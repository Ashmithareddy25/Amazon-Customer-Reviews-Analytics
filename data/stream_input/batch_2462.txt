B008MG1E4A|4.0|I've always wanted to know what goes on during these jobs that the military men and women go through during their service.  This by far was interesting from the first page.  I would definitely recommend.
193700788X|4.0|I think this book was very true to Sookie Character and I really don't understand the reviews that say people were jipped.  If you like to read and have been reading her books and didn't devote yourself to your couple WINNING some Best Couple contest, this book falls in with the others.  There have been two of Charlene's books I didn't exactly like because they were so dark and the continuity was poor but I didn't find those issues in this one.  I think maybe a lot was over looked to keep from making those same errors but I felt the characters were true to their character make-up. I felt like I was reading one of the earlier Sookie books that were a good read and not focused on who she was with.  Thank you Charlene for a series that kept me reading to the end.  Thank You for characters I will always remember.  Thank you for the hours of reading.  I can't wait to see what project you decide to do next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Cant wait por the next one.. i really liked it i chino ir gave me more detail on this romance
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|In some ways, Tom Cruise does a reasonable job in this film.  Reacher is somewhat machine-like in the books, and I can imagine how most actors would be tempted to add more emotional depth to the character, but Mr. Cruise stays away from that.  I do have to say that Rosamund Pike gives particularly empty performance -- every scene she's in is pretty dead.<br /><br />  Overall, the film is pretty dull.  Whatever else you say about modern action films like the Matt Damon Bourne films or the recent James Bond movies, they have a lot of visual energy.  Even the Mission Impossible films have more kinetic energy than this movie does.  For the most part, it is a little like a super-sized episode of a CBS crime procedural.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|sucked it was a horrible app fix controls and camera action its not worth a dollar<br />make a better app and make this free its not worth money.
B000053VAF|5.0|Was looking for this movie on Netflix, Redbox and Blockbuster and none had it. Doing an internet search, I purchased at the least expensive place with the best reviews. Despite being used, the cd and case were in perfect condition and played beautifully!!!
0062014536|3.0|Didn't quite live up to the others in the series.  I wanted to like it, but just never really did.  I found myself skipping the \\"Hanna\\" chapters after a while.  For me they disrupted the flow of the real story, Lena's story.<br /><br />I'd still recommend the series.  But wish the conclusion had been a little bit stronger.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book really draws you into the mind and emotions of the principal characters.  You feel their frustration as they attempt to go about their daily lives.  Truly excellent story.
0061673730|5.0|I never knew that I would be interested in this sort of philosophical exploration but I enjoyed it intensely. Recommended by a friend, I now recommend this to anyone asking for book suggestions.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was satisfied with this ending to the series. I knew books ago that this had to be the only way it could end for small town southern girl, Sookie. And so I was pleased. I did read a few of the scathing reviews written about this book, and find them a little harsh simply because the series didnt go the way these few folks felt it should. I think the malicious intent behind those reviews and divulging plotlines was sad for the rest of us. These books were about the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse, which I have thoroughly enjoyed. I felt this tied up alot of loose ends, characters plotlines were tied off, I was not left hanging in any way. I did not feel cheated, or that the ending was rushed. Its been years, eventually all good things come to an end. I will note I have not watched the True Blood series, so I have no bias or preconceptions from the tv show. I have only read the books, and they've been a great ride. Thanks to the author for keeping it real.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Well written, and hard to put down. Although the descriptions of the orphanage were difficult to read, the truth of that shameful treatment needs to be shared. Because of that truth the surprise ending is particularly heartwarming.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, who is a supernatural super-fan. She has already seen every episode at least twice. I bought her the DVD set as a gift, which she loves for the commentary and other extras she gets for more information on her favorite show.
B0061S073A|4.0|Easy to use. Love being able to put a timer on &amp; select which apps the kids can use. Haven't figured out how to make multiple logins like advertised or change app picture.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|While this was in the theaters, the &#34;professional&#34; movie reviews for John Carter were poor. After watching it, those poor reviews seem unfounded, almost malicious. Acting was good, special effects were great, and has a very interesting plot. A fun movie to watch with the family. Glad to see that there are a high number of positive reviews here on Amazon!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was shocked that something like this camp could exist in this day and time, and more upsetting was the fact other countries are not putting pressure on this country to stop this.  I think every person that gripes about how unfair and awful the United States is should read this, and realize how lucky we are.  Its amazing what the human spirit is capable of when you want freedom, but it is also sad because he's had such a hard time adjusting to freedom and living with what he experienced in this labor camp.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Can't really add to what others have said about the film here in the Amazon review section. If you haven't seen this yet, you're missing out!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great details and the hints were actually helpful when needed. Thoroughly recommend for a couple hours to kill. Looking forward to their next release.
B008JEJN8Y|5.0|How can you not love Crocs...they created a lasting trend in a massive market and took the world by storm. My kids love them and the ease of slipping them on and off makes getting out of the house quicker.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|First, other then the singing which I'll get to later, this was a very well done film, which was close to Victor Hugo's original book.  What threw me at first was its was done opera style.  No problem but you better like opera before buying the movie, especially if you haven't reviewed the trailer or background review.<br /><br />I don't know about impact.  I was more interested in the historical aspect and timeline of events which Victor Hugo alluded to in the book: the second revolution which brought Napoleon III to power.<br /><br />Other films?  War and Peace; Pride and Prejudice; Great Expectations; Tale of Two Cities
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I got this game and loved it but the only thing I don't like is it takes a long time to get another daily mission but there are side missions.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Too short -- but you have two more videos coming out soon?  When?  They should have been sold, rented or something as a set.  Worse then the cliff hangers of the 30's and 40's.  The ending reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock movie.<br /><br />As an avid writer I thought it was good.  Close to the book.<br /><br />For Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, I still say Hobbit should have been dome first if they were going to go to those extremes.  I was ticked that Lord of the Rings was done first over the Hobbit.  Would have made more sense.<br /><br />This and Lord of the Rings were the first of this genre, so that hard to say/
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is a great one. It teaches you alot and can be very addicting. Recommended to all. The only thing is that have to spend cash to achieve some off the things. But i still like it very much
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Read book first (loved) the saw video. Book is more detailed then movie but movie is emotionally enthralling. Best movie of the year. Jennifer Lawrence deserved the Oscar.<br />Recommend read the book and see the movie.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|The book is super long but at the end, all you can think is that it wasn't long enough. Super exciting and full of adventure!
0316223239|5.0|This story is something that I devoured like it was snack food!  Once you pick up this book and step into the world of the room, you are totally and completely captivated.  It's not a very long book, or a very complex story.  It's about a woman who is abducted and has a child with the man who is keeping her in captivity.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Great movie! especially if you like the movies &#34;Paris Je T'aime&#34; and &#34;Amelie.&#34; I actually liked this better than the Darjeeling Limited and &#34;the Life Aquatic.&#34; How those movies are comparable (other than Owen Wilson being in them) I have no idea- it was just what my mind was comparing it to haha. But definitely a good watch!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|instructions are too confusing...not clear enough for people that are not really too computer savvy. scarry!!!<br />Have it...don't want it...don't know how to get rid of it!

B0091REZMW|3.0|Pretty fun game don't like how much it makes you play the same levels over and over to get new rooms opened.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A really great film; I watched it twice in two nights. It is an honest glimpse into a family coping with mental illness along with the best romantic storyline I have seen in a very long time.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I enjoyed the quirkiness of this story, its main character and his total lack of self knowledge or understanding.The irony of him giving a lecture about aspergers was brilliant!<br />Highly recommended for those who like looking on the bright side of life; empathise with the eccentric and like to smile while reading.
0792839749|5.0|Great for family movie night! Kids love it, and adults as well. One of those movies that is a must see in your lifetime.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I haven't done all the experiments yet. I finished reading the book first. I kept on going. I love the way it is written.<br />For the experiments I have done, I must say, they work. I will continue with other experiments that I will make up myself.<br />This book really lifted my energy up to a higher vibration.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|This is the first Symphony X I have ever heard..........<br />I would like to publicly apologize for having not listened to this band before.<br />to me this is music to speed by  :)<br /><br />I have since purchased thier entire collection........these guys are good!!!
193700788X|1.0|Sorry Charlaine, but the book is a disaster. I feel like 12 books were filler. And if you had your ending planned since the second book... why did you wait until the last book? You cheated everyone. And you know it.<br /><br />And sadly. I'm disappointed in you. Not only as an author, but as a person. Playing the victim card, blaming the fans... Pure PR. You want people talking about the \\"death threats\\" but not discussing the \\"quality\\" of the book. That's a disgrace.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|Do not delay, buy this now.<br />new singer fits this band with perfection.......musically they are all spot on, as you would expect from a Spock's Beard release.<br />Beard is back and dare I say with a release that belongs at the top of their catalog.<br /><br />the last couple of thier releases felt weak to me, so I had some apprehension when I bought this........do not have apprehension. This record is very good and getting better with each listen.<br />Do not delay, buy this.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|What a great heartwarming movie!  Let's you know that there's still some great and noble people in this world.  And it's safe for the whole family to watch.  Now that's rare!

B004BVMBYW|5.0|I've always been a big fan of guitarist and was kicking myself over and over when I first found Rory last week.  After watching one video of him on YouTube, I immediately bought this album and am blown away by not just his guitar work, but his singing and song-writing.<br /><br />If you're not sure what album of Rory's to buy (to start with) always go with something live....that's what I did, and this album does NOT disappoint.

1452115567|1.0|Take a good look at Maddie on the things, note her facial expressions, drooping of her ears, posture of her tail, etc. and it is painfully apparent that Maddie is not happy posing for such ridiculous photos.  How could you do that to your dog?
B0000027F8|4.0|A few of the songs are on other albums but I didn't mind cos I love him anyway, he can do no wrong!
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|After loving the whole series, it ends with this?!?!<br /><br />Such a disappointment. Eric is the best character hands down and he doesn't even feature.<br />It feels like the author didn't want to write another Sookie book. She seems bored and therefore the book was soooooo boring.<br />Last in the series? Just think of how amazing it could have been, and this finale isn't, in any way amazing, except for its banality.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|From the moment the tsunami hit the shore I couldn't stop crying. The performance by lead actors is outstanding.<br /><br />The quality of the movie is remarkable. Renting from Amazon was 2 seconds deal.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read all 3..... They are a really good read!!!  They are for teens but still are really good anyway. I liked them.
0743270754|5.0|Well written.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a real and serious historian.  There is much to learn from the man Abraham Lincoln.
0312641893|5.0|This a unique retelling of Cinderella. I loved it. Seriously, Cinderella in Bejing China as a cyborg (yes, a lot of c-words)? I have never read anything even close this before. As happens in a lot of retellings, the plot was obvious pretty much from the second chapter, if even that far in. Still, I didn't care because it was great to relive a beloved story in a new way.<br /><br />My favorite part was that this book was clean. So many YA I have tried to read were far more NA. If I wanted that, I would read those books. I don't, I want something I can share with my little sister, not something I have to hide from her.<br /><br />On top of that, Cinder is real. She doesn't go completely nuts and unable to help herself around the Prince. She has a legitimate reason for trying to stay away from him. And she is suffering through things that are relatable, even after World War IV.<br /><br />Note: I had someone question the cyborg part of the story. By cyborg they mean people who have been in accidents and needed limbs or other things replaced with machine parts. It is like in I Robots when you find out that Spooner was in an accident and had his arm and three ribs replaced with robot parts.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Once you watch the first two seasons, you have to watch the 3rd! Totally worth purchasing! I highly recommend owning the whole season!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Anyone who enjoys history will like this book. The impact of WW1 was so much greater than WW2 - it defined moist of the 20th century. This book gives the reader an insight into how it came about. As the title suggests, there was not nearly enough careful thought from any of the great powers in the wekks preceding the outbreak of hostilities.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If your into Zombies and how humanity would react to the situation this book covers the hypothetical in a amazing global perspective.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I am very familiar with the behavior of people with bipolar disorder, and the main character (played by Bradley Cooper)  portrays this mental illness accurately, as does Jennifer Lawrence.  Her character is suffering from some unnamed illness, possibly bipolar or borderline personality (these illnesses share a number of traits).  The people involved in both of their lives though, have their own set of problems that prove, in some ways, to be almost as dysfunctional.  The writers seem to be leaning heavily on the idea that &#34;we all have something&#34;  in our lives to deal with: some challenge, some hang-up. That ought to make it easier to understand each other in our struggles, but sadly, we often end up at odds.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|This was a  strange story about a very intriguing circus  with many twists and turns.<br />It would make an Interesting film and I hope the rights for this will be taken up soon.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Another anecdotal review of a near death experience.  While the story line is interesting and the Dr.'s experience real to him, it did not have any real &#34;proof&#34; from a scientific perspective.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I've been using this with a couple DSLR's and I have had no problems with it. It fits snug and doesn't 'wiggle' around when I move the grip too fast. I do wish the grip was a bit heavier, but for the price paid it was definitely a good deal.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Always love the Walberg movies!  I like the snow camouflage scenes and the cabin in the mountains.... very cool.  Awesome scenary.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I loved the story, but I found it was heavy with the technicality of anatomy.  Sometimes, the scientific explanation went on for pages!  I realize he's a scientist, and that's cool.  I would recommend this book to everyone, but I'd warn them about all the scientific content.
0375869026|5.0|This book will be used for the 2013-2014 Battle of the Books for El Paso county 5th graders. It is a marvelous story--one every kid should read.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not going to wax philosophical but this show is crack, and I am on the street begging for more. I don't like the new format of 2 hours per episode, or some major character choices they made this season but overall - the magic continues! Upstairs/downstairs remains endlessly fascinating, and continues to offer complex, nuanced characters, tons of scandal, and realistic struggles of an aristocratic family forced to enter the modern age.

B00BGIC4I6|3.0|I think that this is a good movie but the beginning of it is way more funny then the middle and end. The beginning (if you're looking for a comedy) doesn't disappoint but it starts to wane, and get less funny, and towards the end it almost turns tragic. I think it is more real life then comic. I liked it okay.
0312430000|5.0|Dr. Gawande has been a 'hero' of mine, and this book and its concepts bears out his simple wisdom and how it can make major change in our health care system.  This book was a gift to a very dear friend who's earning her Master's as a Nurse Practitioner.<br />I had the chance to skim through the book before giving it - it was all I'd hoped for in terms of content, style.  Dr. Gawande needs to be a 'bigger part' of health care re-imagining in the U.S.!

B005KAH7QU|2.0|I found this to be very lacking in story.  It does have much in action and even tries to form a story with Hannah's innocent childhood and the discoveries she makes, but much is lacking.  This cannot compare to the Jason Bourne series where the story is actually the basis and the action just as good.

B009NY43NY|4.0|THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.  YOU ARE WARNED!<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that anyone who reviews this book with anger directed at Charlaine Harris for writing HER ending to HER story, an ending that was hinted at all through the series, has no basis for upset.  Get over it: you are not the author.  That's not to say readers cannot have an opinion about who they wanted Sookie to have as her lover. The reviews filled with vitriol about a non-Eric ending are ugly and show a tremendous disconnect from where the series was headed all along.<br /><br />There are several reason why this book was a satisfying end - Arlene's brief return was a surprise; The Prologue set up the story and was some of the best writing in it; I appreciated the support given Sookie by both the human and supernatural communities.  That girl needed the affirmation;  The reconnect with Tara was a balm; Amelia remained true to character; We had our token dose of Bill and could've used more Jason, though he did redeem himself; Eric continued to focus on Eric, but he absolved himself by providing Sookie with much need protection; I'm happy for Pam. She deserved her reward.  And Sam.  YAY!!<br /><br />What was a disappointment in this story was the less than thrilling conflict.  As someone said to me, it felt \\"phoned in,\\" as though Harris had to work hard at creating a threat to Sookie. Reading it in the Kindle version, I was surprised when I exceeded the 75% mark and the plot still seemed to be in formation, no real rushing towards an explosive conflict or heart-wrenching conclusion.<br /><br />I will miss Sookie and the Gang, but all good things come to an end.  Thank you, Charlaine Harris, for a fun ride.  Thank you for creating some colorful, endearing, exasperating, and very sexy characters.  A part of my heart will always belong to Bill, but I sure enjoyed that naughty Eric.  And thank you for keeping Sookie true to herself.  Any other outcome would've been a sell-out.

0385349831|2.0|Update 5/17/2013: Since I'm running 0 to 4 in ranking of this review, I've added more explanation of my viewpoint.  I realize that Paulo Coelho has a huge following, but I have to say that I really didn't like this book.  It's easy to read but hard to follow...there's no coherent storyline holding it together.  Now...my twice edited original review:<br /><br />Presented as a series of questions and answers, the principles presented in this book sound great, but fall apart when subjected to rational thought. I suppose the linguistic twisting is supposed to make you reflect and search for hidden meaning, but I have to admit that I prefer mathematical puzzles to philosophical ones.  A few examples:<br /><br />\\"Describe the defeated ones,\\" said a merchant...<br />And he answered: The defeated are those who never fail.<br />And I answer: Ok.  I get it.  You're defeated if you never try.  Q.E.D. trying means that you sometimes fail.  Is failure a necessary outcome from trying?  No...obviously not.  The problem, of course, is that you have two non-orthogonal concepts: Failure -> Success and Defeated -> Conquerors (or Mastery).  The labels are the extrema; life exists in the middle.  It's a multidimensional surface, not one a dimensional line.  Choose your victories and cherish them.  You can succeed at some things and fail at others.  The defeated are the dead who cherished their failures.  Everything else is a work in progress.<br /><br />And then there's this gem (pieced together from a few paragraphs):  Nature is telling us: Change!  ... They hear the advice of their loved ones, who say: \\"Why do that?  You have everything you need: the love of your parents, wife and children; the job it took you so long to get.\\"<br />And I say: Reasonable question.  Why change for the sake of change?  Change to reduce your stress.  If you're happy with the status quo, don't lose sight of the fact that YOU'RE HAPPY!  Change for the sake of change is NOT necessarily good.<br /><br />The author then goes on to say , \\"Once he has decided to follow his path and has no alternative, he discovers that he has great willpower and that events bend to his decision. \\"<br />And I say: \\"Yeah. Right.  Last I looked, reality has a mind of it's own.\\"<br /><br />And I'll leave you with this one: \\"Difficulty\\" is the name of an ancient tool that was created to purely help us define who we are.<br />To which I say: \\"Really?  Don't you think that might be simplifying things just a wee bit?\\"<br /><br />My conclusion:<br />Manuscript Found in Accra is an easy read, but, frankly, I'd pass.uthor then goes on to say , \\"Once he has decided to follow his path and has no alternative, he discovers that he has great willpower and that events bend to his decision. \\"<br />And I say: \\"Yeah.

B0001AUAU4|4.0|Very smooth soothing voice, but the music needs to be a little more up.  Good listening for those rainy days.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|I bought the Green Bottle Cutter after I saw it demonstrated on You Tube.  Bought it and it works good, there are a few things we have to learn about the cutter, but on the whole we like it.
0439023491|5.0|Loved this book! What an amazing and exciting read!! I could not put this book down!! Finished it in 1 1/2 days!!! It was that good!! I absolutely recommend it, you will not be sorry, I guarantee!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|very good service, your attention, great product, thanks for everything, I highly recommend the product to all my friends. thanks  Keeps a good charge and everything!
1600242197|5.0|Really a Great Story - Lots of information about the program and how it works - I will send it to my grandkids.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The plot of this book offered a lot of promise, American agents avenging the terrorist attack on the naval ship Cole. However, along the way the author lost his way and attempted to combine the serious elements of an action novel with that of a comedy show.  I often found it confusing to discern whether the<br />protagonist John Cory was conducting an actual conversation or just wisecracking to himself and the reader. I almost gave up on this book several times but  stuck it out to learn if vengeance for the Cole was achieved.
0307744434|4.0|Buyer beware: This novel contains magic that will cast its spell over you, lingering long after you turn the last page.<br /><br />Two magicians place a wager, binding their respective students Marco & Celia into a challenge that plays out through the circus venue. Neither one knows who their opponent is, what the rules are, when the challenge will occur or how the winner is determined. This is not your typical circus but one that has been wrought by magic.<br /><br />I was initially put off by some of the negative reviews. However the urge to read it remained, so I gave it a chance and I'm so glad I did. I do agree that some of the criticism directed at the book by other reviewers is valid. Strangely though, the flaws did not detract from my enjoyment of it in the slightest.<br /><br />I was capitivated, enchanted and delighted. I loved the ethereal quality of the writing, so apt for the nature of the story. The author evokes a visceral response with her beautifully worded descriptions of the sights, sounds and aromas of the circus. I wanted to be there, hey, I was there.<br /><br />Sweet escapism with a hint of sinister. Enjoy.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is one of the most tender, sweetest love stories ever. It's totally unexpected. You'll be rooting for the main characters. And wondering who is helping who.
B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|Great film that is timeless. I can watch this year after year even though it's a fairly long film, especially the directors cut. Great film that almost anyone can enjoy regardless of taste.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|What can you say...Tom Cruise does it again and again.Got the movie when it first was released but just watched it. Great rom beginning to end. Can't wait for Jacks next adventure. I sure hope there is one.
0811879542|5.0|I didn't expect to laugh out loud while \\"reading\\" this book!  The first time I opened the book, it started with a little smile, that got a little bigger with each turn of the page. I can't wait until my son is old enough to enjoy this book with me.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Saw it at the movies and waiting for the blu ray release<br />to add to my collection. Can't go wrong getting movies<br />with Tom Cruise in them.
0061124265|5.0|Very good, satisfying book, hard to put down. It pt perspective on life and might even help its readers gain a new will for life. It helped me a lot mentally and it was just really interesting. Some parts are slow but the rest of the book makes it definitely worth it.
B0055OG2BC|3.0|Got it to fill the Bond blu ray collection.<br />Also to get the kids to see it. A movie to watch when you just have<br />time to kill.
0802473156|5.0|If a person follows the 7 love languages; the changes in the life of your spouse or loved ones is remarkable. It works!!!!!! .

B00785P2QC|5.0|So far loving this game xx<br />Only problem is it takes a long while to raise your money but overall a good game it would hav been much better if there was people walking about.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used this app on my smartphone and tablet for over a year - it is one of the few apps I paid for. I can't imagine not having this on my devices - especially useful taking notes during presentations - with the predictive word that adapts to your style it eliminates typing the entire word. I don't like the look of shorthand texting and with SwiftKey I don't type any more letters to get my message across. Everywhere I go, people ask how I can type so fast (and accurately).<br />The only flaw is I haven't seen a Kindle version yet.
1401937519|4.0|I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend.  Her copy was out on &#34;loan&#34; at the time.  I'm glad Dr. Dani had suggested this book.  I believe in miracles.<br />&#34;
B00004SZWD|5.0|just his best album i think. this is my second copy. all types of songs on this cd. something for everyone.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Dude, this one is a hit. I am a huge fan of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto Series, on the PSP. This is much better. I am a big fan of the gyroscope. However the game comes by default at low sensitivity. I guess to make you look a fool... LOL it works. It could be a little smoother in the cut scenes, but vehicle control is Awesome! I love the one touch drive by! All I am missing is the cheat codes!
B00843TZJ2|5.0|wow , big fan of csn since first album, saw them in small theater in aug.2012 , they were so good i couldnt believe it. seen them many times over the years,but this dvd captures their live show beautifully.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|My grandkids introduced me to this game on their IPad.  I was hooked immediately.  When I found out I could buy it for my Kindle I was delighted.  But, much to my regret I found it doesn't work as well on the Kindle.  When you outsmart the Genie you should be able to enter the name you were thinking of and if its already in the Genie's database and he couldn't guess it, you win.  There is no way to search for the name.  It takes some of the fun out of it when you can't really win.  I am very competitive so I doubt I'll be playing this much anymore.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Funny but serious look at Asperger syndrome and relationships from an interesting perspective : the narrator with it but unaware of that fact.
0307269760|3.0|All the stories are basically the same.  Nothing to grab your attention, get you excited, make you angry, etc.  A vanilla read.
0374533571|5.0|There is something about mental illness that can make a great story.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the seminal work in the genre.  In some ways this movie attempts to follow that line but goes beyond the Hospital  Ward where the patients are at war with the doctors.  In this movie, Silver Linings Playbook, the line between insane patients and sane caregivers is wholly blurry.<br /><br />Meet Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) who has just be released from a mental health hospital in Baltimore.  Pat suffers from mental illness and is married to Nikki, an unfaithful wife who he caught in the shower with another man.  He wants to reconcile with her and is working on self improvement.  Most notably, jogging while wearing a trash bag to lose weight quicker.<br /><br />Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a fellow mental case.  She makes a deal with him-be her dance partner for an upcoming dance competition and she will help him reconcile with Nikki.<br /><br />The meeting between Pat and Tiffany is a set of breathtaking camera angles that ably put the feeling of meeting a person one is interested in onto film.  Indeed, the entire movie's cinematography is one of jumble-it helps the audience easily identify with the mentally ill.  The audience also clearly gets that Tiffany and Pat are right for each other.  The entire film is an engrossing story which leaves one asking who is sane and who is not.  One can't help but smile at the end.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This Game Is Awesome and you can do a lot of stunts and good combat combos. This game is worth every penny
B009MF56GC|5.0|I have watched this many times on my pc with a cloud copy given by a friend. my hubby always gave me the strangest looks because I am laughing myself silly over this great tongue in cheek action film while I have in the earbuds.  I love that stuff gets blown up right off the rip and stays that way through the entire film and the one liners are seriously funny. I hope there are several more films with this idea. the camera angles were great, the plot was secondary to the action...as it should be...and no one took themselves too seriously. I loved it so much I had to buy a hard copy so I can share this with my husband, so he can enjoy this as well. what a great movie. get your sweetie, a bag of popcorn and enjoy.
B0095G5AFU|1.0|I liked this app enough to want to upgrade from the free version. Too bad it is the free version. No fonts or any other upgrades. Save your money and stick to the free app.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Spoiler warning! Contains spoilers from book<br />I chose this rating because the book in general was disappointing, the disappointment started when Thomas refused to get his memory back. Also, when Teresa dies and tells Thomas nothing. Another thing was when Dashner in The Scorch Trials ruins Thomas and Teresa's relationship and then kills Teresa off at the end with the final words of, \\"I only ever cared for\\", and then she would most likely have said you. Although Teresa is replaced by Brenda I would have loved to see who Thomas and Teresa were before the maze and what relationship they had. Overall, the book was okay but really disappointing. That is my review on The Death Cure.
B00005YAMV|5.0|The vinyl recordwz all that I expected it 2 B. It  arrived on time in the condition that I expected it 2 b in.
B00138EZIQ|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the greatest group of musicians performing some of the greatest compositions, ever.  The albums flows beautifully from track to track.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Have to say I was skeptical about reading this books since it was all the buzz.  I'm enjoying it.  You have to take it for the type of book it is and have some fun reading.
B001LOYRP8|5.0|No matter what this man did in his personal life - his music was awesome.  Thriller was the best. Thriller was Killer
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love playing hidden object games.  The only thing that I do not like about this game is that you have to have energy.  But then I would probably never stop playing.  I play til I run out of energy and then play again when the energy is refilled.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Like this game very much, graphics and action sequence organized and well thought out.  keeps my interest and allows for more action as the game progresses
B004QX07G4|2.0|I watch Ellen's TV show, on a regular basis, and am always amazed at how she makes me laugh. The book, although slightly entertaining, wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. Maybe I had my expectations too high. Just my thoughts.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this game pad, using it for league as well as for SWTOR ( I have a few shooters, but haven't tried it on them yet )<br /><br />Setting it up couldn't be easier. fits my hand great ( some buttons need to be &#34;thought&#34; about to hit them )<br /><br />A few things I would change:<br />- software, while good, could be more stable, and a little more user friendly<br />- Would be a big bonus if these were mech keys instead of membrane, but it keeps the job done<br />- joystick really isn't used for movement, Logitech even claims this themselves, they just need to steal the 360 stick and throw it on there and it would be great.<br /><br />Over all i recommend it, it can be a little overwhelming at first, but you get used to it, and everyone in my gaming group swears by them.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|This is one of the few TV series I can watch over and over (the other being \\"Closer\\").  They have become like family.  I also have the entire ten seasons to the Jack Lord H5-O.  They are family as well, although the vibes are, as might be expected, a bit different.<br /><br />Particularly in Season 2 of the new series, too many family situations, though.  Lori is such eye-candy.  Wish she hadn't left.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|I went into this with no expectations, but it got me engaged.  It kind of reminded me of Starman.  My two friends fell asleep during the movie.  They didn't care to go back see the movie for themselves, but really wanted me to tell them how it ended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. After starting Bared to You , I could put the book down.  I finished both in 3 days.  You will love Gideon Cross as much if not more than C Gray. You won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend.  I can't wait until the final book comes out.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|As much as I enjoyed the movie, I won't be buying this product until they make it a 3D/2D package.
B0071FBARY|4.0|I was not sure if I wanted to spend the full price for the cd, so I was happy when I saw that it was on sale. I really like the music and new sound!
B0015WS75C|4.0|I love Free. They have a powerful clean sound from 3 fine musicians and a great vocalist. The music from 1968-1971 was the best hard rock between The Beatles to the synth introduced on \\"Who's Next\\". From The Jeff Beck Group, Frijid Pink, Led Zeppelin, The Who & Hendrix to The Stones, The Allman Brothers Humble Pie & ZZ Top. And out of all these groups...Free really stands out.<br />Andy played the bass like a tuba on \\"Mr. Big\\", Simon was one of the best with tasty fills on drums, Paul K. with his vibratto sustain was so moving on guitar, Paul R., with the possible exception of Steve Marriott, John Lennon & Roger Daltrey, had the best rock voice of all time.<br />And \\"Fire and Water\\" was the highlite of their career. The remastering is great, (though not as loud as other albums remastered.) Most of the additional songs are great. There are a few poor sounding live recordings that bring the total down to 4 stars. But this is well worth the money. There are multiple recordings of all the songs with the exception of \\"Heavy Load\\".( I guess they did one take and loved it. )<br />In summation, this record has a freshness and the highest quality of great Hard Rock music !!!<br />Just imagine if Paul Rodgers was singing with Led Zeppelin: that in a nut would be the essence of FREE !!!!!!!
B009EANE3M|5.0|By far the best CD! I can't stop listening to it! I recommend it 100%! My favorite song so far is Glowing!
1451695195|3.0|I was super excited to read a book of this subject matter, but it ended up being kind of a dry read on such an interesting subject.<br />It's ok if you have time to spare in your book list.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is a must see for kids and adults alike who love fantasy.  My daughter and I watch it again and again.
B0097K21YW|2.0|this game is a cheap, destructive version of Angry Birds. The method for aiming is lacking. The good is that the graphics are nice.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|It works. You must really work at calibrating the sensor once the zoom is on but it does work. I have also noticed the the sensor will operate a little better with more light then with out the zoom on. So if you do not need to turn off as many lights as you once did. I like it because it both brings the game play area a little closer as well and shortening the depth of field, so stepping to the back of the play area is not as far away as it used to be.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the settings options. You can make changes as you get better at the game.  A quick game can help give me a little break from stress.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|found this movie rather lame. Not really funny and graphics were unimpressive. Not sure what all the hype was about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft now! it is really fun. the only problem is that the other versions have a bunch of items that this one doesn't have like the cake. seriously; sugar but no cake? i aslo have &quot;pets&quot; on the computer version. wish you could get them on here. I wish that they would update.
B000U1ZV8K|1.0|last disc is all scratch up and will not play at all. Laggy. Thank God I've seen the movie b4
0307950654|4.0|Excellent book.  If you liked Pride and Prejudice you'll enjoy this continuation of the story.<br />Good mystery.  I read this book with my book club.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is fantastic it has great graphics,  never blurs,  and has an excellent selection. this app i would highly recommend this app for photoshopers
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that the entire album has great songs.  From the 1st to the last each song is great and could be in its own right a top ten.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I liked this season, but I can absolutely agree that there are whole episodes that are just there as filler to stall the action until the finale.
B00004YA66|5.0|This movie &#34;Frequency&#34; is a so called mans movie.Fire fighting, baseball, cops, and murder.<br />It will also bring home the real meaning of love and the family.<br />I highly recommend as a family movie.
B004RL9T50|5.0|My children laughed more at this movie than at Despicable Me. They are constantly asking to watch Megamind. Since this is a kids' movie I will leave it up to them, and they give it 5 stars.
B003L77G6A|5.0|it was great show  every year and kept more funny than ever. i also love in the each show! it rock!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I consider Lightning Bug the gold standard for this genre, but this is not only almost as good, it has Lightning Bug beaten in the cost category The ability to download additional sounds for free is great, too.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|i love it and i can get enuf laugh with this show. you wont be sorry to watch this show
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Helen mirran is excellent in the movie and the entie movie tells both sides of what went wrong in the marriage of charles and diana.,however,istill have doubts about how her death occurred
1476733953|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi, but I really enjoyed WOOL. It has been years since I've been so engrossed with a book that I couldn't stop reading it. Hugh Howey creates a vivid portrayal of life in a massive underground bunker. This series explores many aspects of human nature in an unimaginable environment. Since reading WOOL I have read several of his other books and plan on continuing to do so.
B0076NKLRQ|3.0|While Michelle williams does very good in the part, It would be like a singer playing Barbra Streisand,Marilyn was a once in a lifetime star,and trying to project her image, beauty, inner confiict is impossible for any actress
B00CQ3SUAQ|5.0|Hannibal is a wonderfully dark and deep show. The actors are extraordinary and bring a new light to the well known characters from Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Yet it doesn't simply mimic its predecessors. Hannibal brings a fresh look to the books and movies, making it entirely its own, while still following the haunting tale.
0345803485|2.0|The writing style is atrocious.  This book is pretty much Twilight without the vampires.  Just another book with an insecure girl as the main character.  The sex scene are awkward and remind me teenage sex.
B003UPPO2G|4.0|My mom loves the Bee Gees and I thought this would be the perfect gift. The product was in excellent condition and arrived quicker than I expected!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I had purchased this book a couple months ago.  Was looking for something to read this weekend & remembered I had it.  Sat down to read it, and didn't get anything done for the rest of the day.  Finished it all in one sitting!  Even though Victoria can be maddening because she \\"just doesn't get it\\" sometimes, you find yourself totally invested in her & really want her to find love & succeed.  And the other characters are also fully developed.  Such a well-written novel.  I'll be looking at other titles by this author.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works, and that's just what I care about! Don't know what else to say, it does what it's supposed to do.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|this movie is the best underworld movie of all! again, selene kicks some serious butt as the stubborn fearless vampire warrior!
B009MJU9QU|5.0|They are very realistic and he loves them.  He also has the black bear.  These are really good re-creations.  I would recommend these to anyone who has a loved one or themselves that love or has a fascination with bears.
B009X01C64|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my father and he loves it. Very nice looking and shipped quickly and in great condition - he is very happy with it!
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  I'm not one to watch a movie with sub titles but this one is different.  I highly recommend it.  It's funny, inspiring and touching.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This one is addictive. Really fun, good graphics, could spend hours playing. It is always changing and challenging. If you enjoy match three this one is worth a try.
B0001I561E|5.0|After reading the story 300 times, the movie helped fill in all of the missing pieces. My daughter truly loves this movie.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is very fun, and does a great job in the graphics relative to the movie. The game runs smoothly, and differs from other versions of Temple Run. Definitely take a chance with this game and buy it!
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|this app sucks all the way around. it doesn't work, doesn't load, doesn't search, and doesn't download. makes you miss google play
B004H4XAXO|5.0|This book is a return to the high fantasy missing in so many generic fantasy novels these days. It features both a non-generic plot, a believable universe and admirable characters who serve as more than caricatures. This book rises high above the corny and unbelievable fantasy books that abound today. Not just a great fantasy, but an epic novel with the same originality and scope as the Lord of the Rings.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Finding Nemo is a very good film and with the transfer to 3d it is even better. Fantastic transfer quality and nicely packaged.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I WOULD 100% RECOMMEND THIS KNIFE TO ANYBODY THAT IS LOOKING FOR A COST EFFICIENT AND A VERY ERGONOMICAL  KNIFE.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a damn good romance book. Maybe not the BDSM book most people in that life style would enjoy to read but in the romance aspect yes a very good romance I shall enjoy reading again and again........
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is so so addicting and my kids love it! I especially like the parental lock. I'm just typing this sentence for enough words
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones were very good and well suited for their roles.  I purchased it in DVD, because my VHS model needed to be replaced.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is a life saver for almost all portable wifi/smartphone devices. I've only use this for a week and the convenience and practicality is right on. The LED flashlight is an added bonus. Versatile with 2 USB ports for high and low charging needs. The ability to use any USB powered charger for re-charging is also sweet. Great product and free shipping!
193700788X|1.0|wow after reading(skiming)thru this book I am so glad that I read the overwhelming reviews that were as shocked and betrayed as I was. I own every book and honestly,I always liked Bill the best and hoped in the end she would pick him.Eric grew on me to some extent but c'mon never Sam. how are we supposed to believe that it was always him.She created the chemistry between Eric/Sookie then annililates it in the last book.I have read almost all of Harris's books and never did she sell out,dark plots and charecters,yes,but this? I will prob never read her books again as there are too many authors out there that treat their fans with respect,after all we help make them get where they are and to delude us ike this is just contemptable and she should be ashamed of herself.I will tell all not to read this book as,before I pushed this series.as they say fool me once! ladyl
1607066017|3.0|The core story is a wonderful one: forbidden love between enemies in a time of war produces a child who is loved deeply by her parents. The larger universe is well-drawn, complicated, and interesting. But some of the surrounding pieces push the envelope too far for me to really enjoy. Perhaps a bit of a tamer version would have been more appealing to me.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I was never one for these types of games but this one is pretty amazing for a mobile device app. Amazing graphics but be prepared for a 750mb download after the initial install.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Have played lots of these and so far this is my favourite.  Don't miss it.  Complex  with lots of levels.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|The people who gave this movie 5 stars are in desperate need to see REALLY 5 Star movies like the Buddy Holly Story, or The Committments.<br />Seriously, the acting was awful, the plot so predictable you could have bet your paycheck on it. Formula movie making at it's worst. The girl group who is obviously going to beat the guy group, no spoiler here for sure. To make it worse, the girl group does the same exact act for the entire movie and then, hours before the \\"big contest\\" and not only fired the leader, obvious from the start of the movie, and changed the entire act, costumes, and dance routine, again, literally , hours before the final. Will they win? Are you five star people for real? If I were 12 this movie would be 4 star at best. I have seen hundreds of truly great movies, this is not one of them.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Truly Enjoyable. I Am Grateful To Add to My Collection, It Is worth The Price. Very Happy With Purchase Thanks.
B00908DDZM|5.0|love it! whoa, these guys are killa fo realz!  So psyched to finally have this one in my music library!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|In my opinion this final book in the WoT series was quite a fitting end. I do not want to give anything away to those who have not read it yet. However, I do think that if you are a fan of the series that this final book is worth reading. If not for anything else, but, because it is the last book and I think those who enjoy the series and have an open mind, will enjoy it as well. I had a hard time not reading it, after I finally decided to open the book up and read it. It kept me enthralled for hours, waiting to see what would happen next.<br /><br />I was not disappointed and in many places I found myself surprised and shocked at what happened, which led me want to read more and more, not just a chapter or two a day. I found myself not being disappointed at all when I finally reached the end.<br /><br />I will admit there are some things that were left unanswered and some things I would have loved to have had expanded on, especially in the epilogue, but I guess that is what imagining is for and the only thing that will happen as of now.<br /><br />Overall it was a great ending and there was a little more than I had expected there to be at some points and at others there were some things I wish there had been more of. I am sad that this is the final book in the series, as I find myself wanting more, but that can be said to be true of any book or series of books that one finds that they truly have enjoyed over the years. I guess you could say it is bittersweet.<br /><br />Farewell Wheel of Time and thank you for the memories.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The best fun every.I am having so much fun building my island with the most amazing dragons. I love visiting the other islands and making new neighbors that help me expand my island. I find myself playing all the time. If you love dragons you must get this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I do not want to miss it! Is very well done! I love it. Downton Abbey is very pretty. Good
B000FA675C|5.0|Really can anyone honestly give this book a bad review? It is unbelievable well researched for a novel(fiction) and well written.
B008OOYALE|5.0|btw what two dragons do I breed to get a diamond one? beside that. thanks team lava u guys rock
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is unbelievable.  When you first think of it if you are over 40 years old you think about the old movie.  Even though there are walking dummies throughout the season's, the plots and acting keep you on the edge of your seat.  One of the greatest come back series ever produced on TV.  Don't miss it.  Once you start watching, you don't want to stop.  I started seasons one and two on Netflix and when I<br />saw Amazon had it out to buy by episode or series, I jumped right on it.  Couldn't wait for Netflix to pick it up.  Don't miss it!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I just wanted to say thank you ludia Inc. for making this game! I'm at level 11 or 12 but I went to my aqua park and I got that rare Dna from a free expedition! the way I know this is because the first time I saw it it was in one of those bins that I didn't get and so it said &quot;Dna! buy for 365 dollars?&quot; I said no way! and clicked continue then I clicked free expedition and the time it came back I opened the box and there it was the rare Dna! anyway I hope you liked my rant. lol XD. true story. happed yesterday.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|has a large additional download. Also, have only gotten to play once for a couple runs before it froze with a blank white screen and background sfx when going to upgrade screen. after force close (after &quot;waiting&quot; for 5 minutes with no effect) it no longer even runs. after getting through the marvel splash screen (if it gets that far even) it just crashes when it starts the &quot;loading stark industries&quot; the screen just blanks out like its about to move on but then it is back to nothing but the carosel/app page. I really enjoyed the game when I actually got to play it, but I don't like it repeatedly crashing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this and uses it all on his own. It's much better than a traditional video game since it is creative.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Plot and character development weak.  Special effects quite good.  I would recommend the movie as a fill-in for the Avengers movie, which was very well done.
B0097K21YW|4.0|Angery birds on fire? If you are a pyro at heart,you'll love this game.City after city of fun!! Let it burnnn.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I grew up reading Captain America comc books.  I liked the movie for its focus on the human element in the super hero's personna, and how he overcame it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The plot is a little thin, and the dialogue that moves it along is even thinner. But I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The singing is fantastic and the characters are hilarious and lovable. You will want to watch it again right away.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|More and more sexcapades with Christian and Anna.  Just wish the book had more storyline and less constant sex.  Could have done without the Red Room of Pain!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It flows better than when it is on TV..it doesn't feel so episodic it feels like a movie if there was just a way to remove the intros....
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Bought the book because everyone else was reading it and said &#34;you just have to read this&#34;.  It was definitely too descriptive and left nothing to the imagination, over and over and over again.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|I think the movie followed the book for the most part. Actors were believable. Scenery was amazing. I liked the movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not exactly the type of book I like.  Very repetitive as was the first 2 books  ....  descriptive details didn't make you need to wonder!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I just got the Talking Tom Cat app.  This is the cutest little cat and when he repeats what I said to him, my real life cats come running over if I say their name and then he repeats it!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This is the first series since Doctor Who was revived in 2005.  Christopher Eccleston is fantastic in his one and only series as the Doctor, and Billie Piper is a great match for his companion.  This series is smart, funny, goofy, and thought-provoking, sometimes all at the same time.<br /><br />Every episode on this DVD set has commentary, and it's all fascinating.  Tons of other special features as well, such as Billie Piper's video diaries showing some behind-the-scenes of how the show was made.<br /><br />Almost since I got this DVD set I have been lending it to others to get them hooked on the series.  It's in its fifth set of hands right now.  Last time it was returned to me I didn't even have time to bring it back home, I lent it out again immediately.  Everyone loves it.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|fun game I could just play for hours.,  my gran-children love it too!  gee can't an adult have any game to our self with out having to share!  I let them do what ever they want anyway its just more fun giving them a hard time :)
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Great Movie! My kids have watched it at least 20 times since Easter. Such a great storyline, adults will love it as well!
B003B02O14|5.0|This novel lives up to John Grisham's expert writing and storytelling skills.  Definitely another &#34;page turner&#34; from one of my favorite authors!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Hilarious Movie! My kids love it, they watch it repeatedly. I really enjoyed it as well. Great storyline and lots of cute jokes and songs!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is by far my favorite show of all time.  I have recommended it to all my friends and everyone loved it.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great Movie with an excellent story line and message for kids and adults alike. Disney rarely disappoints! Wonerful voices and lots of laughs!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I use this because I record multiplayer games on Playstation 3 with Turtle Beach Headset using the HD PVR 2. The HD PVR 2 records your friends' voices but not you(the recorder).  This mic is worth the $25 I paid for it so far.  Hauppauge HD PVR recommends using a $25 mixer, I haven't bought one yet.<br /><br />It records in mono, which is great for what I'm doing, but YOU WILL NEED a sound software to enhance your recordings. I record with Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10, but there are free softwares like Audacity. Just make sure it HAS &#34;Noise Reduction&#34; & maybe &#34;Noise Gate&#34;.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cheap<br />2. Comes with shirt/collar clip<br />3. Sound great after audio editing<br />4. Cord is long...too long for what I'm using it for, but long enough for business, school, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Mic foam slides right off --- had to wrap it with a small rubberband<br />2. No LED on/off light --- I just have a visible note near TV to remind me to turn off<br />3. No LED low-battery warning light --- So if you'll recording something important i.e. a lecture, meeting, etc.,<br />  then you may want to always use a new battery.<br />4. Fairly easy, though it took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to insert the battery the first time.<br /><br />YouTube &#34;Noise Reduction for Sony Sound Forge Audio&#34; TUTORIALS:<br /><br />--basic--<br />HowTo: Noise Reduction using Sound Forge Pro Tutorial - Great for Game Commentary or Podcasts!<br />[...]<br /><br />--advance--<br />The Voice Over Coach - Sound Forge - Advanced 1 - Noise Reduction in Noisy Environments<br />[...]
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I was expecting a sweet little Irish romance, and there was that, but there was so much more. I don't want to be a spoiler, but this is a story that will make you laugh out loud, and a few pages on break your heart. I finished with tears running down my face. Beautiful book, and not at all ordinary.
B00003CWN3|4.0|This movie was incredibly difficult to watch and impossibly difficult to stop watching, The story is tragic and compelling, the acting is top notch all around and the directing was wonderful. I was very pleased with Hilary Swank's performance and pretty much amazed by Chloe Sevigny.
B000SW4DJO|5.0|I use this movie to talk about the lost princess in my class along with other missing people in history.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is fantastic! Way better than the movie. However I wouldn't recommend this book to a child, a person 12 or older, only because contents maybe confusing to minors.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|This CD is different but the same fun all their other albums had!  I was also impressed on the length too :)
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I was really excited to watch this movie last night as it has been advertised as a light hearted romantic comedy. It is not. The main drive of the story is watching people with severe mental illnesses interact with one another; including the two main characters. As you can imagine, these people fight, yell, manipulate, and there is a very unnerving scene of domestic violence. I am not a person who is put off by these types of stories; however, I felt that the movie was marketed in such a way to avoid actually showing that 90% of this movie is disturbing and depressing. The ending is cute and at least redeemed the fact that I sat through this film. On Amazon, the HD switched to regular about 20 minutes into the movie. You can see when it happens, so I would reccommend saving yourself the extra dollar if you do rent Silver Linings Playbook.<br /><br />Not impressed.
1616550414|5.0|exelent book that contains the complete zelda history, art and an special surpise for the fans. Lovely book for the fans of TLOZ, for the collectors and concept artist too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the costume's and how it show's what it was like for women at that time, the beauty of the landscape. the story line is great and fun. I cant wait for the next season, it's too far away. I love Maggie Smith and all the going's on between the upstair's and the role of everyone downstair's. It's just a fantastic show I hope is on for a long time!!!
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|NOT  CRAZY ABOUT THE SONG CHOICES. DISAPPOINTED HE SANG MY FAVORITE SONG WITH DOLLY PARTON INSTEAD OF THE VERSION WITH HIS DAUGHTER.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My kids and I love this game. The graphics are wonderful, the sounds are great - but it's a typical facebook game. You get to that point where you have to just wait and wait for time to go by for the next thing to happen.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this game is fun interesting for all ages and also pretty much all G5 games have great graphics and storylines keep em coming
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Wonderful fun. This made my brain hurt in a good way. My kids enjoyed it as well. It also has a lot of levels, so you don't get board.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very good so far in other solitare games it feels like they are cheating. I recommend this game for anybody who is looking for an excellent spider solitare app!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Even better than I had expected.  What a talented actress and singer.<br /><br />This review by Marv Fish, the lucky receiver of this gift from wife Judith E. Fish
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|This is an outstanding piece of movie making and a truly engaging experience. However, right up front, I will caution that if you want something to just &#34;wash over you&#34;, like say an Avengers movie (outstanding in their own right), this is not it. This requires an engaged effort to follow the multiple threads across time. There is a wonderful payoff in doing so, but it is not for everyone.<br /><br />The makeup is spectacular! With several actors playing 5 or more parts you will always be guessing who is whom. Yet, this doesn't distract from the epic itself too much. Each story on its own has a great deal of action and intrigue, but when woven together, they make a truly interesting fabric.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This is a nice case for the money, genuine leather, rotates and stands up, definitely worth it. Also has a strap to hold it shut.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|No software or complicated process to get this up and running, I was able to use it immediately and without any issues.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Purchased for our 13 wedding  aniversary.  Traditional gift is lace, so I figured there should be lace in here somewhere.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was an interesting read -- compelling since it was written from the perspective of a child. Without giving away spoilers, this story has some parallels to a story that's currently making headlines.<br /><br />I thought the second half of the book wasn't paced as well as the first, but overall this was a good read.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This was a gift for a friend who had admired the doll in the store. She loved it and was very happy with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game i've been playing it for a year now! And it is worth the $3.99 so<br /><br />First is first creative mode (recommended before playing survival mode)  you can explore the seed (or world) you entered  in the seed generator  and get to learn the controls of the game (when you start the game of course) and in survival mode i<br />Have 2 gigantic houses but one got infested with zombies oh sorry sorry i forgot<br />To introduce the monsters of the game 1 zombies eat you 2 spiders jump on you<br />3 creepers explode in your face  and 4 skeletons or archers have crossbows and<br />Shoot you down with arrows. CT and when it gets dark in survival mode thats<br />When the monsters i introduced will appear. And don't let those creepers near<br />Your house or else they'll blow it up so i would recommend buying it and its only<br />$3.99!! Oh i almost forgot you can kill animals to get food wool feathers etc and i<br />Have the v0.6.0 alpha edition (most rcemmended) and you can mine stuff but i would build a shelter before you mine first you collect wood and and you must get<br />Get sticks before you can build a tool weapon etc. Okay you will only get a wooden<br />Pickaxe because you can only mine wood at the start because you will have nothing after you built your house then you should build a wooden pickaxe requires 3 wooden planks and 2 sticks after that then you can go mine! Let me<br />Tell you all the recipies for all the tools and weapons okay so first is first so wooden shovel 2 wooden planks and 2 sticks wooden sword 2 wooden planks<br />And 3 sticks and the wooden axe is 2 wooden planks and 1 stick  oh and get a bow because you can like build archery sniping spot to snipe monsters that are near your house (bow requires: 3 sticks and 3 string) the string in which you can<br />Collect by killing spiders oh yeah spiders can climb walls so put lendgejeus around your house  and i built this huge archery range for shooting down monsters'n such so really buy this game it is only $3.99 and i recommend it to everybody who likes action so im done and i really want to get back to my game so good luck and have fun building!!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Best music, the only downside is that they aren't the music videos. Which is your prompt to go to youtube.com and enjoy them!
B000065U1N|5.0|Enlightening movie but some parts are so graphic that I had to hide my eyes. After seeing the movie, I now understand what happened in Somalia in 1993 when 19 servicemen were tragically lost trying to help people they did not know. The movie is a testament to their strength and courage. It broke my heart to see that they had to run out on their own at the end (because there was no room on the Humvees for them) even though most of them were very badly wounded....but see this movie. It is well worth it.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This is a very important film.  Don't believe that it's just hype.  Oil and gas companies who have megabucks and lobbyists working around the clock to keep the fracking going to put money in their pockets are saying that this information is false.  It's not.  This has been going on too long already.  Oil & gas companies do not have to meet the clean air and clean water standards.  During the Bush/Cheney administration, that little loophole was tucked into the energy bill.  Read all you can about this.  Watch this important film.  Then, ask yourself how much you love your children.  We need to stop this nonsense before we have destroyed the land, water and air for the next generations.  We also have a responsibility to be good stewards of the land and respect other living things.  We certainly aren't doing that now.  Thanks to this film, more people can start the process of becoming aware.
0307730697|5.0|OMG. This book is so inspirational and moving. I was reading with tear filled eyes but could not put it down. Adam Brown was absolutely fearless and would not quit! He overcame so much to get to the top and his story is very powerful and inspirational.  Eric Blehm did an excellent job in telling Adam's story. Like one of his teammate's said: &#34;This book will motivate you to challenge yourself to be…fearless.” Just read it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|What can I say about this film that had not already been said. well....it's bona fide. In all truth, this movie is one of our favorites. It is funny at times, serious at times, and the music is awesome (if you like old southern songs). I would highly recommend this movie.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I bought this movie because I saw it was highly rated by Common Sense Media and it was definitely a hit.  It's a great price for a very cute short kids movie and my son loves it.  I bought the book along with it and it is one of our family's favorites.
0920236162|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I really like the paper bag princess. It has a clever girl in it, which appeals to my own clever girl (age 3). The illustrations are solid. The story makes is not overly complicated or trying too hard to be clever, so young listeners can understand it. The weak point on this book is the writing. It definitely feels like a parent's bedtime story, transcribed word-for-word into children's book form. I wish that the prose had been edited a bit and better integrated in with the pictures. That said, it is a book that I can read over and over again without cringing. And for that, it is a favorite.
0142403873|5.0|This is one of our favorites!  I came across the movie review on Common Sense Media and decided to buy the book to go along with it.  It is a very cute book and my 3 1/2 year old loves it.
B0097K21YW|5.0|Great game!  You will enjoy this game more than Angry Birds.  Buy it today and enjoy it tonight with friends..
B00947N6D8|5.0|It came in perfect condition, the price was fair, the movie was entertaining. My 6 year has watched this movie more than 3 times so far.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Suprised, I didn't know Ben Affleck could act!<br /><br />Good story, not too much action, more like a suspense documentary .
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|The Sessions is a beautiful story about a man (Mark O'Brien) who was severely disabled by childhood polio.<br />outwardly, the story focuses on Mark experiencing a sex life despite his physical limitations.<br />to me, the heart of the story is Mark having the courage to live life fully and experience it as deeply as possible.<br />the reward is the experience of being engaged by other people as a human being.<br />not just as a crippled body with needs.  a disabled human yes, but a human first and foremost.<br /><br />The Sessions really moved me.<br />in turns, i was embarrassed, comforted, saddened, inspired, and delighted.<br />for 95 minutes i forgot about everything else and was completely absorbed by the story.<br />the most touching and uplifting aspect is feeling that Mark knew what it felt like to be seen as a beautiful man by some special people in his life instead an aging boy in an iron lung.<br /><br />i've looked forward to seeing this film since reading Marks essay \\"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\\" several months ago.  the essay can be found online by searching on its title.  with the run-up of good things that i've heard about The Sessions, i was afraid that my expectations were running so high that the movie couldn't live up to its promise.  i definitely am not disappointed.<br /><br />there is nothing about The Sessions that i don't like.<br />the sex is handled tastefully but not prudishly.<br />the cast is outstanding all around.  John Hawkes is super convincing as Mark.  Helen Hunt is perfect as Cheryl (the sex surrogate).  absolutely love William H Macy as the priest. Mark's interactions with Macy's character kind of tie everything together and keep the story moving forward.<br /><br />i think we would all prefer to be seen as the complex and beautiful people that we are.<br />not just a sum of our body parts, abilities, possessions, etc.<br />in order to achieve this, we'll need to exercise the kind of courage that Mark O'Brien did.<br />that's whyi think this movie speaks to everyone.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I only discovered this artist about 6 months AFTER the albums release. But I have to say, it is one of my favorite albums.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|This Blu Ray set has both the original and the enhanced.<br /><br />Only complaint would be the episode list is on the back side of the sleeve, and based on where the disc attach to the case you can have trouble reading the list.
B005XLN97M|4.0|I purchased this doll house for my seven-year old niece and she loves it. It's not as elaborate as other doll houses on the market, but it is a great starter. It is also larger than I expected, which is great.
B0019IB0II|4.0|An amazing depiction of what the brain is all about. A little repetitive on some points, but overall a very enjoyable book to read.
193700788X|1.0|After reading Dead in the Family I kind of had a clue of who Sookie's choice would be in the end but I still had hope that CH would prove me wrong.  What a waste of time and money, I feel so duped!  All this time selling us the Sookie and Eric romance for her to end up with Sam?!  Really CH? it's not believable! Did you pay someone to write this book for you, 'cause I have to say it's the worst of all the series and the characters are all wacked.  Never reading anything you write ever again!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This a great app and very easy to use. It is so easy to veiw great deals the only down side i spend to much money on all the great deals.
B005R32L66|5.0|I have been using Skype professionally and personally for years, it's great. I love the security and reliability. It works for families who travel overseas and has robust business features.  I would like a business version app for iOS/android.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Product seems to works as advertised...Makes the correct noise.  Magic ink and UV light work well.<br /><br />I am still trying to unlock my cage, though.  Well, I'm sure it will eventually work.  Just like my picture on the milk carton.
B00AA0U05A|3.0|Saw her sing on the Katie show and the song selection caused me to want more. I didn't care for the song selection at all on this cd. Her voice is very engaging but to me the cd tanks because of the songs.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This continuation of Season One is better than the first one-and I didn't think that was possible!  The acting is superb, the storyline fascinating.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was surprised to find the whole DVD collection at such a low price, but delighted at the same time.  I'm not a huge fan of the films, I much prefer the books.  The product arrived in good shape.
030758836X|2.0|This started as a smart, slow and witty whodunit with enough twists to keep you interested. But once the plot opens up the story picks up pace and builds up to a climax which does complete injustice to the characters and the plot. In short, poor execution. Good for lazy afternoons if you've nothing else to read.
6305127646|5.0|Love this flick.  It's well done AND funny!  Product was received in good shape.  If you like spy movies, you'll love The Saint.
B009AMANBA|4.0|For children who find history books dull and boring, this film brings to life a great American.  Daniel Day Lewis really studied Lincoln's character in order to portray the man.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|From ages 9 to 15 it can really relate to you and just make your really him in the movie!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|With all of the violence and blood and guts in movies today, this film was very refreashing.  Even if most of it was computer-generated, it was like a breath of fresh air to view.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|The classic story is just a awesome story to relax you from age 0 all the way to adults! Fun!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|The acting was great. I got so much out of the movie as far as history. Been sometme since I revisited this time of history.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|You get to a certain point usually a high scoring game &amp; all of a sudden the ball gets real small &amp; your game is over. Very frustrating!!! It would be a great game if it weren't for that. Why can't that be fixed?
1742200508|5.0|With a very colorful cover image of a castle atop a hill, overlooking the ocean, how could I resist. I couldn't. I love travel guides and am always looking for those that provide me with any additional information concerning a country or city I plan to visit. This Lonely Planet guide to England is very comprehensive (846 pages in all). I will not go into minute detail but, rather, cover the basics of the guide. If you will be driving I suggest that you enter locations you have decided to visit on your satnav GPS prior to your trip. Then you are all set for your tour.<br /><br />The guide breaks England down into 12 districts and the first page conveniently tells you which page to go to for the district you want. The first 50 pages of the guide are devoted to planning your trip, with top suggestions, what you need to know, what's going on month by month, and the like, to assist the traveler in preparations. Following that, each district section includes an index, as well as Lonely Planet's top 5 suggestions for Best Places to Eat and Best Places to Stay. This is followed, again in each district, with short reasons concerning Why Go and When to Go. The Why and When write-ups are short but do provide some nice information about each district. From there you get into the heart of your chosen location, including activities, festivals, sights (castles, museums, galleries, churches, colleges, libraries, and more), entertainment, history, and additional offerings about food and sleep. All of this is assisted by at least 3 or 4 maps of each specific district.<br /><br />After the districts is a section of about 50 pages aimed to help people understand England, including history, food, architecture, landscape, arts and sports, which I found pretty useful. The book closes with a \\"survival guide\\" with an A-Z directory (camping, hostels, customs, embassies, insurance, and more), a bit on transport, a glossary, a very thorough index and a legend map. Those last 45 pages may indeed come in quite handy during travels. As with any Lonely Planet guide I have owned this one also comes with a pull-out map, of London. The map provides top sights, a full street index and a transit map. All in all, a very good and recommended guide for anyone visiting England.d come in quite handy during travels. As with any Lonely Planet guide I have owned this one also comes with a pull-out map, of London. The map provides top sights, a full street index and a transit map.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|I read through this whole book thinking that at least the ending would be really good but it turns out that this is in fact, not a mystery book. Poop. I really was hoping it was. Ms. Monroe. It turns out that this is a dictionary....whatever that is.  I do not recommend this to anyone
B000002WAE|5.0|Perfect condition. Arrived in record time. What more can I say? Oh, and the price was affordable. This tape is never gonna give you up, or let you down.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|this normaly not my type of book but reading this one has changed my mind,the way that all the charactors were described and the way the story unfolded made me want to keep reading.it has a surprising ending that makes you think there is more to come, I hope so [outstanding]
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I really enjoyed the last 2 depeche mode releases. For me this record is lacking and I can't qwuite put a finger on why, I think the songs aren't quite as strong. Great sounds, great performances but there are only a few really strong songs. Still better than most of the record to come out this year but not Depeche Modes best effort.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best romance/action packed novel. If you have seen the movie, there are only a few differences, but the book in my opinion is much better. It is a very detailed novel and i hope Suzanne Collins continues her wonderful work!
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|This is a good app for fit people but with being new at getting in to shape its a little advanced.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Great book I love it dictionaries! I love it so much it is amazingly amazing! I am awesome? what )_the ceasefire
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|So you thought you knew all about America's role in world affairs prior to bombs falling on our battleships in Pearl Harbor.  Think again.  Lynn Olson has captured the real anger that was ripping our nation apart before Japan united us in December 1941.
193700788X|4.0|I was a Sookie Stackhouse fan before True Blood and I remain one now, even though I stopped watching the series after the third season and some of the books in the series were disappointing. The ending made the most sense, especially after the prior book, and Harris neatly tied up loose threads and gave us closure on the most important characters that appeared over the 14 book series (not to mention additional short stories).<br /><br />The intensity of the fanbase was exaggerated by the HBO series, I think, and it was clear which way most of them wanted the series to end. All I will say to that is they were not thinking of Sookie, but their own fantasies.<br /><br />Yes, to me, Sookie lives. Not the tv show Sookie, but the one who loved her grandmom and took too much crap for too many books, but really emerged a stronger, more confident character who had too much of a sense of herself to take less than she deserved anymore. A character who was afraid of taking chances and took them anyway, and learned from her mistakes.<br /><br />Congratulations to Charlaine Harris, who stayed true to the Sookie I care about and made this book one of the best in the series. Sookie was in danger again and again...and never without good reason. She interacted with her best friends, former lovers, and old enemies, all in typical Sookie fashion. And in the end, we see her longings for a child, and the possibility of having one in a loving marriage. Good for Sookie.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|the app wont even download on my kindle and like most I liked the game on my handheld and I thought this would be cool but turns out it cant download and ive tried on another app in the app store and it work perfect so theirs some virus or glitch that's in the code. if this is happening to you speak up so they fix it.
1579128149|5.0|What a beautiful and informative book. It goes perfectly with the large periodic table poster I purchased and framed prior to buying this book. I recommend it to everyone.
B00B9366VO|5.0|so well done. The production is sooooo good. If you are interested in recording, music, or classic rock, this is an amazing film, and provides a unique look into the recording industry. While it can get a little jargon packed at times, if you know your stuff, you will appreciate it.
B00AO2S45W|5.0|I wasn't expecting it, but this album is quite good.  I normally don't replay an album over and over, but I keep finding my self playing this one when I'm looking for something to listen to.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|this movie is too funny!<br />If you appreciate family guy style humor, you will loooove this movie. The plot gets a little hackneyed at times, but what can you expect from a comedy movie.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|And we found it here. My kids love it and it was nice memories for me :) great movie for all ages.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it...easy to play on my Kindle Fire.  Calling all Baby Boomers<br /><br />  and solitaire players.  Braingames..good for all ages
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. It is great, its modest enough to watch while small children are around. Can't wait for more seasons
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This is a series my whole family has been enjoying including my 4 year old granddaughter. We are always looking forward to the next season.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I love the size of this item. I was worried it would be too fragile but it works fabulous! It's very cute.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This is a series my whole family has been enjoying including my 4 year old granddaughter. We are always looking forward to the next season.
B001HN694K|5.0|This Mad Hatter is really very mad indeed and Alice is a charmer, yet strong eough to chop up a Jaberwock. The film is altogether quirkly and delightful. If you like something different, this is certainly not the Disney &#34;Alice In Woinderland&#34;, but I like that version as well - so make a set of the two and enjoy them.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Oh finally! my turn! After a couple of listens, I'm ready to post my ratings. First off I'll say Depeche Mode never ceases to amaze me, after SOTU I really didnt think they could top themselves yet again, and here we are, Delta Machine is a stunner!<br /><br />I describe Delta Machine as Trippy, Organic, Chaos!<br /><br />1. Welcome to my world - \\"And if you stay a while\\" 8/10<br /><br />2. Angel - its got a hypnotic effect that reminds me of APTIUT \\"oh leave me here forever more, peace\\" 9/10<br /><br />3. Heaven - Dave called it right, this is the lynchpin of the album! 10/10<br /><br />4. Secret to the end - \\"Did I disappoint you?\\" the part at 4 mins 25 secs is beautiful 9/10<br /><br />5. My Little Universe - trippy! \\"Here I am king\\" 9/10<br /><br />6. Slow - \\"... your beautiful face\\" \\"Thats how I like it\\" 9/10<br /><br />7. Broken - Joy Division Insight intro \\"you dont have to fall that far\\" \\"you were broken from the start\\" 8/10<br /><br />8. The Child Inside - Lovetheme x Easytiger 8/10<br /><br />9. Soft Touch/Raw Nerve - \\"your depression will take me down\\" climatic ending! 9/10<br /><br />10. Should Be Higher - reminds me of Sinner In Me x Corrupt \\"your lies are more attractive than the truth, Love is all I want\\" OMG this is the best song on the album! 10/10<br /><br />11. Alone - at the 2 mins mark it becomes epic, progressive, haunting 8/10<br /><br />12. Soothe My Soul - \\"only one way!\\" Chaos! Dave & Martin bring the house down 8/10<br /><br />13. Goodbye - I Feel You interlude (Get Right With Me) x Peace! 10/10<br /><br />14. Long Time Lie - 5/10<br /><br />15. Happens All The Time - 5/10<br /><br />16. Always - nice strings 7/10<br /><br />17. All Thats Mine - violatory sun & the rainfall \\"like a ship in the ocean...\\" 10/10<br /><br />So there we have it  I'm blown away again, a new favorite yet again!<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />10's - 4<br />9's - 5<br />8's - 5<br /><br />Should Be Higher is the best song on the album, love it love it!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoying playing mahjong, would give another star, if app had a better background than just plain.  Other than that, this game ok for now.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The character Jennifer Lawrence played is raw and hardcore but still capable of empathy. It's similar to the tough, red neck one she played in Winter's Bone. I'm pleased she won best actress for this year's film. I thought Bradley Cooper's character suffered from delusions more like schizophrenia than manic/depression. His middle of the night rants and friviolous passions did make him seem biploar but I don't recall any descents into depression. He could become violent like Jennifer Lawrence's character that's why as lovers I imagine their love will either emotionally heal each other or lead to fights until they've both had enough.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Very nice animation I loved the story line but for an animation that had the world video game cellebrities like Sonic, Mario, Street fighters & etc..., They were all just guest stars.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I belive this worth every penny it has stunning visual effect just breath taking ! goes good with my Lcd,hd,3D tv.
B0000669JL|5.0|The merchendice was undammaged & the songs more than buetiful I give it 11 thumbs up or shoud I say 11 out of 10
B009NY43NY|2.0|I feel like I have invested enough time and money in this series to say I feel cheated. The flow of this book is different, the characters feel different, it is simply a different book than the other ones. Maybe CH felt rushed? Maybe she wrote the ending out of spite to her publisher? I have no idea what the issues were but there were definitely some big ones. I know the ending pissed people off and it did me too, but I could have accepted it had the author made it a believable possibility through out her last few books.  Also being that it was the book I expected more of a big bang, but it read more like a mid series book. There was so much potential for drama, heroics, and romance.  I guess Sookie once said she wanted someone who would put her first, and I expected that to happen for her. The author was obviously ready to be done with this series.
B008602KQI|5.0|I did not read the book(s) but I think the movie stand on its own, Jennifer Lawrence star is rising the Oscar she won should be just the beginning.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Great Movie, a movie I seen as a child, now my child watched it and loves it!  Will watch it over and over again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say. Great acting/great story/great photography....cannot wait for the forth season. The story line is simply outstanding. I just don't watch &#34;zombie&#34; movies of any kind. This is much more than that.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It was a cool game with lots of mystery. I want the red rubies for my reward thanks a lot.
B000059GXA|1.0|This movie would not play apparently it is a Swedish version site should be more clear about regions I'm sure I am not the only one this has happened to
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  Good story, but  it actually  could have been longer to tell more about the characters
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Great move. Great sets. Great costumes. So much emotion. A perfect way to see this very famous work. Glad I watched it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is and will always be a classic.  You have to love his storytelling, from To Build A Fire to White Gang it seems like London was a true mountain man and loved everything about the wilderness.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Why do I like this movie?<br />It's mindless fun to watch people kung-fu each other for 2 hours.<br />RZA did great for his first time at bat.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I'm in my 50's and watch this film annually.  If you start watching it when you're young enough, watching this film becomes a foray into another little world.  It's a comforting escape to watch in January when the parties are over and the pockets are empty.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this for my grandkids to use, and they LOVE it.  The graphics are fabulous and the app is fun and very informative about how a reef lives.  They really love it.  The kids range in age from 9 - 4.  Reading is needed, so when the smaller ones use it, I sit and read it to them, pretty much like an interactive story.  Excellent!
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|If you looked at the billboard charts right now you would think pop is dead.  Well technially it is but it doesn't have to be.  New Kid's newest album makes One Direction look like amateurs.  For some reason this album hasn't got the credit it deserves.  Very unique and original songs.  This second album since their reunion is better than the first one they put out even.  THIS is how you do a comeback.  Too bad it wasn't pushed and marketed and played enough though because it will end up falling through the cracks due to lack of popularity but definitely not lack of quality.
0871164566|5.0|Easy to follow instructions. A must have for beginners at wire wrapping. It will get your imagination flowing. Very motivational.<br /><br />FG<br />Virgin Islands
B009GEDP26|5.0|A great cast makes this multi-faceted series a MUST SEE! All ages will love the way family and work force dynamics are weaved into a fun, upbeat plot with plenty of interesting twists and turns. You'll be hooked if you give this series a try! Season 5 is a long awaited look at Castle and Beckett's relationship development. Gotta go (want to watch it again!).
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It a well made game. It has the playstyle of games like temple run and the charm of Robert Downy Jr.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|This was just as good as the rest.  I haven't seen the last one yet but I expect the same.
B00992CF6W|4.0|In my opinion I think this game should be more like the computer like put at least put in pressure plate's, redstone and switches
B000065KLO|5.0|I love this movie! Received it right away and it was a great quality.If you have not seen this movie make sure you do.One of a kind and heartwarming
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE - CANT WAIT TILL THE 2ND ONE COMES OUT!!!  CHRIS PINE IS AMAZING AS KIRK AND DOES WILLIAM SHATNER JUSTICE.
0307474275|2.0|Based on the popularity of this book, I was expecting to love it. Not so much. I found it to be very poorly written. The author needs remedial courses in basic English sentence structure. Mixed metaphors abound.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the \\"mystery\\" portion of the story hinges on an incredibly remote coincidence that is ridiculous upon inspection. It fools the reader not because it is clever but because the probability of things unfolding the way they do is zero.<br /><br />Speaking of the characters, they are less than cardboard cutouts. They are not even paper thin.<br /><br />The conspiracy aspect to the story is okay and the history is passable. The idea behind the story is serviceable. Too bad this topic wasn't covered by a stronger writer.
B007RCJNDE|1.0|Why did I ever start reading the wot series.  I'm just sorry that I had to read to the end because it was not an end. As has been said by many others it left too much unexplained. Awful awful ending.
B001QXZ81G|5.0|I saw this movie many years ago and since wished I could purchase it. When ever I have searched for it I have found it to be not available, darn. Now I  have found it available but I read that it will not play on a standard U.S. dvd player, darn. This is good comedy, as was the movie.
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|They do a great job with the album, especially covering the mighty VH \\"Romeo's Delight\\", and that my friends is not an easy accomplishment...keep up the good work guys, you rock!!
B00355L2TU|5.0|DId the first work out and it was great! Felt refreshed and ready to do it again after one day of being sore but now I am ready to do it every day.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Not his best work but enjoyable.  Found the plot a bit thin and the characters a bit weak but have not read any of the other books in the trilogy.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Time has not dimmed great writing in this classic. Reading this made me think of my own growing up in a small Midwestern town in a simpler time.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Really enjoyed the book.  THought the plot amazing and really had you thinking until the last page, which came as a surprise. A thriller with a difference as not your usual &#34;who done it&#34;.
1400069742|5.0|This is an extremely well written narrative over the internal battle in America on whether or not we should enter WW II.  Headed on one side by Roosevelt and on the other by Lindbergh, Americans were deeply divided on whether they should come to the aid of Britain and France against Nazi Germany.  The historical events are well presented and examined in depth without being dry and didactic. The personalities of the major players, their flaws and gifts, comes through clearly.  The book is a true page turner because the author has a knack for making complex political situations easy to understand and follow.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any history lover that wants a deeper understanding of this time in history.  This is the first book I have read by this author, it will not be my last. Highly recommend, this is a true 5 star book.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It performs its basic functions well and works between my pc, phone,  and kindle,  but the organization feels off and their are still occaisonal syncing problems.
0060833459|5.0|It was a pleasure reading it! Drucker sets the foundation of key management principles which could be applied in every domain.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|The album is a win win every piece of music enchanting.  I was taken away by the music.  Love it!
B00448SE4S|1.0|Horrible script and story. It was just incredibly painful to watch and I would not recommend it to anyone. Ever.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|But if you like Tarantino movies you'll like it. I watched Inglorious Bastards also, which is done in a similar vain.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Ok some people seemed to be confused with this...<br />The box it comes in IS a cheap thin plastic box saying Fujiyama (thats the &#34;name&#34; of the amp) but this doesn't make the product bad at all. I have to say that charging it completely before even trying it out is very necessary but no worries the charge hold a good amount (2  hours charging and about 10 hours of use). Using it while it is charging does emit some noise but it isn't really a problem since it charges rather fast.<br /><br />So this being my first, I didn't expect how much of a change it would be with my ATH M50s, and I do hear a different but is NOT an immense change like some people say. Notice that this is a really flat amp so with no EQ it won't suddenly change everything about the quality you are getting through your cans. I am also very pleased that I can hear small sounds and details that I could not hear before and nothing is blurred or muddy, very clear. Overall, very nice product and I am very pleased with it.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Great game I am having a hard time putting it down. Just love the levels and can not wait till the end.
076790592X|5.0|This is an enlightening book.  It should cause the reader to examine his/her own values.  Well worth the short time it takes to read.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I like this story line a lot but with all the different characters, it is hard to follow at times.
193700788X|4.0|I've enjoyed all the Sookie books.  I'm glad there was a happy ending and that Sookie has the opportunity to lead a \\"normal\\" life and maybe even have children.  Imagine the great children Sookie and Sam can have!  The ending is open since Sookie doesn't know if she will always be with Sam, but she knows where she belongs and she is HAPPY and content.  After 12 books shouldn't the series end with a sense of hope for Sookie.  Charlaine Harris should be praised for her great imagination.  I will miss Sookie and friends!
1849801800|4.0|I think we have to go deeper into the myths and ancient culture to understand different management framework<br />Hindrik Öunpuu LightPerspective BPC AB
B005F3XV62|5.0|Amazing. My grandson and granddaughter loves it.  I would recommend this to everyone, who likes comedy and romance. Get it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good length.  Puzzles that aren't too easy nor impossible to solve. Well worth<br />what I paid. I look forward to the sequel.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It is good quality work properly and meets my expectations and I would recommend it to other buyers and carriage arrived much earlier and optimal
B002UNMW7O|5.0|i love this collection of movies. I love the actors in both movies. I would recommend both movies to anyone who like action/humor type movies.
B0016YBFZ8|3.0|Adventure story was a little slow. I liked the music and the clothing. A little too graphic for me but hubby was okay with it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well written,  intense, twisted and fascinating story line. I can't wait for the 3rd book. So much better than 50 Shades trilogy!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought 4 ps3 controls & all were faulty in that @ least one of the D pad directions in each control did not work. Any gamer would know this basically renders the entire control useless. Had to go & re purchase controls from bestbuy. Exremely disappointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|If I have to compare this book to 50 Shades, I must say that this is much better in so many ways. It is better written and much more interesting story. The characters are more complex and fascinating. You just can't stop reading.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|This album is as good as their debut.  Give it some time, it's quite the grower. Infestissumam is worth the cash
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|The twist in the movie is great....not in the book...you will enjoy every moment...and want to see it again and again...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been waiting for the book for long time and it was a suitable end for a most intriguing fantasy.<br />I enjoyed it and I can recommend the Wheel of time to anyone seeking a very good story....
1416955070|4.0|Book was in excellent quality, it just took two weeks for it to finally get to my door. Book is good and would recommend it if you liked beautiful creatures and twilight series.
B000SGSU58|5.0|This ranks as one of Michael Connelly's best. Detective Bosch is involved in a case that seems impossible to unravel. I have read many books in this series and this is the best of the Bosch series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun and challenging. I am very fond of this type of game and this is the best one I have found yet.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Dual shock three, it fits snug in your hand and has vibration and six axis! I'll give the xbox 360 controller the benefit of the of being snug, but there is a reason sony, has stuck with the same design since and it show, this controller is neat! Battery power can be an issue for some, but i always have it usb connected so its never an issue for me
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This CD has all the greatest success of Whitney Houston and I just loved it. I was looking for some collection that had especially &#34;It's not right, but it's ok&#34; on the setlist. Finally I found this one. Very happy ;)
B000B7BRMM|5.0|First off, I'm a big Diana Krall fan and this Xmas cd just rocks for me!  Honestly, it did not thrill me as much at first, (mostly, because there's not a lot of piano playing by Krall on this one to my untrained ear) but, this one has really grown on me.  I listen to it all the time---even when it's not Xmas! It's now my favorite cd to play during those wonderful weeks in December. If you're a fan, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection.
B006H5120E|5.0|I'm 22 now and I still cry watching Titanic. I'm a huge fan of this movie and I have all the other versions of it at home.
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Not the best movie I've ever seen. Same old Mark Wahlberg, but it's pretty good. Definitely worth a watch and you be the judge.
B000FA57RG|4.0|I gave 4 stars because I wish they had the lyrics on the album folder, which doesn't exist :(<br />Other than that the product is awesome, and she's the only Queen of Pop...
B003Y5H542|5.0|Item arrived when they said it would and in perfect condition. It is a great price for the combo. I purchased it since I was planning to buy a blu-ray. The dvds work beautifully. No complaints here!
B000BBOV8U|5.0|I didn't know all the songs of the cd until I heard it for the first time. Since I like Brian Adams, I also liked the musics. It's very worth having it.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This movie was everything I thought it would be and a little bit more. For the most part it was hilarious and highly engaging, there were a few instances when it was deep and I may or may not have shed a tear. (But what do you expect when you're watching a movie about parenthood). I want to watch this one again.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|College Hoover is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. This book was SO  good. She masterfully developed the characters...Not just the main characters but all of them. I would recommend recommend this book book and I can't wait  to start Point of Retreat.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very interesting biography of a riveting individual. The editing could have probably been a little better as I felt he repeated himself a several times throughout.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Always love new versions of Angry Birds. Playing with friends makes it more challenging,beating their high score is more fun
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Great album, all the songs are very heart felt and soulful. Each album they produce gets better and better. Love thier songs.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|I read all this reviews claiming it was addicting and then after I buy it, I played and get born after 5 minutes. Not worth it. Plus this game if spyware. I don't need a app taking my personal information.

0316224588|3.0|Rankin's latest shares all the elements of previous Rebus books.  It is generally well-written and well-plotted.  I thought it was only \\"OK,\\" however, for two reasons.<br /><br />My first problem with the book was that there is too much going on.  After a while, the numerous characters became overwhelming and they distracted (maybe on purpose) from the main story.  Also, I'm not really sure Fox needed to be in this book.  It felt like merely an attempt to connect Rankin's two main characters as a way to market them.<br /><br />My second problem is that the way in which Rebus \\"solves\\" the crime is a bit unrealistic.  As the massive 2013 police investigation in Boston showed, there are many eyes analyzing video camera footage these days so the fact that someone might have \\"missed\\" a key clue seems a bit far-fetched.  That the someone who \\"caught\\" the clue didn't really spend much time behind a desk (and, in fact, spent it drinking and bashing the investgation techniques) seems even more far-fetched.<br /><br />I wish I liked this book better.  However, I think at this point Rankin should stick more closely with Fox.  The good old days for Rebus seem to be over despite best efforts to keep him relevant.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I really enjoy this game takeover it cause I have so much.  So if u want a game that u can have fun this is the game for u
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|Love this app for the Kindle, photos are clear and so many creative options for storing and arranging photos to share.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|These Fans are fantastic. The performance is great, but where these fans really shine is in the packaging and with the add ons.  The fans come packaged in a way that shows great attention to detail and care. They also come packaged with extras like rubber mounts and several wiring choices. The care shown in how these products are packaged and the extras that are included justify the price and instill a confidence in the brand.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I love all the Gossip Girl season, and this was no exception. I'm currently re-watching it, and then I'm sure I will re-watch the entire series.
1616550414|4.0|This is the master piece of the Art Books, it haves concepts from the very first zelda for NES and a lot of good history from all the games in the series, im not giving it 5 stars just because it contemplates in majority the skyward sword and not more of the other games
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Great cinematography. Accurate. Dwelt a little too much on some individuals without explaining as much about the war or battles, but the features on the disks fill in some gaps nicely. Follows Robert Leckie's book, whose character was played by James Badge Dale, quite well. Band of Brothers was a much more engaging wartime scenario for storytelling than The Pacific. No matter which series you prefer, however, ie, Band or Pacific, you have to appreciate the struggles our soldiers went through AND came out of. Both movies made me want to learn more about WWII, and Leckie's books on all the wars are very well written and easy to follow for us non-historians. I was &#34;forced&#34; to read key chapters in his book on the Civil War before watching Gettysburg. Not only was the book captivating, but I could then understand all the unspoken and undocumented action in the movie.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing these games!  They are both fun and challenging with all the variations of they games.

B00BWGISB4|4.0|Lets face it there are a lot of husbands like me out there that has to listen to their wives relive their youth by hearing boy bands on the stereo.  This album isn't a 'chore' to listen to, it's actually kind of fun and energetic. What can I say other than I have actually listened to it without the wife in the car.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Download tracks 1,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,14 & 15 and you'll have yourself a solid, rocking Aerosmith album written (mainly) by the band.  Tracks 2,7,9,11 & 12...blechhh...  Trust me.
B0053O89IS|5.0|BONES REACTIONS TO A FIRST CHILD ARE HILARIOUS. ALL MOTHERS SHOULD WATCH THIS IF THEY HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT MOTHERHOOD.<br />I DID NOT LIKE THE GRAVEDIGGER.
1469984202|5.0|I loved many things about this book. I loved that it was published independently and that the author also edited it, and well of course, the story. I loved the story. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's a twist. Just when you realize the book is excellent, something else happens and you are amazed - it's even better than you had thought.<br />I have already recommended this book to many of my friends. Bought a few copies for people I know will love it. I wanted to share the joy and also, but mostly and selfishly, I was dying to talk about it with someone. It's not just an amazing suspenseful dystopia with just the right amount of romance, it's a well-written and well-edited book.<br /><br />In a nutshell... what are you waiting for? Read this book!
B003L77G8I|5.0|THE FORENSICS ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO SOMEONE WITH A BS IN BIOLOGY WHO ALWAYS LIKED  DISECTION CLASSES BEST. ROMANCE BETWEEN BOOTH AND BONES IS ENTICING.<br />EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH AT LEAST TWO EPISODES.

B000IZ4R1U|2.0|The characters and story line is all very cheesy.  I watched it while working out on my bike and it helped pass the time.

B005KGNN26|5.0|If you are a Peter fan, this record must be in your collection. Like other PG efforts, I think this record demands something more from the listener. To really understand the genius of it requires uninterrupted concentration. I think one who is VERY familiar with the original arrangements will also get more out of this record than the casual Peter Gabriel fan. The orchestra does much more than transpose the old material into a version fit for a symphony. It also takes melodic liberties at times, giving the songs a darker yet overwhelmingly beautiful feel. Part of what is so enjoyable for me, is identifying those changes, and finding the other subtle differences or new adaptations contained deep within the vast ocean of sound that is the orchestra. They do an incredible job of creating extreme dynamics that can go from a whisper to an explosion of sound without warning. But most importantly, it allows the listener to approach the songs from a completely different perspective emotionally. As Patrick Bateman might say, &#34;It's an epic meditation on intangibility.&#34;

B00000I41J|5.0|Before I launch into opinions that reflect my personal tastes more than being objective and factual, please take the time to listen to the sound samples on this page. They will convey what this album is about in richer detail than my weak writing skills.<br /><br />This album has a quality that sends chills every time I listen and soak in the way Miles' trumpet is buoyed by Cannonball's rich tone from his alto. I also think that the incredible rhythm section comprised of Hank Jones on piano, Sam Jones on bass and Art Blakey on drums is perfect for this session. I am especially impressed with the way Blakey - also known as the volcano - laid back and played with delicacy and beauty.<br /><br />I love this album on a number of levels ranging from the sensual rendition of Autumn Leaves to the final track - Bangoon - that is up tempo and swinging. That track was not on the original album, but it's inclusion for this reissue is a nice treat.<br /><br />For my fellow jazz historians and hard core fans this album is also interesting because at the time this was recorded on March 9, 1958, Adderley was a member of Miles' quintet, but on this album is the session leader with Miles as a sideman. And it works because you can clearly discern the difference in the way Cannonball approaches songs from the way Miles would. Cole Porter's Love for Sale is a good example.<br /><br />A few final notes for the hisrorian: this was recorded in Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on the date noted above, and was released later in 1958 as Blue Note 1595.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I really don't write reviews but when this book finished I was like are you kidding me?  THIS is the final book?  No epilogue, nothing.  I was very unsatisfied by this ending and hugely disappointed.
B000MR9D5E|1.0|To be honest, when I saw the complete series on the shelf for only $20 I was so excited to grab it. I instantly nabbed it up and bought it. I remember the days when it used to be $60! So I got it and went home, pressed play, and what was supposed to take 50 minutes for each episode became 20.<br /><br />I mean Jesus Christ people, is this really what we have come to? Why not show the mating rituals of animals? Or the certain way they socialize. No. Time after time it's a baby bird dropping into a crocodile's jaws, a lion killing an antelope, or a snake eating something. Even something as majestic as a dolphin is just half about eating fish. Really people? This is your \\"beautiful\\" footage? It's pathetic and crass and shows what dullness is spat out by people that think they are so high and mighty that they find beauty in death. I find it quite interesting that a country that shows death and dying on a show about the beauty of Earth is the same country that has banned knives and guns because a few hundred people died every year as a result of them.<br /><br />Easily a 1/5 and I'll be looking to get rid of this DVD set as soon as I can.
B0094KOSO6|5.0|Great movie for kids and the family...my 2 year old cant stop talking about Mater! They even sneak in some humor for the adults.
B0039OC64M|4.0|I find the movie is a very good translation of the book, but really, its impact is lost unless you've read the book first since you're missing most of the mental thoughts of Winston and the background information on the society.  For instance, Winston has to constantly work at keeping his face passive to avoid the appearance of Thought Crime, but you'd just think everyone looks the way they do because they are oppressed as it isn't overtly stated.  It's a good companion to the book, but it doesn't stand as well on its own as a movie.

B009NY43NY|3.0|There's a lot and not a lot going on on this book at the same time. Much of the plot seems a little forced...like she was stretching to make everything come together. Fans of a certain character will be none to happy with how things turn out, I know I wasn't....but the story wasn't terrible. There were enough twists to the plot and returning characters that it kept me engaged. The ending....I was not a fan at all. There's very little closure, and a lot of questions left unanswered. And for such an action packed and often times romantic series...the ending of it all just didn't cut it. I was left staring at the last page wanting more...not because I was so enthralled with the story, but because the abrupt ending seemed lackluster.

Its horrifying to watch but you can't stop watching. It's one of those movies, like a friend of mine said, that once your done watching it you dont even want other people to know you have watched it lol. My husb almost threw it in the trash after we watched it but now it is making its round through all our friends lol. If you think Human Centipede was too much, this goes far far far far beyond anything like that. Seriously, watch at your own risk. The filming and acting was superb for a low budget film. Some of the scenes are sooooo real you cant believe they are not real.

0143119680|3.0|Well well, Miss Harkness, I must say this was a good one. I had a couple problems with this book at first but for the most part I did really enjoy it. This interview may read like a \\"don't pick it up\\" but I prefer you to see it as an objective point of view.<br /><br />As I've mentioned in other reviews I appreciate in a trilogy when there is a good build up in the first book. It obviously makes for a better anticipation for the series. Hell, I've even read trilogies that suck because of a great first read just to see what may come.<br /><br />This series started out on a good note, just not a great one. While the writing and the story line are very solid, the first half leaves something to be desired. I appreciate when authors want to convey a certain feeling or tempo for their writing, but damn can some books be slow at first.<br /><br />I started this MONTHS ago and finished it now. I just couldn't keep reading through those first slow chapters. The characters, while all kick ass in their own special way, just weren't doing anything at first. Sure there was some scenes that sparked and kept me reading. I mean with a mix of vampires, witches, and daemons, something is bound to happen.<br /><br />Now, AFTER WRITING ALL THAT I can say it was worth the wait when I finished the book! I mean its like s*** hits the fan and everything goes from bad to worse and when there is even a bit of hope, the main characters still feel the weight of it. The plot revolves around a magical alchemical text called Ashmole 792. All of the creatures want their hands on this becomes it holds the history and reason for being of each race, or so they believe. Since no one has laid eyes on it for centuries, of course it's an item of interest. Diana Bishop pulls the text from the library storage, reads a little, and puts it back. This leaves everyone in a complete state of W.T.F.!!! LOL. Some random witch did what no one for centuries could do and no one knows why. And so that's where the adventure begins.<br />I know, it doesn't sound that intriguing. I thought so to.  But trust me when I say it gets VERY interesting. A witch having a vamp guy around, being hunted by every creature, discovering horrifying truths about her past, the EXTREME power she possesses (and KICKS ASS with!!!), and then having to travel through time to fix things makes for a great first part.<br /><br />All in all, I give this a 3 1/2 out of 5 because of the slow moving first half and that ONLY. If you have the time and patience then you should give this a read. You will be pleasantly surprised. I certainly look forward to and will read the next book!!'t sound that intriguing.

B00BAYLQI0|4.0|Amazing effects and stunts along with and solid performances balance out some artistic lapses and ethical questions<br />in this true story of one family's experiences of the horrendous Tsunami  that killed 300,000.<br /><br />The downsides; there's something a little off-putting about choosing a white, privileged family as a focus, while at the<br />same time showing almost exclusively other white people as suffering and afraid in a disaster that killed far more local<br />people than tourists.  The Thai's are certainly shown in a good light, kindly helping all these suffering whites, but even<br />in the hospital, almost every face we see in a bed is a white one.  That hint of odd racial insensitivity is also underlined<br />by replacing the original family, who were Spanish and dark, and making them into a gorgeous blond English family, a<br />telling choice in a `true' story.<br /><br />On a more general level, the film can feel manipulative, from the tear jerking score, to the multiple \\"will they spot each other?\\"<br />shots that feel like a horror film's self-conscious suspense creating frames, but that technique feels strangely artificial in this<br />more naturalistic setting.  There's no question it's exciting and at times moving, but it felt to me like one of those films I<br />would have felt even more deeply if it wasn't pushing so hard to win my emotions.

B000YPWDSS|5.0|Having only discovered the talents of Ms. Winehouse after her death, I did a bit of research to see which CD I should buy.  I did not buy the US version of \\"Back to Black\\" as it does NOT include \\"Addicted\\". A remix of a song already on the album is no substitute in my opinion. From the youtube clips I've seen, Amy opened several of her live performances with \\"Addicted\\", so frankly (no pun intended) the US copy of this album is incomplete and not truly representative of the artist's vision.  I'm pretty sure the reason was simply censorship, and I'm no fan of that.

Heavy at times - slow and melodic - and the vocals are an 11 for me. Worth owning.

B009B8YZIK|5.0|I've been craving a Halo movie ever since I first played the game many years ago.  The premise and setting are prime stock for an on-screen adaptation, however Hollywood's go at video game movies has a horrible track record (yes, I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll).  So, needless to say, I was a bit apprehensive about HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN when I first heard about it.  I mean, it had minimal promotion to begin with, and then I found out it was a web series...ouch!  But then I sat down and watched the DVD version...and WOW...I was blown away!  This is one video game adaptation that truly does its source material justice!<br /><br />HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN is a serious adaptation that should make even the stoutest of Halo fans happy.  It looks great, but it also bears the dark and gritty feel that military movies should have.  The acting is superb and the action is intense; add to this a nice selection of practical and visual effects, and the result is a stellar film that will entertain and impress.<br /><br />There are so many things to like here.  As mentioned, the acting is top notch with Tom Green and Anna Popplewell leading a great cast.  Although I am not very familiar with their previous work (Popplewell's most notable appearance prior to this was in the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series), Green and Popplewell display massive talent in this film and play off of each other very well.<br /><br />Also, as I previously mentioned, the special effects in HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN look great.  The production team spent a lot of time to get the details from the game correct, and the effort definitely pays off.  I found myself grinning a couple of times when I recognized a weapon or piece of equipment from the game.  Even Master Chief's armor, which could be difficult to actually construct, looks realistic.  This was a major point for impressing me overall.<br /><br />But the storyline is what truly made me breathe a content sigh of relief.  The studio actually got it right!  They didn't deviate and try to make a nonsensical movie that only borrowed slightly from the game itself (like the travesty that is DOOM), nor did they try to recreate a new mythology that was not already there.  The production team stays true-to-form and delivers an outstanding film that every director considering a game-to-movie project should watch.<br /><br />HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN is an absolute blast and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, you will still enjoy this military science-fiction masterpiece.  The film is available on Blu-ray, DVD, and streaming, so check it out for sure.didn't deviate and try to make a nonsensical movie that only borrowed slightly from the game itself (like the travesty that is DOOM), nor did they try to recreate a new mythology that was not already there.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|This review is for: People who love the TV series GAME OF THRONES and are considering reading the books as well.<br /><br />In fact, let me be a little more specific. I tried reading A GAME OF THRONES several times before the show started and didn't make it more than a couple chapters before giving up. During those initial attempts, my thoughts about the book could be summed up as \\"Yawn,\\" and \\"Ugh.\\"<br /><br />I didn't even like the HBO show at first. Season 1 struck me as okay. Good enough. Fine. I mean, you know, I watched it, so it wasn't terrible. Season 2 is what hooked me, and it hooked me good. All of a sudden I cared about everything. About the characters -- all the characters! -- and the world and the plot. I was fascinated by every little aspect of Westeros and I wanted more.<br /><br />So I picked up the book again, and I loved it.<br /><br />Obvious warning here: if you don't want to be spoiled, don't read any more of my review.<br /><br />So, first off: I'd heard that the HBO show follows the book pretty faithfully. For Season 1/Book 1, this is true. The HBO show covers all the main events in the book, so don't expect to be surprised, or even to hunt down side-stories or 'deleted scenes'. There really isn't much.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was surprised by how different characters in the book could be from the same character in the TV show, even though they're doing the same things & often speaking the same lines. I didn't pay much attention to Bran during Season 1 -- I couldn't have told you what his name was -- but he leapt off the page for me in the book; I loved his chapters. I've been mostly indifferent to Jon Snow in the show; the actor strikes me as sort of wooden and dull. But I adored Jon Snow in the book; he's funnier, more likable, and full of angst.<br /><br />And...the biggest surprise of all...I didn't like Ned Stark in the book. I loved Sean Bean as Ned Stark. He was so grizzled and fierce and stoic and wise. On the show, his execution struck me as a tragedy. But the Ned Stark of the book seemed provincial, complacent, a poor observer. In the book, I saw the hubris that forecasts a terrible fall. His death seemed less tragic, more inevitable.<br /><br />In fact, when you read with the benefit of hindsight, it's fascinating to see how often a character will make a decision whose TERRIBLE outcome you already know, and then another character will say, \\"Hey, maybe you should rethink that decision, things could go wrong in a TERRIBLE way,\\" and then the first character will say, \\"Yep,\\" and carry on. It's amazing how utterly BELIEVABLE it is that this happens, time and time again. It feels true to life, but it's only possible because the characters are fully-fleshed, and the conflicts they face are so dire.<br /><br />To sum up: don't read for new plot, it's all in the show. DO read to get a different perspective on the characters.<br /><br />DO read if you want to go deeper into the worldbuilding. For example: in the show, it's clear that some people follow the 'old gods' and some the 'seven gods' and then there's the 'one god'. If you want to know why some people follow one religion and others a different one, the book lays it out. If you want to know where Littlefinger got his nickname, if you want hints about who Jon Snow's parents are, if you totally didn't realize that 'The Dog' and 'The Mountain' are brothers who hate one another...the book DOES fill in a lot of details along these lines, and I loved the backstory. It was exactly the sort of thing I'd been craving.<br /><br />I'll tell you something else. I LOVE the HBO show Game of Thrones. Love it. The characters are vivid, the story is crisp and brisk -- I regularly scream or gasp or do some other embarrassing thing at the end of an episode.<br /><br />But the book was more impressive to me. It wasn't until I READ it that I got a handle on how many plots and characters and landscapes GRR Martin is juggling. How huge in scope, how intricatelyworked out this series is -- the plots, the characters, the places. It is all so present and real, and it all feels IMPORTANT.<br /><br />The show feels pretty epic. The book even moreso.worked out this series is -- the plots, the characters, the places. It is all so present and real, and it all feels IMPORTANT.<br /><br />The show feels pretty epic.

1594202842|1.0|Amy Chua's \\"Tiger Mom\\" is a perfect recipe to ruin the children's mental health. She disguises her horrific parenting style that is literally a torture to a child's psych, with emphases on statement such as every decent parent wants what is best for their children and Tiger Moms parenting style is derived from the love for their children. However, as she put it herself, that parents who practice Chinese parenting has a motive that the parents wants to feel proud and secure their own retirement. It's quite sickening. She succeeded with her first child, Sofia, but she completely failed with her second child, Lulu, and she had to change her parenting style realizing that Tiger Mom ruins a child's healthy emotional growth. She knows very well that her book is all about sensationalism for the purpose of high profit and not about good parenting.

B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I don't usually comment on movies.  In fact, this must be my first.  I must say though.  This was a simply perfect movie.  You had to actually think about it.  :D  I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It is a wacky story, but the truth comes thrugh about how we all can grow and change. It has a lot of family dynamics that are common for us all, as well. It's funny and heartwarming.  It gives you a good feeling about embracing the ever changing journey of life and your heart.
B006M4F67A|4.0|A colourful version of the game with pleasant tile pictures and a good variety of starting shapes. Sound effects are not obtrusive.<br />Johuneh.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app ROCKS!!! I beat the entire game in 10.5 hrs, and I couldn't help myself ... I started over!  very addicting, and very fun! I would definitely suggest jetpack joyride!!!!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I recently plowed through `Old Man's War' like a farmer on a spring morning planting corn on a flat field. I purchased `Old Man's War' on my Kindle HD on Friday, 3 May, 2013 and was finished by Tuesday morning. I would have been finished far sooner but I do have a house to run and a wife to keep happy.  Mr. Scalzi's ability to use first person narrative was exemplary and I was never jolted out of the prose by questionable internal monologue or useless adverbs. I ran from beginning to end wanting desperately to understand how a seventy five year old soldier, thrust into a never ending battle for humanity's survival, could wrestle with the moral implications of bloodshed, loss, and slaughter. John Perry, the hero, is personable, a man who is not every man, but enough so that you want him to come out on top. From John's drill sergeant in basic training to the complicated feelings you have when killing is the only answer to a thousand questions, the book is as real as it gets. My only harsh critique is the use of dialogue tags (DT). He uses them far too often; it distracts from the flow of the narrative and throws hiccups in the otherwise excellent flow of a two to six person conversation.<br /><br />I recognized his use of DTs after I decided to do a drill, a practice exercise if you will, to improve my own writing. The drill is to take a piece of your own work, which is dialogue intensive, and remove all of the dialogue tags (DT). The story and or pages must be coherent and flow without DTs, and the reader must never become confused. SO you have to work to make the dialogue make sense. The writer - me - has to use action, movement, sense, sound, smell, something to identify who is speaking without using he said or she said.<br /><br />I don't know if I invented the drill, but I find it to be difficult in its execution and useful for improving my own prose. For me, it makes me look at the characters as people and not constructs on the page. I have to see their quirks, habits, and each idiosyncrasy. For instance if a character is carrying on a conversation with three other people in a room, how do you execute the carousel of dialogue without the DTs.<br /><br />I worked for two hours peeling back the DTs on `Nathan's New Suit,' my mind was trashed and I had what amounted to three new pages. The story flowed better and I filed it away to be submitted this week. As a reward I decided to try another of Scalzi's books, `Ghost Brigade.' I did not buy the book outright, instead I used the Kindle's \\"Borrow function\\" (this is not what Kindle calls it) and I was assaulted by Dialogue Tags. My mind was fresh from my drill and every `he said' and `she said' blasted me out of the story. Every page had them, not a sprinkling, but a deluge, a flood of DTs assaulted me like insurgents on an improvised explosive strewn road in Baghdad. I pulled back and regrouped. I went back and read 'Old Man's War' again to see if the problem systemic, not some accident. It is how he writes, how he keeps track of who is speaking.<br /><br />Since `Ghost Brigade' was John Scalzi's second book in the `Old Man's War' series I thought he must have had a bad run: I continued to drudge forward. From chapter to chapter the tags were present in all conversations. His internal monologue is excellent, descriptions, sights and sense of place carried me through, but once the conversations started again, I felt I was riding a unicycle on a speed bump littered parking lot.  He said and she said are, in my opinion, only necessary in the beginning of a two person dialogue, and only if those persons are stationary, which in real life never happens.<br /><br />I hate how my mind works. I want to the dialogue tags, push them aside, but I can't. I notice them like a leaky faucet, a too tall blade of grass on a manicured lawn, they are fingernails on a chalkboard, and I want them gone.<br /><br />I know such a minor inconvenience will not stop other readers from enjoying John Scalzi's writing, and I hope many people purchase his books. He is an otherwise excellent story teller. His use of technology is not an assault on ones senses more like an excellent array of spices on a marvelous steak. John is up there with Jack Campbell and David Drake when it comes to military Science Fiction. I just need him to delete the dialogue tags.<br />[[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]]i's writing, and I hope many people purchase his books. He is an otherwise excellent story teller.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Love this movie, glad to have all of these folks in my living room, and glad I bought the DVD!
B003BKZW7C|5.0|This is a stunningly good book! Not only does it build tension superbly but the characters are so well drawn and the atmosphere of small town life in the 1950s are captured beautifully. And the nostalgia/fear of childhood memories that can haunt adulthood also seeps out of the pages. It would be difficult to imagine that one could be captivated for 1100 pages but I was. This is a great book!
B005RYF5JA|2.0|What has happened to Celtic Woman, I have loved all their DVDs prior to this. The songs lacked melody (unusual for CW). Previously the cast changes were seamless but they have made one change too many this time. The songs were dull and lacked something, so much so that as I write I could not even tell you the name of any songs on the disc.<br />The introduction of the male dancer is a big no! no! its as if they are trying a new formulae but failing miserably.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|When I heard this book was written from a dogs prespective I was apprehensive.  However, its a great heart warming story.  The parts about car racing boring so I skimmed those!!  Found myself looking at dogs in a new light.  Ive never had a dog either!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I have 8 diamond swords and a castle with a mine<br />That goes to bedrock and all in survival. People who hate minecraft<br />Are lost. I have found 16 diamonds and 56 iron with plenty of coal<br />And butter(gold) . All you need is imaganation
B006M4F67A|1.0|Once again another app to be wary of.  There are to many reviews with five stars making it hard to believe that the creator did not write them.  What really bothers me is the fact that when a negative review is written there is a positive review about the same issue right after.  Even free, if the creator of an app feels it's necessary to write so many reviews to get people to download it isn't worth my time.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Mahjong tiles are really fun to play.  Sometimes it can play tricks on your eyes, but definitely a fun challenging game.
B0044WWLN4|5.0|This is one of the best greatest hits collections.  I listen to  Pink's Funhouse more often, but this CD is a close second.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Movies are good quality and they were packaged very nicely. Price is very good for getting all the movies in the series.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Loved this movie. Actors Bradley Cooper and J. Lawrence were fabulous - they deserved the nomination/award! Check it out! Worth staying up late.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I was expecting something navigable and useful. But unless I missed something major, this is the most dysfunctional app I've ever tried to use. I couldn't even find the search function, if it has one. I deleted it within 10 mins. Awful experience.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was great, but you really have to read all the books in the series to understand what is going on.  I would highly recommend the entire series.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed This is  40. It was funny, ironic and sweet. It was certainly worth the $5 that we spent.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My 5 yr old loves this movie and has seen it 3 times. We watched it on Prime twice. I loved it too..
B0002B15WE|5.0|I bought this because my 17 yo loves the die hard movies, but had never seen the original.  Great price and (as always) fast shipping.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The graphics are lovely, the music is soothing, and the game is very simple. Microtransactions are &quot;encouraged&quot; by the game in the form of quests that require pearls-a currency that can be bought (or harvested, but only one every 3 days). As yet I have not been forced to stop because of these requirements but that may change. It also requires an internet connection, which, if you have the first-gen kindle fire, can be easier said than done. Overall, this game is fun, informative, beautiful, and overall very enjoyable despite its few negative points.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I've played many versions of this game and this one is one of the best. The art work is nice and the play is very intuitive. I recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was captivating, realistic, personal, political and suspensful.  Today's literature seldom captures the human soul of all it's characters including their flaws.  Watch the news and it's easy to understand why the book ended as it did.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I feel the key layouts for this keyboard like the com button and the number keyboard are well thought out. Good punctuations are also on the number keyboard. Some things I would like improved are more themes. Flow could be improved for sure as words with double letters such as &quot;too&quot; don't always come out right. Swype is still better in that sense. But the addition of flow has made this my go to keyboard since it has the Google Voice button on the front keyboard and uses Google Voice instead of third party software like Dragon. If give it 5 stars one those little tweaks get improved. JAMES Samsung GS3
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I found this book to be riveting. It was well written and seemed to have accurate information. I found many parts of the story surprising as I had very little previous perception of what went on in the silicon valley. The personal hygiene or lack there of concerning someone so incredibly intelligent was also a surprise.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|It works well, love it!! I have used this item more than once and it cleans and re-functions my cam.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It was an exciting, thrilling book! I simply could not set it down! It was both exciting and original!! I HIGHLY recommend it.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This CD stays playing in my car. It's a wonderful mix of tunes and has great balance. I recommend it highly!
B008J2GAKU|2.0|If your definition of success is to make Batman look incompetent. No detective work, continuously gets his ass kicked and the story isn't that good. I have to say this is among my least favorite Batman arcs ever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! very addictive and fast paced. Though the game gets over quickly, you are always wanting to play again to go ahead or complete challenges.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. Never has any problems and is extremely easy to use. The only downside is how quickly I can blow through cash on it. Lol.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This is a very cool model toy, I really like the open and close action of the jaw on the T-REX
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Phenomenal. This is a must see. The entire movie from start to finish makes all of Nolan's work look amature. Great job.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is addicting!  I play everyday and love that there is no end, just added challenges.<br />If you love pic search puzzles you'll like this.
B009POHHR6|4.0|When I first heard about this comic I was very hesitant to buy it. I had heard that Batman was russian too and thought I was going to be reading a book about a Russian justice league. But it's not. Batman has his place and it makes alot of sense within the context of the story. It's a little slow moving at times but i really enjoyed the ending.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Okay, maybe I'm a few brain cells short of the rest of the reviewers, but I liked it. I wasn't able to predict anything and I didn't believe it followed any formula. I liked how the ghost was presented, it gave this tale a sort of romance. All the actors did a remarkable job in their roles, too. Cheers, r
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Phenomenal. This is a must see. The entire movie from start to finish makes all of Nolan's work look amature. Great job.
B004CJ05FU|5.0|Somebody please tell me how One Tree Hill lasted seventeen thousand seasons and this intensely awesome show got cancelled? I adore this show, especially the dynamic between Seth and Ryan. I wish they would do a kickstarter movie to show what the characters have been up to.
B008JIWNYG|3.0|Despite this being volume 1, which I would expect to start with Green Lanter #1, I really feel like I missed something in this volume. I have no idea why Sinestro is back in the corp or why Hal is not. The story was pretty good other than that.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book until the end. The end was very abrupt and was \\"silly\\". It was a really good read until the last few pages. Hard to imagine why a finely crafted novel for 98% of a book goes south late in the game. Regardless, I recommend it with 4 stars. The novel has a good plot and the characters are portrayed in good style. The kindle price is good and you will feel rewarded.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I was asked to do a honest review of this book by the author. Megan is trying to start a new life, but she never dreamed starting it without her brother. She expects to live a peaceful life away from her abusive husban, but peaceful is not what she gets. Todd Jordan, Megans brothers best friend and business partner, knows how it feels to loose someone you love. Him and his family couldn't have asked for someone like Megan. I really enjoyed this book, It was a nice and easy read. I was enthralled from start to finish. If you enjoy comtemparary romance, then this is your book. I would like to say thanks to the author for allowing me to read and review this book. I hope to read the other books in this series soon!
193700788X|1.0|I have loved Sookie like so many other fans but the last two books have been very BAD! No romance at all. This last book had one last quick shag, but with the only other male in her life she has not shagged. What is up with that?  If this book had been if one of the first three books, we would all be asking Sookie who?
0307888908|5.0|This book avoids the traditional business self-help and professional development jargon-case study - checklist format. Instead, the authors focus on the singular, practical function of networking in today's market. The reviews criticizing the book as a poor professional How-to and research guide are partially correct -- there's near zero discussion of job search, interviewing, sales, etc.  While the case study examples (some of them self-serving Linkedin anecdotes) are unavoidable, they are far less painful than most management/job books inflict.
B00BKS1HIA|5.0|This book gives a thorough introduction into sock knitting with basic patterns for five different weights of sock yarn, each with five different sock sizes, then has chapters on &#34;Colour and Texture the Easy Way&#34;, &#34;Adding Your Own Colour and Texture&#34; and &#34;Cuff and Leg Variations&#34;.  It explains yarns, equipment, plus measuring your feet to work out your sock size then roughly how much yarn will be needed for the various sizes.<br />GSKS is my first foray into knitting socks; now I'm hooked and knitting my third pair.  It's an excellent book.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book made me think about all the lonely hearts out there looking for companionship and not knowing how to go about it.  I especially liked the flashbacks to the characters childhood.  The twist ending was my favorite part!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|If you like pop music, you'll enjoy this. It's got some great tracks and it runs the gamut of styles.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed watching Downton Abbey, I cannot wait for Season 3 to come available.  I would recommend this series to everyone!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love the message, love the beats, it's original and fun! Pleasantly surprised. I had to type in eight more words...
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love this show!  There is never a dull moment and you never know what is going to happen!  I am telling all my friends to watch.
B00138KKP8|5.0|Every song is a great emotion filled story. Ray is a beautiful soul! I enjoyed it from end to end.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was a very good movie.  My kind of movie to watch on a cool rainy day curling up on the couch with a light blanket
B0094M2ITG|5.0|I love the story, one day we will all be old and tell takes of our lives to our grandkids that will  be our legacy. Yes they will be tall tales to relive the best times of our lives. This story epitomizes the melancholy and joy of sharing those moments near the tail end of our lives.
1466216336|1.0|As noted by other reviewers, the version of The Royal Road to Card Magic sold by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform is cheaply produced and a terrible value. The images are all low resolution and enlarged to the point of illegibility. At points the text is missing or simply illegible. This seems to be unique to this version, by this seller.<br /><br /> Other versions such as this one  [[ASIN:B008Z1XMFQ Royal Road To Card Magic]] are printed correctly, feature legible illustrations and are less expensive.  While this version contains almost the same content as others, it is presented horribly. Do yourself a favor, get this from a seller that cares enough to edit their product at all.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Over rated and the special effects were over done and looked fake. Acting was not good and plot was not that engaging. I like first person narratives like \\"Big Fish\\" movie, this movie tried hard to be that movie but came across cheesey.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|I was not too happy with this movie. The plot was weak and the transition  for Sam could have been better. Still the same cast of characters but would love for the writers to watch the cartoon series for some inspiration.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Devouring all 3 books was so easy, and fulfilling. I would even say that with each book, I enjoyed it more than the one before (and I LOVED the 1st one)!!! I find myself comparing every book I've read since I finished these, and they always come up short. I dare you to read only one of these masterpieces. You won't be able to do it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Graphics are great, and it is challenging.  I love the fact that you can use your imagination and create your on reef.  It was AWSOME getting to include all the Nemo characters.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Got this for my daughter's Easter basket. Perfect condition, fast delivery, highly recommend! This movie is a different rendition of Snow White, it is very cute!
0470913029|2.0|I haven't actually read the book, yet, but was curious avout it. Just looking through it, it would not be something I would do for very long, if at all.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|This soundtrack is brilliantly put together. Modern with a perfect twist of jazz influence. Perfect compilation to the film itself.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I will start by saying I thought Tempest by Bob Dylan was going to be great going by reviews so imagine my surprise when the genius who created Positively Fourth Street and Like A Rolling Stone seemed gone!  Of course, many Dylan fans disagreed with me but as somebody who thinks early Dylan is absolute genius (and I don't use the word lightly) I was disappointed to say the least.. SO I START THAT WAY BECAUSE IN THIS CASE ROD I HOPE YOU SEE THIS HONEY THIS CD IS PHENOMENAL!!  Why? Well, to begin with you sound exactly like the Rod Stewart I adore who sang the heartbreaking I don't Want to Talk About It.  I cannot boast enough about this beautiful wonderful CD Time.  It rocks and it breaks your heart both.  The song Brighton Beach is so incredible and for me, floods in special memories and times.  It's Over is the best divorce song I ever heard.  Sexual Religion I loved it, sure women are more powerful, are you kidding me ,and thanks Rod for acknowledging that!  The cover song Time is phenomenal.  Can't Stop Me Now is inspirational and She Makes Me Happy is playful, hell, even Rod's cover of Here Comes The Night is even better than the original.  To say I highly recommend this CD is understated..if you love the Rod Stewart that gave us Maggie May he is still here alive and well in Time!  I cherish the cd and it's top on my driving list!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|If you want a graphic intense movie this is it. The visuals in the movie are AMAZING!!! The movie itself was good a well but watch this ONLY in Blu-ray as anything else will totally destroy the quality.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I love her books ! They are always quite thick books; so works great to have the book on my kindle instead of trying to stuff a big book in my purse !
B002MRRRAA|5.0|Got this as a gift for someone. Came boxed up nice and they loved it. Would recommend for any Nirvana fan.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I've been a Limp Bizkit fan for years.  Love the CD.<br /><br />If you are a fan you will like it.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|All 3 Bournes in one box. It’s time for a marathon!!!! Amazing set would love for there to be more to the series.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this because I have a 2 USB outlet in my kitchen. Love that its 5 ft long, as I have an older place with 1 outlet per wall (if that). Charges quickly and travels nicely.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Got this as a gift for someone. Came boxed up nice and they loved it. Would recommend for any Led Zeppelin fan.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I'm already a fan of Angry Birds, and when I got my Kindle Fire and found out that Angry Birds in Space was free, I had to have it. Hasn't disappointed
B002ZG981E|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. My parents for some reason don’t have an HD TV so I gave them the DVD, I kept the Blu-Ray and watched the digital copy on my iPad. Leo is fantastic in it. Highly recommend to anyone into suspenseful movies as this one will keep you on your toes.
193700788X|2.0|Brought to you by OBS reviewer Heidi<br /><br />*Beware of possible SPOILERS*<br /><br />Dead Ever After is the final full-length novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  In this one Sookie's relationship with Eric is still uncertain, but it doesn't look good, especially with him spending all of his time away from her.  And,  honestly he's still pretty steamed about Sookie saving Sam's life instead of fixing his situation.<br /><br />Arlene is out of jail thanks to one of Sookie's enemies in a plot to see her spend the rest of her life in jail.  But that's not the only scheme brewing to end Sookie once and for all.  But none of her enemies took the loyalty of Sookie's friends into consideration when making their plans.  Sookie is once again hunting for a killer, but this time it's to clear her name of a murder she didn't commit!<br /><br />Honestly, I knew going into this book that I wouldn't be happy, but I had to see this series through to the end, no matter what!  I love Eric and hate seeing how much Harris has changed his character over the last couple of books and despise how things are ended between Sookie and him.  I'm not as angry as I thought I would be and,  I don't think that this was necessarily a bad book, but overall it just made me..... sad.  There is no other word to describe it.<br /><br />I just feel that if Harris had never intended for Sookie and Eric to end up together, then she never should have built up such a great and swoon-worthy relationship between them.  Their growing love compromised a majority of the series and it was a huge let down to see that their love couldn't conquer all.  And, honestly the love that prevailed just didn't seem as good as the one Sookie lost.  I didn't feel a spark between her and her new love, in fact I felt this character was more fatherly than lover; even in this installment where I felt was the time to drive home that heat and passion that just wasn't there.  I think this love should have been built up more over time if we fans were to ever believe in this couple.  Instead, Harris gave us a wonderful romance to trash it at the end and break all of  our hearts, and it seems I'm more broken-hearted over it than even Sookie is. I did have a feeling during the first book of the series, Dead Until Dark, that she would end up with this person, but I had hoped that Harris had changed her mind, as authors sometimes do.  But sadly that was not to be the case with this series<br /><br />I'm glad that this series has come to a close. I just wish it had ended on a happier and more upbeat note.  There were so many better ways to end it, my personal favorite was Sookie using the cluviel dor to turn Eric human and eliminating the vampire marriage issue and also giving them the ability to have kids.  But that was not to be.  My heart does ache a bit for the death of the relationship that we Sookie fans have all come to love and count on.  I just feel that Eric (and all of the fans) deserved so much better than this ending.  This book was truly unlucky number 13.<br /><br />Now I can only hope Eric and Sookie have a happier ending on True Blood.<br /><br />This review and more at openbooksociety dot com
B004UPANAI|4.0|I loved the original X-Men trilogy and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine; but never got to see this one in the theaters. Debating whether or not to rent it of get the DVD when released. Well, I finally decided to buy the DVD and where I like this movie (it IS good) it just doesn't have that same 'excitment&#34; that was present in the three (+ one) X-MEN movies. Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable movie and the special feature shows everything that they did to make it a bigger and better film as it concentrated on one character. But something was lost in the production. Maybe over time, I'll have a better opinion of it; but for now, it's enjoyable but just not one I'd want to see again and again and again.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I find this a relaxing time waster...we all need a little kickback time! Love to play this in late evening. Great game!
B000KIPT30|5.0|We use this to plug in multiple set of wireless in ear monitors and it helps so much. It boost the signal coming from the click track and anything else we run into the channel. It's helped us a lot.
B005OMOKN2|4.0|Not much else to say, it is the Nikon battery.  It works really well and is an inexpensive replacement that allows you to keep shooting.  Cannot imagine NOT having a back up battery.  Especially on vacation.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|*********SPOILERS WITHIN**************<br /><br />The ending of this series is a major let down to say the very least. Does anyone else get the feeling they have been played by Miss Harris? Looking at all the reviews I can see I am not alone in this. The storyline just falls flat. I mean the premise makes no sense. A man makes a deal with A devil (not THE devil, mind, WTF?) sells his soul for one wish, his one wish is that this devil steal an object that allows him to make a wish (he wants his relationship with his daughter mended). Say whaaaaat? I am so not picking up what you are putting down Charlaine.<br /><br />As regards the HEA, Im still trying to grasp just how exactly this happened....a Sam HEA is just SO damn out of the blue...I think I would have found a Quinn HEA more believable at this point. As an Eric/Sookie shipper I feel like the last 5 books were just filler designed to get the legions of Eric lovers buying the books. If Sam was CH's intended HEA all along why on earth wasnt he introduced as a love interest before the last 100 pages of the last book out of a 13 books series?? He has ALWAYS been in the best friend/boss zone. Nothing in Sookies narrative has hinted toward anything else.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about who she ended up with, how about those she did not end up with....this is just as upsetting, if not more, than who the HEA is.<br />Eric. Strong, beautiful, smart, loyal Eric is shipped off to The Queen to be a sex slave for 200 years. Forced to give up his whole life. And not just for 100 years as was required, but 200 so as to ensure that Sookie is left well and truly alone. Seems like a very sweet and loving gesture from him doesnt it? Submitting himself to an extra 100 years in the name of protecting Sookie? But NO. Just NO. CH couldnt even throw us that bone. She had Pam make sure Sookie knew it wasnt a loving gesture, meerly Eric showing he looks after what used to be his. How noble. Thanks for the slap in the face Ch.<br /><br />Bill Compton, resident Bon Temps rapist is even given a happier ending. Life long friend and confident to his rape victim. WTF Charlaine???!!! This just blows my mind! And what was with all the narrative on cooking and eating? Its the FINAL book in a much loved series, what are you thinking putting so much filler in it??<br /><br />I truly feel like the author resents her Eric fans. She herself has said she wonders if people are reading the same thing she is writing and that she doesnt understand the fuss made about Eric.  My honest opinion? She was forced to write beyond her intended story(she wanted to end this series at least 4 books ago) and mainly about a character she had no feeling toward(Eric). She's gone back to her intended storyline (Sam as HEA) despite the fact that it doesnt fit anymore. This last book is a thumbed nose to those who have sustained her career for the last decade. Its a \\"Ha this is MY series, these are MY characters and LOOK I can do what I damn well please with them\\". Yes, yes you can do what you want, and the fact that you have, and have executed it in such a way only shows me that you do not appreciate your fans and all they have done for you. Do I sound entitled? pfft, maybe I do, but I dont care.<br /><br />Perhaps some authors need to take a leaf out of Nora Roberts book, who eloquently said \\"The characters belong to the writer.....but the characters become the reader's when the reader opens the books. And she has every right to get as angry as she wants, as happy as she wants. When a large group of readers agree, the smart writer needs to listen, and consider. Just as she listened to her editor, and considered.\\" I couldnt agree more with this statement, I think authors totally disregard fans and readers by saying \\"they are MY characters, they are My books\\". If you feel so selfish about 'your' world and 'your' characters, then why share them with us in the first place? why write in a manner that makes us feel as though we know and love these characters and are invested financially and emotionally in the outcome. Make up your minds, you either want us invested and buying into your world, or you don't, in which case you have no career. Either way I think us readers are entitled to a little more respect from certain authors.<br /><br />Thats it, rant over, Im done with this series and its author. Never again Charlaine Harris, thanks for the awesome world and the awesome characters, but never again. Good luck to you.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not Grisham's normal style, but still had trouble putting it down.  As always, he holds your attention and at the end I was happy.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This was an excellent book. It is really good for readers who like books like Harry Potter, The Benedict Society, and books like that. This book is good for readers who are starting to read big  chapter books. Great book!

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|action packed  I did not know if it would be good cause in the book  Reacher is much bigger guy but it worked
1451695195|5.0|This was a gift for a nephew. I have not gotten with him to let you all know  about the book.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Surprised and delighted is what turned out to be, when we finished watching this movie. The cinematography is downright majestic, and the acting mostly specially good. What a story! It seems that Jay Moriarity was an outstanding human being, with a passion for the sea only known to true surfers. The acting in this movie is right on cue and well worth enjoying. There is something to be said about these waves, but I believe that seeing them is the best way. Mother nature manifests itself with tremendous impact when it comes to mavericks, places in the world where these gigantic waves appear. I know that in Peru, in a place called Pico Alto, there is a wave that many of the sturdiest surfers from around the world, challenge once a year, or at least it used to be.<br />Whatever configuration creates these monsters, only the few selected can hope to venture in and remain unscathed, and one can only imagine the stamina and strength required to challenge these waves.<br />Truly a very fun time at the movies, in the comfort of your warm or air conditioned home, being witness to the kind of people that Frosty and Jay are, a breed apart to be sure! 4.5 Stars!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|John le Carre is brilliant at describing the internal thoughts and emotions of his characters. Some say his books move too slowly, that there isn't enough action. I believe his work is a much more accurate portrayal of what life in the intelligence and counterterrorism fields is actually like (plus I know some folks who corroborate le Carre's accounts). This book raises very serious questions about the involvement of non-governmental entities in matters properly restricted to sovereign governments. The tension builds throughout the book to the very last page.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|It will stay with you for awhile, quite violent, but without too much realism in the gore.  If you like mythology, you'll like this one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|An addictive game with good graphics even on my simple 6'' tablet. Whilst I did find my way around the screens more help information would have proved useful. All in all a good game and all free!
B001NAT05W|5.0|I love this movie I think it is the best movie well best catwoman movie out there I love watching it and Im glad I bought it
B007CW2FIE|5.0|These recordings are at the same fine stellar level normally associated with Pinnock.  I have not heard finer.  This is definitely a required purchase for Baroque and Vivaldi lovers.  The period instrument sound with Pinnock and the English Concert is pleasant and charming without the harsh and strident flavor imparted by some of his contemporaries.<br /><br />It is disappointing that Archiv did not provide full and proper track information on all discs, choosing to list only movement names  (\\"Allegro\\" for instance) for entire CDs without even mentioning  the concerto names.  Between the booklet and the back of the box, there is enough information to reconstruct a catalogue in iTunes, but it was a significant amount of work.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love jigsaw puzzles, and this one is pretty good.  Not too many puzzles included, though. Then you have to pay for additional
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is pretty good.my name is kyle.you can get dragons I will name some plant dragon earth dragon cold dragon  lightning dragon fire dragon also I have to watch seasame street because my little brother
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was a great movie and I loved how they come together for one goal. I would recommend this movie to people ages 17 and up.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For anyone interested in or skeptical of near-death experiences, this is a must-read.  The fact that this man's experience differed in some ways from the more usual accounts actually makes his argument more compelling, as does his intimate knowledge of neurology.  Between his understandable preoccupation with stressing the neurological reasons that his experience is valid and his account of his family's reaction to his deep comma and almost certain death, the flow of the account is awkward at times, but this book is a serious contribution to the debate over the reason for existence and the possibility of an afterlife.
193413712X|4.0|We read it for our Book Club... great discussion about relationships between men of three generations.  Interesting weaving into the discussion how important our relatiosnhip with nature is compared to mechanicaly things... like clocks and time.
B003XT60KO|4.0|I'm not sure if this book helped me get an &#34;A&#34; in Economics or was it from having a good Professor.  At first I thought this book was a little one-sided, but after getting half way through the book I realized it helped me understand the basic concept of Economics. I would recommend this book to someone wanting to know about economics.
B00BF11STU|4.0|A likley very accurate account of the struggle to find Osama Bin Laden.  A well done movie.  We enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series, and Catching Fire is a wonderful part 2 to the Hunger Games. If you're debating reading this series, I recommend you stop debating and just read it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The movie is well done and well narrated.  It has parts that are both action but also makes yo think.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|it is a great game  i have enjoyed it very much  very interesting  the slots game is very interesting and easy to play
B001C3L32I|5.0|Growing up, we had a electric green Pymouth station wagon with a cassette player and one summer, driving around the woods and lakes of northern Minnesota, my dad played this cassette.  Ever since, the etheral, mystic quality of this album has been one of my favorites.  For me, it has held up over the years and still has a magical quality that life today seems to be sorely lacking.  I'm sure this isn't the music for everyone, but if you know and love one or two of these songs, it is likely you will enjoy the rest.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app every day. It does what it's suppose to do and it works every time. What more could you ask for?
B005FITIDC|5.0|This was a great movie!  The message of the movie is really amazing how someone can have such compassion for the people in other parts of the world.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Addictive game but you also have to have patience it will keep you from spending your money and enjoying this free app.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|red country lives up to its name with plenty of flowing blood and interesting characters to keep you wnating to turn the page to see what happens next!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Not for the average viewer, as it has violence and dives into people's motivations through the different storylines.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoy watching it and we even rewatch as you pick up more nuances.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|The director does a great job of capturing the hilarity of the mundane throughout this film. The always-present struggle with the fragility of life, of death, of how quickly life moves (particularly observable for adults with children, who serve as permanent bench marks of age) is part of the comedy of This Is 40.<br /><br />We laughed. A lot.<br /><br />My wife and I related to the scenes. There's a Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus element at work in the film, where husband and wife communication just looks downright laughable at times.<br /><br />I'm not sure the movie resolves in clear way, and this was the part of the movie I failed to get the most. Most Rom-Com's have a problem/resolution element, and though there was a resolved problem, it wasn't clear exactly what that was all about.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I wish I had read this book 15 years ago.  It validates many of my own experiences as a career women of 20 years.  I could have better articulated the concepts in this book sooner, as a mentor of both women and men, who mentor women.  Sheryl has definitely hit upon and articulated many of the reasons that women don't advance to senior positions.  She is not taking away that organizations and our culture still have to change, but rather focusing on what we, as individual women and men, can do to improve the odds and better understand ourself and how we react to the culture we are in.  Hats off to her taking the time to make this happen.  Please have all your executives read this books so that we can start acting more to counterbalance the reality and make the next break through for the next generation.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I enjoyed The Phoenix Project very much and smiled numerous times while experiencing a bit of deja vu.<br /><br />Gene has put together an excellent story that is very easy to read and should be mandatory reading - amongst others that cover core concepts - by all IS/IT practitioners who aren't quite as long in the tooth as myself.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've read the books and wondered how they were going to get all the storylines, etc. into the series.  They may not have covered it all, but it has been outstanding and elegantly done.  Excellent acting and complicated storylines with great visuals make it a rich experience that you can view several times and enjoy each time as you pick up new nuances.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|If Angels could make music, it would sound something like this. Truly incredible. I had never heard of them before this, but am so glad i decided to give this a shot. I havnt heard a album this good for a long time. Poetry in rythem from start to finish.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Good acting, good storylines, good visuals.  If you like the prohibition era and want to see it come alive, then watch this series, however, it is not for everyone as it has violance and portrays the time period with accuracy (which is not always pretty).
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I enjoyed reading this but it had been awhile since reading the last. My only complaint was the mention of an important incident/character from the previous book without really explaining it. Later in the book it was discussed in a little more detail that triggered my memory but still it had been frustrating.<br /><br />I would give this a higher rating but I find I don't get as lost in Archer's stories as I do Follett's. This series reminds me of Follett's latest trilogy but not on as grand or detailed a scale.<br /><br />Good, quick read. The cliffhanger really isn't one, as it seems predictable, though I may be wrong. I guess we'll see...
B009EANE3M|3.0|I like the number &#34;3&#34; and thought I'd give their new album a try considering how much I had liked them in the past.  I stopped listening to them for a while because they reminded me of a relationship I had.  Not a bad album.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|This book has been out for quite some time but I was drawn to read it after my brother suggested it. He had had a chance meeting with Simpson and they talked about his, Simpson's, experience. My brother asked if I had read the book. I hadn't but had read and been intrigued by Krakauer's &#34;Into Thin Air&#34; so immediately I got &#34;Touching the Void.&#34; What an incredible story. And to think he went back to climbing! Definitely motivational and inspiring!
B0071FBARY|3.0|Not bad.  I kinda liked the songs.  Haven't listened to it much.  It was very low priced and that's why I bought it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I thought that it was to drawn out. Got bored before ending and yet I like Harry Bosch novels and read some of them twice.
193700788X|3.0|The best thing I can say about this book is it is readable.  SVM's go down easy and are fun.  This one is no different.  That's why I'm giving 3 stars.<br /><br />Full disclosure:  I was hoping Sook would end up someone in particular.  So, that didn't happen.  Ok, I have my big girl panties on.  Fine. I still bought the book and hoped for a mostly satisfactory conclusion.  What I read was a rushed, not overly coherent, short book.  I think Ms. Harris was over Sookie before this book was started.<br /><br />I'm sorry for it because I was really looking forward to the book.  Even after the leaked ending.  *sigh*
0345803507|5.0|I could not put them down once I started reading the first of the three books.  Great books and can't wait for the movie.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this app is so fun you get to design people hair I'm any way you want I no u think it sounds boring bit it isn't
0439023513|4.0|I am normally leery of fiction that is too popular.  (I'm thinking of you \\"Twilight\\").  I finally got around to reading this series and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  The writing is young-adult level but clear.  Sometimes the book is silly.  If you were leading three squadrons of advanced fighter-jets and two teenagers standing in the open started shooting at you with explosive arrows don't you think that you might shoot back?  You get the idea.  The book is not that all that deep but a fun read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Wonderful game. Highly addictive...recommend it for someone who enjoys mystery or crime solving. My child even enjoyed it. Loved the story plot.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|it was a fun way to waste time.It was a great love movie for a rainy day. I would def watch it again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great story, all of her books are worth reading, all of the series she has done. The ending was perfect and cleared up a lot of things.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome can't wait to read the next book.I hear it's the best one yet that is why I can't wait
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I could never see this movie enough times to really enjoy the filmaking and dialog that goes with it.  Truly an amazing movie, with so many life stories that are told.  It brings me closer to the REAL LIFE prisoners and their heartfelt thoughts while being there.  Will watch again.  I loved the honesty and true frienship that this move depicts.  Very good movie!
B000001ESJ|4.0|Great music- this brings back so many great memories in my younger life -i had to purchase moving pictures too ♥
B002S45V32|5.0|Never in a movie is there so much wisdom, love, fear, hate, acceptance, and an overall freedom to really be who you are and not what peers want or think of you.  Very inspiring to teens who think everyone must live up to their reputations.  They need to know as a teen to cope with the others is to not change who they are, but to stand tall and be proud...PERIOD!  Much recommended for teens and families in helping the teen years to not be overwhelming, but embarrassed.  Very good movie, recommend highly!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Everyone remembers their first Doctor.<br /><br />I hadn't paid much attention to Doctor Who since Tom Baker's departure. Several years back, I remember reading a brief article in a 2005 Time magazine about the 'new' Doctor and his forthcoming return but I had no access to the series and forgot about it. Then last year I found a great deal on the the Sixth Series in Blu-ray, bought it and was blown away. Shortly thereafter, I found a similar deal on the Fifth Series in Blu-ray and was blown away. Found the Complete Specials of the 10th Doctor's closing tenure in Blu-ray and was blown away.<br /><br />Enough, I thought. Start at the beginning. But there weren't any Blu-ray releases. Why not? I did the research and -- duh -- found prior entries were not 'filmed' in HD. So, well, DVD was about as high def as it was going to be. Well, technically, European PAL (625 lines) has more resolution than American NTSC (525 lines) so there is a case for upverting to 1080 and releasing on Blu-ray as done partially on the Complete Specials.<br /><br />Broadcast image quality issues aside, this series is a solid reboot of the series! To be sure, the series has its ups and downs with most installments better than others, This series sets the stage for what follows and does it quite admirably.<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of Paul McGann's little known but very notable 8th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston's 9th Doctor breathes new credibility, vitality and integrity into the long-lived series. A great achievement and fun entertainment. I can finally see why the Time article was so positive about Eccleston and the reboot.<br /><br />No need to hesitate. Trust him. He's the Doctor.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|SIMON BAKER IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACTORS AROUND TODAY.  THIS SHOW IS FUN AND IS A GREAT SHOWCASE FOR HIS TALENTS AS BOTH DIRECTOR AND ACTOR.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE TO COME OUT ON DVD AND I HAVE ALREADY PRE-ORDERED IT.
B001LF347E|1.0|My wife has a lower tolerance for fiddling with classic stories than I do, so when we started to watch the first episode, I found myself trying to defend it, feeling she'd not given it a fair break. By the end of the second episode (and by now I was watching alone), I realized she was just more perceptive than I.<br /><br />From excising critical plot elements like Uther's death and Arthur's sojourn at Ector's home, to anachronisms like neatly-printed signs on the wall, this was cringe-worthy from the git-go.<br /><br />Let's revisit Merlin's arrival, for example.  He walks up to a couple of guards and asks for the Court Physician. One grunts and points through the door they're (nominally) guarding, although they make no effort to find out who he is or why he wants to go through the door, so I'm not sure what they're doing can be called \\"guarding\\" (the grunt is presumably to avoid having to pay union scale for a speaking part). Upon entering the indicated passage, Merlin sees a very modern-looking sign that says \\"Court Physician.\\" Why put a sign (as though people in Arthurian times were mostly literate!) *inside* the hallway that leads to the Physician's quarters?  After all, if you're already in the hallway, you're heading there anyway.<br /><br />The first time Merlin hears the voice of the dragon (penned beneath the castle; apparently the series' writers were not aware that \\"Pendragon\\" comes from the Welsh meaning \\"great dragon\\" ie \\"great leader,\\" not \\"he who penned the dragon.\\" 30 seconds on Google will bring you to this fact, but they apparently couldn't be bothered), he somehow figures out where the voice is coming from and decides to follow it.  He uses obvious magic to move the guards' dice into the shadows; each time the guard reaches for the dice, they skitter a little further away, prompting both guards to follow them. Oddly, despite this obviously magickal movement, it occurs to neither of them to scream bloody murder, or notice they're being led away from their posts. *sigh*<br /><br />Merlin swipes a torch, sneaks down to the cavern, has a chat with the dragon, then... We never see how he sneaks back out past the guards, nor how he gets down to see the dragon again (several times). Sooner or later the guards are going to figure out something is hinky with their dice if it keeps happening, but after that first time Merlin seems to be able to waltz down to have frustrated chats with the dragon at will.<br /><br />Despite a prohibition on magic that carries a death sentence, Merlin uses his magic to save Gaius' life and keep himself from a beating, both times in what looks like pretty blatant ways. He later uses it to hide a book of spells in what seems an unnecessarily risky way--pulling a blanket over the book, rather than pushing the book under something. The searcher is much more likely to see a whole blanket moving than to see the book slither out of sight, especially since the book is on the far side of the bed from the searcher, but Merlin chooses to move the blanket. If you're going to take that kind of chance, why not just whip the book up to the ceiling? This level of incompetence in hiding his powers makes me wonder how Merlin survived more than about twenty minutes, let alone manage to grow to young-adulthood.<br /><br />The court physician can mix antidotes for snakebite if he just has access to the original venom, people of obviously African descent are unremarkable, everyone and everything is amazingly clean, the windows are full of glass (seriously?), and the architecture looks like something from the Renaissance. I don't mind that kind of mixture at a Ren Faire (as a friend of mine put it Ren Faires are for people who \\"think the Renaissance is everything pre-Beatles\\"), but I can't stomach it in an allegedly period piece.<br /><br />Plot holes, anachronisms, and wild departures from anything resembling classic Arthuriam mythos just made this unpalatable. Countless writers have taken a swing at interpreting the Arthurian Cycle, some (Marion Zimmer Bradley, Jack Whyte, Mary Stewart) quite good, and where they strayed from the myth they either did so in ways that didn't abuse the myth, or they strayed far enough that it was clear they were trying something pretty different.  This version is smack dab in the middle of the Uncanny Valley.<br /><br />I made it through two episodes. I almost stopped watching when a tournament contender showed up called \\"Knight Valiant,\\" but decided to watch the rest of the episode--I have no one to blame for that but myself.<br /><br />If the writers had created a fantasy series out of whole cloth, rather than trying to co-opt the Arthurian legend, a lot of my criticisms would be defused. Design a fantasy world, even call it \\"Albion,\\" and run with the plotlines and relationships they used, and this would have been something I could have dealt with--maybe even enjoyed--but as it is, I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather than spending my hard-earned gold on it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille gives the reader a lot to think about. I'm hoping it's all made up. But it seems to be too closely correlated to today's news to be all fiction. If this is a glimpse into what really goes on in the Middle East,....more than scary.
B000W1W9EW|4.0|I heard Nick Drake talked about on NPR and all comments said this was one of his best, I wholeheartedly agree, a great album from a great artist.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awsome best game I have ever played. Everyone should play dungeon hunter 4 and 5 . Highly recommended but takes up about a gig, totally worth it.

0143122061|5.0|This is a very informative and important book.<br />I bought copies for my grandson and my son.<br />I recommend that everyone read it.

0307744434|3.0|My book arrived as promised in great condition, but I found the story to be unbelieveable, even for fantasy.  No character development and a weak ending.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|I cant stand it when they say a game is free, but you cant actually win it without purchasing anything. it is also very stupid that one of the characters cost 50 bucks. what a rip off!
B005PK1G76|5.0|After tons of research, I was happy to find this stroller organizer.  It's a great price and works well!  The bottle holders are stretchy to accommodate most bottle sizes.  The zipper pocket on the inside is an added bonus!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|it was okay but still kinda left you hanging at the end. Plus there was a little jumping around and I got confused for a part of it.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|The Season 1 finale of Once Upon a Time left every fan questioning: what will come next? It was a shocking moment none of us expected. The curse had been broken, at the end of the first Season. Even more shocking - the arrival of magic in Storybrooke. It was uncertain what direction the show would take in the future, leaving many counting down the days leading up to the Season 2 premiere. I was among those eagerly anticipating the shows second season, and I am pleased to say that not only did the new season meet my expectations - it far exceeded them.<br /><br />The season begins by thrusting us right back where the Season 1 finale left off, picking up moments after the previous episodes ending point. From there, we have a thrilling ride full of many twists and turns, one that pushes the show to new heights of intrigue, drama, emotion, and wonder. Magic plays a key role in this season as the inhabitants of Storybrooke - and indeed, the outside world - come to terms with what it means and how it affects the people that it touches. In particular, Regina and Rumpelstiltskin see a great deal of personal dilemma and growth from the return of magic, leading to much of the seasons well plotted and excellently paced drama. Regina's attempts to win Henry over with magi and Rumpelstilzkin's relationship with Belle and his search for his lost son take much of the center stage for the first half of the season - leading into a second half that introduces us to a new threat that could very well spell the end of our beloved Storybrooke and all who inhabit it. There is far too much detail in this season to summarize further the events that take place, nor would I try to - this season is something far better experienced firsthand, and I look greatly forward to rewatching it in the future to experience the ride once more.<br /><br />On the negative spectrum - many of the side characters lose focus in this season as we are thrust more and more into the trials of the main cast. Expectto see a great deal of Emma, Snow, Charming, Regina, Henry, Gold, Belle, etc. while seeing much less of some fan favorites such as the Mad Hatter, August, and so on. Much of this season's focus is on the ongoing drama in Storybrooke, and so fans of the first season's style of introducing us to a new fairy tale character and their Storybrooke counterpart each week may be disappointed in this change of story focus.<br /><br />That's not to say there aren't new characters, though - and fortunately, the new characters this season introduces are well written and not thrust into significance too quickly. Almost every new character has a gradual introduction and buildup into the shows formula so excellently paced that you hardly realize that a mere three or four episodes prior, you had only just first met them. In particular, I very much found myself enjoying the storyline surrounding the mysterious Neal and his past relationships with Emma - both of which come to play a critical role in a way that is unexpected, but welcome. In addition, we gain new villians this season - and though I won't name them for the sake of keeping spoilers to a minimal, I found it fun to have new bad guys to be rooting against. The method in which their discovery was handled reminded me of the early days of Season 1 where Emma would be trying to one up Regina, something that was very much welcome.<br /><br />The remaining negatives are minor - a few major characters from Season 1, Ruby and August in particular, get glazed over and thrust into the background midway through the season, and a few important moments feel rushed for the sake of keeping up with the ever growing complexity of the plotlines. Aside from those complaints, however, I find myself unable to recall anything about this season that truly caused me to dislike it. All in all, this is a fine followup to Season 1, and a strong setup for Season 3 and (hopefully) beyond. And with that in mind, the season ends on a very strong note, introducing us to a new (and much anticipated!) world that will play a critical role in Season 3, setting up a new group of villians and briefly introducing us to their goals, and - most importantly, in my eyes - keeping us eager to see what happens next.<br /><br />I would highly reccomend this season to any who watched and enjoyed the first. And if you enjoyed Season 1 or 2 as much as I did - BUY THE DVD/BLU RAY OF THIS SEASON!!! Support this show and hopefully it will have a long, healthy, thrilling life that we can all enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a really good book. It had a good story line, like it could have been based on a true story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series. The actors and actresses are superb.  I have not watched a more entertaining and engaging series in a long, long time. If you love period pieces then you will surely love this but you don't necessarily have to be a Pride and Prejudice fan or a Sense and Sensibility fan to appreciate this marvelous story.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|Step Up Revolution is the best in the series, the dance is more modern and real, not just break dancing, this is all about dance and choreography with a slice of theatre.  Loved it and really liked the storyline.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series ever!!!  The cast is perfect, the wardrobe divine, the acting amazing, and the content<br />really interesting.  I love it and don't want it EVER to end.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The worst book of his i have read. By far.  Too bad as I like his writing. The story was week and political and the smart mouth of the main character got old fast.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I really enjoy getting to know the characters more and more with each episode.  Each episode brings in a new character that often impacts the whole town in some way. Very entertaining.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I'm usually a slow reader, but I got this one done in only a few days.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I bought this(kindle edition) on 5/10...today is 5/13...<br /><br />On 5/10 it was 9.99$<br /><br />5/13 it is 3.99$<br /><br />AHHHHHH!!!! WHYYYY???<br /><br />I feel upset that i  spent 6 more dollars but it's whatever. I know I'm not entitled to knowing when a company will put it's products on sale but this just goes to show ya, there's always a chance buying something full price could end up upsetting you in just a couple days.<br /><br />As for the book I'm only half-way and it really is one of the greats. I highly suggest to anyone who hasn't read it to buy this book right now! If nothing else you'll find it entertaining.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this book.  It has one of the best opening first page I've read in a long while. From there i was hooked.<br /><br />It is a wise story, holding the tension of the journey so that you are compelled to read and you can't guess the outcome.<br /><br />I loved Harold.  He just did the best he could.<br /><br />A very touching and human story we can relate to in our own experience.
B0061QD82E|5.0|The quality of this video is fantastic. I first saw this movie when as was in elementary school and I still enjoy watching it.
193700788X|1.0|Sloppy and lazy.  Im going to read some fan-fiction to try and wipe the memory of this book from my mind.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its amazing for homework and checking problems with math... even though were not allowed. I love the history, the easy to read letters, and its free. I just don't like the adds. Other than that its a great app. Buy it now!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its an awesome game but the ads are so annoying and it always does weird things and slows down but other than that the game is fun but TOO MANY ADS!!!!!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I wouldn't say that this was the best book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, but it certainly is an enjoyable read.  It reads a bit like the who's who of Sookie's life. We get visits from all sorts of characters we've read about over the years, friends and foes.  I have read several other reviews criticizing Sookie's lack of growth, but I think if you look back over the years the girl has learned a lot about love and life. Overall, I was quite pleased with the ending and think it rings true to Sookie's character throughout. Also, if you've been paying attention I don't think Sookie's choices will be all that suprising to you.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My roomate loves this stuff but I am not sure what to think yet, so far so good. I just dont understand him sometimes
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Great show! I love it so, I bought this for my grandparents for an xmas gift and they are now addicted!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|For my sister! She really likes this artist, so it was a perfect gift for her. She loved it so much.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is a very handy app. This can can replace the flash-drive transfer that we all have been doing. It is easy to set up and works well. Remeber to copy the file and paste it in Dropbox if you want to leave a copy on the original machine.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|If you love the big bang theory already or want to give them a try, this is the season to start with! Sheldon and the boys all have girlfriends and it causes some great new laughs!
B009NY43NY|3.0|The entire book read as if the story was second to making sure every loose end was tied up and every character in the series brought back. Sorry, but the end was anti-climatic and disappointing.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Though I am am not looking for a diet to lose weight I had noticed two years ago that overall I feel better when I avoid excessive consumption of wheat. I enjoyed reading this book and getting a better understanding of how wheat has changed and how it's consumption is linked with many health issues that impact myself, my friends, and my family. It makes you really want to evaluate what you eat. Good informative book!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have loved all the book, until this one. Very disappointed in the ending. I won't say what or why, but not what I would have ever anticipated for Sookie, Eric, Sam, Pam, and the rest of our Bon Temps crew. Once again, just ....... Disappointed.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I own many weather apps but this is the one I use the most as it is more detailed than any of the others. Suggest this one of all the others I own.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I just started and the implementation of chains and blades makes twice as fun and challenging 5 out of 5
0062082353|5.0|Good gracious, this book was very much appreciated by my husband who is interested in this time in America's time.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Shipping was good. My family really enjoyed this movie. My kids have watched this movie several times and found it to be very funny.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was so much, too much! Full of breathtaking drama, to the point when Anastasia was tired, I was actually fatigue too! Excellent read. I can't imagine it getting any better...
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Shipping was fast. My family really enjoyed this movie. My kids have watched it several times already. Can't wait for the next one.
141694737X|5.0|I was pleased with this little board book. I'd only seen the original version and wondered how it would be in a smaller/harder board style. Still just as cute and a great little story. I gave it as a baby shower gift, but I would like a copy for my kids too.
1439190275|4.0|My doctor put me on Atkins to help lower my lipid levels. It's quite easy to follow<br />the meal plans and keep track of the carbs consumed daily. Also having a carb counter book<br />is a big help.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I knew Tina Fey was smart! I had to look up at least three words. This read was fun and light even when discussing political or thoughtful topics. I think she could honest to goodness produce at least one of her woman-over-40 movie ideas (Note: Wedding crasher), and there must be a way to prove the merits of apple butter, one of this great nation's best concoctions, in sketch form.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Judging by the promos for the movie made from this book, I thought for sure the story was going to be packed with suspense. But I was disappointed to find out that it wasn't. And, in other Nicholas Sparks' stories, the endings are not always happy or predictable...but alas this one took the route of the typical romance novel.
B008MMFBQQ|5.0|First five by ISB are among the acoustic worlds best ever. Simply awesome songwriting. Ignore imbeciles who cannot tolerate occasional atonality in vocals, actually very listenable and magical. A must set.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could NOT out this book (Kindle) down. Gillian Flynn weaves an intricate psychological thriller and I especially liked the way the chapters switch back and forth between the points of view of the two main characters. And what a twist at the end. I like to pride myself in being able to solve the many a who-dun-it, but this totally threw me for a loop. I cannot wait to read Flynn's other two novels. Awesome storyteller!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Bobby Bowden the host of other people liked this is global warming up the host a good mood for the pictures I have a good French president Nicolas Sarkozy and girls who are not allowed to be a good French president Nicolas Sarkozy's and girls are not be able the pictures of a size have really
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This doc is great in taking the viewer on a tour of the history of Sound City recording studio - Its humble beginings, its ups and downs, and finally its demise. You will be amazed at the number of hit records created there throught the years - records by bands spanning several generations. You will learn about  the people who made it go - some of the artists and that famous Neve board and drum sound. It's all very interesting to hear the inside stuff. SOme great classic footage and great interviews with the starts that recorded there.<br /><br />Along the way though the story evolves - while it is about Sound CIty it becomes a story of real musicians making real music. Musicians who work together and collaborate and make music together, playing instruments. It gets a bit nostalgic but in all of the right ways. The idea is that music isn't supposed to be perfect and it isn't supposed to be created by a single person sitting alone behind a computer screen.<br /><br />Dave Grohl, has made a great documentary and has evolved into a true Rock and Roll hero. His heart, honesty, and human-ness show in this story. THanks Dave - I truely enjoyed Sound City (so much so that I ran out and bought the cd).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. It sucked me in and I couldn't stop reading. I might just read it again and again.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Just because a series doesn't conclude with the way you wanted it to does not mean it sucked.  This was a good book and the ends were tied up neatly.  When authors are forced to continue writing or are told not to write off certain characters, well that is the publishers fault not the author. Charlaine Harris delivered 13 books and still was able to keep readers interested and wanting more.  This book really ended the series well.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I am only sorry I did not discover this awesome tool earlier!!!  I got this as the &#34;free app of the day&#34; but I can tell you that this works so well, I feel a little guilty not paying for it......well OK that's a little much, free is always great.  Seriously though, this is working on all my XP, Win7 systems as well as Galaxy Note 2 phone and ASUS tablet....no issues at all!  Great tool to have at your disposal.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This artist and album is unlike anything you've ever heard before and its almost impossible to describe but you'll know it when you hear it. The tracks range from slow tempo to catchy hooks and almost hypnotizing beats that you'll want to keep hearing over and over because you just cant get them out of your head. The production on this album is amazing to go along with a truly talented voices thats unmatched today he puts all other R&B singers out today to shame. He has no ceiling on how successful he can be. Buy this album now I strongly recommend it 5 stars and thats putting it lightly, I'd give it many many more if I could.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Once you start this, you are sucked in hopelessly.  The story line is based on Hamlet.  Most people thinks its just a 'biker' show.  Love SAMCRO!
B006M4F67A|4.0|IT WORKS. NICE TO HAVE COUNT OF REMAING TILE MOVES. BUT THIS IS ADEQUATE. TELLS YOU WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF MOVES BUT THEN GIVES YOU MORE
1933308087|5.0|This is very good book~I love it! this book gives lots of information, will buy more for gift to my friends....
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Solid book. Well-written and apropos of current events in Cleveland. A very quick read. The characters really come to life.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I love being able to read free books on my Kindle app.  This app is easier than waiting for books to become available at the digital library.
0385344333|5.0|My requirements on novels are simple. I like humor. I like ones where there is a good guy and a bad guy and the good guy wins.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Excellent story with very witty dialog and strong adult themes.  Also requires a mature audience to handle sexual situations.  I thought the acting was excellent.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it has been fun so far. I am only lvl 7 at the moment but it is going good. fun times.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|To be sure, the game has great sound and graphic, and lots of action.<br />However, I expected free flight.<br />Instead, it's a bit like a hyper advanced Temple Run.<br />You are swept along the path and can only go freely left or right, up and down is automatic.<br />You collect bonuses, shoot enemies and dodge obstacles.<br />You can upgrade your suit and weapons with what you earn.<br />It's a good game but 600MB is a bit much for what it does.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. Graphics are good. File is 1gb which could slow down your phone. And I wish the pop up ads would go away.
1601251505|5.0|This book is worth every penny you spend in it. It's quality is superb and the content ruleset is probably the best compilation of d20 rules, comprising the enhancements from D&D 3.5 that player community suggested.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Witty, sarcastic and elegant writing. a great plot of star crossed lovers. Great relationship with the girls' father who is funniest of them all. Must read.
B00003XACV|3.0|I bought this one for the first track. It is an excellent 'Show off' track for your equipment. Fast percussion and grumbling bass will<br />test most equipment. Musically though, typical sound track. The film was a surprise.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Watched this movie twice in a row all the way through!  Great movie!  Because we have intelligence officers in our family, makes it more interesting for all of us!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I am so glad this was featured as a FAOTD. It's simple, fun, and addictive. I am having a great time leveling up the various options. My 3-year-old loves it too. :)<br /><br />5/16/13 Edit: A suggestion for the developers - the Reset button, to a 3-year-old kid whose reading skills are still developing, looks awfully similar to a Quit button. MY UPGRADES, ALL GONE OMG.<br /><br />Still loving the game though. Highly recommend it.
B008S80OU2|5.0|GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY. TOP BOX SET. Great way to get hold of BOC collection. Do yourself a favour folks.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Probably the best explanation on what happened during the financial crisis.  Not only is it explained well but it's a fairly fast and entertaining read, Michael Lewis keeps your attention from start to finish!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I bought this cd as a birthday present. I think it went over pretty well. I think it was genuinely enjoyed.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|FF3 is a remake of the classic game with 3D models and higher resolution visuals.  I originally played it on Nintendo 3DS, and I still have the game.  I love the game, but at the same time, the game library for Android devices is so much more expansive than that of the 3DS.  You could do better for $15.<br /><br />On Android, I have played games like Pocket Heroes, Minecraft: Pocket Edition (highly recommend that one), and even simpler games like Tetris clones and word games.  And the price of each game was never over $4. Most of them were even free.  For that reason, I have to give FF3 a less than perfect score, because while it gives you a lot for your $15, you could spend that money on other options which undoubtedly will offer a lot more to do and could take up a lot more of your time.<br /><br />There is one other bonus to the 3DS version, though.  You get a 3D screen, which may seem like a novelty but is actually quite cool to look at.  The Android version looks a lot better because of the larger screen.  It is simply less pixelated.  That said, both versions of the game look good, and I prefer the 3DS version for the 3D screen.  If not for that screen, though, I would love the Android version and would most likely get rid of my 3DS version.<br /><br />My recommendation is to get the game only if you are a fan.  If you honestly do not care about the game franchise and just want a good game, it's still a good experience, but you are better off buying other, cheaper games, at least on Android.  $15 is worth it, though, if you do not have a 3DS or simply want all your games on one device.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This is the best twilight soundtrack beside breaking dawn part 1. I was hooked from the first time I listened to this.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is the best i got it and i couldn't<br /> stop playing this game is so fun!!!! That's that

B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't get myself to stop reading it. I have been putting off reading this book. I'm so glad I finally decided to check it out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yet again this book is addicting, I could not put it down. There are many twists and turns, you just never know whats going to happen
B001ECDVKE|5.0|What's not to like about this movie?? I bought this movie for old times sake.  I love this movie just because of the hair styles!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book! The love story between Ana and Christian is heart melting! This is a must read story
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Felt nasty and sick at times reading this but also could not put it down.  Overall a well written book. Would suggest others to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a little harder to get into, just the middle of the book. But the beginning and the end are just perfect and not at all where I expected the characters to end up
B009NYU1CQ|3.0|I love Sandra Bullock, but this movie was just okay for me. I thought the story line was a bit strange and rather unrealistic.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time is an intricate, well-woven escape from reality. The layering of contextual details and the duality of character and conflict development create a compelling storyline. Not your mom's fairytales, Once Upon a Time deftly flips the stereotypical constraints of canonical definitions of heroism/villainism. Character motivation and consequentially, their behavior, choices, and actions, stem from realistically crafted characterization. No one character is wholly defined as one dimensionally good or evil – creating broader insight into the pursuit of “happily ever after.” Once does for fairytales what Wicked did for Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz.

B00000JFV9|5.0|As a fan of Curtis Mayfield, it amazes me how much of a musical genius he was.  As a child of the 70's, I didn't fully appreciate his musical arrangements until later.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Interestingly, the movie was up for multiple awards and most of my friends who saw it (I have not yet) were not enthusiastic.<br /><br />Books are a different &#34;story&#34;, no pun intended.  I enjoyed the time I spent in Pat's head.  Curiosity remains, though, as to when in his life his mental disorder showed up.  Did he not exhibit any syptoms in his teens?  I came away wishing I knew more about Pat the boy before he became Pat the man.<br /><br />A quick, interesting read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love Downton Abbey.  It is funny, sad and fantastic all at the same time.  My husband loves it just as much.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I am not a true fan of the stage musical,  although I have seen it 4-5 times for one reason or the other.... Still I was skeptical about the movie versio....But what a great surprise it was. The movie stays completely loyal to the stage version scene by scene!!!!! Being able to see the characters upclose makes it so interesting to watch... I think that Russell Crow was completely miscast as he does not do anything for this movie... The man cannot sing! Point blank! Other than that,  brilliant performances from everyone else... One of my new favorite musical movies.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|WHEN 10 & 12 YEAR OLDS  ENJOY A MOVIE AS MUCH AS MINE, THEY WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER.<br />THIS WEEKEND WAS COLD, RAINY WITH SNOW WHICH MADE IT EVEN BETTER TO WATCH &#34;PITCH PERFECT&#34;<br />THEY MADE POPCORN AND HOT CHOCOLATE, COVERED THEMSELVES IN BLANKETS AND WATCHED THE MOVIE.<br />GREAT MOVIE!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I must be reading the wrong books, because by far this is still some of the best storytelling I've come across in a long time.  Read it, read it, and read it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a must see series. My husband and I starting watching the series and couldn't stop. I would recommend this series to anyone!
B00BF11STU|3.0|Movie seemed hastily put together, thin character development and the climax cinematography left something to be desired with all the black screens
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I'm glad I read the book because I enjoyed seeing the characters come to life. I can't wait to see the other two movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so many people play on minrcraft not just because its fun beacause its entertaining to all those who play it.
B001R1PZ9M|3.0|Alot of this movie is aimed towards kids,compared to the first film,and it really shows. But still,the turtles going back in time was something different and new. Overall,this may not be the best Ninja Turtles movie,but it's ok.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The subject of greatest Doctor or best companion ignites fiery debate. But the primary reason for my five-star rating of the fourth reboot season is the chemistry between this Doctor and this companion. People differ on the kinds of plots and plot-resolutions they prefer, but nobody likes flat interactions between key characters. Enter David Tennant and Catherine Tate. Both are excellent actors alone; together, they make otherwise-iffy stories come alive. When I find myself not caring much about characters in more recent seasons, I think back to these with great fondness.

You can rent it at Redbox.com for $1.27.<br />It won't break your bank either way you rent it. So you don't need to write a book about the review. Thanks, and happy viewing.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son love's this set.  It is very detailed.  He took a couple of days to put it together and it looks amazing.
1612930832|4.0|This book was kind of drawn out. Distilled down, it's all about focus and the power of the mind. \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne was constructed on books like this and \\"The Science of Getting Rich\\" by Wallace Wattles. Reading it and following its principles/system may yield success for you. I have followed its principles to the T for over a year now and have seen success. That being said, a certain amount of faith is required to continue any path you choose...as it is with religious dogmas.<br /><br />One thing I like about this system is it doesn't necessarily take God out of the picture, but inputs you back into it. You are the designer of your destiny and the master of your fate with the universe, or God if you will, endowing you with all that you need, the good and the bad, throughout your journey. And in the end, that's what it's all about...the journey, right? In the end, whether you see yourself as a failure or success you can fault yourself or give yourself a pat on back...respectively...and I like that.<br /><br />John Darryl Winston

B009CZTDE8|5.0|Though not composed by the band Nightwish, this score for the film contains many of the motifs from the Imaginaerum CD making it very enjoyable to listen to. Very well done, highly recommended if you like Imaginaerum!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|It was definitely entertaining, and the actors were great in it, but the story itself isn't much of a substance.

0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a very thought-provoking book, interesting and different in many ways. The subject was fascinating and the characters intriguing. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. By Kathryn, author of Benjamin@ [[ASIN:0988904993 Benjamin]]
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the first person narrative from the main characters, but I did not like the ending.  I like good endings.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I love rock bios and the who.  I thought this would be a perfect match, but it turns out it is not so.  Pete Townshend is incredibly talented, smart and funny and much of that shines through. But truthfully this book went into too much detail about his failed and sub-par work and not enough into what I wanted to hear about.  He mentions on Tommy and one of his other works that if you want more, go to [...]  bollocks!  I bought the book to read about that stuff!  At the end of the book, I just had a hard time caring about him any more.  It is obvious that he has a rather high opinion of himself and the book just did not take me in the way that I felt it should have.
B001RNO7BM|3.0|I like the look of these shoes and the construction seems to be fairly rugged and well done (hence the 3 stars); however, the shoes are significantly undersized.  My shoe size is 10E, and I normally buy a size 11 in athletic and outdoor wear just to get a little more room for thick socks and wiggling my toes.  The shoes I bought say size 11M, but there is little room (length-wise) for socks and no toe-wiggle room at all.  Toes are right against the toe-cap (without socks).  Also, the shoes are pretty tight in the width, and for that reason alone are not comfortable for walking.  Can't see doing any distance hiking in them, as the stiff, protective toe-cap sort of eliminates the possibility of them stretching out to a reasonable size over time.  If you don't have wide feet, these might be fine as long as you get them about 1 1/2 sizes larger than you normally wear.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing book about real events. I highly recommend it to anyone that want to know what it's like to have cancer or what it's like to be in love.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|Who would have thought of that ending. The first book left me in tears and now this one leaves me completely doubting my very existence...
B0078XHAB4|5.0|Firstly I'd like to thank Black & White Publishing for sending me this book to read and give an honest review.  This isn't the first book I've read by this author, I have also read and enjoyed the first two books in The Sarah Midnight Trilogy.  I had heard many MANY good things about Watch Over Me so I was very much looking forward to reading it.<br /><br />Wow, what a powerful prologue!  It was thought-provoking, slightly haunting and completely drew me in so that I just had to find out exactly what happened on that spring night in the woods.<br /><br />As soon as I read about Eilidh's struggles to fall pregnant, and the effects it had on her life, I felt incredibly sorry for her.  I knew then that she would be a character that I'd take to my heart and as she ran from the pain I felt glad, I thought it was the right thing for her to do.<br /><br />When I read Jamie's story I felt a mixture of emotions, I was shocked that a mother could up and leave her child so easily, sad for what Jamie and Maisie had lost but also happy that they were able to stay together.  He seemed to be a very likeable character and I quickly warmed to him even though there were times that I felt frustrated by his actions, particularly when he didn't say what he really wanted to.<br /><br />Then came the twist that made this book so special for me - Elizabeth's story after her death!  She was Jamie's late mother and reading about how it broke her heart to leave her family behind brought tears to my eyes.  She raised some great points about motherhood and talked about death in a peaceful kind of way.  The moment she `felt' Eilidh's distress gave me chills and I enjoyed Elizabeth's memories of Jamie and Eilidh's childhood as friends.<br /><br />As Eilidh and Jamie both tried to rebuild their lives and battle their inner demons, Elizabeth was working behind the scenes to make sure they would find each other again - this was one of my favourite parts of the book and brought a smile to my face every time she intervened.<br /><br />It wasn't just the main characters who captured my interest, the author created some fantastic supporting characters who were just as interesting and I really enjoyed following their ups and downs too!  Elizabeth had to be one of my favourite characters though, her words were inspiring and made so much sense, the author had written it so beautifully that I felt like I was actually reading the thoughts of someone who had passed away.<br /><br />There were a couple of heart-stopping twists and turns towards the end, one in particular that gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes once again.  I found this story so poignant and was completely unable to put the book down - I finished it in just one day.<br /><br />This was a breathtaking read, it was beautifully written with such an emotional atmosphere, I have a feeling this book will stay in my mind for a long time.ry time she intervened.<br /><br />It wasn't just the main characters who captured my interest, the author created some fantastic supporting characters who were just as interesting and I really enjoyed following their ups and downs too!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Just seemed dragged out to me. Didn't hold my interest.  Felt obligated to finish the trilogy so stuck through it. Not a very realistic plot or characterization.  First book was the best.  Just didn't get any better from there.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good book just a bit too wordy.<br />This was my first and will read another to see if it's the same.<br />Love to watch the TV show Bones and love the \\"younger\\" Tempe. She and Booth are fantastic tigether.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is the best version of cut the rope I have ever played also the toughest because of the two om noms and the two pieces of candy.
B009R659L8|4.0|Every year Mary Higgins Clark writes a mystery, and every year she manages not to disappoint!  Her sense of place is very true...as a NY area native, it returns me to my home turf.
B001EBWIRW|4.0|had seen before...loved the movie BUT the streaming was much to be desired, it took me 2-3 nights to watch it all. Kept cutting off and at times couldn't get back in.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is one of the best and most under-rated Movie that I have seen and is terrific in it's music and acting and writing and directing; it has it all!! A heartfelt top notch film,
B00633W614|5.0|Kept my interest,  Has to be a sequel to find out who the baton is. Handed to .Would recommend this to anyone
1861085257|5.0|I enjoyed reading through this book and I can't wait to get started. Nice pictures helped to understand the techniques.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I actually had a lot of fun with this one. The puzzles and the 3D effect was stunning. I only wish the game play was longer, other than that I loved it and would definitely recommend it to my puzzle loving friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Excellent series!  Looking really forward to season 4. Master Piece Theatre has the best classics. You are drawn into the lifes of the individuals.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|If and when I use it, I'll edit the comments I've made now.  Got it for a Kindle and sent the Kindle back and don't need it.
B003L77FYS|1.0|The second disc of the five disc pack doesn't work at all. When I put it in my dvd player, it doesn't load and it shows up blank. I wish the seller would've noted this before selling it. I wouldn't have bought it if that was the case. One star it is.
B008602KQI|3.0|I only watched a few minutes on my computer, then attempted to finish it on my Samsung tablet with no luck. No workie on Android. Too bad cause I was hoping to only carry my tablet on trips. Any alternatives?
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty fun to play.  My only complaint is how long it takes to earn energy and invest points.  For those that Don't want to pay-to-play, it can get frustrating.  \\"Money\\" builds up fast though, that's a nice change.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love to play this in between books or just simply when I'm bored and want to pass away a couple of minutes. Graphics are great. Has an intriguing story line and mostly easy seek and find puzzles. To be a free game, this one is worth it!
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Let me preface this review in saying that this wasn't my favorite book of all time. I thought it was nice, it was entertaining and fun. I liked the parellel stories of Lena and Ethan and their civil war counterparts. This was barely touched upon in the movie even though it was a driving force in the book.<br /><br />Another driving force in the book was it's characters, in  particular Ethan's mother who used to be the old caster librarian. Not only did they not talk about her at all, and when they did they didn't explain how her uncle even knows Ethan's mom. They condensed multiple characters in one and got rid of others. The movie was long but not well thought out.<br /><br />The only saving grace of this film was it's actors. Each actor played their parts exceptionally well. I especially loved Ethan with his bumbling flirtations and sweaty demeanor he was believable. I think that he played the love interest very well. He was believable, which is something those other vamp/werewolf lovers did not even attempt to try!<br /><br />All in all it wasn't a good movie. If you are 12 years old and really into sci fi/fantasy movies with romance then I'd say it could work but if you have any sort of litarary integrity I would skip it and move on to the book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually write reviews even if I love a book (and when I say usually, I actually mean never). I am making an exception for this book because I was so shocked at the emotional journey it took me on. I hesitated for at least two days before deciding to purchase this book and I am so happy that I made the decision to buy. This was a well told story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! Unlike temple run 1 this one has many more obstacles and has a more exciting course. The course is a bit more challenging but that makes the game even more fun. I suggest you buy this game right away.
B0040X46TE|4.0|hi.. I spent a number of years with late husband, on Oahu, and heard this kind of music often, daily, nightly etc.. Enjoyed it a lot... not so much in their language, but the songs I could understand,and later got to know to hum along. I purchased two of these. one for a gift to my sister, who has family on the Big Island and would appreciate it greatly..it's been mailed to NC so I'm waiting to hear how she liked it..I find it easy listening even in Hawaiian.. love the first 2 songs.. play it the whole way through often.. pmps
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Unlike a previous Kindle case, this was a very easy fit.  The color is gorgeous, easy handling and stand-up screen a hoot. Great product.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I choose this rating because it was a good book, good suspense but to long and drawn out. Husband reminded me of sleeping with the enemy with Julia Roberts the twist he was a good detective with a bad temper and horrible drinking problem. So I got upset especially when he found her very drawn out. Not the best of Nicholas Sparks reading which I enjoy very much. Not this one maybe movie is better.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|was looking forward to this movie.  This movie began but we kept waiting for it to  start this was throughtout the whole movie mind you!!!!.<br />the film focused on special effects and never really met expectations,
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this in 1 day! I couldn't put it down. I was captured from the first chapter. Can't wait to see Travis' side &#60;3
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|best love story,so glad I can buy it now..was unavailable for awhile. wonderful refreshing story and a happy ending!!! this is a keeper
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is very entertaining. Once you start you can't stop playing it. It is very fun. And guess what? The best part is that it's free and safe for anyone and all ages. You have to get this wonderful awesome game please get it!!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Just as good - did miss Matt Damon but after a while forgot all about the old movies and was focused on the new.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I found this to be much better than book 2. The plot was so intricate that at times I had difficulty remembering all the characters. I found the author's references to firearms to be mostly for show - not as glaring as book 2, but to my knowledge there is no such thing as a 9mm revolver.  More annoying and distracting than anything else.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|This tape player plays at a slow speed when running on new bateries. The problem gets worse when you plug in the USB. With the USB plug in the speed varries from slow to very slow and back again. I was not able to test the softwear since I could not get the tape player to play at the correct speed. Also the symbols and writing on the devise are dificult to read especialy on the chrome parts.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I am addicted to this storyline, so I love the package. I don't love the controls that come with the Blu-ray though, they load really slowly. The provided interface is poorly executed, just so HBO can remind you that the product came from them. I forgive them though, because the programming did, too!
193700788X|1.0|Ms. Harris, what a poor way to end a series.  No thoughts for the fans that made you wealthy, or your characters.  What a grab for money and you obviously ran out of ideas.  Very, very disappointed.
B00AW0KGYI|4.0|My wife wanted the collection, so... (it was a couple of bucks less than the local Walmart, no taxes on the purchase, and the package includes the digital version as well. What's not to like?)
B00005U122|5.0|One of my favorites from a great songwriter and performer. Covers plenty of Floyd but also some of the best of Waters' diverse and prolific solo work. Fantastic, flawless but passionate renditions of many great songs by a superb band behind a polished Waters. The Waters solo stuff is his apocolyptic best but great nevertheless. A bonus sight you don't often see is a fantastic guitarist playing left handed upside down on his red strat. Highly recommended especially for Floyd/Waters' lovers
0767834739|4.0|Part three of an ongoing saga. Sequels tend to be poorer than the first one, but this series does ok.<br />Due to the steady action sequenses, the story doesn't need to be very intricate.<br />When you're taking out zombies who needs a complicated plot?
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story tells of an often unknown practice in our country's history regarding the care of orphaned children in our large cities.  It is a story that everyone should know.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Love Satriani his music is so distinctively his i can listen to it forever Satriani Rocks with his music and with Chickenfoot !!!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|A fun little game... But I love games like this.  You have activities that have to be accomplished by your little guy, such as cutting wood or building a bridge, and this requires resources.  You can get these resources via chopping wood, gathering them, or creating buildings (which may need resources and time themselves).  All this needs to be done before &quot;the sun goes down &quot;.<br />There are former mentions of IAPs... but I haven't seen any and I am through the third land...
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great case works best for travel to have a place to store and charge so gald i purchased this item Thanks!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Having never read any of Landay's work, I find myself eager to read more. His skill at weaving the story makes every session engaging.  As a lover of language, I enjoyed his descriptiveness (although a little excessive at times), as well as his vocabulary. Some might see it as borderline obtuse, but I found myself looking up unfamiliar words and truly admiring the precision with which he used them. Ready for more...
B007FEFLTO|4.0|History portrail of the world events based on good information and put forth in a very interesting narrative. Too much intimate sexual details detracted from believable accuracy.
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|my wife loves vamp movies and this one showed up just in time for mothers day.  She requested and amazon delivered.  The three D is great in this film.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I recently saw these guys on a morning show (don't remember which one) and I fell in love with the song that they performed.  I got this CD and the whole thing is A number one !
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Very interesting history of the studio. Well put together. So many great clips of the artists who recorded there. A must see.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I devoured this book - a fascinating memoir about a rather intense mother (glad she wasn't my mother!)  I think those who criticized her failed to read it as a memoir and self-parody.  What I find particularly fascinating is how different countries have reacted to the book.  Amy Chua received the harshest criticism from her US audience.  However, in China, the book is considered a parenting manual for how to allow children to have more fun and freedom.  Who would have thought?
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Absolutely wonderful, heartbreaking book. Portia is so open and honest. You will feel like you've lost a friend when you come to the end. This book is a gift to readers!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I was interested in the whole &quot;white noise thing&quot; and decided that it might help me get some rest. After looking at other related apps, I chose this and I've been enjoying this since purchasing it. I even talked my wife into buying a copy for herself and she agrees that it's effective. We each have our favorite sounds, but also have fun combining things into a mix. Now we use it to help eliminate a lot of distracting sounds from outside and next door.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Super easy to use. This is a must-have for anyone, like me, who needs lists to get all the things done!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The detail information available on local weather services and the 10 day forecast information.The various overlays of different weather information.
B00CDXOPYE|3.0|Acting and plot fair. Disappointed that we purchased it. It would be great if there was a return policy. We did not read any reviews before we purchased. :(
B00000AF95|1.0|The CD was cracked in half and the case has some orange foam on it.Stay away from this company.Far away.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great insight to a man & his mission for now & the future - can't imagine where we would be without Apple & Steve ... Walter's keen interviewing and writing ability makes it hard to put the book down !<br /> Looking forward to reading Einstein & Ben Franklin's biography's .
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|This album be sounding to stank its crazy!!!! OFWGKTA's game is stepping up, no doubt. Its a must cop for sure
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli has always been a favorite of mine.  This album is particularly enjoyable with the addition of other artists and the updated approach to the old standards.  Thank you, Andrea!
1594136467|5.0|Great Book, especially if you have ANY doubt God in your life. This is a true account and experience with God from someone who was a non-believer at one time
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I like this game alot.  I play it on my kindle fire.  Works great and its free.  Need more games like this.  DOWN LOAD THIS GAME.  It's a good one
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|need  more practice, but is fun to do. Need to practice so i can get to the really good stuff.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|And it works really well.  The new Mac laptops have no firewire connectors so it you have legacy firewire devices you must get this adaptor.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For basic operations. Great for basic household operations. Love the key size, easy to see and easy to use without hitting unwanted keys.
B0089J270U|5.0|LETS GET THIS STRAIGHT. THIS IS NOT A MARILYN MONROE MOVIE. IT'S AN ETHEL MERMAN MOVIE AND THE IDIOT THAT CHANGED THE COVER AND PUT MARILYN MONROE ON IT SHOULD BE SHOT. IF YOUR AN ETHEL MERMAN FAN YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY THIS MOVIE. THE WHOLE CAST IS GREAT AND THE SONGS ARE VERY ENTERTAINING. IT HAS A NICE FAMILY STORY AS WELL AS A FAMILY OF ENTERTAINERS. IF YOU OWN THE LP OR THE CD OF THE SOUNDTRACK YOU WILL SEE IT'S ETHEL MERMAN ON THE COVER, NOT MARILYN MONROE.SHE IS HARDLY IN THE MOVIE.. LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THE BLUE-RAY EDITION.
B009R659L8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  But then I like to read Mary Higgins Clark!  This book seemed to have a lot of characters so you have to kind of keep track of all of them.  I loved how devoted Hannah was to her sister Kate!
B00AR9GKJY|5.0|I got the vinyl. Had to get a replacement because side 4 was very noisy with no visible scratches; unfortunately all to common these days. The music is sublime - it's one of those albums that beckons you to put it on again and again. Great musicianmanship, lyrics are just a bit mysterious, and it's got a lot of Mellotron and Gilmouresque guitar - what more could you ask for? Beware, however, once you get hooked you're going to find yourselves digging into Porcupine Tree's catalog, and then all bets are off.
B000VZYPB4|4.0|We discovered BBT just a couple of seasons ago and have been watching it in syndication. But that's catch as catch can as far as the &#34;order&#34; of things goes - you might not see the conclusion of a two-parter for a few days. I was happy to see that Amazon has most of the seasons. I was looking forward to finally getting to watch them in order and get a little more understanding into some of the on-again off-again relationships. But rather than getting to watch the series for the price of our subscription, a la Netflix, each episode has to be paid for individually. Sorry, Amazon, not gonna happen.
0374533571|4.0|Book considerably different from book but our book members all enjoyed the book and movie for different reasons.  All in all we all gave a two thumbs up.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|the book is completely different from the movie and totally ruined the movie for me! The book was really good but with Bradley Cooper playing him in the movie it really ruined the book for me as well and made it seem kind of dumb.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|To anyone who seen this wonderful musical on the stage, this attempt to screen it using screen stars instead of the<br />many marvelous stage stars who have made this musical a world wide favorite is a total failure.  There are a few<br />capable singers cast in supporting roles but the 'star' leads cannot do justice to this music,
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My grand daughter calls this &quot;the doctor game&quot; She is 2 1/2 and it didn't take long for her to figure it out. She doesn't like the part where the animal has to get a shot,so I have to do that part,but I'm sure she will be ok after a bit. Nana is a nurse so this is a great learning game. Love that we can do this together!
B008L1PYQU|5.0|So many remixed/remastered projects fall victim to the \\"loudness wars\\" that bely modern digital format mixing techniques. Not this one. And, thank God Bob Ezrin over saw this project. As the original producer, the quality of final product is a matter of personal and artistic integrity. Working from the original 16 track tapes (after they were dumped into a DAW), Ezrin applied minimal effects (I'm guessing mostly compression and EQ) but maintained a mid-70's vibe.<br />Destroyer has always been a personal favorite, so I was eager to hear the new mix, but ready to reject it if I found it too \\"modern\\" sounding. After spinning the (vinyl) LP several times, I must say, Ezrin's integrity remains. This mix is AWESOME! Everything has more definition, and occupies a wider frequency range. The bass has deeper lows, the drums are more clear and punchy. But it doesn't sound overly compressed like so many modern recordings. There is a still some \\"air\\" in the mix that gives it a 3 dimensional feel.<br />Highly recommended.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|I am really enjoying this. I don't need extra  nose piece. This allows you to concentrate on just swimming and not have to worry about your air. I found using this very easy on first try. I reommend it .
B009NY43NY|4.0|When I first read that this was Going to be the final Sookie book, I was disappointed. I had started reading the series because of True Blood. I have since stopped watching the series due to lack of HBO.  When it came time for me to buy the final book, I had read a lot of reviews and most of them were bad so I braced myself for the worst and I am glad I didn't listen and bought the book anyway. I didn't hate the ending but I wish things were just tied up better with Sam.  I never wanted her to end up with Eric and I don't think she wanted to either. He had tricked her into marrying him and the laughed at her when she did mention a traditional human wedding.  I also don't think that there were a lot if any inconsistancies within this book. I did like how she brought a lot of important people from Sookies life in this one. It proved to her that even though there are people out to get her, she has made a lot of good friends along the way.<br /><br />I think that the way CH ended the series was bitter sweet but good. Her last line is showing right there that.Sookie. can stand on her own two feet. That she doesn't need a vamp to protect her or love her. That she is.choosing to be with Sam. Don't get me wrong, when her and Eric first got together I reread those.books several times however you.could see his progression that spikier was seeing that in the end he just really wanted to control her and not love her the way she truly wanted to be loved nor could he give.he the life she had always wanted. That never.changed for her right.from the start.<br /><br />I enjoyed the entire series and I am sad to see it end. I cant wait for the epilogue book that will come out in October so maybe all those naysayers who complained about how it ended will get to see what became of the whole Bin Temps clan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|i loveeeed this book so freaking much, one of my favorites. so many awesome twists and turns and totally my kind of book. loved it.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|you will not go wrong with this one...if you have any other of joe's music,,,put it on the back burner
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|If you are charging a tablet (iPad or other), then get a higher powered 12V charger like this one. I had been using a supposedly 2.1 amp charger, but it barely kept my iPad from losing charge, and it certainly didn't charge it back up. Yes, this charger is bigger than some of those small ones, but if you have a tablet, you need to use a higher power charger. This particular charger works well, and charges my iPad quickly.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The first Jack Reacher book, but not the first one I've read.  Lee Child was already an excellent writer when he wrote this book. Jack Reacher is only months out of the Army and is seeing the country by bus and foot when he is picked up for murder in a small town.  How he saves himself and solves a counterfeiting plot is the theme of this book.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The puzzles are fun and challenging. I have a hard time completing them quickly. It's a good time killer. Great to play while waiting in docs office or for car repairs.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Best movie I have seen in years, Denzel can officially change his first name to Oscar. Don't miss this, really.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Easy to play, easy to learn, and as it's free, an all around great deal, especially for those who enjoyed the movies.<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />Holding out hope that they'll fix the\\"update\\" that deleted so many people's game.  For those who don't know, support for this game is supposedly found by emailing jurrassicpark@ludia.com.  Still waiting for an answer......
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game has good grafics can be played with spending little money and it is lots of fun<br />I have enjoyed this game thus fare
B009369Z8A|3.0|I love love love this movie, which is why I purchased it, however when my package got here, I opened it and could hear rattling inside the case. After opening it, the inside of the bluray case that holds the disk, were a bunch of broken pieces that came from the hinge inside the case. Now the disks just move freely inside the case. This may not be a big deal to most, but when I buy something i expect it to be in all one piece and thats including the case that holds it.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Seriously.  Buy it.  If you want proof just go to Youtube and search for Hero2 HD standard vs. dive housing.  Make sure you leave this window open so when I'm right you can come back and buy this thing.  I never use the standard housing but do keep it as a backup just in case.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was an exceptional finale. This series is so amazing I was sad to have finished it :P Better read<br />Heroes of Olympus now!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Didn't want to watch it but it was terrific, cinematograoghy was unbelieveable. Loved it wish I had a bigger set!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|This game has a cute story line, entertaining gameplay, and the joy of resource management in timed conditions. I played through the whole game and didn't encounter any in-app-purchase elements. Higher quality than most cheep games out there. Worth the extra price!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game.  But I would like to make a suggestion: We should be able to give dragons that we have 5,000,000 of, to friends.  Not just Facebook either, like if you visit a random person it has a button that says, &quot;Gift with dragon&quot; or something. I really hope the makers of this app will take my review into consideration. Thank you!
B006M4F67A|4.0|this downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle<br />I like mahjong and this one has nice layouts and some good features. I do have complaints though - the colors are washed out and hard on my eyes to distinguish the tiles - I would like an option to change the background to a darker setting. I also agree with another reviewer that pointed out there were more then 2 pairs of each tile making it harder to strategize their removal which I found frustrating at times.<br />overall it's a good game with replay value as you attempt to beat your old scores and earn 3 stars on all levels.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|For a free game, this certainly has a lot to it. You just need to connect the dots of the same color to each other, using up all spaces on the board. The boards start at 5x5 (considered easy) and go as high as 14x14 (considered master). It also has time trial modes where you can see how many boards of a certain size can be completed in a chosen timeframe. Overall, there are 900 boards to complete for the free version. The graphics are simple but clear and concise, and I've never had any lag when using this app. It's a simple puzzle game that has a good amount of replayability. Definitely a game to check out!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I love this genre of book I never really get tired of it. Also, I'm not as picky as others are about editing when i really get into a book I'm transported and this series has transported me to a new world with Thorgrin and the legion. Are their problems with the series? Sure it could use a little more character development but if you are a fan of the genre it's a nice series to sit and relax to but if you are more uptight with your reading preferences you will not enjoy it. George RR Martin she's not, but then who is?
193700788X|5.0|After seeing all the negative reviews I was braced for the worst, but I was blissfully surprised at how good a book this was.  I've been reading the Sookie Stackhouse books for years now, eagerly awaiting each new book.  I think this was the perfect ending to a fantastic series. There's not much wondering what will happen from here and I sleep easy knowing Sookie will be happy.<br />This book is a departure from the previous books and many characters I have grown to love (and sometimes hate) fade into the background, but they are SOOKIE books after all, not Eric or Bill.<br />In the end, if Sookie is happy, then I am happy.  And I am very happy indeed.
0307463745|5.0|I loved this book. It is quirky, fun, and makes pretty great points. It's a quick read, which is great for anyone on the go, but is packed with logical suggestions for a better working environment. Not just for new business owners, this is great info for anyone who wants to make their work life more effective.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Have not finished it but reading it fast. Great book, especially for a parent. Gut wrenching, you can only imagine what it would be like to be in these parents same position. UHG!

1401324649|5.0|I am looking forward to read it in the English version ,as I read it in Swedish last year...book was hilarious and I really enjoyed it, I hope to be as entertained in the translated version....I am buying this to be able to lend out after I re read it,and I have referred many to buy it in the online version.
1423136802|5.0|I was very pleased with my boxed set of Percy Jackson books. They are books I can read over and over again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well done in the game. It isn't the best game in the world though.maybe you should charge lower for the new better people. Just my suggestion.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|The case has been great so far - gives me a sense of peace knowing there is some sort of protection from the effects of using the Kindle Fire - I wish it were a bit more rugged - the style and colors are good, and my son loves the feel of the texture, it was quick and easy to put on
1582406723|5.0|Loved this comic collection would highly recommend it to any one interested in this series and or comics in general
B008M0UTRO|5.0|Another beautiful film by Studio Ghibli. I saw the English version first in the theater but always enjoy the original.

B003OAL58E|4.0|And how their warlike natures could have been reinforced.  It's elegant, authentic looking, and superbly acted.  However, unless it's more symbolic than literal, the facts are far from proven.  I suspect the voice over narration was an attempt to cover this flaw by the perspective coming from an \\"outsider\\" who had opposing ideals and limited observations.
0802130208|5.0|When I read this book  I didn't want to finish it because the enjoyment would end. If you want to get a funny time reading a book, you have to choose it. Ignatius Reilly, the anti-hero of this novel will kill you of laughter with his crazy adventures.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect game for when you can't sleep or you just need to kill a few minutes.  I definitely recommend this.
B0000024YL|5.0|My brother had this when he was going to war and I feel in love with it so I listened to it everyday until he returned.  Now I got one of my own.  It is just a great CD.  I know who ever listens to it will enjoy it.
B004G600A4|5.0|such a great dvd.  My daughter and i enjoy this so much.  You get lost in the animation it is that good!
B00CHILW64|5.0|This movie was so amazing. Watched it on the plane and I was balling like a baby. Really helps put everything into perspective.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|What it is really like to be bipolar in a manic phase, in grief over a dead or  estranged spouse, or obsessive compulsive.  I had given up on Robert DeNiro ever doing anything edgy again, but he hits just the right reactions.  Of course there is a romantic triangle of sorts that keeps you guessing and many funny but inappropriate lines blurted out to the wrong person at the wrong time.  It's way more emotionally effective than most bittersweet comedies.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|We are so sad to see MERLIN wrap up its 5 year run.  They are now making it move to fast.  Only 3 left.  Had to get our copy of this last season.
B0044CG71G|4.0|I was going to give a 5 star review, but then I remembered something that happened while I was watching the second season.  The first season killed it, great way to get an audience hooked.  But there were a few episodes in the middle of the second season that could have literally been inserted at any point in the story and you wouldn't know the difference.  The long story arc that is the entire 5 seasons is truly the interesting part of this series, the shorter story arcs can, at times, be less interesting.  I actually found myself skip an episode or two in the second season (that I had watched before).  They just weren't as captivating as the really good episodes like the final two of the second season.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, overall I would recommend this show to anyone who even remotely enjoys sci-fi shows.  I would just say to people that if you run into a few episodes that are just \\"so so\\", continue with the entire series.  The last season in particular I find quite good.  I think the reason for that is that they tie more into the long story arc.<br /><br />If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but I can't.  Either way, I'm a huge fan and if you're on the fence about getting into this show, it's well worth your time.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sean
B009O07NDY|5.0|I watched the movie and fell in love with the music so I had to have this CD.  I do believe anyone who listens to it will like it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Love this dvd.  great story and well played by the actors!  Really enjoy this story. Fast and good service too.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The story starts off well enough but toward the end gets into medical jargon.  He is determined to prove there is a journey to the afterlife, but is disappointed that he does not see any loved ones who have gone on before except for an unknown sister.  His story is boring at the end and I was surprised to arrive at the end unexpectedly.  He has lots of resources listed.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love Love Love this show! Couldn't wait to get this! Had it watched in 1 day! Loaned it to my niece and aunt after I got them hooked on the show! Can't wait until November for season 4! Extremely pleased with the deliver time, and of course the product itself!!!! Great show!!!!

B005LAII3U|4.0|A movie better than the original one. It was very enjoyable to watch and watch again. Why I need to type four words more?
B009MYARIK|1.0|I have loved all of Kinsella's previous books, but this one was a true struggle to finish. Even though I read all the previous reviews, I hoped it was better.  The plot was weak, and the situations weren't even close to being believeable.  It went on and on with stupidity.  Definitely not the enjoyable reads of previous books.  Hopefully her next book will be back to the way she used to write.  Very glad I borrowed this one from the library!
193700788X|1.0|I want to say first that I am a Sookie/Eric fan, and that little bit of a crash and burn did hurt, but the book's writing just wasn't at the same level of quality. I'm not an author, but I feel that if I can skip pages in a book just to get it over with, the book isn't worth it.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Heart pounding at times, tender and sweet at other times.  As always, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.
0307454541|4.0|So, when I am at the beach I like something that is challenging enough to keep me entertained but easy enough for minor distractions.  This book fit the bill exactly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story and the complex, flawed characters.  Well worth the time and the occasional translation stumbles.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Like its predecessor (On Basilisk Station), this is a jolly good read.  David W. has good writing skills that convey the emotive aspects of his topic and characters very well.  He lends an (often missing) dimension to space-opera Sci-Fi by often focusing on the 'human fallibility' and sensitivities of his richly drawn characters.
B000002J03|5.0|I have had this musice on LP vinel CDs and MP3 down loads. A must for the Zip head in ya. The copony I got this copy from has fast shipping , the CD is in great shape for used and well packaged.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an amazing bag I absolutely love it. It fits all my lenses and camera. Worth the price, great quality.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I downloaded the clock app &amp; to say the least it's one of the most versatile clock app I have ever used on the kindle tablet. It's very simple to use, the blue hue on the clock gives it a real feel of an alarm clock, real gentle to your eyes when waking up. A nice customisable alarm &amp; background to make it look &amp; feel classy yet elegant. I love the app, I had another app for a clock ended up deleting it &amp; getting this one. For $0.99 you can't beat that with a long shot.
1451695195|1.0|After being presented with this book by my mother, with all of her hope and interest in it, I felt compelled to give it a chance for her sake. Half way through, if not earlier, you will come to realize that the scientifically credible evidence, and even any reasoning at all behind Alexander's experience that you'd expect to find, is simply not there. &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; is one hell of an audacious title for this book, probably thought up by a publisher with dollar signs where his eyes should be.<br /><br />Despite the incidences of Dr. Alexander's past with medical malpractice and sanctions all swept under the rug, it's only fair to take in his account of a near death experience as you would any other. Not only am I very hesitant to be on the side of that improbability but the NDE story carried on with hollywood-esque characters and interactions, likely intended in hopes of a film to be made.<br /><br />If you're looking for words between pages that pander to spiritually gullible readers looking for shallow support of the supernatural, this is your book. Whether or not it's true, what the book implies (a scientific analogy), is nothing short of a lie and you will be disappointed if you so happen to be a seeker of a story with any intellectual honesty.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is the best mobile game I have played in a long time .I recommend it to players of temple run subway surfers and shooters.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|I love this movie and you should totally get the blu-ray version because it is super crispy clear and sharp!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I am happy with this.  I was hoping to find something a little more real time pics with the weather given, and I was not really happy with the options available for you widgets, but I am content with the flat one and I am very happy with the other applications that come with this app...the map, the forecast (10 day and hourly)...and the warnings....
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is great. It has only very little to do with The Hobbit novel but is, instead, mainly related to other writings from Tolkien. This would explain why Saruman, Galadriel, and Radagast, make appearances in the movie but not in the novel.<br /><br />The Hobbit does a great job of referencing The LOTR trilogy at almost every turn (especially The Fellowship). The only time it doesn't reference the other movies is the only time it actually should have - which is when Bilbo comes to posses the One Ring in the first place.<br /><br />Still, it is quite enjoyable and Martin Freeman makes a very good Bilbo Baggins. I'm certainly glad I got it.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|Some of my favorite parts of the best songs were omitted. I'm not sure why either. I wanted the full film version of the Work song and At the End of the Day. The cast was fantastic though and it gives me my fix when I want to hear something in particular.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love her workouts... only 20 mins of your day, perfect for my busy schedule. love it!! Jillian kicks butt!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This film was not a cheesy pregnancy film. It was quite honest & funny. Good characters. BTW, the little boy seems to be made of steel- totally indestructible! :)
1476734941|5.0|I bought this book after watching the special on T.V.  I've been on the Fast for six weeks now and have lost about 6 lbs.  The book has some good 500 calorie meals to prepare.  After looking at all the diets people go on in which they count calories, or exclude major food groups, I thought this one would work the best for me.  It forces me to eat less two nonconsecutive days per week and I'm finding that I pay more attention to what I eat on the other days.  I hope to continue to eat like this always.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I was looking forward to reading The Panther since I am a DeMille fan, having read many of his previous books. And some with John Corey as the main character. However, this one is boring and tiresome. This one does not compare well with the current fiction writers in the spy, terrorist genre today. The plot is good but why should it take over 600 pages to the end? Readers have to plod thru way too much wise cracking and thoughts from Corey. I will not purchase and/or read another Corey book.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Michael Douglas is fantastic in Falling Down. At first, Bill Foster seems like a man who just wants to get home to see his daughter. But it turns out to be more complicated than that. His rampage across the city is such that we would all love to do should we be in the same situations.<br /><br />Torn between rooting for and condemning Foster, we cannot help but feel pity for him. I highly recommend this movie to anyone enjoying good thrillers.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What fun to watch and in Blu-ray!  A great selection to own  Get the pop-corn ready and have a marathon!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|SO LOVED THE FIRST CD, HAD TO GET PIANO GUYS 2 AS A RESULT.  FALLING IN LOVE WITH THIS ONE TOO! WIDE RANGE OF GENRES OFFERED HERE AS WELL!
B005ETANC2|3.0|A wonderful entry in the 50's &#34;atomic catastrophe&#34; genre. Was amazed to see a car phone in the heroine's 1955 Chrysler. Didn't like the extra layer of copyright protection placed onto the disc by the manufacturer, specifically, the DVD won't play in my combo DVD-VCR player because the unit is capable of recording. Isn't the basic copy protection enough to deter people from duping off 58 year old movies (if anybody would actually do that)?
B003ED7WAG|5.0|This is Janis' best album by far. So much soul. And, I bought it used in good condition, and it showed up looking brand new with absolutely no scratches.
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|Uncle Acid moves into a more progressive style on Mind Control but sacrifices nothing, this album still has plenty of catchy heavy riffs to rock out to but also comes with more twists and variety. One thing that stands out here is the drum work which has more bounce and fill then on Bloodlust. Still lots of Sabbath and psych era Beatles influences here but they package it all together so well with a very fresh and new sound all the same. It kind of reminds me of B.S. vol.4 paired up with Beatles Revolver but totally reinvented. Amazing album
B007FC3AAI|4.0|First of all I can certainly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the Twilight Saga films. I only gave this film 4 out of 5 stars because I waited for Part II to be available before watching them both and I although I liked Part I, I loved Part II.  Buy them together and you will not be disappointed.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really loved this series of books. I am happy that the story is closing. I do not like the ending. Miss Stackhouse should have ended up with Eric instead of with Sam.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love this show. It's so funny and realistic. Well, for a cartoon anyway. I recommend that any fan buy this complete series. You won't be disappointed. :-)
B000PAAH3K|3.0|Not exactly a book with a &#34;life lesson&#34; , but it helps to understand how and why we act and think how in a split second decision.
B00181JGI2|4.0|I like this movie very much, but I'm not one of the obsessive fans who made this such a cult classic.  Not yet, anyways.  I've only seen this once, and I understand that it gets better the more times one sees it.  It is a top-notch film, and both Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are the best they've ever been in their whole careers.  The plot is weak, but the dialogue and performances more than make up for it.  See it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have had this app installed for a couple of months now and have not had any problems with it.

B004UJTG6Q|2.0|I did not love it. Don't recommend reading it. I had to read it for English and did not enjoy it.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I truly love playing this game 247 manning games.  It's always a challenge and that is what I love about playing games like this. It keeps my mind working.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how it is all going to end . It a very bizarre twisted partnership but the bad part is that you can relate to a lot of the craziness because you have felt it before in your own relationships . Engrossing and hard to put down , like not wanting to see the mangled car crash but unable to look away
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Her stories are witty, gritty and don't pull any punches. Subjects normally glossed over in this genre are addressed head on. The situations of the characters are refreshingly realistic while remaining fantastically romantic. I'm finding everything I can by this author. Highly recommend.
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|The chuggington wooden trains are just great. My son just loves chuggington and playing with them when he watches the movies. The price and shipping were great.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this appxalowes you to get free diamond or butter you can get spawn eggs on pro this app is epic.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This collection of greatest hits also includes Catch My Breath, the first hit from her newer album. Like this CD because it has some of her \\"anthem\\" songs, which I think showcase her talent the best.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|I have read all of Elizabeth Strout's books because I enjoy the humanity of them.  Characters are explored in their outer appearance to others and their inner feelings.  They seem so real.  Like her other books, this one shows how people stumble through the difficulties of life and recover, with the aid of other people.  It is a lovely book.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This cd is beautiful.  It's a great cd for people who want to feel something when they listen to music.  Will never get tired of this cd.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it. I like the longevity of the game. I like the complexity of it and it's free which is awesome. I really enjoy this game as a pass time but I don't like how they try to get you to buy life constantly.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have had this game for a long time and still love it! I also purchased crossme color and have enjoyed that tremendously too! They update the game and add new puzzles to it every once in awhile. I look forward to the next update! Great and addicting game!
B00AB55BS0|3.0|So there they are, trudging across the tundra, the cold wind blowing hard. The men are all bundled up in thick animal furs. The women are all half naked. Hmmm...<br /><br />But it gets better. Up on &#34;the wall&#34;, where it's really cold and the ice is everywhere, nobody wears a hat. Multiple layers of fur coats and no hats? Really? And one wonders if the makers of this program have ever seen real snow? They certainly do a horrible job of simulating it.<br /><br />Ah, but here's the best part. Every episode has a few sex scenes, usually rather energetically portrayed. In one scene a young stud is slamming a sweet young thing from behind, his sweaty thighs making a loud smacking sound against her sweaty buttocks with every brutal thrust. He achieves what might seem to be a very satisfying climax, and no more than 4 to 5 seconds later he has withdrawn and we see him in full frontal nudity, his totally flaccid 10&#34; long member hanging straight down between his legs like badly overcooked linguini. Now, as a fully paid-up, card carrying member of the male gender, I can attest to the fact that it takes a bit longer in the real world for a penis to go flaccid. Perhaps HBO has some policy against the display of an erect human penis? I don't know if they do or not. But to go to all of the trouble to show something that is physiologically impossible just seems a bit silly.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a pretty good show.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love these books though I thought the first one was better I can't wait for the 3rd to come out !!!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really like this game, it is challenging. Like a lot of these types of games it is not so confusing as to what u are trying to solve. There are plenty of hints if u need them and the map is very clear. I was drawn in immediately.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Even though this soundtrack has a few Christmas songs I find myself playing it all year round.  If you liked the &#34;LOVE ACTUALLY&#34; movie this is a must have
B001KR9AP8|4.0|I like women with beautiful singing voices and Beyonce has that. I originally liked TLC and then my daughter had the song Halo on her laptop and so I checked this out. The price was low enough that I checked it out and ended up liking the most of the songs on the album.

B008I34YYY|1.0|Could have been a funny movie. But so badly done everyone involved should be embarrassed. Save your money and read a good book instead.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game and great design. As I said above, sight for sore eyes. Rich colors and graphics make it easy to play if you have some time to kill.
B008N1V11U|1.0|this isn't really a review but I really really really need you gameloft I have your game called modern combat and I looooove that game but it takes a hole lot of memory and I tried to get the batman game but it wouldn't fit in with the modern combat game so I just need you to really hold it at 0.99 so I could think about it it looks AWESOME so thanks and again great games really I hope you get this ok thanks
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book was a total cop out on Charlaine Harris' end. It's not even about Eric and Sookie. You can tell she was over this series for the last three books. She took every character that she spent 12 books building up and used the 13 th book to tear them down. I personally feel let down as a fan that Charlaine half heartedly wrote this book. If she was done with these characters then she should have stopped writing it instead of degrading the series.
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|I love this album and she came into the scene with a few other strong women singers that I enjoy. Excellent selection of songs that speaks to the times.
B009Y7YC2M|5.0|I tried the free version of this app and then quickly bought the pro version.  It works great for me.  It is simple, has a few good options, and I even record my podcasts with it (Found Footage Films Podcast and 80s Anthologies: Episode by Episode, btw).  Highly recommend for the average user.
B001NLKT60|3.0|I read to see if this would get any better than the first book and if she would get revenge. It is a pretty slow read. Hard book to keep my interest.
0767817664|5.0|This is quite the memorable 80's vampire flick that holds up quite well to this day.  Sure, the graphics can get a little dodgy but the performances and perfect casting make it great.  The story, while nothing ground-braking works perfectly here and the direction/pacing are just about perfect.  Everyone nails their roles and it has rewatch value just for being a fun movie to get into.  I love watching it with people that have never seen it - they all get into it right away and have a great time with it.  Like Christine, I would have loved to get it on blu-ray but that scumbag company that released it only does 3K copies and that of course makes the prices skyrocket.  Not doing it - the DVD will be just fine.  Highly recommended.
0345479092|5.0|Sent to my daughter-in-law for first baby who does not like to sleep at night.  She has read the first part of it already and says it is good common sense stuf.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the time period and the life lessons you can learn. It also has great characters on it. Great show.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|This film has memorable characters, an awesome car, great soundtrack and ends up being better than its usually given credit for.  Of course, its not perfect by any means but it serves its purpose quite well.  The pacing is decent although I'd argue that the final confrontation is a little underwhelming.  I would have actually liked a little more exposition added to this film to flesh it out even better.  I like how its never really revealed whats going on with the car.  Use your imagination.  The DVD video quality is acceptable.  I'd have loved to get the blu-ray but I refuse to pay gouge prices as this was limityed to just 3,000 copies on blu-ray.  The DVD is good enough for me.  I recommend this film for any who enjoy the genre.  You'll like it.

1400069289|5.0|I have always thought that if you want to get rid of a part of your life, a memory or a habit, you are left with a void that needs to be filled. If that void is not filled with another, memory or habit, then the part of your life you wish to be rid of will come back and fill that void.<br /><br />This book, The Power of Habit, builds on what I already learned from life. I mean, we all have habits and all this book does is create visible the once invisible- The cycle of cues, routines, and rewards- of habits. Of course, there are those that may find this book uninteresting, sociology or psychology majors/degrees maybe. However, for the rest of us who wants to create a foundation of future self-exploration or want to inspire change- this book is defiantly worth a read.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I have never had an issue with any of the DVD's I have purchased, and I have purchased quite a few.  I am a satisfied customer.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is a great Kindle app.  I have made several YouTube playlists, and this makes it easy to watch them on my Kindle.  Highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Use it daily for my devotion. Easy to handle. Different language bible version. Allows you to highlight text and adding notes.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome game, far more depth than first apparent. Save your prizes for the bonuses for greatest effect. Word minimum acquired.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three books, enjoyed each and the ending was a surprise didn't expect this as the end.  Look forward to more
B00CDT41RY|5.0|How refreshing! This was the best movie I have seen in a very long time. Character development was great, visually stunning backdrops and great surprise humor!  Although I am in no way a blood and guts kind of girl, I do realize QT has a panache for it, in this movie it was fitting. A brutal look at how inhumane slavery really was. And what never ceases to surprise me is how recently in our history as a country that it all occured, and how far we have come, and how hard we have to work to keep on acheiving this level of success for equality. It is so important to remember even though it is hard to watch, how these people were treated, so that nothing so despicable ever happens again.  A must see, and the best part was, you couldnt guess the ending!
1878424319|5.0|Life changing book.  Anyone can pick up this book and change their life!!!!!!  But, especially profound if you are a healer or if you have been in a life long search for the truth!!!<br /><br />Simple, spiritual and easy to absorb.  A quick read....the type of book you will want to keep for reference and/or re-read to incorporate into your life.  You will quickly see positive resuslts when you follow as it reads.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Its an Ok book because Abby the main female character is either dumb or bipolar . She consistently stays away from Travis even though she loves him. It is not clear why and it does not make sense. At times,very frustrating to read.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|rated pg-13......too scary for that!...do not watch alone just to see others react to all the mama &#34;gotcha's&#34;.beware and don't let young'uns watch!
B006TKP2B2|4.0|A truly unique view of our future.  This is one glimpse of what can happen when our natural resources are largely expended.
193700788X|5.0|I finished Dead Ever After well satisfied with the end of a series that I love.  Sookie has learned so much in such a short time!  I love her development.  As for vampires-  well we know they never change!  I don't see how the series could have ended in a more satisfactory manner.  Sookie remainded true to herself:  the self that is a sun worshiper, a lover of her human self , a woman who wants children.  Bravo Ms. Harris!
B009329ZF2|5.0|It is in my top 10 favorite movies of all times it keeps you entertained and can be watched over and over again without getting bored like most movies
B00B6QXN56|4.0|Love the mix, sound, grit.....old school type music with perfect delivery......even live!!!!!  The lyric are soulful and intense keeping me wanting to listen to it again and again.  It is such a gift to be the listener of a natural born musician with the voice of a healer.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Love john's sense of humor and the absurd .  Seems as though the agencies don't play too well together, scary thought.
1450419895|3.0|I bought this book looking for some new ideas for the gym. After getting book and going through it found this book sucks. I would not recommend it at all.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|One of the best animated movies, my daughters cant wait to see the new one!! Hey hope they make one when Bo meets kitty again.
B0000C6K09|5.0|Best Music Ever!  The case fell apart within a few days which is quite disappointing but the CDs work perfectly.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|My husband is a huge fan of Lady Antebellum.  He thinks the group, especially the female singer, are the very best country singers and he loves the stories they tell in their music.  This CD was a disappointment to him and to me.  Not bad, just not as good as their other CD's.
B00280LYIM|4.0|this one is a good book but don't  nave the smarts of the lighning thief and the characters  of the titand curse  but it is still a good book andis still worth the money plus the next book will not make sence if you do not read this one so donte hesitate to spend your alouance on this book buy it noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooi<br />w and i will tell you why 1it has noko in 2 it is a farly long book so that is why it is a good book
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Loved it. I'm not at Trekkie, which is probably why I liked it. But its a great movie with stunning visuals and the actors do not disappoint.
B004ZGI1V0|2.0|I don't mind a simple concept in a simple movie, or the simple plot where the acting is okay, but it this one repeats such an over-used plot it becomes trite; not anywhere near as well as so many of the others.  I stuck it out, expecting maybe to be surprised, only to find it rather boring, trite, and repetitive with filler thrown in to give it the minimal length needed to be considered a movie and not a short. Really, the entire concept could have been done in 30  minutes instead.  I'm surprised only to find it being rated so well by other viewers.  Maybe are they all youngsters without having seen this concept a zillion times already?  Who knows.  Anyway, simple entertainment - don't expect even the slightest surprise.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Fantastic acting. This will be a legendary film. It is a must buy. Heath Ledger was phenomenal. Story line is a bit choppy, but it works
B003TH14H4|5.0|Good show, great price, good quality streaming! I like that Amazon has the instant streaming service and offers it at a good price.
B0097K21YW|3.0|There is a bit of a learning curve on it, and the tutorials aren't super helpful.  Once you get going, it is fun, very much an angry birds kind of game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|this is a great read a blend of humor/action/adventureand even drama. so read this on your free time i know i did .and you see my ratings on all of rick roridans books for he is the best i know
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I don't have the time to write a long review but simply put, this movie is stellar. I love the Alien Franchise, especially Alien and Aliens. This movie brings to light some backstory to the franchise but still maintains the level of mystery that the movies are all about. CAN'T WAIT for the next one.
B001661RC2|3.0|nothing like 'Brothers' and 'El Camino'. It has some good individual songs but overall, hearing the whole album, I wouldn't put it as one of their best.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Flows from the previous novel beautifully. Fool let's historicity is great and the personal dramas of the players is great human drama.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Castle is quite a good show! I didn't want to get into it, but the characters draw you in. I watched an episode on TV and had to find out what happened before that episode! Amazon offered me a cheap way to catch up with the series- great price, good quality streaming.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This goes so far beyond the first hunger games. Can't wait to start reading the third book. Great story , captivating.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|im ganna make this short so i can read mor yay percys back its the best feelling ive ever had whel that and you know<br />kk
0783226845|5.0|I NOW HAVE IT ON DVD AND VHS. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? THE TANGO SCENE HAS BEEN PLAYED OVER AND OVER.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I loved this movie and it's a movie you must have as a part of your collections. It's a movie that you can watch over and over and have as a favorite. It's a part of history that we as should always remember and can't forget.
B00BOL126U|5.0|This show is awesome.  I have purchased the first season and am waiting very impatiently for the second (which has been renewed but not filmed yet..  darn it)<br /><br />The characters are fantastic, the acting is great, and the story line is very entertaining.  I don't mind watching battle scenes, but if you do this may not be the show for you- there is a lot of killing/ blood.  But then again, why are you watching a show about the vikings if this bothers you? They were savage.<br /><br />I could watch Travis Fimmel (the lead character) all day... so much hotter as a Viking than his other stuff.<br /><br />definitely recommend!!! I hope it keeps going for a long time
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never write reviews, but for this book I felt compelled to do so.<br /><br />This is probably THE BEST book I've ever read so far. Certainly the best one in the last 10 years at least.<br /><br />Read chapter 1 and you'll be doomed to read the entire book in hours and then to buy it's sequel. Simple as that.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This author combines sad, happy, discontent, and contentment all in her wonderful main character.  I felt like I would love to go meet him \\"for tea\\"'.  All characters are so well developed, there is no guessing to their personality traits.<br /><br />The story puts forth a hard truth of history that should not be forgotten but does not leave the reader in this dark place but uses it to develop her delightful Jamie.  It is a easy read that allows the reader the ability to contemplate how one can make the best of a horrible past and the need to reach out in love to those less fortunate in having been taught life skills in their early years of life.<br /><br />Thanks Christina McKenna for the reminder that as adults we have to always be aware of the need to share acceptance,
B00280LYHS|5.0|waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaa im sad that i will never read apercy jackson book ever again it was posibly the best book ever writen and can be shared by millions so pleSe buy this book
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I have read all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books.  He can't write quickly enough for me!<br />I think this is the best one yet.  Perhaps because the subject matter, and perhaps because of the wonderful ways the bad guys suffer and catch their demise.<br />Only fault with the book is that there's no gorgeous woman vying for his attention.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I ordere this for my husband. We got a new 55 in flat screen HGTV and the movie looks amazing.<br />Thanks
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best free app possible. Free puzzles and low cost others. it is great!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Watching this late in the game: Season 1 - I watched this on DVD and then purchased season two and three. At first, I was not interested in it; with the coaxing of my daughter, I gave it a chance. It is funny, fresh, and loveable. Sheldon grows on you being that he is the lead character.  After the first two episode I found it to be comic genius.  Especially Sheldon, actor Jim Parsons is an amazing talent!  It is a great show, you don't get tired of it.  It is comforting - terrific writing formula.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well this game is one of the best games in the world for some reason I always get hit by a bus anyway such a great game LOVE it for my 10 year old whoa is obsessed with this : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) !!!!!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I would like to see a longer intro. Need longer intro.  Makes me wonder if the full game will be short also. Good mystery.
B008VBYN80|5.0|So far so good, just started though.<br />Nice graphics don't like the need for spending more on more content<br />Thanks
1432794426|5.0|As a long-time fan and supporter of Michael Jackson, I have purchased many books written about Michael. I have often been highly upset when I commenced reading \\"some\\" of them, only to discover that the author/s in fact wrote negative and disturbing reports rather than positive one's, that their misleading titles may have led me to otherwise believe.<br /><br />I am happy to discover that there is finally a book about him that focuses on all of the positives --  Michael's humanitarianism, humility, passion, kindness, and courage.<br /><br />Thank you so much Karen.<br /><br />From<br />Debbie Jackson. (Long term MJ fan).
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I love this movie. My only negative was for the stream quality from amazon. I did a [...] test being plugged up to ethernet. I was running 22mbs download speeds. I have a blazing fast MacBook Pro and the quality was terrible. I immediately went to itunes and simply downloaded it in HD. I know on Amazon you can download to an approved device and watch in HD but I did not want to do that as I wanted to watch on my big apple monitor and thought this would be quicker.<br /><br />Revised-I spoke with Amazon and they refunded my purchase price. They suggested restarting router etc., but am in a hotel and that isn't an option. They say it was more than likely on the hotels end.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Such a good mystery.  Kept you interested.  Enjoyed it so much I have been re-reading Ken Follett's other books.<br /><br />It had a good ending, and not a predictable one.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Is think it's cool awesome gum disease and Grew the bad news and Agree the bad and we can segregate to be friends
0446585041|5.0|It's as though Ellen is right there in front of you. Never a dull moment in this book! Go get it already!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|While I know I have talked to some fans of the original Star Trek tv series and the movies from them (with Shatner and Nemoy and all), who didn't enjoy this movie, I think it was great.  It is a well done action adventure movie with good character development.  For people who maybe have never seen any other Star Trek material, or maybe have just a passing knowledge of the franchise, this an effective movie and introduction to the genre and universe.  Well worth the watch.
B008PWUU3W|5.0|I got the Timbuk2 sleeve to use as basic protection and storage of my Kindle Fire and it has been great. It is made of very high quality materials and does a great job of protecting my kindle while looking great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for basic protection for their Kindle Fire.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for a friend. I own a copy of this DVD myself but never, ever, would I lend it out, for fear I may never see it again! Apart from being one of the best &#34;live in concert&#34; recordings I've ever watched, I actually attended this same concert when The Eagles passed through Seattle during their Farewell I Tour.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Obviously, if you've read all the other books in this series, chances are you are going to read this one. That being said, I was disappointed. Basically, all the old characters come back through for one last hurrah, and then you're sort of left with &#34;life went back to normal, with a few life lessons learned&#34;. Not exactly the brilliant ending I'd wished for, but at least now it's over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play the Pc version of this game I love it CANT WAIT TILL THE UPDATE COMES WITB ONLINE SERVER!!!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|It's great. Lots of details. Maps, and charts, are a great visual of the Bible and have helped me understand the content.
B00821OX98|3.0|I was interested in watching the series although not enough to watch broadcasts. The post-apocalyptic scenario is a bit overdone. IN addition, I believe Spieberg could have found more talented writers. The plots are pretty predictable and many things the characters do are simply nonsensical. Will Patton plays perhaps the most nuanced character.
B00BUI6D2A|5.0|Album is pretty dope!  Definitely what I expected from Wayne!  Nice features as well, Gun walk is my favorite song
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|I read this book for my Church book club and really enjoyed it.  It was written really well and told her life story, surviving the holocaust without graffic details of the death camps.  I liked the way she included small details in her writing.
B00BHF9SHS|5.0|i got a signed copy from alisons website...and holy crap!!!!...it starts off very moody with \\"horizon flame\\"...then kicks up with \\"changeling\\", then her newest single \\"when i was your girl\\"...and runs right through the rest...\\"filigree\\" definitely has a yaz sound...the lyrics are very british, and very alison...i have been listening to it all weekend and i haven't done that in awhile...its a little yaz, a little hoodoo, a little hometime...just a fantastic album...she looks great, and i just wish she would tour here...she is also offering a red vinyl edition on her website...i would say run out and get it, but all that would entail would be to run to your computer and let your fingers do the walking...BRAVO ALISON!!!!!<br /><br />update-8/13/12<br /><br />Alison just released a live mp3 ep that includes-when I was your girl, filigree, nobodys diary, and don't go...definitely worth the 4 bucks...some new arrangements, and crowd doing back up

B000053V9F|5.0|\\"JFK\\" (1991) uses long monologues to keep the audience riveted.....the Oliver Stone and Co. screenplay is the star of a great show! Here's why......<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />If a Nobel Prize for movie screenplays resulting in incredible movie results were awarded, the writers of the \\"JFK\\" (1991) screenplay should get the first one..........<br /><br />Here are the official screenplay credits for \\"JFK (1991) starring Kevin Costner: Oliver Stone (screenplay) Zachary Sklar (screenplay) based on the Jim Garrison book \\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" and the Jim Marrs book \\"Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy\\" Two screen writers who used two books to fashion a truly hypnotic screenplay resulting in a wonderful, satisfying, riveting movie.<br /><br />\\"There are no good movies without good screenplays\\" saith the movie god sage, and this often repeated in \\"How To Write Good Screenplays\\" type books, of which there are many (many worth reading).<br /><br />How true! The current (2013) fashion and mania and center stage status of comic book, superhero \\"action\\" movies packed with special effects and computer generated images (CGI's!) is all about the LACK of good screen writing available to the movie industry, which serves a huge and profitable market (aka the world wide audience reading and willing to pay big money for the distraction from their awful lives provided by a good, entertaining movie), and substitutes video game type psychedelica (both visual and audio images and sounds) to dazzle without the need for mental logic or coherent ideas.<br /><br />Well......good screenplays are hard to come by, always were.<br /><br />The \\"JFK\\" (1991) screenplay resulted in a wonderful, magnetic, riveting movie packed with long, long, long compelling monologues delivered by wonderful, verbally capable actors (Kevin Costner, Donald Sutherland, others) which \\"action heroes\\" of fame and note (e.g. Clint Eastwood, bless him) could never have, and will never deliver.<br /><br />Clint, even in his 80's, can jump out of windows and slug bad guys, but he can't provide articulate, sustained intelligent long, long monologues filled with polysyllabic words and complex but logical ideas which go on and and on and on..and keep us all on the edge of our seats, and make us grateful we were lucky enough to see a great movie with almost NO \\"action\\" and visual crutches the \\"no ideas\\" \\"silent super hero\\" movies based on Marvel Comics types shove at us in current times (2013).<br /><br />Only well educated and articulate actors can \\"talk the talk\\" and present long, intelligent arguments, and \\"JFK\\" (1991) does that well, to it's credit.<br /><br />For those who don't know, \\"JFK\\" (1991) is a Kennedy assassination conspiracy movie based on Jim Garrison's assertions, legal actions, and book with help from yet another Kennedy assassination conspiracy book..<br /><br />What the brilliant Oliver Stone and his co-authors have done is simple and wonderful.<br /><br />They have taken a \\"single issue\\" argument and \\"cause\\" well known to the public and famous everywhere, and made a movie consisting of long, long monologues presenting in logical and articulate detail various related arguments in such zealous detail, any lawyer advocate of ability would be dazzled.<br /><br />And dazzled we, the audience, are....by this movie and it's simple device......logical long monologues presented by well equipped (for monologues) actors which are implicitly dramatic and appealing.<br /><br />\\"Single issue\\" causes (such as the Kennedy assassination conspiracy arguments) are dramatic and satisfying.<br /><br />They provide the audience with a good time for the same reason a good football game provides good times to onlookers.<br /><br />Logic, oddly, has very little to do with it all.<br /><br />\\"Single issue\\" causes not seriously challenged or contradicted (the case in \\"JFK\\" 1991) SEEM logical and deliver a delicious satisfaction to the audience.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with whether or not the \\"cause\\" presented is worthy or whether the conclusions advocated are accurate and true.<br /><br />It's all about the psychological satisfaction of hearing a good one sided case well presented which we've all heard about before, and can never know about completely....nobody can for most famous \\"single issue\\" causes of fame.<br /><br />And there are many, many, MANY \\"single issue causes\\" of fame over history which could ALSO be presented in movie form using the techniques of screen writing used in \\"JFK\\" (1991), which would make incredibly successful and satisfying movies (again, let us emphasize that logic has little to do with emotional and mental satisfaction...a good \\"single issue\\" movie filled with monologues must avoid on-screen challenges to the case it presents....the fact it's one sided is what will make it a successful movie!<br /><br />Richard Hofstader's brilliant book titled \\"The Paranoid Style In American Politics\\" (1952 Harvard U.

B003OBHVYU|5.0|Of course I love all things Fender!  I am a bass player, but really appreciate a good guitarist.  It was joy seeing Gary Moore and Joe Walsh in this video.  I downloaded for 48 hours for $2.99.  Well worth it.  Watched it several times!  Peace, M
B0056AP65I|5.0|I'm not an artist, but my mother is and she recommended this brand. These pencils are GREAT for note taking. The sharpener is screwed into the top of the pencil, which makes getting a nice point really simple. The leads are nice and thick, so they never snap. My mom wants her own set.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very well written. Consistently interesting and made you think. This book took me outside of my world and into the constant trials of a castaway at sea. Martel made it very easy to visualize the different scenes, trials, and joys in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
193700788X|4.0|(Small spoilers within)<br /><br />I was cautious about this book after reading all of the reviews here. Although I can understand some of the hurt that people expressed, I did not find this book to be untrue to the world Harris created. (With one exception, she did slightly change Sookie's power regarding shifters.) If you have read closely, the last several books have been leading in this direction. Some folks even predicted it in their reviews of the previous Sookie book. If you love Sookie, read on. If you are too big an Eric shipper to let go, skip it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Loved the novel. Loved this as well. Sticks closely to the novel and brings your favorite characters to life. I will watch this again and again and recommend it to all Austen fans.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|It is great to have this series on DVD to watch again and again.  Also came with great extras and additional information.  Can't say enough about this HBO series.

B000RGH4FQ|5.0|An album that is worth acquiring an original., Several of his albums this is one of those that I like,. and especially with the papas irene participation. I think the mastering should be even more definition. but with good volume appreciate the difference in the instruments compared to the first edition. A disc will repeat again and again., Is a classic disco, electronic, and chorus, very substantial.

0061900656|5.0|this book was very helpful for us as we were expecting a second addition to our family. my son loved the book as i started reading it while i was pregnant. it is not complicated to understand for a 3 year old new brother.<br /><br />fast shipping, great condition
B00000612P|5.0|There was a time where Rod Stewart was the greatest Rock and Roll singer out there.<br />This is the best record he ever did.<br />This is an excellent record, and not just to Rod's fans, every person that likes Rock music just take a listen to this.<br />Rod Stewart was still part of The Faces when this album came out, and it sounds very much like a Faces album. Ron Woods is all over the record playing guitars, bass and writing.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well written and very informative for all genders and all ages.  But it's especially good for all young women to read.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Really good story. Inspiring story. Makes you Want to go outside and start doing that thing you've always said you were going to do
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I enjoyed the first two Clifton Chronicles, but this one was a little flat.  Hopefully next one will be better. I will order it as I am a big fan of Jeffrey Archer.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|I was never much of a Redford fan, but he gives a good performance. Even though the &#34;high tech&#34; trappings in this movie are very low tech by todays standards (dinosaur computers, no cell phones, etc.), you will get caught up in the tension of Redford's plight. Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow are also fun to watch.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|This is a timeless film that is a must be in your library to watch again and again.  The acting, adventure and history is all amazing.
B002HP269O|2.0|I love this show only because it's the only show I know besides the real l word that focuses on the lives of lesbians. Season six got me down. It's simply too short and the ending had little to no impact on me. I'm hoping it was so lame because it was rushed due to being canceled or something. I mean yes some moments in season six I really enjoyed but overall I was disappointed. For the record I really would like to know who killed Jenny or if Jenny just killed herself instead of playing with different possibilities in my head but then again mystery isn't all bad I guess. Frankly i believe if Jenny did not do it herself it was Bette.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have been using the app for over a month and I'm ready to add my review now. Before I purchased I read every review and weighed the options carefully and as there are lot's of reviews written already I'll add some bullet points...<br /><br />Cons: Things that made me hold off buying initially from reviews I read<br />- Yes it asks for unusual permisions for an app like this but I haven't noticed and problems from that<br />- Yes it occasionally freezes and hangs, maybe once a week and I am a daily user. I do a force stop in applications and I'm on my way.<br />- Reviewers said it caused latency on their device... I have not found this to be the case but I have a fairly new Kindle Fire HD<br /><br />Pro's<br />- This is excellent for what it is... it is a Bible Reading app it is not a set of exhaustive Bible study tools and there are no add-on's that I am aware of.<br />- What I love are the countless Bible reading schedules that walk you through various portions of the Bible or topics.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried it.. it's free. If you don't like it you can just delete it from your device. No ad's or messiness with it. It's a clean app no malware/virus.<br />It is account based so you can also go to their website and log in and on your other devices and have access to you saved states.<br />You can post the scripture of the day or your completed reading plans to FB etc.. but I haven't seen where you can post any scripture to FB... it's not obvious if it's there and I haven't done any investigation into it.<br /><br />**Update June 3rd**<br />Since writing this I have learned that I had a network problem at home and most of the times the bible app stopped were because of that glitch. I love this app and use it daily for my personal study with God!
B002GTZSZU|5.0|I wish American youth understood the importance of History, Music and / or otherwise!<br />Maybe so many things would not be... Repeated.
B003XU3MWM|3.0|This move was very bloody, but rather pedestrian. The characters were mostly forgettable, except for Michael Fassbender, who is always fun to watch. Who can pass up seeing him without his shirt on?
0316287059|5.0|Explains in detail how to accomplish several looks and how to contour different faces, it also has picture guides to make it a lot easier
B004EWFV9K|4.0|I've read a few of the Wallander books, out of order. I began this with no knowledge that it was to be the last. I am beginning my second year of infatuation with Scandinavian crime authors.<br /><br />As others have stated, some pieces were left unanswered (messy desk drawer, rock by shoe, etc). And I find the writing to be a bit choppy, filled with fairly short sentences. I personally was not drawn to the disappearance of the in-laws story line much, I felt it was a vehicle to allow us to watch him grapple with the end of his life.<br /><br />But, I seriously enjoyed this book. Again, I learn more about Swedish society, but best of all, I connected with Wallander on a melancholic level. People complain that he acted like he was 80 instead of a young 60 year old. But, I see him as an intrinsically melancholic, introspective man. How many years of his life were wasted, all the years of separation from his daughter, the realization that his marriage with Mona was a failure. He watched his father lose himself to dementia.<br /><br />For another kind of personality, finding the bright lining, cheerful, upbeat, sanguine or phlegmatic, of course one could figure out how to see all these life issues in a different way, but he was not. He was a deeply melancholic man aware of all his losses, unable to focus on what was good and true in his life (except for his beautiful granddaughter).<br /><br />Being introspective, he realizes what it means to be moving into dementia and the ensuing losses. Of course he should focus on living life fully, but, he's a melancholic and won't / can't.<br /><br />I read this book nearly 2 months ago and am still deeply moved by it. Of course, I am a melancholic and it colors how I see things.
0525953728|5.0|Captivating!  Interesting to get an inside look at the workings of the soldiers than work behind the scenes risking their lives every day.<br />These are the professional &#34;cream of the crop&#34;.<br />I love reading the real life stories of the men (and women) who make protecting our country a career.  And knowone knows who or where they are.  True to life hero tales.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|movie. makes me wanna try some bigger backcountry mountains and spines. hope to see alaska some day. want more movies like this
B009NX409M|5.0|Wow, this was a great movie.  I love Merl Streep and Robert Deniro is awesome.  Everyone should see this one.
B002CIMKHO|5.0|Any Clint Eastwood fan will enjoy this movie. You'll get the guttural Eastwood utterances as he intimidates the bad guys. And, through the hard exterior you'll see the inner softie who does care about his neighbors and just wants people in his old neighborhood to do what's right. When the villains just won't back down, he takes it to them in a surprise ending. I watched it with a 14 and 11 year old. Some will object to the frequent swearing but the characters wouldn't be believable without it. And besides, the kids weren't hearing anything that they don't hear on the school bus every day. Great family movie unless you're a prude.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Mad Catz Makes the Cybor R.A.T 7/9, I used 7 and it was giving me issues after sitting in a hot starage container for 7 months. Need a new mouse, this was recommended and I would recommend it to others. Its got the comfort features of the Logitec Gaming mice as far as weight and feel go (great for big hands and non-claw style grips) great set of software loaded in and the added button in on the left side work all three: ctrl, shift, alt buttons by default. Get a good HARD mouse pad though, one of the ones from Steelseries and this mouse will love you till it dies.
B00C7L2QCA|5.0|Exceptional all the way around -- story, acting, staging, cinematography.  Strange to find a series about serial killers and cannibalism so beautiful, but that is what has been achieved here.  I would not consider this the healthiest of shows to watch simply because of its subject matter; however, it is beautiful and deserves deep and wide acclaim.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|the show just keeps getting better. I love the books so when I found the series I had to have it. while it differs greatly from the books the series is fantastic. I hate to say it but I love the series more than the books
