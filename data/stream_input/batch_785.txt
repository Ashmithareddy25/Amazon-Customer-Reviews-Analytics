B0013D8LOU|5.0|Best movie of the year by far.  The 2-disc DVD is definitely worth buying, and is full of informative, entertaining features.  Helena Bonham-Carter is absolutely wonderful as Mrs Lovett, and Johnny Depp is a surprisingly good singer.  Alan Rickman is perfectly cast as the judge, and Timothy Spall is wonderfully, skin-crawlingly disgusting as Beedle.  Tim Burton's depiciton of Victorian era London is visually beautiful, and at the same time makes you feel that you could catch the plague just from looking at it.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|this movie is a must have to really show off the capability of blu-ray and your high def tv. the picture is amazing as is the sound. i highly recommend. i also love the movie itself but that is a personal preference. a must have if you like sci-fi and want to see amazing picture.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The cover says it all, the rebellion and anger that the Ramones had with rock music at the time. Many people like the Ramones back then had thought that Rock music became too complex and bands like the Ramones wanted to bring Rock back to its roots. The Ramones first album self titled, \\"Ramones\\", is probaly one of the greatest punk albums ever made and has remained a classic album to this day. 14 tracks in total each and every song on here has basic rock beats and loud guitars and british style singing make this album great.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I ALWAYS RECEIVE GREAT SERVICE AND ADVICE ON AMAZON. THIS SELECTION WAS ONE AMAZON RECOMENDED FOR ME AND IT IS A TERRIFIC MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. IT HAS GREAT MORALS, LAUGHTER, SADNESS, AND MOST OF ALL IT'S REAL. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR TEENAGERS! A MUST SEE...ENJOY!
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N Roses started out in 1985 in California and in that same year recorded a live EP. Than in 1986 they got a record deal with Geffen and recorded what would be known as, \\"Appetite For Destrucion\\". Perhaps one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time and by far the best GNR album there is out there. Every song on here is just great. A true classic album.<br /><br />  All the songs sound really good and all the instruments do too. Some key tracks on here are, Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child O Mine, Paradise City, and many more.<br /><br />1. Welcome To The Jungle 5/5 stars<br />2. Its So Easy 5/5 stars<br />3.

B0014XCMVM|4.0|Even though her only other album that I have is 'Jagged Little Pill', I'm quite a fan of Alanis Morissette; but her distinctive music is an acquired taste and will not appeal to everyone. 'Flavors of Entanglement' is a collaboration with Guy Sigsworth - electronica whizz kid from my own sunny shores; he produced the album and co-wrote the songs (but AM wrote the lyrics - and can't you just tell). Her vocals sound a little mellower than on 'Jagged', but they still retain much of her earlier quirkiness - and she is definitely in fine form vocally.<br /><br />The combination of electronica and AM's idiosyncratic style isn't quite a 'marriage made in heaven' (more a burgeoning love affair), but I think the balance is about right - thanks, in no small part, to some gutsy vocals from AM, which she projects with laser-guided precision. The synthesized sounds are both interesting and exhilarating, but there can be no denying that the real substance of this album, is in the songs (especially the lyrics) and AM's delivery of them. One only has to listen to 'Not As We' and 'Torch', to realize that AM is still more than capable of rendering some stirring songs with well crafted lyrics, without resorting to an over-reliance upon electronic wizardry.<br /><br />Some comments about may favourite tracks :<br /><br />CITIZEN OF THE PLANET - The song starts with synth laden strains of 'Arabian Nights' - pleasant, 'easy on the ear' stuff. However, don't get too 'cumfy', because the chorus which follows, with its fusion of powerful vocals and high density synths, will literally blast you into the cosmos. Strange lyrics (but great to listen to) - something to do with sacrificing family ties to go forth and seek 'enlightenment' by experiencing the wider world (I think).<br /><br />VERSIONS OF VIOLENCE - Another high-octane offering, with pulsating electronic pyrotechnics aplenty - including some noteworthy bass harmonics. AM sings in two different keys on this one. The overall sound is somewhat reminiscent of Evanescence and, arguably, the track is a little over-produced.<br /><br />NOT AS WE - A wistful, slow tempo song with piano accompaniment only, and featuring ethereal vocals and exceptionally fine lyrics. AM reflects, with sadness, upon (yet another) relationship which has crumbled. She puts on a brave face ('I'm faking it, 'til I'm pseudo making it') - but, at the same time, the song is tinged with a sort of 'life goes on' resilience ('...... begin again but this time I as I, And not as we'). 'Torch' has a similar theme, and is also fairly light on the electronics.<br /><br />MORATORIUM - Fans of sequenced drum loops (at least, I think that's what they are) should enjoy this track; also, listen out for some ghostly chorals (electronic, of course) in the background. I liked the song for its lyrics - AM is telling us that emotional relationships are all 'getting a bit too much' for her, and she needs a break. Scarcely original, but she manages to convey this sentiment in four different ways by her colourful use of words - and besides, any songwriter who can work a word(?) like 'focusless-ness' into the lyrics, gets my vote.<br /><br />Of the remaining songs, only 'Underneath' comes as a disappointment; it's due for release as a single, so it must have something about it. I guess a lot of people will like it, but I'm afraid it didn't push many of my buttons. I don't dislike 'Incomplete', it's a pleasant (almost folksy) song but, within the context of the album', it's a bit too 'pretty' for me.<br /><br />To sum up, 'Flavors of Entanglement' is a rather mystifying melange of disparate vocals, sharp (if occasionally impenetrable) lyrics, frequent tempo changes and techno trickery. It's an album that can be enjoyed in it's entirety - but I found it easier to take in small doses. 'Flavors of Entanglement' is a good example of well executed modern pop-rock (but for grown-ups only?). Apart from maybe 2 or 3 tracks, not recommended for lovers of soothing music.ing music.
B000002H97|5.0|Commonly reffered too as The Black Album this album is really just self titled, Metallica. Realesed in 1991 it would come too be one of the most popular metal albums of all time and become another great classic rock record. Taking almost a year too do which was pretty unheard of for metal albums at the time since most metal albums before that would not take nearly as long. This album changed all that. From Enter Sandman too The Struggle Within this album just keeps on rocking throughout the entire album with heavy guitars and heavy beats and great solos this is a non stop metal album. Also containing so many classic Metallica songs, Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters, and more. In fact this metal album is the first too include classical music on it as on Nothing Else Matters there is some ochresta stuff in there which may of been kind of risky too Metallica's image. Compare too the bands first album, \\"Kill Em All\\", the songs are slower on this album but still have heavy riffs and great solos and cool drums on them. It also marked the end of an era for Metallica it was really there last great album and they were never the same again, what would come after this album was a two year world tour than a break and than the two not so great albums load and reload. Than a 2 disc nothing special tribute cd. Than in 2003 the band would release St. Anger which nearly broke the band up, and than this years fast Death Magnetic. What i am saying is The Black Album has become one of the most influential metal albums of all time and is one of the best metal albums you can get your hands on.<br />And its still being bought all the time....
0765348780|2.0|Based on all the buzz over this series, I had high hopes for this book.  But unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.    Sure, the book does not follow any of the old fantasy conventions, it has a lot of characters to keep track of, there is magic all over the place, and there are several convoluted plots to get your brain around.  If that is all you want, then this is the book for you.      All of that would be fine to me too, but it was just so sloppy, and completely arbitrary.  The common theme that kept coming up in the book is the spinning coin of Oponn, the God of Luck.  Oponn influences \\"earthly\\" events quite randomly, with no apparent purpose - the flipping of the coin.  And that's exactly the way the book was written.  Scenes, actions, creatures, and characters all appeared and interacted in such a arbitrary way.  I understood the book well enough.  I just didn't care what happened!    And that brings me to my other criticism, which you could certainly argue against.  I think for any novel to work, it has to truly engage the heart of the reader.  It has to provide some sort of story about the human condition.  Otherwise, particularly in fantasy, you get just a bunch of made-up stuff that was created just for the sake of it.  To me that can be fun, but it is really just empty if the reader gets nothing more than mental images and a new catalog of characters and monsters.      This book seemed to set the stage for perhaps more interesting story lines.  Even the term \\"Ascendants,\\" for the gods - implies that these gods were once mortals.  Maybe some character will strive to become a god.  That would be an interesting storyline that might be touched on later.  Even so, I don't think I'll read the next book, unless I am desperate!
B000001ESP|5.0|A classic progressive rock album. This has too be one of the greatest rock albums made of all time defenentally in the top 100 greatest albums of all time. Everything on here sounds great the drums vocals etc. Rush was becoming a big band around this time Rush was becoming a pretty big band and Moving Pictures made them huge. It has sold millions and millions of copies around the world.<br /><br /> Some of Rush's greatest songs are on this album, Tom Sawyer, YYZ, Limelight, and many other great songs. To date Rush still plays some of the songs on this album live. This album is just perfect in every single way. Plus the price on here is too beat only 7.97 that is a great deal. All in all if you like rock music you should buy this album of Rush and these other two albums, 2112, Farewell To Kings.
B001ATNPCK|5.0|Never before have I written a review for a CD on here, but this definitely deserves to be the first.    Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace is an incredible album, there's never a dull moment. These guys have been my favorite band since I was nine years old and records like this is why they're still the best in my book.     Overall, this album is pretty dark compared to more recent works. There aren't any joke songs (Don't Pick It Up, When You're in Prison) and there's no overproduced pop single (Hit That, Pretty Fly) either. In fact, the single \\"Hammerhead\\" is about a school shooting. The music video is pretty disturbing too.     There isn't a song on here that isn't a stand-out track, each song has it's strengths whether it's a \\"classic Offspring\\" song or something fresh and new. I especially enjoyed Dexter's new style of singing in \\"A Lot Like Me.\\" Check it out.    5/5

B00168OINK|5.0|Ok, I admit, I went to the theatre a bit negatively pre-biased.  Sure, the previews I saw were mildy funny and I do like Jack Black, but I thought Kung Fu Panda would be yet another vapid kids' animated movie with anthropomorphized animals saying cleverly planned puns and adultish in-jokes and that the funniest scenes were probably already shown in the trailer to draw audiences in.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised to be wrong.  Kung Fu Panda is hilarious and well-made, and though it is clearly aimed at kids, it was tremendously entertaining and satisfying for adults too.  The movie was pretty evenly funny throughout, with occasional uproarious hilarity, esp from Jack Black.  Like, have you ever gotten a comic image stuck in your head and you (embarrassingly) find yourself chuckling outloud, by yourself, for minutes after the audience stopped laughing?  Well, there were several moments like that in this movie for me.  There was a subtle, clever layer of humour particularly in some of the facial expressions, and I even found some of the side storylines genuinely touching, like the relationship between the son, a chubby panda (voiced by Jack Black) and the kind-hearted, noodle-shop owner father, a stork (voiced by James Hong).  The villain, a cloud leopard with sinister glowing eyes, is really menacing and scary (believe it or not), enough to scare some small kids into tears, so be forewarned.  The whole production, the \\"legendary\\" tale, authentic movements, and background sets really HONOR the Kung Fu movie tradition more than parody it, I thought.  I mean to say, the Kung Fu itself was pretty good (though it's animated and practiced by animals).  The animation was superb, and in particular, some of the food they showed was just mouth-watering (it really made us crave Chinese dumplings and noodles).  Lastly, I'd like to add that I went to the movie theatre without knowing who the voice cast was.  I only knew that Jack Black was in it.  Watching as the end credits rolled, we were just as entertained (again) in discovering the great (and distinguished) voice talent behind the animation.  I was actually able to correctly guess one person (the Rhino captain of the Prison guards), though everyone's voice will be vaguely familiar.<br />I highly recommend Kung Fu Panda for the whole family.rolled, we were just as entertained (again) in discovering the great (and distinguished) voice talent behind the animation.

0783114222|5.0|and had forgotten just how good this mini-series was.  I last saw it when it was broadcast on TV in NZ.  I had always meant to buy the series .. but ... just didn't until now. I can only reinforce all the other positive reviews as to the quality of production and the outstanding performances of all the actors and actresses.    You will not regret buying this mini-series.  It reminds us of a time when we did things not because they were fast and easy with instant gratification, but because they were hard and required focus and dedication to the task at hand.    The SCREEN FORMAT question: I bought the original '98 release as I felt it more important to not loose any subtitle information etc while watching on our 16x9 format TV, so I was expecting the sidebars on screen from the 1.33:1 image.  I don't know if our TV is automatically reformatting it to 16x9 but it fills the screen, and there is no lose of image that I can see/remember.  Subtitles are there, as is the stuck thruster that a recent reviewed mentioned was missing from the widescreen format.    In watching and remembering this my only regret has nothing to do with the mini-series itself ... it's the fact that somewhere along the way we seem to have lost our direction in our Journey from the Earth to the Moon.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|I adore all of DKM's efforts including this one, however, Blackout is their zenith. One of the best albums ever produced IMO.

006135323X|4.0|Predictably irrational or Unpredictably rational?    This book entertains as well as it explains. So read it. What the book doesn't mention is the paradigm clash between \\"irrationality\\" (studying circumstances that occasion choices which do not appear to be optimal) and \\"unpredictability\\" (studying unpredictable behaviors that are often optimal despite the appearence that they are irrational)camps of behavioral economics. For a comparison with an alternative paradigm, after you finish this book you might want to try reading Paul Glimcher's work on neuroeconomics (which uses game theory to explain why the rational course of action is often to behave unpredictably).
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|I wasnt quite sure what to think about the 17-year gap between studio releases, but Donna has teamed up with some fresh tallent and the results are good.    Nothing will ever bring back or equal the fantastic work from the 70's, but this I feel is a solid effort and would say that it is \\"contemporary\\".    Naturally any hard core Summer fan will like this project, and I feel she may actually attract some new fans and popularity.    Well worth the money and an enjoyable listen!    (Personal favorite, track 5 \\"Fame\\" a collaboration between Donna and Justin Timberlake)    Brian
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|When I bought this album, I was ecstatic as I awaiting its first (and last) play through the stereo. I was horribly disappointed and I stated such to my best friend.    For the woman who had possibly the most beautiful voice of all times (MacArthur Park, On The Radio, Last Dance, Our Love, etc.)... to hear her thin, deeper voice is heartbreaking. She almost sounds like Debarge from the early 1980s. My first (and lasting) impression is...    God should never let Donna Summer's wonderful voice age. Some artists should be able to share their magic for all eternity. Donna is one of those few rare treasures of life. I would have wished that she would have never lost her amazing voice - but alas (according to this release) she has. The only remnants of that beauty comes when she sings off-key to hit those high notes, which is very thin in its recording sound.    I love Donna... and I still hope to see you in concert some day. But I am so glad I have so many of your original albums on cd. CRAYONS will not be among my play list.    John
B0015519VS|5.0|I did enjoy Usher's previous album Confessions, but I did think it could be a bit over-rated. I didn't see what made it so much better than My Way or 8701. Although I am a big fan of Usher, I was nervous about this album, because I wasn't sure of the direction he was going with his music and I wasn't sure if I was gonna like his new music. I was starting to feel like my favorite music of his was his older stuff, and the newer tracks of his that had gotten the most attention didn't appeal to me as much as his older music and certain over-looked newer tracks. I was afraid that he was going to move in a direction that satisfied the people who loved the music I didn't care as much for, and leave me behind in the midst of it all. But I was extremely surprised that he didn't do that, and I am proud to say that this is my FAVORITE album of his. Although My Way is a classic, I know that the only reason I'm battling between whether Here I Stand or My Way is my favorite, is simply that alone, because My Way is a classic. So therefore, I have to let My Way gives its crown to this album. Especially considering the fact that My Way is only ten tracks long, and this album has more than ten HIGHLIGHTS.    \\"Love In This Club\\" was very strong first single, it's both marketable and pleasurable. But as much as I like the song, I didn't want an entire album following the same formula. When I heard the second single, \\"Moving Mountains\\", I felt way better about the album. It was raw emotion, and that was something that I wanted, that I didn't get with \\"Love In This Club.\\" \\"Moving Mountains\\" is probably the best single Usher's released since.... Well, I almost wanna say ever. I knew the album would be worth getting after hearing this song. The Dream helped pen the sexiest track on the album, \\"Trading Places,\\" a creatively written song about a couple switching their sexual and domestic roles for one night. One of the major highlights on the album is Usher's collaboration with Jay-Z, \\"BestThing,\\" which battles with one other song to be the best track on the album. It definitely wins the award for the best upbeat track on the album. The best ballad on the album is the Bryan-Michael Cox-penned \\"Before I Met You.\\" It's a somewhat dark sounding ballad, where he invites his woman to reminisce with him on the life he used to lead and the person he used to be before she helped change him. Stargate and Neyo helped penn another dark ballad called \\"His Mistakes,\\" where Usher refuses to stay in a relationship where he is forced to pay for a previous man's mistakes.  This song is also a favorite of mine, next in line to \\"Before I Met You\\" and \\"Best Thing.\\" \\"Appetite\\" is a mid-tempo track about trying hard to suppress his ergs for other women in order to stay faithful. This song has a great beat and is greatly written, and you can't help but love it. And last but not least, another big highlight of the album is another Stargate production called \\"What's A Man To Do.\\" The production and instrumental of the track are indescribably sick. The song is a ballad about being in love with your current significant other but at the same time, still not over someone you claimed to be in your past. The thing that I love most about his album is the raw emotion, not only in the lyrics and in Usher's singing, but in the music itself. The album is full of excellent production and powerful music.  HIS BEST ALBUM TO DATE.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Too bad Rod Serling is dead because I think he would have made more sense of the time travel stuff in this movie.  Or even the Back to the Future writers.  Lake House had too many loose ends and made very little sense in the end.  Actually it is a bit confusing to classify this as a time travel movie because it appears that only a dog and some letters in a mailbox travel through time.  The mailbox is a portal to the past, but the person being communicated with in the past lives in the present as well, but is getting communications two years before the present time.  Confused?  I was too.  As for the other elements of the movie, I thought it was a nice romance and Sandra Bullock is charming as always.  This could have been a really great movie with just a little more thought as to how to make some sense on the time differences.  The guy who is an architect and getting communications in the past from the girl who lives in the present ends up dead according to his brother, but then he doesn't get killed after all because he gets warned in the past before the event by the girl, so he avoids the danger.  The problem is the brother has just said he died, so which is it?  There is never a satisfactory explanation as to how he could have died, but then been warned so he didn't die.  Nonsensical.  Does this suddenly change the memory of the brother?  It is never explained or explored.  Did they really think we would buy this?  Only the actors saved this from being a complete disaster.  It's not a bad movie; just nothing special.
B0010DGYJW|5.0|I've recently discovered this album, and was completely blown away.  I had written W.A.S.P. off as a hair band that was about nothing more than sex and violence (not that I have a big problem with that), but with that being said this is one of the most intelligent, multi-layered albums I have ever heard.  Blackie Lawless oozes pure emotion on this album, more so than anyone else I can think of in the metal genre.  His flair for amazing melodies that stick in your head is unprecedented, and your hunger will be so great to hear them all again that you'll find yourself just pressing repeat on your player and leaving it there for days.     The album is based on a semi-autobiographical story about a troubled youth growing up to become the star he wanted to be, and finding it to be more than he bargained for.  Blackie taps into many different moods and still manages to weave all of the tracks together to tell a very mesmerizing and cohesive tale.  This may very well be the greatest concept album of all-time.  And just in case these words don't seem to carry any validity to you coming from someone who's credibility you know nothing about, it's up there with both Keeper albums by Helloween, head and shoulders above Mindcrime by Queensryche, and neck and neck with Seventh Son by Maiden...yes that's right, the granddaddy of all metal, the mighty Iron Maiden.     As far as this edition goes, it's quite a bargain for 2 discs and is worth every penny and much more.  The true album is the first 10 tracks on disc 1, with the bonus being the spoken word 16 minute story of Jonathan, the title character.  Disc 2 has some good bonus songs and demos, with a nice array of live extras from the earlier W.A.S.P. era.  All this is well and good, especially since the price is the same as a single album, but in truth the original story is the treasure to be found here and should be listened to as a standalone product as it was meant to be in the first place.  Buy this now and know true happiness.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|The best thing about Alanis Morissette is that she wears her heart on her sleeve through her music, and new album \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" is no exception. She realizes there is strength in vulnerability, and with that knowledge shares her growth as an individual as well as a musician.<br /><br />The pearls of wisdom beyond her years typical of Morissette abound in this new collection, but thanks in large part to producer Guy Sigsworth these songs have more edge and grit than anything she's released since the '90s. These songs sway, caress, mesmerize and most definitely rock. Those seeking a return of the so-called \\"angry\\" Alanis from 1995's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" will probably never come any closer to it than this new record, but this time around she is older and wiser, and the songs are stronger for it.<br /><br />Morissette is able to be thoroughly autobiographical yet remain accessible. She will easily resonate here with those struggling to cope with death, whatever kind of death that may be. She has mentioned repeatedly in interviews hitting \\"rock bottom\\" upon demise of her engagement to actor Ryan Reynolds and how that informed \\"Flavors...\\" The album certainly reflects death - in this case, death of a relationship. Never hiding her bruises, she nevertheless moves forward toward the light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />Rockers like the righteous \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" (My frontier is on an airplane/My prisons: homes for rehabilitating) and \\"Versions of Violence\\" rub shoulders easily with sunny melodies like \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable\\" and melancholy ballads like \\"Not As We,\\" but despite the variety there are no particular standouts amid the album's slim 11 tracks, and that is a benefit here; \\"Flavors...\\" is thoroughly an album in the classic `70s sense. These songs, while certainly able to stand alone, unravel in succession, letting Morissette narrate a story. Because of this, a selection like lead single \\"Underneath\\" with its radio-friendly production and insightful lyrics (\\"Spotlight on these seeds of simpler reasons/This core, born into form, starts in my living room\\") sits comfortably aside the angry, swirling \\"Straitjacket\\" (\\"One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not met me.\\")<br /><br />This album may have been a long time in coming, but lyrics like these from the urgent, chest-pumping \\"Moratorium,\\" which snap and jerk amid Sigsworth's spellbinding production, prove it was worth the wait:<br /><br />\\"I declare a moratorium on things relationship/I declare a respite from the toils of liaison/I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement/I declare a full time-out from all things commitment.\\"<br /><br />The loss she chronicles reaches its apex on the downcast, revelatory \\"Torch\\" (\\"I never thought I'd have to lay down my torch for you\\") but simmers down on \\"Giggling Again For No Reason,\\" where she clears her head with a spontaneous drive out of LA to take in the California sunset and feel the ocean against her skin. \\"I can feel the bones are smiling in my body,\\" she sings. \\"I can see the meltings of inhibition.\\" Sigsworth's sparkling production and the rapturous melody fit the song like a glove, making it an ideal summer tune.<br /><br />Though she's giggling again, she can't turn off the \\"Tapes\\" in her head that fill her with inaccurate, unfair self-appraisals (\\"`I am someone easy to leave/Even easier to forget'/A voice, if inaccurate\\") that continue to foster her insecurities. Nevertheless, on the disc's hearty conclusion, the bittersweet, rousing \\"Incomplete,\\" she proudly owns her flaws and the humanity they underscore with a new outlook on life:<br /><br />\\"I have been running so sweaty my whole life urgent for a finish line/I have been missing the rapture this whole time of being forever incomplete.\\"<br /><br />Morissette continually proves herself to be the underappreciated poet laureate of this generation's contemporary singer/songwriters. She has a sharp insight into the human condition that is uniquely hers. By inviting listeners along on her journey of self-discovery she helps them gain insight into themselves as well, all the while entertaining. She is certainly a force to reckon with.<br /><br />The few extra dollars are worth investing for the deluxe edition, which comes with 5 leftover compositions from the album's sessions in addition to 6 eye-catching photograph/lyric cards. The bitter, self-critical \\"The Guy Who Leaves\\" sizzles with tingly electronic beats and swirls amid Morissette's urgents vocals, while \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Madness\\" are both understated, poignant, positively beautiful ballads. Bittersweet coming-of-age tale \\"Limbo No More\\" has a profoundly moving orchestral arrangement, while the joyous, folksy \\"On the Tequila\\" is set to turn more than a few heads. It is not for lack of quality but simply because they do not fit the scheme of the album that these songs are not included on this standard version.

0061122416|1.0|I picked up this book with an open mind, wondering what all the hype was about.  It turns out it's all about hype.  This is not literature; it's a string of trite self-improvement bromides.  Of all the gushy blurbs on the cover, the most outrageous is the one that compares it to Voltaire's Candide.  It may be a story about a quest, but there the similarity ends.  Lovers of Candide should imagine that book, stripped of all its nuance and narrative richness, and populated by stick figures who ponderously (and repetitively!) intone Big Thoughts.  And in the end, those thoughts wind up being nothing more than that this IS the best of all possible worlds, in which anyone with pluck and determination can go to El Dorado, become fabulously rich, and then head back to Westphalia, secure in the knowledge that Cunegonde will be waiting faithfully.  Some may find this fluff uplifting, but I'm going back to Voltaire.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|The best thing about Alanis Morissette is that she wears her heart on her sleeve through her music, and new album \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" is no exception. She realizes there is strength in vulnerability, and with that knowledge shares her growth as an individual as well as a musician.<br /><br />The pearls of wisdom beyond her years typical of Morissette abound in this new collection, but thanks in large part to producer Guy Sigsworth these songs have more edge and grit than anything she's released since the '90s. These songs sway, caress, mesmerize and most definitely rock. Those seeking a return of the so-called \\"angry\\" Alanis from 1995's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" will probably never come any closer to it than this new record, but this time around she is older and wiser, and the songs are stronger for it.<br /><br />Morissette is able to be thoroughly autobiographical yet remain accessible. She will easily resonate here with those struggling to cope with death, whatever kind of death that may be. She has mentioned repeatedly in interviews hitting \\"rock bottom\\" upon demise of her engagement to actor Ryan Reynolds and how that informed \\"Flavors...\\" The album certainly reflects death - in this case, death of a relationship. Never hiding her bruises, she nevertheless moves forward toward the light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />Rockers like the righteous \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" (My frontier is on an airplane/My prisons: homes for rehabilitating) and \\"Versions of Violence\\" rub shoulders easily with sunny melodies like \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable\\" and melancholy ballads like \\"Not As We,\\" but despite the variety there are no particular standouts amid the album's slim 11 tracks, and that is a benefit here; \\"Flavors...\\" is thoroughly an album in the classic `70s sense. These songs, while certainly able to stand alone, unravel in succession, letting Morissette narrate a story. Because of this, a selection like lead single \\"Underneath\\" with its radio-friendly production and insightful lyrics (\\"Spotlight on these seeds of simpler reasons/This core, born into form, starts in my living room\\") sits comfortably aside the angry, swirling \\"Straitjacket\\" (\\"One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not met me.\\")<br /><br />This album may have been a long time in coming, but lyrics like these from the urgent, chest-pumping \\"Moratorium,\\" which snap and jerk amid Sigsworth's spellbinding production, prove it was worth the wait:<br /><br />\\"I declare a moratorium on things relationship/I declare a respite from the toils of liaison/I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement/I declare a full time-out from all things commitment.\\"<br /><br />The loss she chronicles reaches its apex on the downcast, revelatory \\"Torch\\" (\\"I never thought I'd have to lay down my torch for you\\") but simmers down on \\"Giggling Again For No Reason,\\" where she clears her head with a spontaneous drive out of LA to breathe in the California sunset and feel the ocean against her skin. \\"I can feel the bones are smiling in my body,\\" she sings. \\"I can see the meltings of inhibition.\\" Sigsworth's sparkling production and the rapturous melody fit the song like a glove, making it an ideal summer tune.<br /><br />Though she's giggling again, she can't turn off the \\"Tapes\\" in her head that fill her with inaccurate, unfair self-appraisals (\\"`I am someone easy to leave/Even easier to forget'/A voice, if inaccurate\\") that continue to foster her insecurities. Nevertheless, on the disc's hearty conclusion, the bittersweet, rousing \\"Incomplete,\\" she proudly owns her flaws and the humanity they underscore with a new outlook on life:<br /><br />\\"I have been running so sweaty my whole life urgent for a finish line/I have been missing the rapture this whole time of being forever incomplete.\\"<br /><br />Morissette continually proves herself to be the underappreciated poet laureate of this generation's contemporary singer/songwriters for this generation. She has a sharp insight into the human condition that is uniquely hers. By inviting listeners along on her journey of self-discovery she helps them gain insight into themselves as well, all the while entertaining. She is certainly a force to reckon with.<br /><br />The few extra dollars are worth investing for this deluxe edition, which comes with 5 leftover compositions from the album's sessions. The bitter, self-critical \\"The Guy Who Leaves\\" sizzles with tingly electronic beats and swirls amid Morissette's urgents vocals, while \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Madness\\" are both understated, poignant, positively beautiful ballads. Bittersweet coming-of-age tale \\"Limbo No More\\" has a profoundly moving orchestral arrangement, while the joyous, folksy \\"On the Tequila\\" is set to turn more than a few heads. It is not for lack of quality but simply because they do not fit the scheme of the album that these songs are bonus cuts. The above average fan will certainly find them worthwhile.rs along on her journey of self-discovery she helps them gain insight into themselves as well, all the while entertaining.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums by the greatest artist in rock history.  Pretty strange since the old geezer was hiding in an artistic bunker with such bums as the Awful Dead.  I've been listening to him for 30+ years; trust me, this is as good as his '60's work.
B00177Y9ZM|4.0|As someone who read the original novel back in 1992, and the sequel(Reflex) in 2004, I believe my opinion counts for something.  This movie is not what the book was, though aspects of the second novel(other Jumpers, and people hunting Jumpers) did find there way into this movie.     The movie is pretty fast and enjoyable, clocking in at only 88 minutes.  Compared to Spiderman at 121 minutes, and Superman Returns at a whopping 154 minutes......this movie moves.  Ultimately feeling more like a really awesome pilot for a show, than a completed work.     Some of that is discussed briefly in the commentary track (reviewing 2 disk edition), in which they discuss having used only part of the story they'd outlined for this movie.  There are hopes on their part to ultimately have this as a trilogy.     I enjoyed this movie, and I'd like to see two more movies set in this world. And for fans who liked the Jumping premise; I'd highly recommend you read the novels.  You will find completely new adventures with the same characters.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I wish pple would stop hatin'  on this! The shakiness isn't all that bad! And pple just keep on hatin' on it. The acting is believable,the monster is awesome and the gore is limited but this movie is awesome!
B000WZB944|4.0|I didn't discover U2 until \\"The Joshua Tree\\" came out (I must have been living under a new-wave rock or something).  But this is still my favorite U2 album - I can even enjoy all the songs on the B side.  And since my cassette from way back then was finally starting to sound a little stretched out I figured the 20th anniversary re-mastered reissue would be an excellent choice to replace it.  And the songs sound just as good as they did 20 years ago.<br /><br />The \\"bonus\\" CD however is an example of why some songs don't make it on the finished album - they just aren't that good (and believe me, I feel bad saying that about one of my favorite bands).  At best some of the songs are listenable, but it really wasn't worth the extra money.  The version of \\"Sweetest Thing\\" included on it isn't as good as the \\"Single Mix\\" on the greatest hits CD, and neither version of \\"Silver and Gold\\" is as good as the live version from Rattle & Hum.  I wish I'd bought the single disk CD and spent the extra cash on replacing my \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" cassette tape or something else.  I'm sure some of the songs will eventually grow on me and it comes in a cool case, but I could have been more satisfied with something else.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|One of the best CD's of the year!  Listen to \\"Not as We,\\" \\"Incomplete,\\" or \\"Versions of Violence\\" and you will agree.    Also, check out the Bsides - \\"Madness\\" is one of the best songs that Alanis and Guy made!
B000UR9T8C|1.0|This movie is a disjointed, thrown together, mess.  It doesn't make any sense.  The Sandman guy...what is that about?  Who is he?  Why is he in this movie?  Why not throw in 10-12 more villians and give them each minimal story line?  Tobie M. is about as milktoast as you can get, and just painfully feminine.  This movie is worse than the Silver Surfer.  Why did I watch these two awful comic book movies?  Am I losing my mind?  It's a sad commentary when a movie you are supposed to sit through for mindless entertainment....doesn't entertain!!!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|It's been 13 years since \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" owned the Billboard charts, but this CD explains why Alanis still has a large, dedicated fan base.  She still remains one of the most important singer/songwriters in the music business.    The first single off of \\"Flavors\\" is \\"Underneath,\\" an upbeat song that compares personal relationships to large-scale wars.  Though it may not be the best song on the album, it highlights Guy Sigsworth's production.  The verses also sell the song.    Other highlights are \\"Not As We,\\" a heartbreaking piano-based ballad. \\"For now I'm faking it, til I'm pseduo making it, From scratch begin again, but this time I as I, and not as we.\\"  This song is lyrically one of the strongest songs on the album, and the simple piano arrangment suits it well.    \\"Incomplete\\" is one of the strongest songs on the album.  The upbeat, techno-influenced track is about her hopes that she will someday be happy and fulfilled.    As far as the bonus tracks, \\"Madness\\" is the best.  It's another sad, piano song, though it's not as big of a standout as \\"Not as We,\\" which explains why it is a Bside.  The other bonus tracks are hit-and-miss, but this track is a must listen.    This album was worth the four year wait.  Alanis may not put albums out often, but when she does, it is certainly a big event.
B0000009OP|5.0|I have owned this disc since it came out and it never gets old. Admittedly it doesn't make its way into the player quite as much any more, but when it does these tunes always hit the spot. Morphine was a power trio of a different sort, a two string bass, a sax player, and a drummer. As a guitarist, not the type of band I would normally be interested in, but with a sound so bass heavy I couldn't resist. Songs like \\"Buena\\" and \\"Thursday\\" practically blew me out of the room when I first heard them, proving that Morphine could utilize elements of jazz and still rock hard in the age of grunge. Not to mention the haunting opening of \\"Dawna\\" and closing of \\"Miles Davis' Funeral\\" that bookend this disc. The clincher though was \\"In Spite Of Me\\", a totally atypical Morphine song steeped in reverb drenched mandolins and echo chamber vocals from vocalist Mark Sandman. I first heard this song while watching the darkly hilarious and excellent independent film \\"Spanking The Monkey\\", which turned me on to Morphine in the first place. I personally want this song played at my funeral: love the lyrics, love Sandman's voice, love the whole vibe. To me, it stands as one of the most perfect songs ever written. Mark Sandman's passing only makes the lyrics that much more poignant. I also love \\"Let's Take A Trip Together\\", a song that I doubt by its arrangement could have been about anything other than LSD. Overall, a wild, eclectic ride that I can't do without.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|There is allot of people in here that have obviously not see any of Hayden's other movies. Maybe you should do that before leaving senseless comments. True this is not a movie where the acting needs to be \\"out of this world\\" but he still does a good job. I think that Rachel Bilson although cute as a button cannot act at all.  She is weak and not a very strong personality in this movie. I cannot believe that this is the same director for Mr & Mrs Smith and the Bourne Identity. We are talking about two very good movies and this one is just okay! I guess I expected and wanted a little bit more out of what could have been a \\"classic\\".
0307394549|5.0|I originally ordered this on March 20 from globalbooks2000 through your web site, paid for on my Amazon credit card and never received.

B000M4RG42|5.0|This is a very well made movie but what movie has Clint Eastwood directed that was not!  The movie is very interesting as we move through the flag raising.      I will say this, IWO JIMA, statue is my very favoite one in D.C. but knowing that the government tried to dupe the American people bothers me and tarnishes the feeling for the monument somewhat.      I recommend this movie especially to people who are interested particulary to history!  It is one I will watch again and learn more each time I view it.

0786948523|1.0|This book is lacking in everything but pictures and stats. There is zero flavor. Monster descriptions are terse at best, many monster variants are simply not described. Of pure description text the illithid has two short paragraphs. It reads more like a bestiary that one would find in an MMO walkthrough. What happened? Where is my D&D? When did I start playing WoW the tabletop game? Please read through this book in a local store before purchasing; you may like it, others have, but I think many will not.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workouts!  I ended up rotating through them consecutively...level 1 on Mondays and Thursdays, Level 2 on Tues and Fri, Level 3 on Wed and Sat.  Worked different muscle groups to some degree, allowing rest/growth.  Enjoy it alot, and definitely made a difference in my physique.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|This album far exceeded my expectations! Every song is smart, runs from the ache of heartbreak in Not As We and Torch, to whimsy of Giggling, to the fun of Tequila with BFFs with much more to fill out this treasure of an album. Listen to every song in a quiet place to truly get how both her writing, singing and the music bring together this masterpiece in an often devastating and always beautiful way. Her voice is strong and penetrating, the lyrics smart and deeply touching, the music different and still very much enhances the songs more with each listen. Anyone who has ever deeply loved will be touched and enlightened by these songs. Welcome back Alanis, we missed your voice!
B0012BUX0I|5.0|To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the \\"Best Foreign Film\\" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashômon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashômon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being \\"borrowed\\". His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.    While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashômon. This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical \\"courthouse\\" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashômon. Kurosawa gives us the \\"black sheep\\" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true \\"truth\\". Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the \\"truth\\" may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that \\"it didn't exist\\". Deep within Rashômon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.    Outside of these beautiful themes, Rashômon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife. While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease. When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.    Overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film. Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories. I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied. My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it. I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes. I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end. The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path. It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all!
0743290119|2.0|I think the plot is actually quite interesting and it'll be much more engaging if the writer told it well enough. To me she wasn't able to portray clear characters (except Adriana, who is a typical rich, beautiful, spoliled daddy's girl, despite her degree from Cornell). At the end of the book I still couldn't imagine how the other two girls look like apart from the fact that Leigh is a \\"put-together\\" type while Emmy is naturally small and slim. I also find it hard to believe in some of the characters. I think the writer did well in the Devil Wears Prada because she was writing from her own experience while here it seems like she borrows stories from others and it sounds a lot less convincing.    Some of the stories told, like others have said, are not necessary and only make the whole book longer without getting anywhere. I almost gave up two or three times because even at half of the book you still feel like you are in the introduction part.    There are quite a few flaws in the story-telling i.e. Brianna's age (23 and 22), Leigh's possession of designer clothes (at first it says she has only one piece of haute couture, which is a Chanel jacket, then later Leigh wears \\"her favourite Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress\\"), or Emmy's attitude toward gift wrapping paper (early in the story she felt sorry to see her boyfriend tear off the wrapping paper carelessly when she spent hours choosing the one that would match his taste, but, she herself did the same thing when getting a gift from her sister thinking \\"what's the use of keeping used gift wrappers and bows?\\"). I know these flaws are petty, but I guess they reflect how much the writer spent time with the book.    I like the book better when it comes toward the end as it becomes more entertaining and gripping, though the ending is quite predictable. The explanation about Jesse's marriage at the end is basically quite unbelieveable, though not totally impossible.    I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone except for those who just want to read away and have a penchant for the Sex and the City theme.
1400077915|5.0|This offering of short stories by Alice Munro is just about perfect.  The stories' characters are unusual, sensitive, vulnerable.  Some are isolates.  The author uses some of the characters in linked stories.  She covers the passage of time in competent, realistic fashion, hiding her mastery of the literary form.       In \\"Runaway\\" the goat and the woman both take off and return to the starting points.  Temperamentally they resemble each other in their capacity to bring cheer to others.  Their parallel development is thoughtful.      In another story Sara and Sam, Juliet's parents, are encountered.  Sam had been a dynamic school teacher, but had seemed to undermine authority.  As a consequence he was passed over for administrative positions.  Sara and Sam were happy to meet Juliet's daughter Penelope.  Years later, reading a letter she had sent to Penelope's father during her visit, Juliet winced at the sprightly cover-up of it, the false tone.      The plot turns are particularly good in the story, \\"Tricks\\".
B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman and Batman Returns were two of Tim Burton's finest work. After Batman Returns, Tim passed the torch to Joel Screwmacher who drove the franchise into the ground with Batman Forever and the absolutely dreadful Batman & Robin. in 2005 Christopher Nolan breathed life into the series with Batman Begins.<br /><br />Plot: The movie details the origins of Batman as well as Bruce Wayne(played by Christian Bale). It tells the story of a young boy who loses his parents to some punk and has a fear of bats. It details plot to destroy Gotham by the same rogues headed by the same guy who taught Bruce how to fight so well. It details crime and corruption caused by a crime lord and a neurotic psychologist named Scarecrow.<br /><br />Opinion: Batman Begins has a great storyline as well as interesting characters. Christian Bale is perfect as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He gives Batman more edge than the Batman of the Schumacher films ever had. Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Ra's Al Ghul and the Legion Of Shadows are interesting villians as well as Scarecrow(who uses a hallucinogenic gas that causes its victims to have a illusions about their worst fears). And I LOVE the new Batmobile. Nobody seems out of place in Batman Begins and the storyline grabs you and never lets go. Its is a definite improvement of the last two Batman films and is worth the bucks. Does it make up the the Schumacher disasters? I dont know, those wounds run pretty deep but I can say that it is great step in the healing process and is an excellent installment to one of the best superhero movie series ever made. I cant wait for The Dark Knight. Two thumbs WAY up.

B000RPCK1U|4.0|\\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" in a strange way feels like that \\"other\\" Bond movie since to many people, the first 90's revival film, \\"Goldeneye\\", was very well-received and brought a classic Nintendo 64 game with it. This film, Pierce Brosnan's second outing, is a bit more stronger in terms of pacing and its action sequences though it doesn't have that reverence the previous film did which is a shame. Sure there's some elements, like all Bond films, which don't quite make it perfect, it's got plenty of bullets, quips and babes for any Bond lover to be entertained by.    A British naval ship, the Devonshire, had drifted too close to Chinese waters and the event leads the Devonshire sunk and a Chinese fighter destroyed. But a third ship, a stealth ship owned by media mogul Elliot Carver, used technology to fool both sides and the result creates a possible start to World War III. 007 James Bond is sent in to investigate Carver's plans and with the help of Carver's wife Paris (and an old flame of Bond's) and Wai Lin, a chinese agent, Bond tries to stop 2 powerful governments from declaring war on each other.    I'm going to get the negatives out of the way so it doesn't sound like I'm complaining too much. For one, the lack of a strong villain kind of hurts the film and though we have acclaimed actor Jonathan Pryce (\\"Brazil\\") playing the role, he seems more like a man behind the scenes playing with toys than a threat. And the plot isn't exactly new and Carver's whole reason for doing it is kind of \\"...wha?\\". However, this film has some of the best action sequences of the Brosnan era, from the pre-credit fighter jet scuffle, to Bond literally backseat driving as well as my favorite, when they drive up and all around a city on motorcycle. This scene is right up there with the tank chase in \\"Goldeneye\\" or the boat chase in \\"World is Not Enough\\".     Acting-wise, there's not a whole lot to nitpick about, aside from the villains. Carver's muscle \\"Mr. Stamper\\" is kind of laughable and M. played by Judi Dench nearly loses her strong confidence she exerted last time but she's still a nice foil to have around. Brosnan, the fifth Bond, is starting to get more and more comfortable in his role which is sad since the series started to get more laughable and a bit silly but his charm and wit combined with handling the rifles and fight scenes works very well and special kudos to Michelle Yeoh for doing probably the best Bond girl.     \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", complete with one of the few Sheryl Crow songs I can tolerate, is probably the last good Bond before it went into decent-ish followups and I'd recommend checking it out.

B000I5X81K|4.0|I really think Josh's all time BEST is his CD, \\"CLOSER,\\" but this one is still a good one. My ratings for his CD's are as follows: \\"Closer,\\" His self entitled debut album \\"Josh Groban,\\" and then his newest CD, \\"Awake.\\"   I wouldn't say Awake is his best accomplishment so far, but it's a good listen nevertheless, and one which I believe all avid JG fans will appreciate, even if they don't enjoy every single song.

I am so im love with this cd. Alanis......welcome home. We love you keep it up. thanks for growing as an artist, tryin new things, taking a chance....it work well. thanks for a great cd.

B00005LK95|5.0|This movie brings back a lot of memories.  Growing up, I went to the  theater and watched this film.  Same casts of characters as the first one with a few new people in it.  Johnny Five is a wonderful example of what a true friend is like.  Helps his friend Ben build rebots that would help out his company.  Johnny Five also learns the differances of good friends and those who just want to take advantage of others and use him for bad purposes.  All in all, this movie rocks!!!!
B001ATNPCK|5.0|First that this was available early on Amazon, 1 week before the street release date.  Secondly that it is pretty darn good.  After Conspiracy of One I about gave up on these guys.  Some of the songs are more mainstream but others reflect the old sound from the mid 90's that started my listening to them to begin with.  The sound is very well produced.  Will be playing in my iPod for awhile.<br /><br />The first 3 tracks began to tear it up.<br /><br />1. Half-Truism 4/5<br />2. Trust In You 5/5  Old school Offspring - great song!<br />3. You're Gonna Go Far, Kid 5/5  New sound for them, very catching.  This one will be stuck in my head.
0385333846|5.0|Straightforward Fantasy of Baffling Reality    Billy Pilgrim has been unstuck in time, and I feel that way too. Through my English class, the whole contemporary style threw me completely off. This is not Dickens. This is not Steinbeck either. The closest I've read before is James Joyce, but I had no clue what he was saying. The similarity: half my brain cells died reading either book.  So it goes. However, this book is not going to be like any other war book you've  ever read-besides the usage of drugs as a plot device. This story has one of many interpretations. I am certain I have overanalyzed this book over and over again, but this is what I feel about the book.  The first is the easiest to explain and understand. Kurt Vonnegut is crazy and disillusioned after the onset of a terrible war including the hellish bombing of Dresden during World War II. This could easily explain for the random twists, plot spins, alien abductions, etc. However, this seems too simple an explanation.  Another explanation is an extremely deep one: the characters in the story are intended to be completely sane, and the book is not as much an antiwar novel as much as an analysis on free will. The narrator includes countless allusions to this argument, starting when Vonnegut compares stopping a war to stopping a glacier, to when the Trafamadoreans tell Billy Pilgrim that free will does not exist, to Billy getting thrown into the deep end of a pool. Billy is being taught the \\"sink or swim\\" method by his dad, but is rescued \\"against his free will\\" when they find out that he actually likes the bottom of the pool.  At this point, I cannot say that I have made a thorough analysis. I have practically nothing good to say. Perhaps the only thing I have left to say is \\"poo-tee-weet?\\"
0452289963|3.0|There is unquestionably truth in A New Earth, however, it's not a very accessible read, and I am grateful that the book was loaned to me. As many other reviewers have stated, it's pretty much a rehash of Hinduism, Budhism, and also C.S. Lewis. In one of his books, C.S. Lewis states that our only connection to Eternity is now.(Perhaps Lewis got that from the Hndus and Budhists as well, or perhaps spritual teachers arrive at the same conclusion.) And, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to conclude that fear truly is the root of all evil. These same ideas of the ego (lower self) and being in the moment are espoused by Deepak Chopra. Another book that readers might find more accessible is the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.    The ego-- cant' live with it; can't live without it. Since we exist on this plane where the ego is very much present, many of us need a more organized and concrete presentation to satisfy the ego so that we can actually bypass it and become conscious. When something is presented in such an esoteric way, many people who are becoming conscious may not be able to wrap their minds around it. That being said, there are many voices who reach different people. Many find something in this book that speaks to them and that is a good thing. Much of it resonated with me, but that's because I had aleady been exposed to these ideas from other sources. Others will go elsewhere for a voice they understand. Hopefully, we're all the better for the \\"teachers\\" we find.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Cloverfield is the sort of movie a rich kid who moves to Williamburg,Brooklyn, might do with Daddy's money.The hand held camera assaults your senses, sweating its way  to give a cinema verite` attempt that fails. Miserably. Taking a cue from the first, terrific Alien, and not showing the monster but for seconds does add a modicum of suspense to an otherwise standard,dull waste of time. The film starts off with a video diary of sorts, two young 20 somethings  after having spent the night together in daddys central park apartment, tape their special day.switch to 2 weeks later, a going away party for said[male] dullard,with the clumsy sore thumb friend asked to record a farewell in a downtown apt.loaded with beautiful people [many who are apparently,er loaded} an evening of solipsism interrupted by an extraterrestrial attack[don't you just HATE when that happens?}The destruction of NYC begins for the umpteenth time, as our intrepid crew, decides not to go to safety but to go find the girl from the opening, who had shown up at the party with a different guy, but is the now realized true love of...well, you get it, I guess.Anyway, much sturm and drang ,lots of noise many calls upon the Deity for help,then a set-up for a sequel. Sigh.watch clips on -line its much more enjoyable. save your money, give it to charity or some poor auteur whom you might find on on the street.
0316143472|4.0|Sometimes it feels as though ever since I first discovered David Sedaris, I spend the remaining time anxiously waiting for his latest collection! So, I've been looking forward to this book since I finished reading [[ASIN:0316143464 Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim]].  When I first saw the cover online (before the book's publication) featured one of my very favorite Van Gogh paintings (seriously, I even have a T-shirt from the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam that features this same painting), I was even more ecstatic! So, needless to say, I held some extremely high hopes.<br /><br />And I did enjoy reading this book...  I'm looking forward to adding it to the books we keep in the road trip bag to be read aloud from.  But, I am a little disappointed to admit that this is not my favorite book of essays by this talented writer.  Favorite cover, yes.  But the content, while overall hysterical, was missing something in comparison to his earlier works.  And that may be because there was less about the whole Sedaris family, which is always my favorite parts... or because Sedaris has apparently grown up quite a bit since that first collection of essays. They are a bit somber now, more serious and that does detract a bit from the overall fun<br /><br />Either way, I admit that while this was not his best book of essays, it is still far superior to other essayists that I have read (such as ones by authors with rather pompous sounding names), and certainly one of the best covers. And after finishing it, I am once again very excited to read his next book... I hope it has more about his family though (or Hugh's family, too... that first essay was hysterical).
B000J103X4|5.0|THE GAME'S SECOND ALBUM IS THE BEST RAP ALBUM EVER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT THEN GO GET IT.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Neil Young.  Quite frankly however, I just don't understand why this CD is a rip off just because Davis was on the same bill that night at the Fillmore East.  In my opinion, and I will leave it to the Neil Young fanatics to explain the genesis of these vault tapes, this is a gem.  And, I am sure that the acoustic set that preceeded this one was just as great.  Hopefully, that set will be issued at some point.  The most intriguing song is Wonderin'.  With 20/20 hindsight, the obvious country influence on this tune appears to be a harbinger of what was to come with Harvest, two years later.  Crazy Horse is Crazy Horse, a solid and very competent R&R band that was perfect for Young's material.  Simply put, I don't think that anyone who is intersted in the music will be disappointed.
0743496736|4.0|This was a tough one for me.  I think Picoult is an amazing storyteller and have enjoyed her books to varying degrees (I still think PLAIN TRUTH was the best).  This was a well-crafted novel telling the story of a very difficult subject.  She managed to communicate the proper shock and disgust with the horrific crime committed but she also conveyed how difficult it must have been for the perpetrator living year after year with almost intolerable bullying.  It really is a very good book.  However, I was tempted to give it three stars because of the shocking surprise ending.  Frankly, I just couldn't buy it.  Even with the explanations, I couldn't buy it.  No matter how hard Picoult tried to explain it, it didn't ring true to me given the narrative of the book.  But (except for a lot of excessive offensive language), her storytelling won out in my evaluation, so I gave it four.
0060899220|5.0|This is a great book, a MUST have for any chef!!! Bourdain is one of a kind.
0061150142|5.0|This is the second book I have read from Picoult and have to say that she is an amazing author who has the ability to make a reader feel like they are directly involved with the story line.  The ending was quite surprising and not what I had expected at all.  A very touching tale of teenage love, heartache and of the lengths a person will go to for the one they love.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I love albums.  I think the artistry behind how an album is produced and assembled and how it flows can be almost as impactive as the songs themselves.  Green Day's 'American Idiot' is a recent example of this, as are albums like 'The Wall' and many others.  (Naming others might lead you to judge my other tastes, rather than this album.)  With that being said, this is the most anthemic album of them all.  Each song--powerful in its own right--fits tightly and seamlessly with the next.  The overall imagery is remarkably powerful.  It's true that this is a Roger Waters album.  It's also a gift with a powerful and coherent message about the psychological ravages of war as well as the senselessness of the pursuits used to justify it.  This is a beautiful album.
0743454537|5.0|An absolutely amazing read.  Picoult has become one of my most favorite authors.  An amazing tale of the lengths a parent will go to for their child, especially one who is so very ill and how the decisions made affect an entire family.  A story line becoming more and more real in today's day Picoult makes the reader feel for everyone involved and makes one wonder what would you do if you were in this situation.
B000002LGQ|5.0|One of the GREATEST album ever. After so many years, this is still my favourite and BEST Madonna's album (I am sure all Madonna's die-hard fans will agree with me). I love every track on the album (even the last track!!!). (If you still can) Check out the remixes for LIKE A PRAYER, EXPRESS YOURSELF, CHERISH, KEEP IT TOGETHER. Can't wait for the Re-mastered release! Please please ....<br />Long live the Queen of Pops.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|When this first came out, it got a similar reaction to Let It Be... Naked.  Many \\"purists\\" condemned it while some fans loved it.  I don't consider this so much a \\"new Beatles album\\" as much as a tribute and for a tribute, it's an enjoyable one.      The main disappointment was that the DVD was only another audio version.  The 2nd one is that \\"Blackbird\\" was only the introduction, where the entire song would've been both appropriate and appreciated.  I probably wouldn't have been disappointed if another reviwer hadn't pointed that out.  The version of \\"Because\\" is not too different from that on  Anthology 3, except that there's more of a pause between each line.      Ok, that takes care of what I didn't like or thought was so-so.  Now I'll share with you what I did like.  The version of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" features sections of the different takes on Anthology 2, starting with the original demo and the earlier takes seguing into the more familiar version, with George Martin's sped up piano solo from \\"In My Life.\\"  \\"Lady Madonna\\" features some interesting percussion, not unlike the \\"...Do It In The Road\\" introduction.  \\"Gnik Nus\\" sounds like a mantra.  Actually, it's really an a capella excerpt from \\"Sun King.\\"  \\"A Day In The Life\\" mixes versions of the Sgt Pepper original release and the outtake on Anthology 2.  The medley of \\"Mr. Kite/ I Want You/ Helter Skelter\\" is pretty interesting and I was amazed at how well \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" blended, considering they're in the same beat (listen for the \\"Taxman\\" guitar riff.  One of the highlights is George Martin's orchestral inclusion on George Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (Martin took creative liberties and they worked!).  The  orchestral intro of \\"Good Night\\" also works well on Ringo Starr's \\"Octopus' Garden.\\"  Tabla drums from \\"The Inner Light\\" are featured on George's \\"Here Comes The Sun.\\"  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" blends well with \\"Within You Without You.\\"  Hearing Paul McCartney sing \\"Can you take me back?\\" from the closing of \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" nearly brought chills when added to \\"Dear Prudence.\\"  John Lennon's guitar work blends well with \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (you'll have to hear it for yourself to believe it).  \\"All You Need Is Love\\" is a great finale to Love, with a snippet from one of the Beatles' Christmas records- \\"This is Johnny Rhythm saying goodnight and God bless ya!\\"
B000R5N1MC|5.0|The HD version of the Final Cut is breathtaking.  The expense of my HD TV is now worthwhile as this movie fulfills the promise of 1080p.  What more can I say?    Greg
0743289684|5.0|One of the most honest books I have ever read! Sometimes its very hard to read and stomach, but there is so much knowledge in the story. A story about religion, love, hate, struggle, success, and everything in between. Definately in my top ten favorite books of all time. Read it! It will make you look inside the box, and see whats really going on!
630542845X|5.0|I saw \\"Powder\\" when it first came out.  I was so moved by the movie because I really identified with Powder.  I have felt most of my life like I did not fit in.  He was not afraid to be who he was.  Being different is not a bad thing; in fact, it is a very good thing in most cases.  Powder portrayed a beautiful personality and also manifested so much love and understanding from his eyes. There is also a wonderful feeling of acceptance from Powder while all the while the people around him feared him. This is a movie that deals with energy...  which we all are.  It will continue to be in my top favorite movies of forever.
B000Y35A94|5.0|I heard this is a fabulous concert dvd, however, it's not sold in any stores. The website stated that it was exclusive to WalMart and was supposed to be released yesterday, however, they never got a shipment in either! Also, no other store carries the dvd! They should've marketed this product alot better!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|I'm really amazed that this film has managed to only get three and a half stars. Not only does it features amazing performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano, but also excellent music and cinematography. Just look at some of the reviewers that have given this a bad score, they've written three or four reviews and they are internet trolls.    With most of the garbage that fills cinema today, we very rarily get a good movie like this to come along. When a movie like this is released, it is truly a gift to be appreciated.    Go rent this movie as soon as possible, it was the best film of the year, and is also one of the best films of all time! Highly Recommended!
0385340567|4.0|If you're a Jack Reacher fan, then you'll enjoy the book!  It's a bit more introspective than the last couple of Reacher books, but it is a great read & a very fun story!  I enjoyed it & lost some sleep while readin it!
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Although the title says the book is about race, after reading it, I don't agree. The issues of race are there, because after all, he is bi-racial, but that is not what the book is about.<br /><br />Any young man who never really got to know his father starts out with a disadvantage in the \\"search for who I am\\" department. His search was complicated by distance, culture, racism, family dynamics on an island, two continents and an archipelago, polygamy and more. It's no wonder that he came to a place where he just had to figure it out.<br /><br />The book is divided into roughly three parts. The first covers his childhood growing up in Hawaii, Indonesia, back to Hawaii and school, the second encompasses his time as a organizer in Chicago, and the third is his first trip to Kenya where he met his father's family and learned his father's story from them.<br /><br />This man may very well be our next president. It is not only a good read, but it will let you know just who he is. For that reason, I encourage everyone to buy it.
0312287550|5.0|Wonderful storyline that makes you feel you are with them on the journey.  Who cares if it's not historically accurate - it's fiction.  I'm looking forward to the reading the rest of the series.
B000068OCS|5.0|I first encountered Koyaanisqatsi in 1984,and was awed by the photography used to create the images that I saw. As time went on and I watched it several more times, I slowly began to understand the story this film was telling:We are slowly destroying the very planet we live on,our only home in this vast universe. When I've shown this movie to family and friends the first thing they do when watching it is recognize some of the locations that were used and they get a kick out of that.It's not until they see it again that they start to understand what it's about, and it's very touching to see the looks on their faces as they realize what is happening.  The music used is very mesmerizing, but there are a couple of places where it goes on and on and it makes you feel like \\"enough already!\\" Give it a chance,as it helps make the movie what it is.
1400079179|1.0|This book was given to us for Christmas or I wouldn't have read it. To satisfy any curiosity I had about something that gave the Pope such a hissy fit he encouraged Catholics to read it by banning it, I'd rather have seen the movie. Wading through all that clunky text was every bit as bad as I expected. But clunky writing wasn't enough for Dan Brown, who felt obliged to assault his readers with a lot of misinformation (such as that The Last Supper is a fresco when it's actually a painting). Rather than go into lengthy criticism of the book, I'm pointing readers to an in-depth one by linguist  Geoffrey K Pullum. The URL is [...] and every point Mr Pullum makes is 100% valid.
0792839749|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this Chitty Chitty Bang Bang DVD.  There are many skips, although it was advertised as new.  And the skips are most prevalent on the songs which are the best part of the movie.
B000Y35A94|4.0|I just picked this up yesterday at Sam's Club for $18.37. I haven't had a chance to watch it - I've been listening to it while I work. The sound quality is good, except once again Nick Davis has the mid-bass nearly non-existent in the mix (also my only complaint on the 5.1 mixes for the albums).    As for the performance, I'm pleased with it. Phil's voice change takes a little getting used to. It's not just lower, it has a slightly different tone to it. The band seems to be relaxed and enjoying themselves. In fact, they may be a little too relaxed. I think that might be why the energy level seems a little low.    Overall, I'd give it a thumbs up. I'll update the review after I have a chance to watch it.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Professional and audience reviews of this movie have, for the most part, demonstrated a lack of knowledge and/or understanding of the Tudors, Henry VIII, and the Boleyn girls. The Tudors were probably the most conscious of the need to have a queen provide an heir in the centuries when the lack of one spelled the end of dynasties. Henry VIII in particular was desperate for a male heir, to the point that his queens were either divorced or beheaded for not providing one. He was the ultimate \\"stud\\", and had many mistresses, but the availablity of a young woman who combined beauty, sexuality, and the possibility of providing that heir was more than enough to cause the divorce of Katherine of Aragon, a break with Spain, and the invention of the Church of England, all of which was blamed on Anne Boleyn. She had more spirit than Mary, and there is nothing to contradict the fact that she held Henry at bay until he agreed to make her his queen. She didn't want to be cast aside like her sister, and he saw the chance for a son.  All this was accurately presented in the movie; Henry was not yet the obese Holbein portrait so Eric Bana was physically acceptable in the part. As to the girls, the portrayals were excellent, the accents more than adequate (my English friends had no problems), the differences between the personalities very well defined, and the acting of a very high standard. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, Natalie Portman seems to be incapable of being anything less than very good and is mostly superb, and as Anne she was excellent. Scarlett Johansen improves with every film. Producing a movie like this will never satisfy everyone because there is so much that could be included, but which must be left out because of time restrictions. For what it was intended to be, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is excellent and worth watching more than once.
B000WS4OZM|5.0|Of the 5 American Series Cash released during his last years, this album is my 2nd favorite, very close to being IMHO as good as my favorite, A Man Comes Around IV.  The main difference is that IV includes a few out of this world tracks that give it the edge over this one.    That is not to say that no stand out tracks are included on this set.  No less practically half of the album reaches the status of being exceptional.  Tom Petty sings along with Cash on the opening two tracks, the first being a Petty cover, I Won't Back Down.  Petty's version is good but somewhat dated (Jeff Lynn produced it), Cash's version is more straight forward and much better.  A similar analogy can be made of the next track, Solitary Man, a very straight forward version with a silent despair.    U2's One is another track which Cash does much much better (I am a huge U2 fan and think that their version is great).  The text shines in this version and actually adds a different dimension to the song itself.  After a solid and powerful start the set slows down somewhat with I See Darkness and The Mercy Seat.  The latter track is a Nick Cave cover in which Cash interprets the anguish someone feels being on death row and about to be electrocuted; very powerful song and the end where the admission of guilt is followed by bar room piano playing in a macabre fashion is not to be missed.    Mary of the Wild Moor and Wayfaring Stranger are the main tracks at the latter half of this album.  Although most of those tracks are not as good as the first tracks of the album, none of them have any filler feel to them.    Although I prefer IV, this album is also a must purchase for any Cash fan and those who would like to add some Cash to their collection should not let this album pass them by.  Of the American Series, this may even be the most even album and probably has the most direct straight forward production, brimful of guitars and solid tracks.
B00133KHCY|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in many years.  Normally I would have called this a Chick Flick; however I believe every one who likes to see a feel good movie will love this movie.  This movie is a great movie for any collection.
B00177Y9ZM|4.0|I just finished watching this movie, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was actually better than what I thought it would be! Believe it or not, I was expecting total crap and came away satisfied.<br /><br />THE PLOT: David is a very wealthy and well-living man with a secret: he can pretty much jump to everywhere he wants to go. But one thing he doesn't know: An agency is looking for him, since he had robbed a bank at age 15. For 8 years they have been looking for him, and have been trying to take him down. He reunites with his sexy girlfriend Millie, who doesn't know that she's about to become entangled in the mystery as well.<br /><br />WHO WILL LIKE IT? People who love these types of movies will like it for sure. Hayden Christiansen (sp?) gives a solid performance, as does Rachel Bilson. It's a movie that has lots of action, comedy, tragedy, everything you'd expect in a good movie.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD SKIP IT? PROBLEMS? Predictability. You can probably guess how this one is gonna end from pretty early on.<br /><br />OVERALL: A very enjoyable film, very fun, very tightly made and I think I may see this again sometime soon. Reccomended!
B000H8SFMK|5.0|I am amazed that this album has only 11 reviews to date, since it's era defining album from a band that defined a whole new music style, punkfolk. It's absolutely the best album ever. Having danced my teenage years away on Fiesta, who can disagree with this judgement? All the other Pogues albums are of course worth listening, especially Rum, Sodomy and the Lash, but this remains their peak. If you get the chance, see them live, since they're on the move again

B00164KYS2|2.0|I've been a fan of the ultra-popular HBO series that had run from 1998 to 2004 and I went to see the movie that was based on the show. As a fan, I wanted to follow the stories of four women in Manhattan in search for \\"the two L's: Labels and Love.\\" The 148 minutes long movie tried to cram the stories of four friends after we said goodbye to them four years ago but it did not exactly succeed and it lacks humor and wit of the show. The jokes in the show were often on the verge of good taste but they were not as banal and vulgar as the one that made devastated and heartbroken at some point Carrie, laugh again. Having being the fan of the show since its first season did not stop me from seeing how shallow, selfish, arrogant, and often unpleasant and not interesting the foursome of single and fabulous Manhattan women in their late 30s and 40s were. Thanks to good writing and competent directing and 30 minutes per episode, the show was always fun to watch even if it was not realistic at all, more of the fairy tale with a lot of dirty talk. I think the big part of my love for it was the fact that \\"Sex and the City\\" has been one of the best dressed TV shows in history. Nothing is wrong with adapting the fairy tale on Manhattan to the big screen but at 148 minutes, the movie version did not make the multiple stories interesting enough. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, I simply stopped caring for the characters and concentrated on their clothes, shoes, and bags that were fabulous as always. My interest picked up again when the film introduced a new character that was missing from the show, Carrie's personal assistant Louise from St. Louis (Jennifer Hudson). Hudson was refreshingly natural, young and effortlessly beautiful, genially sweet, intelligent and practical but sadly she did not have enough of screen time. I don't regret seeing the film - that's what devoted fans are for, and I liked the ending. For good ending, I would forgive a movie many sins. I wish Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda happy lives but I would not want another reunion. Their stories have been told.<br />2.5/5mantha, Charlotte and Miranda happy lives but I would not want another reunion. Their stories have been told.   2.5/5
B000002KHB|5.0|One of the greatest rock albums ever made 'Machine Head' combines rock, blues with progressive complexity and the result is nothing less than amazing! Blackmore and Co. rip through each song with dexterity and unrelenting drive! 'Smoke On The Water' has one of the most memorable and best guitar solos in the history of Rock N Roll. Stand out cuts like Lazy, Highway Star and Space Truckin' are pure bliss, but the entire album rocks like there's no tomorrow! The version I have of this is an anniversary edition with the original album remastered on one disc and a remixed version on the other disc, plus some quadraphonic mixes of some choice cuts! It's a smokin' release....if you can find it!
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I mostly agree with 'greggmitch's review of the album. While I won't say Hard Candy is painful, as a few tracks on it are OK, but that's about all I can say in terms of offering praise. It's a shame that a woman with such a strong personality and in such control of her product/persona released something so unmemorable. A lot of this album sounds like castoffs off of Justin Timberlake's last album, not to mention bits and pieces off of anybody else who's 'hot' right now. She sounds downright boring, like one of the herd. I thought American Life was bad, too, mainly for those awful and embarassing raps, but otherwise it had its good moments and I still listen to some songs from time to time. This newest one is just so indistinctive. The opener sounds silly with her saying her candy is 'raw sticky and sweet,' and it's not just her age. It sounds dumb for any woman to say that. Should we be payin $1.99 a minute to hear that? Four Minutes is a bit better, but I think the best tracks are Miles Away and Voices, which are a bit more distinctive and earnest and confessional, and She's Not Me is a fun dance track but still a bit silly. Spanish Lesson is quirky and a bit fun on that level but I cringe a bit hearing it, but she tried to be a bit odd with it, so ... She's going to be 50 this year, and has pretty much done what no other woman has ever done before, and all she can sing about is her sugar being 'raw sticky and sweet' and 'she might love you in the shower but she doesn't have what's ours'? Come on! Her bar is raised so high and she falls so far short!

B000059QYB|5.0|I grew up in the 80's listening to Billy on my mom's record player and now am still listening to him on my MP3. I got this because it has most of his best songs- although I am not crazy about Shock to the System. I also don't understand why some of his other soulful works are not included on any \\"greatest hits\\" albums. I would have liked for \\"Prodigal Blues\\" and \\"The Loveless\\"(Charmed Life) and \\"Worlds Forgotten Boy\\" (Whiplash Smile) to have been included here. Even so, it remains a must have for any Idol fan. Other great Billy albums are Charmed Life and Whiplash Smile as well as his latest, Devils Playground. Idolize Yourself (another hits compilation) will be released later this month with 2 new songs. Billy Idol remains \\"the man\\" of punk and rock. He is still rocking in his 50's and gorgeous as ever. I would highly recommend this CD. One word of caution: the live version of Rebel Yell does contain some audible expletives, not to be played in front of children. I'm glad my 5 year old wasn't in the room when I first heard it.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Over the years it seems like it has become a trend to cast popular american actresses as queens or european (mostly british) historical figures. The other boleyn girl is an example of this trend and succeeds on some levels and fails on others. The other boleyn girls deals with two close sisters who are torn apart by the ambitions of their father and uncle who come up with a plan to have one of them bed and become the mistress of the king whose relationship with his wife has gone downhill do to the fact she cant give him a son.          Pros: The lovely cinematography enhances the feel of the film, The lovely costumes, The acting is great all the actors hit the right notes especially natalie portman as anne boleyn.          Cons: The film lacks any scene were the characters are humane not just soap opera heros . The problem is the script .  Ratings: 7.5/10 The other boleyn girl is very fast paced but lacks the dept of films like Marie Antoinette (2006) (yes I love this film so don't judge me !)
B000008GS9|5.0|This is on of Billy's best albums, in my opinion. There are only 4 tracks on here I don't really like as much as the others, but they are still good. Tracks #1-6 and 11 are the best. I love the soothing sexy vocals of Pumping on Steel and Trouble with the Sweet Stuff. Prodigal Blues is one of his best songs. I don't know why it's not one of his greatest hits. Buy this- you won't be disappointed.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|As some others have said, this is a gorgeous film to watch! But, historically, umm....well, it's sure a gorgeous film to watch! I fully understand taking license with history for dramatic purposes, but this is a mess. And couldn't \\"they\\" have found either some actors/actresses from Great Britain or at least some with more plausible English accents?  In essence, I'd say this: it's fun to watch and beautifully filmed, but if it's history you're interested in, better head to the English history section of your local bookstore; this flick won't help.
055358202X|3.0|All in all not a completely awful book. But there were too many characters, and it was long. Not sure in the over all story any of this book's subject material matters much. It's obvious the G.R.R Martin had to put this out due to a contract. The first and second book of the series are still my favorite.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|It is true as most reviewers say:  This is Marley at his best.  I already owned for over 10 years Burning, Catch a fire, Exodus, and those earlier versions albums, you know: Duppy conquerer, Kaya and such. The first time I heard this album I wanted to kill myself for not listening to it earlier.  I have Black Uhuru's live in 84, Burning Spear's Garvey and his ghost, some Steel Pulse, Peter Broggs and so many other Rootz Reggea artists and I'll tell you this album is not only the best Reggea album I have ever listened to (Yes, I've heard Live), but probably the best Live album by any artist I have ever heard.  Just the begining of it it's awsome, he gives his praises to Jah and BOOM!  Rastaman Vibration, no intro no nothing, he gives the crowd what they went there for:  Mad live Reggea tracks to dance all night.  Kind of like The song remains the same from Zeppelin: All right let's go!  Buy it today!
0553381687|5.0|This is easily one of the better novels I have ever read.  It is high fantasy that reads much like historical fiction.  As someone who has great appreciation for believability, this lends the book very true feelings of life and death as well as intimate attachments to the main protaganists, the family of Starks, as well as heavy doses of empathy for each member of that family, as if somehow they are us.<br /><br />The book is brutal in its delivery, and there are many details that I just don't find all that interesting, which have the feel of being included merely for shock value.  The story, however, is riveting.  I despise spoilers so I will provide none, but the tangled webs that are divulged bear an unfortunate resemblance to our own world.  There are many fundamental truths that the book lays bare, especially in regards to the ultimate price of unflinching virtue, be it honor, loyalty, or commitment to justice.<br /><br />As these virtues call to our own souls and the burdens that are entailed upon us, we have characters provided here for our own inspiration, and we may shout lustily, \\"Stark! Stark!\\" and figuratively spill our blood with theirs.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|I bought this movie with the anticiaption of getting my kid into Iron Man with the new movie out on the big screen.  I was disappointed with the cartoon due to 90% of the movie is build up and only the last 10% is Iron Man fighting and action that a young kid could follow.  This movie appears to appeal to an older generation or maybe even some older kids into comic books, not good for little kids.
0060977493|3.0|I borrowed this book from a friend's library because I heard so many good things about it. Although it can be confusing at times with multiple flashback events, I love the wordplay and the little details of life from multiple perspectives. Some aspects of the story might be confusing for readers without a background on Indian culture, but it is still quite accessible. I love how the author sets up the drama and creates suspense, but it might be a little much because I lost interest at times and wanted to skip to the end (like what some other reviewers did).    This is a good read for English majors and those who like poetry in their narratives. I wouldn't recommend it for casual readers.
B000W4KT64|5.0|I first saw this version of Harispray last night and quite frankly, am still glowing from the experience.  Totally engaging, excellent new songs, captivating choreography, great clothes and a beautiful variation on the original.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that this version also presents delightful variations on the original characterizations as well with the end result making them somewhat more sensitive/poignant than in the first.  Divine's Edna Turnblad was just as loving to her daughter as Travolta's Edna - though Travolta's Edna was not nearly as confident as Divine.  Christopher Walken, abandoning his usual scary persona, is downright adorable as Wilbur. Jerry Stiller, this time out playing Mr Pinky was just as much fun as he was as Wilbur in the first.  Michele Pfeiffer is loads of fun as Amber's ambitious mother and Queen Latifah's MotorMouth Mabel is fierce!!!!<br /><br />This version also stays true to the overall theme of racial equality and the setting remains in a teenage world still idealistic enough to not only want to effect change but also honestly believing that they could.<br /><br />One cannot mention the attributes of the movie without mentioning the enormously powerful music.  The music, expertly based on 60s sensibilities enhanced by modern flourishes is a crucial element to the success of the film.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that both versions can indeed stand on their own. The latest version does not AT ALL try to copy the original - it simply presents another variation.  This also has a somewhat different format as it is essentially a Broadway show on fim....that works beautifully.<br /><br />What's even more amazing is that the message is still MOST relevant in 2008 and this was set in 1962!!!!! (sigh...)<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a powerful, uplifting film with a remarkable cast.  Additionally, it is quite funny.<br /><br />Hiiiiiiiiiighly recommended!!!
B0015519VS|3.0|When Amazon first offered this as a pre-order selection,  I did not hesitate to order my copy because I felt that it had to be the bomb after confessions and a 4 year hiatus.    When I first heard Love in this club, I felt that Usher had made a poor career choice. I said to myself who will make love in a club full of people other than a few misguided low lifes. That choice was even worse when it aired as the first single for the album, why waist such a beautiful voice on such a garbage song? But I still had faith and purchased the album anyway, which in my opinion is just a little to slow and laid back.   There are only really 3 dance tracks on the album: Love in the club, This Aint sex and What's your Name. Unlike confessions, where basically you could listen to the whole album uninterrupted, with this cd I find myself pushing the fast forward button way too many times. Alot of the songs sound the same and flow into one another in a bad way.    Although Trading Places alone validates my purchase.It is the only song that I have played back to back several times. Other honorable mentions are as follows then the rest of the songs are too weak to write down.    Lifetime  Here I stand  Love you Gently  Love in the club Remix  What's your Name  Best Thing    Last but not least, out of 18 songs ( because there is a hidden track after song number 17) The fact thAT I only dig 7 songs (some much more than others) explains me being somewhat to moderately dissapointed. Trading places is great and should be the next single, hell it should have been the first.But it can't carry the whole album. I am glad usher has grown into a family man and is in love and all but he lost some of his musical magic in doing so.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|~In December 1968, police were called to the scene of a double homicide; no motive, no suspects, no witnesses. On July 4th, 1969, \\"he\\" struck again, but this time, one of the victims lived. The survivor's name was Mike Mageau, and he is now one of the consultants in this top-notch movie. The attack on Mageau, and the girl he wanted to one day marry, named Darlene Ferrin, comprise the first sequence in the film. Thusly, the the December attack isn't depicted. This is because the makers of \\"Zodiac\\" wisely chose to only recreate the crimes which had witnesses or survivors, removing as much speculation from the script as possible.<br /><br />But, to the dismay of today's A.D.D. riddled audience, there are only three scenes of violence in \\"Zodiac,\\" although they are recreated with such authenticity, anyone already familiar with the story will cringe at how brutal and heartless the crimes are. Bryan Hartnell, who survived the attack at Lake Berryessa in September 1969, says he actually had to look away during the scene involving him. The realism was simply too much to handle. For this sequence, the film crew actually went to Lake Berryessa, and, referring to crime scene photos, reconstructed the crime scene to look exactly as it did the day of this attack, even transplanting trees to replicate scene as closely as possible. It's strange, Lake Berryessa is a breath-takingly beautiful location, the scenery is simply gorgeous. But, it has the permanent stigma of being the location where the suspect donned an executioner's outfit and hog-tied Bryan Hartnell and Cecilia Sheperd at gunpoint, butchering them with a hunting knife. It is one of the most horrifying scenes ever filmed, because it is faithfully reproduced, with almost 100% accuracy. It's difficult to watch.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac: The Director's Cut\\" is a very long film, almost three hours in total, with very little real on-screen action, but it is a fascinating movie. It focuses on San Francisco Chronicle employee Robert Graysmith's obsession with the case, and his personal and professional relationship with fellow newspaper employee Paul Avery, as well as the fear that spread through the San Francisco area once this crime spree made the paper. It is a story of obsession, as already stated, but it vividly tells the audience exactly how frustrating this case was to the police and the media. It has derailed careers and jeopardized health, as well as causing an extended panic all over California. The joke about California being a cereal bowl comes to mind. It has its share of fruits, nuts, and flakes, and it becomes apparent here. Of course, in all fairness, weird people live all over the place, so don't call me out on it. Just a comment.<br /><br />It is frustrating to the audience as well as the police, because no suspect has ever been caught, and none are arrested, even in the film. The prime suspect, one Arthur Leigh Allen, had his share of scrapes with the law, usually on sex-related charges, and had even done hard prison time for these offenses, and virtually all of the Zodiac evidence points directly to him, but various little things throw just enough of a wrench into the works to keep him from being formally charged. And when a solid enough case is finally built against him, the arresting officer found Allen dead on his floor, the victim of a fatal heart attack. So, if he really was the Zodiac, his letter claiming they will never catch him came true, because he never did one day of prison time for the Zodiac killings.<br /><br />This release has a treasure trove of material; you have the uncut movie, the director's vision being shown in tact, with almost every little nuance covered. The sets were made to look  like they did at the time, as faithfully as possible. In the bonus materials you have interviews with police officers who worked on the case and two surviving victims, archive footage of news reports from the time,as well as interviews with friends and aqcuaintences of Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />It is exhaustive in its efforts to inure the viewer in the case, and the fact that people still look at the case, is fascinating, as well.<br /><br />\\"...goodbye...\\" (you'll get this quote if you have seen this movie)xhaustive in its efforts to inure the viewer in the case, and the fact that people still look at the case, is fascinating, as well.    \\"...goodbye...\\" (you'll get this quote if you have seen this movie)
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I was nine years old when this movie came out and I can remember seeing it in theaters with my mom and dad. I remember also seeing this movie when it landed on VHS and how me,my dad and uncle must have watched it like 2 times. This is one of those types of movies you can watch over and over and over again without ever getting tired of it! A great All-Star cast,fantastic visual presentation,excellent plot,rememorable lines. If you know someone who has never got into comics this is pretty much a great way to introduce them into it by getting this move. If you are a true Batman fan and don;t have this movie in your collection,then I suggest adding this to your DVD collection.<br />  Its amazing how visually the presentation of this movie has improved since its theatrical release,very clear,rich,smooth. Almost as if the movie came out just last week. It has close captioning in English and in Spanish for those of you that are hearing impaired and loads,loads of DVD extras which I'm not gonna spoil because that's how good they are. For the great price that Amazon has available for this DVD its a win-win situation. I highly reccomend getting this DVD.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Got it for my man, he loved it.  He's watched it twice already and he's only had it for a week.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Drama. Romance. Tragedy. Comedy. Enlightenment. You will find yourself fully engaged in this entertaining story about a very meticulous IRS auditor for whom numbers, organization, and structure are everything.<br /><br />That is until a female voice begins suddenly narrating his life, eventually stating that his death is coming shortly. Harold finds challenge between learning to live and to love, while also seeking out an answer for who is responsible for the voice in his head, and ultimately, his imminent death.<br /><br />Your heart will truly be warmed in this unique take on the<br />interconnectedness between us all, so if you don't like Will Ferrell, then set your prejudices aside temporarily.<br /><br />This is not just a waylay from Will's usual typecast, it's undoubtedly his best acting role to date and he's supported by an unusual, but equally effective and enjoyable ensemble of costars.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Even after a decade this album still sounds sooo much better than most anything else out right now. I don't think I'll ever get tired of hearing this album over and over. I was introduced to it as a middle school kid, I rediscovered it a few months ago and just can't believe how fresh and deep it still sounds.
B000Y179KO|1.0|Let's call this release what it really is: a piece of crap. If the intention of this band was to go back in time, to 1972, then they accomplished it. As for musicality, it is just dreadful. Since firing Don Felder, the Eagles have become a caricature of themselves. This is a lame and utterly disrespectful release: disrespectful to their fans.     Give it up, boys. Your time has come and gone. We'll enjoy the classics but it is now clear, in the long run, you no longer have anything of relevance to offer.
B0012OVFHK|5.0|I am struck by the absolute timelessness of this music. We have loved it for 30 years, and now our children all love it too. This version is beautifully played, and having the two versions on the same CD is very interesting. I prefer the total piano version. Its a great record. Greg Yates in Adelaide, Australia.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|Twenty-two of us watched this film in my History of Modern Ireland class. The class is roughly three hours long, but when it came time to end, we still had fifteen minutes worth of film to watch. Our professor gave us the opportunity to stay, and fifteen of twenty-two people decided to watch the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Once is that type of film.<br /><br />The music is amazing and the plot is strong, with well-written dialogue and wit. The story revolves around a musician in Dublin, Ireland and his week-long experience with a mysterious young woman who quickly captures his heart. The two compose music together, and by the time it's all said and done, their friendship is as strong as their melody. A truly inspiring film topped off with incredible music throughout.
B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane-Giant Steps *****<br /><br />While I am rather new to Coltrane myself, only recently discovering him within the last year or so, I have acquired numerous albums of his, on top of the work he did with Miles Davis (all of  which I own) I have to say that this is by far his most important album. While not as spiritual and uplifting, and maybe not even as moving as [[ASIN:B0000A118M A Love Supreme]], but still deeply influential, and maybe more so in fact. Giant Steps is a musicians album in true from, with emphasis on harmony's rather than on song/structure on his more early work, or on soloing and freedom in his later work.<br /><br />As the title track, 'Giant Steps' opens the album you can tell your in for something special and something unique among the mans masterful body of work, and as that track comes to a close with his long sustained notes you feel satisfied, and this continues throughout the album. 'Countdown' was a sign of things to come, and 'Spiral' was absolutely breathtaking. Coltrane's reading of 'Mr. P.C.' well astonishing to say the least, it is a marvelous way to close such a land mark album.<br /><br />While [[ASIN:B0000A118M A Love Supreme]] may be the quintessential album of all time, and [[ASIN:B00004TA40 Ascension]] might be the most original, Giant Steps is by far my favorite Coltrane record, and easily the one that gets the most spins.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I noticed after posting that I must have clicked 4 stars by accident and it won't let me change it    Jillian is motivational!  I love her on Biggest Loser and really am not sorry I got this DVD.  I don't buy DVDs but previewed levels one and two on Comcast On-Demand for 3 weeks before buying.  The price is right and I really have seen results in strength, endurance and it has contributed to my 10 pound weight loss over the past 6 weeks! (It is combined with dieting and treadmill work as well).    I am 55 and in pretty good shape (5' 7\\" and 128 pounds). I've worked out all my life and I get a good workout from all three levels. I DO sweat!  I love the combination of weights and cardio!  I haven't seen anything similar to this DVD after searching a very long time and trying almost all of the cardio/strength workouts on Comcast Exercise TV.      The workouts are all based on the same concept of 3 minute strength, 2 minute cardio, 1 minute abs.  After progressing through all 3 levels, I now mix and match the workouts, double them up, etc.  All three have different moves, which I love because you don't get bored doing the same video and hearing the same dialog day after day and different muscles get used.  You can make the exercises harder or easier depending on fitness level, physical ability or if you have bad joints or injuries.  I have worked up to doing two levels together, which is another benefit once you've progressed and mastered all three levels.  Jillian does a great job of explaining her concept and showing how to do the moves correctly, although I suggest you watch the entire workouts once before trying them, as sometimes she doesn't get to what not to do until a move is almost over.    My heart rate watch shows that I burn an average of 325 calories during each 20 minute workout, when I am working to my full capacity.    Just a note that at first, it's great that Jillian stops between moves to explain what's coming next so that you get up to speed on learning the routine.  Once I learned the routines, though, I just went ahead and started the next move while she talked or continued the previous move (depending on the focus I wanted). That just helped burn a few more calories, so not really a complaint, just an observation.    Ok, here are the criticisms:      1) Not enough warm up!  Too short and she also incorporates jumping jacks INTO the warm up.  Be careful if you have joint problems.  I injured my knee the first week because I wasn't warmed up enough and had to skip some of the impact routines for a week and ease back in.  Now I start my own warm up before starting the video.      2) Jillian has two 'helpers':  Anita, who shows the modified, easier/lower impact version and Natalie, for the more difficult version of the moves. Watch Natalie - my opinion is that she is less than enthusiastic and often 'fudges' on doing the moves when she thinks she's not on camera.  It's hilarious and Jillian catches her once (I think in level 3).  I did think it kind of killed the motivation at times, then I laughed it off.  They should have used someone else when they saw those takes, but like I said, the price is right!     I definitely recommend this dvd.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|While the last 17 years have only given us lone single releases here and there (plenty enough to fill an album or two if compiled together), Many people have struggled with even those tracks, always expecting Donna to give us the next \\"MacArthur Park\\". Times have changed. Music has changed. Donna's vibe has consistently tapped into those new sounds through a smart selection of producers and remixers. Quite frankly, all the types of pop and dance music I listen to now are reflected in this CD. And all this talk of Donna's voice not being the same--personally, I find her voice has matured to a richer, more controlled timbre, and I welcome the diversity of vocal techniques she uses to make each performance sound different.<br /><br />A majority of these songs are so addicting I can't stop listening to them, and several are ripe for fantastic dance mixes. Stamp Your Feet sounds great in its original form and becomes a club `stomper' in the remixed forms on the CD single--same for I'm A Fire, although the best remix of that song has not been released commercially as of yet. Mr. Music has a great hip hop rhythm and a sort of `crunk' synth riff. Crayons is a bouncy electro pop track. The Queen Is back is a fantastic hard hip hop track with powerful diva vocals and backing vocals and a lyrical theme that long time fans can appreciate. Fame (The Game) is another club stomper with great synths, grinding guitar sample, and a harder electro vibe. Science of Love has an infectious chorus and more edgy soul/hip hop rhythms. Be Myself Again is Donna pulling off one of her stunning moody and atmospheric ballads. And for those smart enough to get their hands on the special edition release with the bonus track \\"It's Only Love\\", you get a 7 minute, disco infused electro house track.<br /><br />Other tracks include the smooth groovin' sand on my feet (very summery track), the offbeat \\"drivin' down brazil\\", the harmonica heavy, country and blues influenced jam \\"slide over backwards\\", and the chanting, tribal vibe of \\"bring down the reign.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line--I cant' stop listening to the latest Donna Summer CD, and am thrilled to have a full length disc from her at last.tribal vibe of \\"bring down the reign.\\"    Bottom line--I cant' stop listening to the latest Donna Summer CD, and am thrilled to have a full length disc from her at last.
0765317389|5.0|This is an epic masterpiece. In short, if that was my review for this book, I would stand by it for all time.<br /><br />I haven't come across a great fiction book to read in a while, and today I decided to just \\"try\\" Ender's Game for perhaps a few chapters. A few hours later, I rested the book and I was astonished.<br /><br />The story is extremely captivating, and the reader can feel Ender's life through so many different moments. We sympathize with him when he's glad, we're happy for him when he succeeds. Scott has really created a book that will cling to all of us - move us, and makes us imagine, just what it would be like to be Ender.<br /><br />We are involved with his love for family, but more importantly, we are involved with his way of growing up. He has no means an easy childhood, but readers can understand EVERYTHING that he's going through - Scott's delicate choice of words certainly makes this novel one of my favorite of all time. I presume that you have the basic notion of what is already happening with the story, and to that I say, even if it doesn't seem interesting from a little bit of the context of the story, buy it and read it!<br /><br />You will love it!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I have to agree with you D. Guery! Though I wasn't a teen when Daria came out, my daughter watched it, and I LOVED this cartoon! One of the best they've come out with, and I miss it too! Funny how I will compair the personalities of people I know with the characters on Daria!
B0002F6AH0|4.0|As many other reviewers already stated this is a very good summary of WWII, looked at from a British perspective.  Keep in mind that the war is over after volume 7. The remaining volumes are reruns of interviews with some more details.    It was mentioned that at the start of the war The Netherlands capitulated after Rotterdam was bombed.   As far as I know from Dutch historical documents, The Netherlands capitulated before Rotterdam was bombarded, but the bombers were already on their way and the Nazis did not bother to call them back, thus adding another atrosity to their long list of crimes to humanity.    Later there is an interview with historian Stephen Ambrose, who feels that the US profited from the war, since the US lost relative few people and now had Western Europe and Japan under its influence. This justified the occupation of eastern Europe by the Soviet Union, not more then fair. Never mind that there was an agreement with Stalin that all occupied countries should have free elections after the war. This (PBS?)'expert' does not seem to understand that the Eastern European countries were brutally oppressed by Russia, while the western European nations were free democracies.    There are other more interesting interviews with e.g. Hitler's secretary and German and allied commanders. Also with regular soldiers and civilians from Germany, Russia and the occupied countries.  Also footage about live in the occupied countries (Holland, Poland) and Germany during the war.    Overall well worth buying, a good historical overview of the rise and fall of Hitler. Of great historical value for present and  future generations.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Say what you will about Cloverfield's \\"shaky cam\\" technique, but this film utlizies the style to great effect. Billed as salvaged government footage, the movie follows a group of people in new york, when it is suddenly attacked by a giant monster. What I like about that idea is the fact that you don't even get a good look at the creature until about half-way through the movie; and every time you do glimps it, the monster looks weirder and more bizare--this keeps the audience guessing. Then there are other surprises as well that I won't reveal, but let's just say that this is the most creative giant monster movie I've ever seen. They actually thought it through and presented the creature as something that could potentially exist in nature.    The characters are believable and we empathize with them. My only real quirk is that the camera guy is often the comic relief and he comes off as extremely annoying at times. Also, some of the decisions they make and the plot points in the movie seem just a little far-fetched. That, and the ending might cause some people dislike this movie.    Otherwise, Cloverfield is a genuinely scary movie. I have seen plenty of horror films, new and classic, from Tetsuo the Iron Man to the Texas Chainsaw remake. So it's very difficult to scare me. But I saw this in theaters and it actually made me scream--twice! If you're looking for a horror/drama that is unique and reinvents old genres, then I highly recommend Cloverfield.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|If you don't get this film, it may be time to re-evaluate your sense of humor and your existence in society. People who don't take themselves too seriously and appreciate some good, whitty and well-delivered nonsense get this film.  Perhaps, that's what this is about in a sense. The Dude is just trying to chill, and finds himself stuck with a bunch of ridiculous characters who take themselves too seriously. It's very funny that he is absolutely the most well-adjusted character in the flick. How can that NOT be funny? It's a brilliant parody of our uptight and senseless social worlds. If you need a plot to follow what the point is... Well, Brandt, I just don't know what to tell you.    \\"This aggression will not stand, MAN\\"
B0018QCXGY|4.0|This is one of those movies that everyone either hates, or loves. If you look at all of the ratings, approx 130 are 5-stars, and 129 are 1-stars. Completely even.    I think that this was a great movie. I loved the whole 'civilians point of view thing.' A lot of people complain about the camera and how nauseating it is, or how it movies all over the place and how it looks like a home movie. Well, I hate to break it to you, but the reason why it's like that is because it is. The whole point of the movie was to film it from a civilian's point of view. If it was from everyone's point of view, then it would've been done professionally. But the whole point of the movie was that the camera was supposed to look like someone was running around and making a home-movie.    I thought that everything about this movie was great. Even the beginning where it was talking about everyone's lives. I thought that was great too. Although it is a little lengthy, if you think about it, it kind of needs to be done. You have to establish a bond between the characters and the viewers. Let's face it, nobody's really gonna pay attention to the movie unless they like the characters. If it started off with blood and guts then it would be pretty boring. But if you like a certain character and don't want to see them die, you'll find yourself paying attention and enjoying the movie even more just because of a bond you have with a certain character.    Also a lot of people complain that you don't get to see certain things happen in this movie. Uhh... that's the whole point... again! It's from a civilian's point of view. I'm sorry, but if someone gets shot in the middle of the street, the police aren't exactly going to let you run into the middle of the crime scene and inspect everything.    This Blu-Ray edition has a lot of great features that go in-depth with the story-line and explain everything. The only reason I gave it four stars was because although I found the beginning necessary, it was a little lengthy.
0767817710|4.0|Brilliantly weaving classic western themes into tantalizing backstories, unfolding through the interactions of allegorical characters that represent legends such as Calamity Jane and Billy the Kid, combined with the most duel-style gunfights of any movie in history, this is a singularly wonderful work of western cinema.  I've seen The Quick and The Dead at least a half a dozen times, and I've loved it more each time.  This movie makes your heart beat faster, touches a myriad of emotions, and provides the unique entertainment satisfaction of classic westerns such as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; and High Plains Drifter.  Indeed, The Quick and The Dead is a \\"must own\\" for anyone who loves westerns or action films.  This is a movie that receives a lot less attention, favorable reviews, and fame than it deserves.  It's a guilty pleasure in which I richly indulge.
B00169N0BK|1.0|My 2 cents...My setup is twin acer 19\\" widescreens. Not high end but look good. I have moved from the huey pro, to the iOne Display 2. They huey worked really well, but did not do luminance and my monitors were way too bright. The iOne did luminance and seemed to handle the twin monitors well. But my prints were still off. I am using an Epson rx580. Also, not high end, but pretty decent prints. So, to gain the print profiling (aside from wanting my prints to match my monitors, I wanted to try some funky papers that I could not find profiles for) I moved up to the Color Munki. For me...it did not live up to it's hype and I wish I never bought the thing. It does not support twin monitors. They don't come right out and tell you that until you call for tech support. And the color app they recommend to download from MS...they don't support that either, and in fact Kevin from x-rite told me today that they don't even think the MS app works right. So, my two monitors look nothing alike. ok...at least I should have a single monitor that matches my prints...right? Nope. The monitor profiling gives inconsistant results for me. I have profiled both monitors and THE SAME monitor right after one another in the same lighting conditions and gotten different looking profiles. I am using the latest version of the colormunki software. As far as the printing goes...the profiling process has to be repeated several times because of the monitor issues. Prints look ok, but not any better than the Epson profiles. I am using InkPress Luster paper.<br /><br />I wish I had saved my money and stayed with the Huey pro.

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I'll warn you now, if you have read the book & enjoyed it avoid this movie at all costs, it will only make you angry.  The only thing Doug Liman (the director), used from the book was the two lead characters names & the ability to teleport. 95 % of everything else is brand new and not for the better, they might as well have ran a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie stating \\"this movie is geared for 12 year olds\\". It will be hard to read the book again & enjoy it as much as I used to.
0316010669|4.0|For me, this book was a good collection of stories, that hold some useful idea in them. And that is really exciting. But, unfortunately, as it was said above, Gladwell fails to bring the general idea (at least until the few paragraphs at the end of the book) and usually whiffle between those short stories. What's good - he gives you some  ideas of what you might want to explore more seriously later.
B00164DWEA|5.0|The second film to be produced directly by Marvel seems eager to prove why comic book companies should exercise direct control over their films.  Rather than being nothing more than a new director's take on an old classic, The Incredible Hulk is both an engaging film and a love letter to every other incarnation of the The Hulk that proceeded it.  This film truly endeavors to understand and assimilate the entire history of the character into one new project, and boy does it succeed.<br /><br />At the center of The Incredible Hulk is an ambitious attempt to marry the two most popular and conflicting visions of the character.  The film borrows many elements from the fondly remembered [[ASIN:B000FDDYPA 1970s television series]] but also incorporates many of the more important elements from [[ASIN:0785123741 the comic book]].  It's a tough balancing act, but the film makes the disparate elements mix together in a way that makes complete sense and (I believe), leaves fans of both series feeling satisfied.  The origin and characterization come largely from the TV series (though, thankfully, it's Dr. BRUCE Banner this time), but the more memorable supporting characters and conflicts from the comic are worked in as well (though Rick Jones was quite fortunately forgotten).  Additionally, the enemy is a highly logical choice from the comic book series.  Finally, the bad memories of a mutated Nick Nolte are beginning to subside.<br /><br />The film also incorporates minor elements from [[ASIN:B0000844JI the TV movies]], [[ASIN:B00005JKC3 the previous film]] (which is neither acknowledged nor completely contradicted), and even the previous [[ASIN:B00008I800 Hulk video game]].  Of course there are also many wonderful nods to fans of each of the Hulk incarnations.  The flashing danger light, the appearance of student reporter \\"Jack McGee,\\" and Stan Lee's cameo proved to be my personal favorites.  Lou Ferrigno also receives a far better cameo than in the previous film.<br /><br />Most importantly, whether you have any interest in previous Hulk incarnations or not, this film is exceptionally well plotted.  It resists the urge to shine the light fully on Hulk or Dr. Banner, instead carefully developing the two in unison.  Dr. Banner (masterfully played by Ed Norton, who actually outshines Bill Bixby) gets farther than his television counterpart was ever allowed, and that experience necessarily changes him.  The transformation is satisfying, yet still allows the franchise to return to familiar territory by the end.<br /><br />In parallel, the monster also receives his share of development, though this isn't made clear until the end.  His final scene cements this film's brilliant unison of television series and comic book, leaving no doubt that this is the most impressive project ever to come out of the Hulk franchise.  I was left so excited, so convinced for the first time that the character had truly come to life, that I almost expected Doctor Strange and the Defenders to show up in the next moment.  For only the third time in all my movie going experiences, a beloved comic book character actually seemed real (or at least possible), even in spite of the sometimes questionable computer animation.<br /><br />Finally, true Marvel fans will be amazed to see just how much continuity this two hour film packs.  Clear and meaningful ties are made to Captain America, [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man]], and S.H.I.E.L.D., and just you wait for the film's final scene!  While DC is still trying to decide who should play Superman and Batman for their Justice League movie, you can rest assured that Marvel is getting ready to tie their films together in a meaningful and impressive way.  The Marvel Universe has truly made the move into Hollywood and, with The Incredible Hulk as a shining example, it's safe to believe that they've just begun delivering everything a humble fan boy could ever hope for.r you have any interest in previous Hulk incarnations or not, this film is exceptionally well plotted.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I heard about the Jillian Michaels Shred Program from a friend and thought I'd give it a try.  I have to say that her exercises paired up with some of the Biggest Loser exercises have finally given me the results I've wanted for years. I've tried numerous exercises, Weight Watchers, low-carb diets and still didn't see results. I have been doing Jillian's workouts for 8 weeks now and have lost 16 inches and 10 lbs.  For those of you wondering if these DVD's work, they do, but you have to commit to them.  I work out 5 days a week and eat smart.  Give it a try, what do you have to lose.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|NOT GOOD AT ALL>>> BAD, BAD ALBUM >>>> NOT THE MADONNA I USED TO KNOW>>>>SONGS DOESN\\"T MAKE NO SENSE>>>IMMATURE>>>NOT REALLY MUCH TO SAY>>>>DISAPPOINTING...
B0014XCMVM|3.0|The hype and pre-release buzz of this, Alanis Morissette's 5th studio album, 4 years after the disappointing \\"So-Called Chaos\\" album, was that this is a return to the Alanis of old form, coming out of a(nother) bad relationship and hence full of vigor and bite. As a fan from the first hour (and having purchased all of her previous albums) I was enticed and snapped this up today, sound unheard.<br /><br />\\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" (11 tracks, 46 min.) starts off terrific, with the eventually hard-charging \\"Citizen of This Planet\\" (reminiscent of \\"Baba\\" from \\"Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie\\", including the eastern musical overtones), and followed by \\"Underneath\\" (1st radio single), which is pleasant enough. Track 4 is equally entrancing, a threatening \\"Versions of Violence\\". However, for some reason, things drop off quickly after that, with mostly mid-tempo songs that don't go anywhere. Witness \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\", and in particular \\"Moratorium\\", which screams to go loud, but just doesn't explode. \\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\" brings some relief, as at least it's up-tempo. The closer \\"Incomplete\\" summarizes the album quite well: pensive and nice but nothing that will grab your attention to play this over and over again.<br /><br />In all, I can't help but be disappointed. I simply expected more. More melodies, more hooks. But for a few songs, they are simply not there. I've seen Alanis many times in concert over the years, and if and when she comes around this neck of the wood, I'm sure I'll be there again. But this album is not Alanis at her best. \\"Under Rug Swept\\" from 2002 remains her last great album, in my book.
B00000DS2V|3.0|This is of course, the Beasties' debut and the album that made them a household name. Rock fans were outraged at the sampling of Led Zeppelin's deceased drummer John Bonham, rap fans were wondering who these snotty white kids were to think THEY could rap, while a whole new generation of kids hypnotized by MTV just didn't care.  They wanted to paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarteeeee and the Beastie Boys were all too willing to provide the jamz.  Cuts like \\"Fight For Your Right (to party)\\", \\"Brass Monkey\\" and \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\" are still playing at frat parties today I would bet....    To me though, this is their \\"Born In The USA\\" album: it's their biggest seller and the one album even non-Beastie fans are likely to have, but it owes its success to the fact that it's also the most watered down and genericized Beastie Boys.  While some of the songs truly are interesting and fun to listen to (I particularly like \\"Girls\\"), the sound and feel on this cd is ICE cold.  It's very sterile and non-groove feeling.  If the songs weren't as good as they were, this one could have been a true disaster of a debut because the feel just isn't there.    Which is truly odd because if you listen to subsequent Beastie Boys albums, particularly their 1989 followup, \\"Paul's Boutique\\", you find that the Beastie Boys are anything but talentless rappers with no feel.  In fact, quite the opposite, they are true slaves to the groove!  They would later play their own instruments and do so with enough prowess to release individual cuts and even a full album of instrumentals with grooves so strong that they stand on their own.  But groove is completely lacking on \\"Licensed To Ill\\", so I have a hard time with much of it.  But if you want a great party record, this one could be for you.    To get more of what the Beastie Boys are really capable of though, check out \\"Paul's Boutique\\" or even the 2-disc compilation \\"Sounds of Science\\" (which contains most of the best songs from \\"Ill\\" anyway and is pretty cheap for a used copy here on Amazon....).

After the first time you watch the series, take your time to watch it again, and notice amazing details here and there, thanks to Austen's genius.  The same happens with Shakespeare in Love, where tiny details of the author pop up as the spectator is not distracted by the main theme.  Enjoy!  P&P is still an amazing production 12 years after it's opening!
B000YABYLA|4.0|I read somewhere that in ancient times, a woman's soul or a window into her thoughts was called \\"juno\\". There was also a separate masculine word for the same thing.<br /><br />The movie JUNO seems to give us a glimpse or a window into the thoughts and soul of our young 16 year old protagonist. In fact, in the movie, Juno discusses how her father was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology at the time she was born.<br /><br />As a movie viewer, I have to admit that I felt that I was indeed looking into the mind, soul and heart of this young girl who faces a pregnancy she wasn't counting on. Ellen Page does a tremendous job with the lead character of Juno MacGuff. There are moments when the language is a bit quirky like some other reviewers noticed; but you overcome this because of the depth and the soul of the performances. Michael Cera is magnificent as Paulie and is perfectly lovable in his portrayal of the ill prepared, ill equipped young father.<br /><br />Though I loved Cera's and Page's performances, the movie does deal with teen age pregnancy, discussion of abortion, has some sexual scenes and some other segments which a parent may or may not want their family to view. I believe in fairness to the film that all of the above was handled incredibly well.<br /><br />Despite the above and maybe because of the expert handling of some very sensitive subjects, Jason Reitman hits a home run with his second feature film. It is a stunner and definately the standout that critics say it is. Deserving a lot of the credit is Diablo Cody who really is the creative mind behind the story itself.<br /><br />Recommended as a wonky, dorky, quirky experience of family values both good and bad.

B00006ADD5|2.0|Its suprising that this movie is from 1962. It feels like a movie made in the 40's or 50's. It has that overblown theatrical feel. Kind of like Wizard of Oz. There are some redeeming qualities of this film. The filming and camera angles are excellent. Some of the acting is good, but not great. Its almost like a Monty Python movie except it isn't funny and it's too \\"old-style\\". Other than that, Lawrence of Arabia would have made a great parody Monty Python movie if they would have went for that. They should have because there is no historical accuracy, no middle eastern actors, nothing real whatsoever. But thats would people liked back then, fake b.s.<br />This movie is similar to the movie \\"Giant\\". Its way too long and it has good actors but the performances are weak. \\"Giant\\" was absolutely horrible though, and this movie is not horrible, just boring, dumb, thoughtless, it also reminds me of Hogan's Heroes, where all the army people talk like they got a gerbal in their throat, or maybe in their pants I don't know. There is one scene where a British officer touches Peter O'Tooles nipple and starts fondling his breast. Peter O'toole hits the officer and then gets whipped while the perverted officer watches and starts coughing, is that like a hernia test innuendo or something? Whats up with the coughing?<br />There is another scene where Peter O'Toole gets shot with a gun and the gunshot has enough force to knock him off the top of a train car, but then gets up with only a little bloodspot on his shoulder. Is this \\"Night of the Zombies\\", or is this supposed to be somewhat historical? They can't make their minds up whether this movie was supposed to be a big joke, or whether they wanted to go somewhere with this. Regardless, there is some beautiful scenery of a bunch of white american actors trying to look Arabic riding camels through the desert. They either talk British or American of course. This would have made a great black comedy if they would have had to eat Peter O'Toole at the end because they got hungry. Oh well, waste 4 hours and watch this junk.le at the end because they got hungry. Oh well, waste 4 hours and watch this junk.
0375707972|3.0|This book is an oddity. Its international success is a complete surprise to me. The fact that it has provoked over 760 reviews here with a broad and even spectrum of responses demonstrates that it hits a nerve. Many different ones actually.<br />I like Schlink as a writer of detective novels. He invented a great PI, an aging reformed Nazi called Selb, a name which enabled great titles like Selbs Justiz or Selbs Mord. A writer and a hero with their hearts on the right spot, with interesting cases in post war Germany.<br />But the Reader is something else. The story is 'simple' enough: a teenage boy has a love affair with an older woman, a tram ticket collector; part of the charm of the affair is that the boy reads to the woman after sex. Then they lose contact when she moves away. Later, he is a student at university, he finds out that she is an accused in a Nazi trial, she was a KZ guard, and it becomes apparent that she is illiterate, and too proud to admit it. She can not even read the dossier of the prosecution.<br />Which reminds me of Monty Python's Meaning of Life: the fish in the aquarium in the restaurant watch the guests eating fish and ask themselves in excitement: what does it mean? Exactly. What is Schlink's point? Till now I have no clue.<br />Are the Nazi criminals just illiterates too proud to admit their lack of education? That can't be it, obviously, so what is 'it'?<br />Schlink pokes into a deep well of ambiguity, but there ends his contribution. He goes no further in clarifying anything. What do we conclude from his story? I wish I knew.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I haven't seen the play or the original version of the movie, though I did put it in my Netflix queue, so I really didn't know what to expect other than musical comedy set in the 60s.    Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is an overweight teen who loves to dance, and her dream is to get on the Corny Collins show. Her mother (John Travolta) cautions her against auditioning, wanting to spare her daughter the disappointment, but her father (Christopher Walken) encourages her to go for her dream.    Tracy does get on the show, and her dancing and sparkling personality make her a big hit, much to the chagrin of the program manager (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants her own daughter to be the star.    When Tracy finds out that the show's \\"Negro Day\\" is being canceled, she joins with Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) to protest segregation.    There are some serious issues presented: racism, obesity, and the value of family, but it's overall a feel-good movie. The racists get their comeuppance, overweight Tracy gets the cute boy, and Wilbur and Edna Turnblad are solidly in love.    The music is catchy and fun, and nearly irresistible. If I'd been watching it at home, I'd have been dancing.    And the humor... when I wasn't dancing in my seat, I was laughing, or at least grinning. My cheeks hurt afterward, I was smiling and laughing so much.
0790733226|2.0|First, the very opening of the movie is fantastic - almost worth the discounted purchase price by itself.    The special effects are really quite good.    The acting ranges from good to poor but, is generally passable.    The story development and character interactions are OK if one hasn't read the book.    However, if one has read the book there is such a distortion of both characters and their interactions and loss of sophistication and nuance as to be quite maddening.    Ah, for what might have been!
0553277472|5.0|I read this book as a fairly impressionable teenager when it first was published.  My generation took it to its heart because it mirrored a feeling that we knew which way the cookie crumbled but we also knew instinctively which way it ought to crumble.  I wrote naively to Mr. Persig and my letter came back to me with his cryptic comments, handwritten, dotted over the pages, but at least he took the time to respond.  One of my questions was: does each individual HAVE to embark on their own journey and travel their own road in order to learn these (in the book)lessons? and his enigmatic answer was \\"yes and no\\" - so maybe that places him up there with Grasshopper's mentor.  I've travelled a long road since then but I still dip into its pages.  I see things differently but the ideas remain valid.    Quite apart from the ideas in the book, the guy can write and so reading English expresed in a unique, compelling style is a rewarding experience in itself.
B00006L83N|4.0|\\"The Odyssey\\" (2002) is the sixth album by progressive metal band Symphony X. It has an epic, symphonic feel, and features a 24-minute track based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\".<br /><br />Michael Romeo's guitar is fantastic as always, and Russell Allen shows an outstanding vocal range. With a running time of over an hour, \\"The Odyssey\\" has enough variety to keep the listener's interest, even if it is a little inconsistent overall.<br /><br />All told, this is a solid progressive metal album from one of the best prog metal bands out there.

B000092Q4U|5.0|1st off id like to say im not rating this a perfect 5 stars, im going with 4 1/2 stars, but that rounds up to 5 anyways.    I have ashes of the wake and sacrament. id figure i take a trip back in time and get LOGs older stuff.    I got burn the preist and new american gospel. they were ok. they were A LOT heavier than i expected. u cant understand randy in either of those albums, and the songs are short and the guitar riffs arent as memorable or catchy as in AOTW or sacrament. but they were definately brutal, to say the least.    so then i listen to as the palaces burn.    amazing cd. this is were LOG started maturing into an amazing band with great overall musicianship. the cd is very good. everything you love from the AOTW and sacrament you will find in this album.    it makes AOTW seem like 'As the palaces burn 2.0'    if you want to download one song to see an example of the cd, the best song i think is 11th hour.    RECOMMENDED TO ALL METAL FANS.

B00004RFFS|5.0|I first was introduced to this movie when I was 13, and it still haunts me today.  I read the book two years later, and suprisingly, I love both just as much!  I was also glad that Anne Rice that did the screenplay, since not a lot of authors get that chance.  By her doing that, she brought what she wrote to life instead of someone else.    Tom Cruise: Best performance I've ever seen, since he's very diverse in his career. I haven't looked at him the same way since, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  Very chilling, likeable and sexy!    Brad Pitt: Another great performance of Louis! I love the humanity still portrayed after he's turned, and adds a bit of light to the film.    Kirsten Dunst: Scared the life out of me!  Just as scary, and sick, as in the novel.  She touches the surface of her love for Louis, which made her such a great performer.    Antonio Banderas: In the book, Armand is much younger, but hey when you get someone sexy like Banderas, you can't complain!  Just the way he looks at the characters makes you wish you weren't really there.    Another thing I absolutely loved was the dark, beautiful soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal.  That is one any vampire lover must have in their music library.  The opening song sucks you right in until the very end.  But one thing I didn't like, since I'm religious, was the nudity and torture to the girl on the stage.  It was in the novel, and I'm glad they stayed faithful to it, but it was hard to watch.  But otherwise, the blood and dark atmosphere was amazing to watch.  This is highly recommended, you won't regret it!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I haven't read Jane Austen's book or seen the BBC series.  Sorry...kill me!!<br /><br />I enjoy movies and don't feel the need all the time to read the novel beforehand.<br /><br />I did read \\"No country for Old men\\" before seen the movie. Definitely there's a big gap between some movies and their book.<br /><br />I also understand that movies have only 2 hours to comprise a book.  Many fans of the book may not share the inevitable editing choices, due to time and business constraints.  That is another constant inevitable.  But also, those editing choices made it possible for an excellent book to reach a mainstream audience, that otherwise may never have had the possibility to be exposed to some part of it and/or relate to it so closely.<br /><br />Since this a forum to review THE MOVIE, I'll do that.  I hope some readers<br />appreciate my review it's not biased by the novel, which I don't doubt is great.<br /><br />First the cinematography and photography are outstanding.  The music is beautiful, it enhances greatly every piece.  The costumes are gorgeous, may or may not be appropriate for the period on some regard.<br /><br />The language is striking, rolls over the tongues of the characters easily and pleasantly.<br />Sophisticated language used to provide a richer communication than we have with our contemporary butchery of it.<br />Reminder of a time where people read and language was enjoyed and honed to increase it's effectiveness, on societies where statements were carefully worded, because what said meant what it meant, and people were not able to hide behind sarcasm and ignorance, when honor was beheld high.  And the consequences of disrespect and/or misunderstandings were significant.<br />A time without TV:) -if you want to save your soul smash yours with a bat-<br /><br />Mr. Darcy is a proud, perfectionist man.  A pose he adopts to protect himself from his insecurities.  By this device, avoiding the risk of trying to attract and be rejected.  He places unrealistic qualities on his ideal woman to avoid having again to be attracted to the real one and be rejected.<br />The essence of shyness, which everyone can relate to.  The flawed leading man, cornerstone of every good script.<br /><br />\\"I don't have the talent of conversing easily with people I have not met before\\", Darcy confesses to Elizabeth, revealing his flaw, disarming himself and standing naked shy before the woman he loves, as his greatest gift.  Teased by Elizabeth, he finds himself as rules of seduction will point,even more captivated by her.<br /><br />And rising love as a catalyst of virtuosity in men, the only force so powerful as to bring a man out of this shell of pride, and risk utter embarrassment: his deepest fear.<br /><br />The fear of, as The great Lebanese poet/philosopher Kahlil Gibram says on  \\"The Prophet\\" in his essay about Love:<br /><br />\\"...To know the pain of too much tenderness.<br />To be wounded by your own understanding of love;<br />And to bleed willingly and joyfully...\\"<br /><br />Darcy Places too much importance and pride on his intellect.  Hence, protecting himself of the \\"foolishness\\" of emotions, and all spontaneous crazyness that comes with strong states of emotion as love, with all the revelations of your true self it entails.  All that could lead to unexpected acts,  and to uncharted territory.  That is dreaded, thus avoided by the one inclined to control out of fear of failure or rejection.<br /><br />The first time he touches Elizabeth's hand to help her into the carriage and feels that unequivocal heat of great chemistry, punishes himself for his warmth and the possibility of having disclosed his emotions.  You can witness that on the shot of the tensing of his hand afterward.  Those subtleties punctuate the movie, and the detail makes the story more intriguing.<br /><br />Elizabeth is as many other heroines, is ahead of her time.  With a strong character and habits considered exclusively masculine is more of amodern woman.  Witty and with an acid sardonic sense of humor punishes all that she spots easily as phony.<br />Her wit and sarcasm her are her own shell, though, as hard as Darcy's.  And also the flaw that bonds them and along with their skill with words.  Language as a an armor becomes also a game for the two, to prove who's able to penetrate the other defenses, mascaraded attraction, finally<br />Wounding them both, with the delicious bittersweet tenderness of sexual repression liberated.<br /><br />And yes, ever so trite: love.<br /><br />She's more open to love, and so able to taunt Darcy into following her into their final \\"jump\\" into the unknown depths and heights of love and their ultimate purification.

080012166X|5.0|Personally, I hated the novel and hoped to see the film was done a lot better. Coppolla really did add some good touches to the novel, as well cast some unforgettable actors.  Gary Oldman is the master as Dracula, who really makes you cry and fear him.  Ryder is pretty good, though I have disliked some other stuff she's done.  The other supporting cast in incredible, making the story seem real and alive.      Probably one of the best things about the film, despite the nudity, was the soundtrack by Wojeich Kilar.  Some songs are scary enough not to listen to at night, but grab you and make you visualize the images of the film.  It deserved the 3 Oscars it won, though Oldman should've gotten a reward for his stunning performance.  This is the vampire film all fans should own, or at least see once in their lifetime, because is this is what immortal love is all about.
B000Q8QHK8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000Q8QHK8 Natural Born Killers [Blu-ray]]]<br />I remember the exact moment this movie came out, the soundtrack as well.  People argue and have different opinions, and to that to each his own.  Oliver Stone nailed this movie with a vision, a message, and an over the top artistic flair.  When I first watched this movie I was glued to the screen.  Abuse can do things to people, but is still no excuse for murder.  Although, this movie takes fiction and makes it reality. The American media does make killers, etc. infamous.  It almost reminds me of \\"Divine's\\" character in John Water's \\"Female Trouble\\".  This movie is one that might be disturbing, but the music the visuals makes it a masterpiece that should not be looked over.  To the people who have the opinion of this sucks, I think they should reflect.....and watch the news and wake up.  Anyway just watch the darn movie!
0765348780|4.0|Much of the fantasy writings out there are intended to be a series (Guy Kay the exception that comes quickest to mind).  This is what makes the fantasy genre one of the few with the potential to build a lore for it's world, and to develop truly epic storytelling.  Obviously I enjoy that aspect or I wouldn't read fantasy.<br /><br />The reason I say this is that this 'series' storytelling is difficult to approach when developing a critique when compared to other genres.  If one  points out a flaw in a book, it may very well be intentional, to be resolved later.  Thus there are 2 aspects of reviewing this kind of fantasy; how each book measures up as a stand-alone, and how the story works as a whole.<br /><br />That being said, I give my thoughts on this, book 1; GARDENS OF THE MOON; including, unavoidably, the minor gripes thay may very well be proven not gripes at all further into the series*.<br /><br />GARDENS OF THE MOON is an ambitiuos, entertaining, and fast paced book that I enjoyed very much.  The first indication that the reader is experiencing something different is the truly epic battle that takes place early on.  It is a bold stroke from a bolder author that says, 'let's cut the crap, I want to see some fighting!'.  However, it is also a beginning that is so 'in situ', with so many goings on and history built into the book, that it's major challenge is to keep up with it all.<br /><br />The Dramatis Personae is huge.  The structure of the book is such that many independent plot points are set up individual of each other, with the climax tying all these fates together. This isn't a bad thing; I applaud Erikson's no-apologies style of writing built-in lore.  But it can be a little jarring when the story shifts to a completely new situation and the reader is asked to invest all over again in a new set of unfamiliar people.  It might have helped if the story were actually slowed down at times, and some of the concepts made a little more clear.<br /><br />Ergo, my major qualm with the book is that it's very assets are also potential negatives, depending on the reader.  Rather than lag the pace down with awkward exposition on the world the story inhabits, it drops fragments of it as the story races along. However this is a risky choice, and it may backfire to a lot readers.  I was reminded periodically of Frank Herbert's DUNE, which attempted a similar goal but eased in the story lore sublimely.  As a book in a series, I really can't say if some of difficulties while reading it become assets further on, making this book improved in hindsight and re-reading ( I have been told by many of my friends that this IS the case, and that it all becomes clear further on).  I can say, however, that I am glad I took a chance with this book and have faith in the author until he steers me wrong (famous last words before to Mr. Goodkind and Mr. Jordan).<br /><br />I would consider GARDENS OF THE MOON a 'higher tier' fantasy novel.  It is best enjoyed by people who already have a feel for magic, epic battles, and the fantastic.  Novice readers might feel too alienated with the vast and detailed work to 'go with the flow' (as has been said by others in this page, a reading of THE BLACK COMPANY and SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series, as well as the CONAN stories of R.E. Howard, would greatly enhance the accessibilty of this book to newbie fantasy readers).<br /><br />Overall, GARDENS OF THE MOON is much above the bell-curve, and I will definitely continue on with this series.  It's complexity is not a major flaw at just one book, but perhaps a boisterious misstep by a new, eager voice in Fantasy.  That is totally acceptable.<br /><br />*I haven't currently read further in the series.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|Danger Mouse is one of the most inventive producers I've ever heard. Cee-Lo shares a lot of that creativity in his vocals.  This mash-up was one of the biggest successes in the music industry.  A new genre was generated out of the storm of Gnarls Barkley.  I am a strong supporter of this new age, and these two guys are leading the movement.  We are at a time when people are dying for something new.  Gnarls Barkley is the most original music in this age.  Theres nothing quite like them.<br /><br />So anyway I would go through the tracks, but I don't have a problem with anyone of them.  The most important track on the cd is \\"Crazy\\".  This opened the door to the new realm of music, and the whole world responded and loved it.  The song won a Grammy and stayed number one on the UK's charts for 9 weeks.  This song was a major success because of its originality and catchiness.<br /><br />Other than that, some songs surpass that single for me.  \\"St. Elsewhere\\" is most likely the best title track I've ever heard.  \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" and \\"Smiley Faces\\" are great upbeat songs that give the album balance.  I absolutely love \\"The Boogie Monster\\" and \\"Feung Shui\\"! Who else has made songs like these? No one else! That is why it is St. Elsewhere.<br /><br />Anyway the remander of the album is just as magical as the beggining. \\"Just a Thought\\", \\"Transformer\\", \\"Who Cares\\", and \\"On-Line\\" are all 5/5's.  \\"Necromancing\\" falls a hair short for me, but every song cannot be perfect.  The album's ending tracks \\"Storm Coming\\" and \\"The Last Time\\" leave the audience with anticipation for the sequel.  The whole album really serves as one great song.  I have the best memory of the album because it brings me back to a cold winter.  I hope it creates special memories for all of you who've never listened before.<br /><br />A word on the sequel.  \\"The Odd Couple\\" does not quite live up to the expectation but it is still Grrrrreat material. So don't miss out.
0671015206|4.0|Descriptions from interviews of millionaires were the most interesting aspects of this book.  The authors occasionally cited actual paraphrases from some of these folks and those statements were often impactful.      At the end, it's all common sense as in almost all business books.  My biggest gripe was the overbearing use of statistics - they can make the numbers say whatever they want and there were times that they did this.  For example, their questionaire must have had a question about being self-made or did they recieve an inheritance.  Everyone always says they are self-made even if they came from a fairly well off family.  They oversimplify how difficult it is to become more wealthy than your parents.  Relying on the answers to a questionaire for this insight is unreliable.    But in summary, the book makes some great points about the inner workings of a traditional successful business owner.  My favorite of which is that any business owner in any industry can become immensely successful, whether it be hauling garbage, running pawn shops, designing software or selling pharmaceuticals.  It's all about hard and smart work.
B000024ZYP|5.0|For starters, ECM doesn't release junk. They just don't do it. If you are a fan of one ECM release you are a fan of them all. In this regard, ECM is one label that takes the guessing game out of purchasing music. All but two of the 11 tracks on here are original compositions by Brahem, with \\"Mazad\\" being composed by Holland and \\"Kernow\\" by Surman. Amidst the ripping bass lines of Dave Holland and the ardent musings of John Surman's soprano sax and bass clarinet, Brahem weaves his captivating strums upon the oud into this reflective outing. Bursting into a subdued musical rapture with two refined veterans of improvisation, Brahem manages to capture our imaginations and hold our attention throughout. One of those rare albums that one just listens to as the centerpiece of activity. (Beautiful)
B0014XCMVM|3.0|I really wish I could give Flavors of Entanglement a perfect rating due to being a huge Alanis fan for many years. While her newest release in four years(three if you count the acoustic release of JLP)is much better then 2004's So-Called Chaos, the production on Flavors of Entanglement causes a few gray areas. First, Morissette's lyrics are autobiographial as always, and also some of the most introspective writing she's done in a long time. Her words are deeply poetic, very concise on her word choices and sense of language, while every experience she draws on this time is filled with powerful narratives, metaphors, and free verse styles. Both her heart and intelligence as a writer come off stronger than ever. Where Flavors of Entanglement needs work is in the sound and tempo within some of the songs. Prior to this release, I had read a couple of articles that told of Alanis coming back with a different kind of sonic sound, but that isn't quite the case or Guy Sigsworth is just not the producer for her. He certainly doesn't strike me as one who wants to push the envelope, which Alanis sort of needs behind her. Glenn Ballard was of course a great collaborator for her, but Morissette may have even done better producing this herself being that she showed great production skill on 2002's Under Rug Swept. It's almost as if Sigsworth wasn't compelled to work on these tracks for a longer period of time. An example would be \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man,\\" where Alanis writes about the admiration she feels when a man can let his guard down, but the almost cookie-cutter melody could stand to be reworked a little more. \\"Giggling Again For No Reason,\\" is a wonderful tune about riding to nowhere with the freedom of one's spirit, but I find myself waiting for the melody to become a little more upbeat and extended every time I hear it-but it doesn't. Alanis Morissette is a versatile artist, which leaves me to question why Sigsworth didn't suggest turning some of these tracks into more electronic, danceable, sonic grooves mixed with a rock beat because she's more than capable of that kind of experimentation.     As for the songs themselves, the strongest are the first single, \\"Underneath,\\" in which Alanis shows her metaphysical worldview by explaining the way we live personally plays a part in how things work globally. \\"Straightjacket,\\" and \\"Versions of Violence,\\" are also highlights and among the best-produced, as is the declaration in the feel of \\"Moratorium.\\" Alanis and her band performed a great version of \\"Moratorium\\" live as a preview when I saw her open for Matchbox Twenty last February. I actually think many of these songs will sound better live, and looking forward to \\"Citizen of the Planet,\\" and \\"Tapes,\\" in live form when Alanis tours to support the album. Of the two most transparent songs that seem to tell about the loss of her last relationship, \\"Not As We,\\" and \\"Torch,\\" I would say \\"Not As We,\\" is the stronger track by far. It's not that Flavors of Entanglement comes off as terrible, but much of the studio work just sounds very(no pun intended)incomplete. 3 1/2 stars.
0670020745|5.0|Dr Taylor shows there are many kinds of knowledge, but maybe only one kind of awareness. The specialjourney that \\"Stroke of Insight\\" chronicles is surprising. It's a lesson how new learning, understanding and benefit can come of an experience that most would consider a severe blow. If you have the courage to face it and see it.    The ability to experience something on several levels, beyond the daily vision of most of us, and then to share it in such a clear and thoughful account is rare. In this book, Dr Taylor shows her courage doesn't end with facing pain, loss or mortality, but she also now breaks convention and presents her ideas and experience in full view, with their emotional and philosophical content included. Not only was she inspired by her own journey, but she shares the inspiration directly with the reader.    More than just an interesting read, this is one of the books that lets the reader peek inside the mind of another and, in doing so, to learn more about the self and the nature of our existence. Well worth your time.
0743571975|4.0|I found this audio series somewhat difficult to listen to because of the unvarying tone of the reader and difficult to understand because of sentence structure. But all-&-all worth listening to and studying.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|There are some movies that inspire you.  Some of these do not inspire you by the masterful manipulation of a storyteller, but by describing something that happened or someone who in real life rose up to the task as a role model.  This is one of those movies.<br /><br />I read one review that complained about the length.  While it is a little long on time, it is not boring; my wife commented that it started slow but picked up steam.<br /><br />There are several applications in this movie, but I won't mention them.  It does show that politics haven't changed much in the last 200 years or with geography.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd has become one of my favorite actors, between this and his portrayal as Reed Richards in the Fantastic Four.  Both my wife and I were very impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch as the prime minister, and Michael Gabon was great as MP Fox.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to be shown at church with a time of discussion following it.  Or maybe split it over two weeks.<br /><br />Jeff Reynolds.

B000001FTD|3.0|\\"Among the Living\\" just hasn't aged very well.  Charlie's drumming has always been a personal favorite, and the bass and rhythm guitar work of Anthrax has always been well above par.  But Dan Spitz has always been, well... lacking, as a thrash solo guitar player.  He's not bad, just not all that great.  Certainly better than the pre-marty Friedman Megadeth days, and at least on a par with Kirk \\"don't ever step off that wah pedal\\" Hammett... Kerry King's and Jeff Hanneman's maniacal mayhem solos are of a whole different caliber...     That, and, I hate to say it... but I just don't like Joey Belladona as a vocalist.  He doesn't have a bad voice, just one that has always seemed out of place with the music, at least to me.  And lyrics... well, we all knew Anthrax was far sillier than the rest of the 1980's thrash legends... but that has been a large part of their downfall over time.  Seriously, listen to \\"Indians\\" or \\"I Am the Law\\"... they're a little TOO silly for a thrash band, at least for me.    Still a classic, still a must own, and definitely still a landmark among 1980's thrash, just a bit dated and flawed.
0385340567|1.0|I have anxiously awaited every new Jack Reacher novel since getting hooked on them several years ago.  This was no exception.  I agree with many here that the plot lacked depth that we've come to expect with previous books.  It seems like a lot of the book wasted time on things that could have easily been tied up sooner and the ending left a lot to be desired.      Everyone has their opinions on current politics and for me it wasn't so much about Child's anti-war rantings in the book as it was that what he projected into Reacher was inconsistent with the character he developed so painstakingly over the years.  I'm sure what I see and have come to know as Reacher is clouded by my own opinions and biases, but suffice it to say, that is what I like about the character and the series.  The Reacher I know from the series has a deep sense of duty, and while he may empathize with desereters, he wouldn't down right support them.  And as mentioned before, I don't see how he actually allows (does!) what happens at the end to happen after ranting about collateral damage and overkill on civilians in Iraq.  After spouting the effects of DU and dirty bombs he just lets it happen?  So much for both those towns after that.    Very disappointed overall, but I won't give up on the series as Jack Reacher is one of my all time characters.  I just hope he sticks to doing what he does best in the next novel.
0804900973|3.0|I won't bother reviewing Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes stories, which feature one of the most popular and enduring characters in the world.<br /><br />Since most readers are at least a little familiar with the work, I'll focus on the package. This collection showcases 12 of the better Holmes stories, and, like many other collections, it begins with \\"A Scandal in Bohemia.\\" Strangely, the editors have chosen to end with \\"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches.\\" This goes against the grain of most collections, which finish with \\"The Final Adventure.\\" I would call that a bad editing choice.<br /><br />The introduction by Mr. Lowndes is a brief, serviceable and well-written overview of how Sherlock Holmes came to be a cultural phenomenon.<br /><br />There are certainly better collections out there, but this will serve well as an introduction to the character in some of his finer moments.
0307386864|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful book! It is a timeless story about the tangled relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. What I love so much about this book is how relevant these situations still are and how easy it is to relate to all of the characters. I have read other Jane Austin novels, and so far this is by far my favorite. Elizabeth is such a strong female character, and Mr. Darcy is a wonderfully complex and interesting male character. This is definitely one of my \\"comfort books.\\" Whenever I have had an unpleasant day or need to relax, rereading Pride and Prejudice always makes me feel better. Truly, it is on of the best books I've ever read.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This is the best soundtrack recording I have ever bought!<br />It really brings back the episode for me every time I hear it and makes me smile.

B000002KE2|5.0|Still a five star favorite, still an absolute must have... \\"Supernaut\\" and \\"Snowblind\\" are my favorite Sabbath songs, by far.  \\"Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener\\" is awesome, and the \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" is an (out of character, sort of) but cool acoustic piece.    However, I DETEST the ballad \\"Changes\\".  Hate it, hate it, hate it.  Don't know why, don't care.  Sorry, but Ozzy's voice just makes me cringe on this one and it always has... other than that, it's an awe inspiring album, and still great (if not on the level of the first three).
0385340567|3.0|Well, I did get what I call my \\"Reacher fix,\\" but it would be deemed my LEAST favorite of the Reacher series. (I've read them all--I plan to read them all over again too.) In this latest book, I kept scratching my head trying to figure out just why Reacher even got remotely involved in the town of Despair's mess.  The reasons given in the book just seemed too contrived, and really rather pointless to me. In previous Reacher books, the reasons for his  involvement in various situations were quite clear to the reader; they were personal, or due to unavoidable circumstances, or in defense of others, for the most part.<br /><br />I did not mind the stuff about Iraq, war, deserters, etc., but I feel that in this regard, the story really bogged down, many times, which is SOOO unusual for a Reacher book.<br /><br />Also, here's another thing that bothered me in this book, that has not in the past---I know and accept that Reacher is a love'em and leave'em type of \\"rambling\\" man, but this time, his sexual encounters with the female police officer, Vaughan, just left me feeling kinda cold. Did the book even mention her FIRST name for goodness sakes???  I don't remember, but I know I haven't quite felt this way about Reacher's romantic encounters in other books. It was kinda disappointing and unfulfilling for me.  Did any of the female Reacher fans feel this way?<br /><br />I cannot conceive of Lee Child ever writing a truly bad Reacher book or any other book/character for that matter.  I'm just wondering where Reacher's character goes from here--better places with more plausible conflicts/situations than was presented in this book.  Nevertheless,  believe me, that wherever the next Reacher book leads, I will definitely follow!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best version of Jane Eyre, I have seen to date! The movie is beautifully shot, it is poetically dark and mysterious, and beautifully romantic as well. The romance was the focus and the heart of this presentation, as it should be. I loved seeing a more passionate Jane and Mr. Rochester, while staying true to themselves. I also loved the banter between them. The cast is great.<br /><br />Favorite scenes: The scene after the fire between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the proposal scene, the scene when Jane is on the moors praying &#34;our Father who art in Heaven&#34;, and the scene when Jane returns to Edward.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this presentation of Jan Eyre, it is very well done.

B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is the most dominate dinosaur series out there! It has so many ranges of dinosaurs it's pathetic! { in a good way! } Ranging from the Velociraptor to the Brachiosaurus to the Tyrannosaurus! Jurassic Park is action packed fast paced and very entertaining! Steven Spielberg has made the dinosaurs belivable. Unlike Carnotaur, { The dinosaur in Carnotaur was actually a larger velociraptor } the dinosaurs are accurate in height weight and sound. You feel like your actually in the movie running away from them with the humans! I love Jurassic Park and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in dinosaurs or someone who is a fan of movie monsters! 5 out of 5 stars!
B000001FSU|2.0|Production is thick, sludgy and just plain terrible... even worse than the notoriously sludgy wall of sound that Metallica achieved on \\"Justice\\".  The songs are mostly long, not very inspired and tend to blend together too easily.  Anthrax just sounds kind of tired on this disc.      Which is odd, as it's not that bad, taken song by song.  Listen to just \\"Antisocial\\", or \\"Now it's Dark\\".  Really pretty good songs, taken one by one.  As an album, however, it just all tends to blur together into a bombastic wall of fuzzy grit... and not in a good way.      Still very worth a listen, and worh owning.  Easily picked up used in local used CD exchange type stores... which also shows how well it's stood the test of time for repeated listening over the years.  Unless you're huge into Anthrax, or just love that thick, bad 1980's production, it MAY gather dust in your collection.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|There are few films I treasure as much as Animal House. It is to creative comedy what Mozart is to music. I've seen it about 20 times and used to sneak out past my bedtime during childhood to watch it on our family room's television. Every performance--particularly Belushi's, Matheson's, Hulce's and Furst's--was outstanding. Every character resonates and the send up of the fraternity system changed our culture. Animal House is gloriously politically incorrect and harkens back to a time when we used to accept the inconsistency, selfishness, and unpredictability of human nature. Of course, you don't have to appreciate it for high-minded reasons because it's a rollicking laugh riot and it lifts your spirits.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I also read the book, loved it and couldn't wait for the movie. This one is disjointed from beginning to end and the \\"acting\\" is just what it is -BAD ACTING! The dialogue is cliche and the emotions unbelievable. Is it really that hard to at least learn a British accent for a period piece?? The other reviews already told the rest. The Tudors is 10 times better than this train wreck and the book is 100 times better. No wonder it made it to DVD so fast!!
0743496736|5.0|This author is incredible and I have yet to be disappointed with any of her books!
B00003CXB6|5.0|The Lost World Jurassic Park is probably better then the first Jurassic just because the plot is all ready set in motion and some of the same characters from the first return in the sequel. The Lost World also has a great range of dinosaurs from the cute but deadly compsagnathus to the swift Velociraptor to the largest carnivourus dinosaur in the jungle, the Tyrannosarus. The movie is action packed and moves at a very fast pace. The accuracy of the height, weight and looks of the dinosaurs is so breathtaking! I would highly recommend to anyone who loves dinosaurs or is a fan of movie monsters! 5 out of 5 stars!
B0002EXH4A|3.0|It's a three star album on the strength of \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" alone... and \\"Mary Jane\\", \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\"/\\"Set the World Afire\\" aren't half bad, either.  \\"Liar\\" and \\"Hook in Mouth\\" can be okay, if a bit juvenile... but \\"502\\" has to be one of the (if not THE) dumbest song ever written by Dave and Co.  And yes, the mutilated lyrics on \\"Anrachy\\" make it (unintentionally) hilarious.    Overall, an underrated and easily villified album.  Some really good Megadeth songs, some of the worst... and yeah, the remastering/remixing sucks.  Clean it up and make it sound a little clearer, fine.  Remove, re-record or boost parts twenty years after the fact because of a well publicized ego and a penchant for feuds and control issues... not fine.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|An older Indy (Harrison Ford) and his companions (Shia Lebeouf, Karen Allen, and John Hurt) are on the trail of a hidden city, where they plan to return a crystal skull to its rightful resting place.  In keeping with the Cold War milieu of the 50s setting, they are pursued by a beautiful Russian military scientist who specializes in psychic research (Cate Blanchett).  This iconic 50s window dressing, along with UFOs, A-bomb tests, McCarthyism, and greasers, adds to the fun of this entertaining movie.    A lot of people hate this film, as evidenced by the surprisingly low average rating of 3.5.  I'll admit that I was disappointed, too, but it's probably next to impossible to meet expectations that have been building for nearly twenty years.  Some of the action goes way over the top and the sci-fi elements don't mesh well with the Indy universe, but I'd say that this film still comes out ahead of \\"Temple of Doom.\\"  I liked the way they handled Indy's age, and it was fun to see Marion Ravenwood return.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|I love, \\"Too Much\\" and \\"What More Do You Want From Me\\". It has been one of the bright spots along with Kanye's and Jay Z's albums.  Definitely the best Soul/R&B album by far.  I enjoyed all the tracks from the first listen, which is rare.
B000WS4PCY|5.0|I have been a fan since Slippery When Wet.  This CD is definitely worth the money.  Every song is wonderful.  This album DOES have a country flavor, which is fine with me.  The tour has been a big seller.  I saw the Lost Highway show in Dallas.  I was, as always, impressed at how Bon Jovi makes each person in the audience feel so special.<br /><br />I highly recommend this disc.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Jurassic Park 3 is one of my favorites out of all the 3 movies. I like it because unlike the first 2 movies that were dominated by the Tyrannosaurus, they brought in the Spinosaurus that actually replaced the Tyrannosaur by getting into a fight with it a little later on in the film. I also like the fact that the velociraptor is in all three of the movies. Like the first two movies, Jurassic Park 3 is full of action, moves very quickly and is very accurate in it's dinosaur features. I love all three of the Jurassics and I would recommend all of them, 5 out of 5 stars!
B0002EXH54|4.0|Megadeth at their raw, drugged out, punky and pissed off best.  \\"Killing Is My Business...\\" is rawer, but a little too raw... the songs are there, just not as fleshed out and polished up as they needed to be for repeat listening.  \\"So Far...\\" has some of the single best 'deth songs, but the duds kill it as an album.  And the mighty \\"Rust\\" is a little too robotic and polished...    On \\"Peace\\", Dave was still drugged out and pissed off... the music may be metal, but the attitude is almost pure punk fury.  The song \\"Peace Sells\\" almost serves as a single song definition of metal in the mid-'80s... who DOESN'T get an evil little smirk just hearing the opening bass line?    Worst feature... Chris Poland's guitar tone on leads.  Yeah, it's a fat, screaming, liquid overdrive, but it's TOO much... coupled with his shaky (read: out of tune and off key at times) vibrato.... a Fender Twin overdriven THAT much should only be used by a pro that can HIT the note, HOLD the note, and VIBRATO that note between the proper pitches.... am I the only one who thinks some of his solo lines occasionally sound like the proverbial dying cat???
1552091090|5.0|I really think that people are over analyzing this book. It's a sweet book and it's meant for children. Yes, a little dramatized but all children books are. I mean, we read to them about animals and monsters. My mom read it to me and now I read it to my son. Nothing creepy unless you make out to be. I love this book but if you don't, just don't read it. No need for harsh criticism!!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|We've all heard, \\"This is the best album of the year!\\" so many times it seems to have lost its meaning.  But when I say this is the best album of the year, I really mean it.  I first heard, \\"Underneath,\\" and instantly loved it.  So I bought the single and waited for the entire CD to be released.  I put the CD in the computer and listened straight through.  It was like I fell into a trance because I couldn't stop.  It was just so amazing!    Let's do a little track-by-track shall we?    -\\"Citizen Of The Planet\\"- Odd lyrics (which is always a welcome) and a chorus full of crunching guitars!  Whoo!  I'd say this is one of my favorites!  -\\"Underneath\\"- The first single, probably the most publicly accessible.  I think it sounds a little bit like it's related to, \\"Thank U,\\" which was an amazing song, too.  Many people don't like this one, I don't see why.  -\\"Straitjacket\\"- Completely new for an Alanis album!  Wow!  It's dancey, electronic but with the witty lyrics Alanis is known and loved for.  Definitely a stand-out.  -\\"Versions Of Violence\\"- You will hear Alanis in her lowest octave ever on her CD's.  This is probably my overall favorite.  It's loud, dark, and just plain good.  The chorus is enough to make me just go, \\"Wow.\\"  -\\"Not As We\\"- A beautiful piano ballad.  Deep, meaningful lyrics played with a great piano and other orchestrations.    -\\"In Praise Of A Vulnerable Man\\"- A great song, just not a stand-out for me.  So I don't have much to say.  -\\"Moratorium\\"- Very synth-layered and very good.  Being the longest track on the album, you'd never know it.  It flies by like a good time!  -\\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\"- A total \\"feel good\\" summer song.  Again, a very stand-out track.  I return to this song all the time.  -\\"Tapes\\"- The lyrics are so pain-filled that I can feel myself carrying similar feelings as Alanis.  She conveys her emotions incredibly.  \\"Tapes\\" is definitely a stand-out.  -\\"Incomplete\\"- I love the beat of this song and the way her voice seems to literally soar.  I guess you could almost compare \\"Incomplete\\" to a Frou Frou song (Which is a massive compliment).    All in all, there is not ONE bad song on this album.  It's an incredible piece of art and I am just so elated that it's finally been released!
068987474X|1.0|So I found this book in the lounge where I work and flipped through during lunch. If you get past the myriad of typos, the flawed/non-existent logic, and the fact it's not funny, there's pretty much nothing left but a nice looking cover.     Still, even though I don't think of myself as an idiot, I took the book to heart. So days later when I ended up in the ER and had a very gorgeous doctor who seemed wildly attentive considering I only had a sprained ankle (he asked me for my number) and he didn't call, I assumed, \\"Hey, he's just not into me.\\" and went about my life.    Flash forward six months later, I get a call from a number I don't recognize. I let it go to voice mail purgatory only to discover it's my \\"He's just not into you\\" Doctor saying, \\"I've been waiting the required six months before I could call you. I practiced calling you every day.\\"    Hmmm, you think he's just not into me? or maybe this worked out because I played by the \\"rules\\". who knows? It's all hooey.
0553381407|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly eye-opening and helpful, both as the daughter of a toxic mother and the parent of two children.  The only thing that I am not sure about is whether confronting the toxic parent is always the best option.  The most obvious questions in my mind were \\"What's the point?  Why do you still want ANY relationship with this person?  Why do you feel you owe this person ANYTHING?  At what cost are you willing to keep trying?\\"  Several years ago I made the very difficult decision to end my relationship with my mother when, after years of trying so hard to keep some relationship going and suffering for it, I finally found the courage to ask \\"what's in it for me?\\" and realized the answer was \\"absolutely nothing positive whatsoever\\".  Also, being disgusted by her interactions with my children was a big factor.  I profoundly miss having a mother, but I do not miss her or her poison.
B000002H33|4.0|One of Metallica's crowning moments.  \\"Justice\\" is personally the preferred favorite, but \\"Puppets\\" is the better album.  Dark, bleak, harsh, FAR better production and clarity than \\"Justice\\" (although in need of a remaster at this point), more mature than \\"Lightning\\".    Just an all around solid classic with my favorite song of their's on it (Leper Messiah)... fan favorite \\"Sanitarium\\" is still good, just a bit overly vaunted in my mind.  \\"Thing That Should Not Be\\" is always a favorite, and \\"Orion\\" is their best (IMO) instrumental track.    An absolute landmark of 1980s thrash and modern metal in general.  This album will be one of the handful to be remembered 100 years from now, when most of the others are long gone, \\"Puppets\\" will remain.
B00002E224|2.0|If you like 'day in the life' movies, it's good.  But for me, I hate it when all the dialog in a movie goes no where. I did love the characters but when all they do is talk through the entire movie about nothing, I kept hoping it would get better.

0380725398|4.0|Georgian England.  Twenty-three-year-old Mary Yellan had a bad feeling in her gut during her coach ride to her new home.  The coachman himself tried to warn her against the place, but Mary had promised her dying mother that she would go live with her aunt Patience and her uncle Joss Merlyn after her mother's death.  And so, she will do it, no matter what the coachman or her own instincts tell her.  But Mary had never imagined what her new life would be like at Jamaica Inn.  Why on earth would her aunt and uncle buy such a place?  Not long after moving there, Mary discovers that Uncle Joss, an abusive and brutish alcoholic, doesn't let in any guests other than the occasional drinker into the inn.  Instead, he uses the place for smuggling alcohol and tobacco.  However, other sinister things occur there as well, one of which is possibly murder.  Mary is alone at Jamaica Inn.  Her once beautiful and bubbly aunt is now frightened and of very little use.  The only two people nearby who can possibly help are a mysterious albino clergyman and Rem Merlyn, Joss's younger brother -- a tall, dark and handsome horse thief with a callous character and a possible dark secret of his own.<br /><br />Jamaica Inn had a creepy, gothic language from the very beginning, and I couldn't help getting sucked into the suspense and horror that is her uncle Joss and his dark dealings.  Daphne du Maurier was a talented author of gothic novels.  I had only read Rebecca, and thought I'd give her other books a whirl.  Jamaica Inn, while not as good as Rebecca, is riveting and horrifying, but has the right touch of romance to give it a little bit extra.  The vicar of Altarnun is a true enigma, a very creepy character, and I couldn't help feeling trepidation every time he appears in a scene.  Rem Merlyn is also a dark and mysterious character, but I kind of hoped that he would indeed become Mary's love interest.  Mary is a young woman before her time.  She doesn't want to get married because she believes that marriage breaks a woman's spirit.  One look at her aunt would confirm her prejudices.  The ending is flooring, but not as flooring as the one in Rebecca.  Still, Jamaica Inn is a wonderful gothic that you will want to read.  It'll keep you turning the pages until the late hours of the night.  Daphne du Maurier was a definite talent.  I have The Scapegoat with me and I look forward to reading it.eves that marriage breaks a woman's spirit.  One look at her aunt would confirm her prejudices.

B000002KDO|5.0|The last truly flawless Sabbath album, from the frenzied first year(s)... before the drugs and turmoil really started to set in.  Sludge, doom and stoner metal nuts... listen up, 'cause this is the ONE!!!     I learned to play guitar to THIS album... not \\"Smoke On the Water\\" or \\"Iron Man\\"... \\"Sweet Leaf\\" has to be one of the best Sabbath songs ever (relatively easy to play, as well, for you aspiring guitar players)... \\"Children of the Grave\\" and \\"Into the Void\\" are personal favorites, as well.    Timeless, crushing, heavy, blistering, and a blueprint of how to do it right.

0679805273|5.0|We gave this book to my niece who just graduated from high school, at the top of her class.<br />She has loved Dr Seuss books since she was a little girl and this one is fitting for all the great places she'll go.
B000Y35A94|5.0|Yes,  I truly believe that this IS IT....the chances of this band, in any form, reuniting again is so slim that we'll probably see Bill Clinton in the White House again before these guys Tour or record ever again. Indeed, watching this document of the last ever Genesis Tour is a sad event....4 (or is it 5!) decades of absolutely GREAT tunes....wonderful personel and commraderie through the years....and, maybe, one of the most profound musical careers of our times. Yes, I will certainly miss this \\"Family\\" of guys---maybe more so than any other band or group of people. The good news, for us TRUE fans, is that they decided to give us what I have just watched, AND, will watch many, many more times to come....'When in Rome'. This DVD package is as good as anyone could hope for; Great songlist, Great quality sound and video and the usual outstanding musicianship onstage.          The setlist includes what may be the most comprehensive set of songs the band has ever toured with. Of course there are the 'usual suspects' such as 'Turn it on', 'AfterGlow', 'Invisible Touch', Etc., But there are also several that we haven't heard since the 'Duke' Era ----'Ripples', 'Carpet Crawlers' and 'Los Endos'. Is it THE set I would have picked? NO....but, it was a good move by the guys to \\"cater\\" to a very, VERY large range of concertgoers. Don't be swayed by comments that are being made concerning the tour----\\"lowered key/ pitch makes songs unlistenable\\"....\\"Old guys simply going through the motions\\", Etc. Personally the songs being lowered in Key for the sake of vocals made NO difference to me and was probably the difference between Phil \\"choking\\" parts and the smooth delivery we get here....Phil,  as usual, nails his parts. As for some saying these guys are uninspired on stage, I totally disagree...All songs were played with passion and prescision. These guys have never been a \\"showboat\\" band,  and they make no bones about their age. That said,  don't expect any David Lee Roth jumpingsplits or high kicks (although Phil's tambourine solo on \\"I know what I Like\\" is quite impressive!). As with most progressive bands, these guys are focused on one important element on this DVD----to replicate their music for the masses....this is no \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" here,  this is very involved music that requires concentration from the members.          Another nice aspect of this package/ show is the sound and stage. The audio and video is the best I've seen on any Genesis release. Very clear picture and sound throughout the show, with good camera angles and everyone getting their fair share of the lens. Thats not to say it isn't without its faults....there are times when the massive lighting casts overbearing colors on the band....very red and green in certain spots. Also there are a handful of times when Tony's keys are too \\"upfront\\" in the mix, as well as some strange harmonics(for lack of a better way to describe) that eminates from the synths from time to time, but none of what I mention above distracts from the overall show. I would also give special mention to the awesome stage for this tour.....Genesis has always had groundbreaking lights and backdrops,  but this is massive! Only Pink Floyd's 'Pulse' stage comes close. When I first saw the cover for 'When in Rome' I questioned the unsymetrical, almost \\"hokey\\" look of the stage....well, after viewing the DVD, I can see how it all fits together for one of the most spectacular stage/light shows that one is likely to encounter. There are at least 3 or 4 times during the show where the lights and video backdrop are almost as intense as the music being played....if 'In the Cage' doesn't raise the hairs, you might be dead!          So, all-in-all, this is probably the best we'll get from this great band....the show is certainly worthy, as well as the DVD documentary and extras included. Even if the band releases vault material such as 'Seconds Out' or 'The Lamb', it will never sound and look as good as 'When in Rome' (although an official 'SO' concert DVD would put me in Heaven!). In closing I would also like to throw out some opinions, since this may be the last review I write for a Genesis product. I have loved ALL incarnations of this band....early, experimental Gabriel era, as well as the prog-pop efforts of Phil and Ray Watson led Genesis. There are (and will always be) Gabriel-era \\"purists\\" who scowl at anything released after 'The Lamb', however, I can confidently say that EVERY album has somthing special and extraordinary....and YES, even moments of pure Progressive bliss! As matter of fact, I find myself reaching for 'We Can't Dance' or 'And Then There Were Three' more often than 'Nursery Chryme' or 'Lamb'. Some of the older albums simply didn't age well. That said, I will say that Peter leaving the band and Phil taking center stage was the best thing that could have happened to Genesis....otherwise they may have died a worse death than Gentle Giant, Focus and Camel. Phil, nor Genesis ever sold out musically(though they may have sold-out to Wal-mart!)....they remained musically significant till the end, and, quite frankly, you'll likely hear 'Throwing it All Away' or 'ABACAB' well into the future----will you hear 'Watcher of the Skies'....I doubt it....as much as I would like to. At any rate, if you are a fan of this band, don't think twice about picking this up....it really is a worthy memoir in every respect. Thanks, Genesis, for the wonderful music and memories....your music will never stray far from my life.
B000002JPA|1.0|...and can play the pants off almost any other band out there.  That much is pretty obvious, no matter what you think of the songs.    But, this sounds WAAAAAAAY too much like 1980's hair metal for my taste.  And not the \\"kinda okay in a silly mood because it's at least kinda heavy and at least faux-evil\\" Motley Crue's \\"Shout at the Devil\\" or even the \\"bluesy, gritty, sleazy and dirty\\" G 'n' R's \\"Appetite\\" kind of hair metal way.... the really craptacular and loathsome Bon Jovi or Def Leppard kind of way...     Musicianship is GREAT (ten star worthy on the strength of that alone), but the horrific songs, the style and tone is reminiscent of some of the worst music ever, to me (which is worth about negative 20 stars).     To each their own, I guess.

It worked great for us; and we are still in this routine a year later!  Our daughter thrives on EASY and is a well-rested, happy little girl.  I buy this book for all of my first time mommy friends!

0553473476|5.0|It's very unfortunate that some people in our country remain uneducated and uncompassionate about the facts behind the premeditated murder that occurred during Adolph Hitler's reign. There is also a great lack of proper spelling, grammar and punctuation amongst the one and two star reviewers in the Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl reviews. All of these facts are reasons to be concerned for the future of our youth and their education in english and world history. The great tragedy of all is that there is still doubt that the Holocaust really happened and was very horrible, there is still doubt that six million people were really murdered and doubt that the diary of Anne Frank was really authored by one of these murder victims. Hopefully we as individuals can speak for those 6,000,000 innocent murder victims, without forgetting the casualties of World War II and the millions of troops who gave the full measure of devotion and make a difference by speaking up when we hear someone deny or misinterpret the facts.
B000000H3W|5.0|Right at the dropping hour of grunge, this tasty sonic assault emerged, and it was good.  VERY good.  Sepultura was about as heavy as it got back in 1991, other than the then laboring in (mostly) obscurity, fledgling death, black and grind scenes...    Heavy, brutal, raw, primal, aggressive, antisocial, tribal, throbbing and pounding... nothing else in 1991 sounded anything like this.  And it's still extremely good today.  Most death metal has easily surpassed this disc in terms of sheer brutality, but Sepultura ain't far behind.  The throat on Max FAR eclipses most death grunters and croakers in brutal, as you could UNDERSTAND and FEAR him.  That's how it's done RIGHT.  Max had something intelligent and socially relevant to say (that didn't fully emerge until a bit later, on \\"Chaos A.D.\\") and he ROARED it!    The drumming and rhythm work has always been what made Sepultura for me... very tribal, and they GROOVE like mad, even when thrashing like lunatics.  Much more rhythmic and catchy than most death metal, and just as heavy.    HIGHLY recommended.
B000VI70WM|2.0|There are great albums that even at the first hearing you know they are mend  to be a classic. There are greater albums that grow on you and are also mend to be classics and ground breaking. And also we have albums like these Duran Duran album that you want so much to love and when you hear the album the first time it leaves you unimpressed. As I am a fan of Duran Duran I listened and listened this album and don't know why, as I listened to it more the less I liked it. At first I love one song and liked 3 other, then after repeated hearings I only like (not love) at most 2 songs. The blame is for Duran Duran decision to hire Timbaland and Timberlake. Why would I like to hear a mediocre clone of already mediocre music of Timbaland/Timberlake? I love when a group changes it style, like Duran Duran Notorious album but at that moment they still had what it takes to make a good change but this latest album is such a disaster and the fact that proves it is that the album didn't have the impact the band intended not even on the people who loves that kind of Timbaland/Timberlake album.

B000GIXEIG|5.0|This movie follows the tale of the Geatland hero Beowulf and his fight against the troll Grendel. This movie was shot very well and the screen writer not only used the epic poem but the history of the era to make this movie. If you're looking for a movie that has a good story search no further; if you are looking for a movie without a complex plot but with pretty pictures go watch The Lord of the Rings or the 2007 animated version of Beowulf...
B000002H6C|4.0|First bought this one in 1988 at 13 years old.  As a fledgling guitarist, artist and social malcontent, it was HUGE for me.  It opened up doors that Poison and Motley Crue would never have led me toward, and for that I will always have a nostalgic love for this disc.    Yeah, the production is thick and sludgy.  Jason Newstead's bass might as well have not even been recorded, for all you hear of him.  Lars learned how to keep time and play drums finally, and Kirk is at his most frantic and tasteful best on this one... before he succumbed to perpetual wah pedal abuse.      Yeah, the songs are long.  Very long.  But, they're mostly worth it.  The shorter bursts on this album ARE far more satisfying, overall (\\"Blackened\\" and \\"Shortest Straw\\" in particular), but the epic \\"One\\"... well, who HASN'T heard it yet?    Emotionally, this album is by far the bleakest and most tortured of their career, VERY aggressive and black.  Their crowning moment, before careening into hard rock territory on the \\"Black\\" album.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I've been an REM fan for a long time. \\"Green\\" came out during my freshman year of high school and I latched onto that album in that special way only a young kid just getting into music can. I played that tape (remember those?) in my Walkman damn near every day and I memorized every line and every riff. Things got even better as I started digging into their 80s back catalog, and I really enjoyed the next couple of albums they put out. Then they started to... well ... they became mediocre. Everything after \\"Automatic for the People\\" sounded like either a failed experiment or a re-tread of something they had already done better. \\"Accelerate\\" finally gets them back on track. No, it's not as good as \\"Life's Rich Pageant,\\" but it's the best thing they've done in years and the first REM album since 1992 that I've really been able to get into. If you're one of the many people who (understandably) wrote them off years ago, it may be time to give them one more shot.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have seen Jillian on the show and always felt that she was one of the strongest trainers and have always wanted to give this a try.    Having gone through personal one on one training sessions at high-end gyms, all the group classes you can think of and also, programs  such as The Firm, please believe me when I tell you that this 20 minute workout is NO JOKE!      I know that I will definitely feel and see the results of this workout in a short amount of time.      Jillian presents a style that I particularly enjoy...no BS, straight up   and uncomplicated (no silly salsa/mambo cardio party moves like the Firm which I will be returning tomorrow)!

B00004Z4SD|5.0|this film is for those who enjoy having time slowed down to a crawl.if you're hyper-active or simply have been intergrated into the Americanized form of cut-a-second entertainment,you will die of boredom if you watch this.story,acting,directing,score,and location are all top-notch;if you allow yourself to get lost in your lack of ritalin or fail to notice the beauty of subtle,small-town life you'll fall asleep or turn it off because \\"nothing's happening\\"(the neo-Americanized aspects of small-towns was left out so as not to interfere with the chilled atmosphere).something's happening in this seemingly-small film,and it's big:this is lynch's statement about our continued disconnection with ourselves/environment due to industrialization.it's also his way of telling us that 1950's lifestyles are still alive and are not extinct as they are in the cities.very cool.
6303269842|5.0|Charming and hazardous card player Bret Maverick makes his way to a big poker championship, with a half million dollar prize up for grabs. And he has competition from the clunning Annabelle Brandsford, who he meets on the way there. Another contender is the sheriff Zane Coburn, frown-faced gun-slinger Angel and others. The catch is that before the championship, everyone has to put up 25 thousand dollars.
0765342294|5.0|After a devastating war with an alien race referred to as buggers, mankind is in search of brilliant commanders to lead the next assault; Ender is one gifted six-year-old boy selected for Battle School, where he is trained to be mankind's only hope in war. Battle School is an immersive environment where Ender pitted alongside and against his peers in order to develop leadership skills, and is instructed to play a number of games in order to learn how to think and to fight. In the Battle Room, he learns to fight in a zero-g atmosphere and then conducts battles against teams of fellow students. An fast-learning and capable fighter, Ender is advanced through his courses at an incredible speed, and the rules of the Battle Room begin to break down as he is pushed, time and time again, to fight better against increasingly bad odds, all in mankind's desperate hope to find a commander before it is too late. The novel is incredibly intelligent, both in concept and in plot: the science-fiction elements, both in alien race creation and inventions such as Ender's games, are contentiously created with a rational explanation and useful purpose. The young children that make up the bulk of the characters are exceptionally gifted, and so sometimes read too much like grown adults--but Ender's development in particular takes into account his young age. The end of the novel comes as little surprise, but that failing is an unavoidable consequence of the way the plot is scripted. This is a famous, innovative, accessible text, and I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.<br /><br />I prefer some science in my science-fiction--at statement which seems self-evident, but too often falls short in books in the genre that have inadequate or flawed scientific reasonings. Ender's Game, however, contains science and integrates it seamlessly into the fiction of the novel as a whole. The alien race of the buggers is increasingly investigated and developed through the course of the book, and what Card reveals about them is original and logical. The games that Ender plays, and the course of Battle School itself, are equally well thought out and explained, without tedious detailed scientific sections but with complete integration into the course of the novel. The skillful intermesh of science and fiction is one of the things that makes the novel so successful, and I really appreciated it as a fan of the sci-fi genre.<br /><br />The choice to make the main character and many of the secondary character children is an unusual one, and a mixed blessing. The children are gifted--exceptionally intelligent, and as a result, well-spoken, thoughtful, and often mature. As a result, they sometimes read as adults, which both undercuts their brilliance and makes them seem unrealistic as characters. It also makes the real adults seem stiff and fake in comparison; their dialog in particular is clunky and exaggerated to the point of melodramatic. Card does tackle some of these problems head on: he stages interactions between the gifted Ender and his normal, largely unintelligent peers, drawing attention to the differences between gifted and nongifted children, and has Ender's siblings discuss some of the difficulties that gifted children face when interacting with patronizing adults. On the whole, the age of the characters can throw the reader off and make the text seem unrealistic at points, but Card handles the difficulty as best he can, in particular in regards to Ender's character, who's progression, on the whole, is that of a brillaint but still immature gifted child.<br /><br />Ender's Game is a classic text of the sci-fi genre, and when reading it it's easy to see why. The science is existent and well-developed, but seamlessly integrated into the course of the story. The text is well-paced and accessible--almost too accessible and, by the end, too completely explained and laid out--but as a result, the core philosophical issues of the book are openly and honestly presented.I found myself thinking about this book for days after I had finished reading it, and went on to pick up the sequel. To me, that's a sign of a good novel--one that captures the reader during the reading of the text, and continues to provoke his thought after the final pages. I highly recommend the book, even with its faults, and I was happy to have the chance to read it.about this book for days after I had finished reading it, and went on to pick up the sequel.

0385340567|2.0|I have also loved this series and eagerly bought this right when it came out.  I can live with the politics (probably cuz I agree) but the book was kinda boring.  I also found the ending a little much.  I know diehards are going to want to read it, but i would say wait for paperback as this certainly isn't worth 20 or more bucks.    Next book I am going to read the reviews before I buy!!

B001AD3NIM|5.0|If you like to see the transformation of an artist, this CD will certainly be for you.  Alanis has grown musically to include other forms of expression, not just the \\"Angry Rocker Chick\\".  Even though people want to confine her to this genre of music, it is undeniable she is still true to herself, becoming more self aware with greater depth.  This CD is worth the listen, and will ultimately grow on you.  All the tracks are impressive, most notably \\"Limbo No More\\" which has not gotten a lot of reviews, but is my favorite.  This is on the deluxe version of the CD and was worth the cost.  Even the light \\"On the Tequila\\" has appeal and reflects on a not too serious Alanis.  BRAVO to a wonderful piece of art.
0060558121|4.0|Shadow is a convict, surviving the final weeks of his sentence and looking forward to a return to his life and to his marriage, when he is told of his wife's death and is released early to attend her funeral. On the flight home, he meets a man named Mr. Wednesday that seems to know more about Shadow than he has any right to do. He offers Shadow a job: to protect Wednesday and work as his right hand man in the big storm that is brewing. When he accept the offer, Shadow is swept into a slice of American life that he never knew existed: a battle between the old gods, brought to America by early immigrants and now dying of neglect, and the new gods of TV, strip malls, and modern America that have been born on American soil and are steadily gaining power. In the course of the novel, the characters journey from cities to roadside attractions to small town to Indian reserves, and Gaiman explores the power in both folk life in America. The novel is as enduringly off-kilter as the roadside attractions Shadow visits, with Gaiman's edge of magic and darkness that give it gravity and purpose. The resolution to the battle between the American gods is too brief, and I don't find the premise quite as interesting as some of his other novels, but the book is an engrossing read, well written, and complex, carrying through a number of characters and concepts, as I expect from this author. I do recommend it.<br /><br />Ever since by surprisingly good experience with Neverwhere, I've been itching to read the rest of Gaiman's novels. American Gods was the first novel in that quest. Despite the fact that Gaiman writes in no particular genre, his work is always distinctly and recognizably his own. They investigate the supernatural within the normal, often in the form of a magical social structure that runs underneath to its mundane equivalent. In this vein, American Gods explores the supernatural world of the gods that populate American soil, arising from human inhabitants, including natives, immigrants, and citizens, but exist largely underneath daily life: in shadows, hidden out of the way, and/or wearing masks to allow them to exist undetected. Because the characters are by their nature explorations into the depths, the novel has an innate level of complexity. However, because the complexity is innate, the author isn't pushed to make the text deeper or to investigate more. As a result, the ideas are brilliant and reading the book is like discovering a new, hidden culture that exists below and adds depth to one's own, but the content of the novel lacks independent complexity, both in concept and in character. The text is interesting, unique, and original, but it lacks the total depth that I look for in what I would deem \\"literature\\". In other words: it's a good book, not a great one. (I also didn't enjoy the hidden world in American Gods as much as the hidden worlds of London Below and Fairie from Gaiman's other books, but I consider my own dislike for Americana a matter of personal taste.)<br /><br />For all of that, the plot of this novel is pleasantly complex, working at both a personal, local, and cosmic level in a few interconnected narratives. The plot lines fit together almost seamlessly and the stoyline is generally linear, so the narration isn't as complex (or as difficult) as the first few chapters sometimes make it seem. The resolutions come a bit quickly, especially in the cosmic plot (the war between the new and old gods), and the hasty conclusion, as well as the nature of the conclusion, makes the plot up until that point fall flat--not completely, but to the point where it is noticeable. It isn't a huge issue and doesn't destroy that plotline. Nonetheless, it was my biggest disappointment in the book because on the whole the other aspects--from characterization to the other plotlines--are strong. The number of concurrent stories keeps the book running at a good pace and the reader consistently interested as well as making for a textthat takes more into account and so achieves a greater depth.<br /><br />The otherworldy aspects of the book are, as always in Gaiman, walk the line between fanciful and disturbing, and are all the more interesting as a result. The darker, more dangerous, sometimes sinister cast to the unnatural elements gives the book gravity and keeps it out of the realm of light, dismissible fantasy. Shadow as protagonist, however, sometimes detracts from the supernatural aspects: he accepts the strange occurrences too readily (a necessary aspect for the smooth progression of the plot, if somewhat unrealistic) and so, through his role as emissary between novel and reader, makes them seem too ordinary to the reader as well. On the whole, I recommend this book, both for Gaiman's unique otherworldy writing and for the unique and intelligent plot, but it didn't sweep me away in the way that some of the author's other work has. It's a good read, but not great literature, nor my favorite Gaiman novel.into account and so achieves a greater depth.

1430300612|5.0|Dr. Taylor's story is a most important and remarkable one in that it provides a very lucid account of a damaged brain's awareness of itself and her struggle to regain an autonomous and integrated life after having a significant hemmorrhagic stroke in the left MCA. I am a neurologist in training and a neuroscientist and I have made Dr. Taylor's story known to family and patients afflicted with catastrohic neurological events with great benefit to them and the process of recovery. This book (her story) ranks with the great classics of neurological literature such as Sacks' \\"Awakenings\\" and Luria's \\"Man With a Shattered Brain\\" and should not be dismissed by the posse of those uninformed who are phlegmatic about the process of neurorehabilitation.And yes,spirituality is clearly a driving force in the human persona (brain) [see V.R. Ramachandrin's \\"Phantoms in the Brain\\".     I applaud Dr. Taylor for her will to live without compromise. Her story is gripping even from the first moments....How did she ever have the consciousness to summon help dialing a phone when [during the CVA] she became functionally blind and aphasic.???   Neurology is a field still tainted with a type of Victorian nihilism and despair.In contrast to the prototypic isolated stereotype of a brain-injured patient, Dr Taylor's monograph beckons us to see what other \\"inspired recovery\\" is possible following neurological injury.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Just a great movie and good quality on the blu-ray format. this ia my favorite bluray purchase to date. The oceans and forrest just burst off the screen.
B00005JLO2|5.0|For many years I hung back from watching this movie due to the poor reviews it received at the release time. Well when I finally caught it on TV, I realized what a gem I had missed, will now purchase it for my own DVD collection. What a loss of an actor Heath Ledger was, firmly believe he would have gone on to be viewed as one of our finest actors of this generation. All the british actors were terrific in their respective roles,only slight miscast would have been Kate Hudson, so many other young british actresses would have been more believeable in the part.Keira Knightley comes to mind.
B00003CXA6|3.0|This movie is based on the book \\"The Killer Angels\\" by Michael Shaara [[ASIN:0345348109 The Killer Angels]]which is an excellent read, especially if you enjoy the history of this war. The book is based largely on the writings and letters of Longstreet. The book covers in depth the feelings and ideas of the men who planned and fought the battle, something I felt the movie failed to do. When reading the book I found myself deeply saddened by the losses the confederates had because you got to see inside the men's minds and know what they were thinking and feeling and that they were extremely brave and gallant men, this does not happen in the movie. In the movie the fault of the southern disaster lies fully with Lee but when I read the book I had to place some of the blame on Longstreet and other southern generals for not standing up to Lee more forcefully to press their point to fight elsewhere where they would hold the high ground. Something they had done very successfully up until now. In the book Lee thinks that the second day of battle was almost a success while Longstreet does not see it this way. Longstreet, however, does not press this point with Lee. In the book Longstreet goes through every step of the last day of battle in his mind. He knows his men will be cut to pieces but also knows that it is useless to argue with Lee, because Lee will not change his mind. He lets himself and his men down and he knows it. After giving the order to attack on the last day of this battle Longstreet walks off alone and leans against a fence with his head down while tears run down his face as the battle rages around him, he knows what the results of the battle will be and what he has done. You don't get this kind of feeling in the movie. In the movie you get to see the battle but it fails to make you realize what the men were about and the vast amount of men that were killed and wounded in this one battle. Over 50,000 men killed.    Martin Sheen was horrible as Lee, very pooracting on his part as far as I am concerned. He managed to make Lee look almost lifeless and almost retarded. Picket never seemed to lead the infamous charge that bears his name and that virtually destroyed his division. Most of the other main parts, those of Longstreet, Pickett and Chamberlain were well acted which saved the movie from being a total flop.    Read the book and you will get a better feeling of what this battle, and the men who fought it, were all about.
B000002B7Y|5.0|I'm not a huge Sabbath fan. Nor more than a casual Ozzy fan, so the fact that I've awarded this thing one of my rare five starts and played it to death over the years is a testament to just how good this thing is.<br /><br />Starting off with Miracle Man, a humourous and perenially timely attack on sanctimonious preachers, this album promises metal on metal. And it delivers with Ozzy in scintillating form. The man at his most attacking in the aforementioned Miracle Man, at his most broken and plaintive in Fire In The Sky, at his most vicious and morally bankrupt in Devils Daughter and Tattooed Dancer and at his most autobiographical in Demon Alcohol.<br /><br />And the focus of the whole thing is kind of intimidating. Sure, during the late 90's and the 00's we got used to the feeling that bands had hugely focussed on the minutiae of their albums but in the 80's that wasn't always the case and for a chemical commando like Ozzy you couldn't take it for granted that there would be such focus. But the whole organisation seems 100% behind this disc from the star production team of Keith Olsen and Roy Thomas Baker through to the band of expert veterans. Bob Daisley and Randy Castillo are certainly 'name' guys to have as your engine room and Zakk Wylde is at his manic best, basically forging his own legend with riffs that would withstand a nuclear blast and solos so biting they'd carve through battleship armour.<br /><br />But hey, don't take my word for it - it's cheap enough so add it to your cart and crak it in the comfort of your own home!
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Fans of Loreena McKennitt will be pleased with this long-awaited album. It has a lot of similarities to her earlier work, but is different enough that I didn't feel like it was a rehash. You'll especially like this if you enjoyed the increasing Middle Eastern influences in McKennitt's last few albums. _An Ancient Muse_ is where the scale tips, more Middle Eastern than Celtic. You might guess that just by the (gorgeous) cover, though!     What I noticed most, besides the sheer beauty of the music, is that the recent years of war have weighed heavily on McKennitt. Several of the songs on _An Ancient Muse_ deal with the theme of war, and the tragedy thereof. \\"Caravanserai\\" and \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky\\" mention war explicitly, mourning the \\"years of war,\\" the \\"sword and gun and hatred.\\" \\"Penelope's Song\\" is less blatant, but as it's about the Greek heroine who waited for her husband to come home from Troy, it fits.     Even when McKennitt returns to the tragic love ballad, with \\"The English Ladye and the Knight,\\" there's something in the \\"feel\\" of the song that seems to focus more on \\"love one another\\" than on these two lovers in particular. I don't think it's an accident that McKennitt chose a ballad that features a Crusades death and has the refrain \\"for Love shall still be lord of all.\\"    This is a beautiful album and I definitely recommend it. It has her usual haunting vocals and entrancing melodies, and seems to possess a subtle but inescapable moral: war is hell, and love is the only hope.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|Based on the much loved Noel Streatfield novel, this is a genuine 'for all the family' film, and most definitely appealing to young girls (and their moms).    A brilliant, fun and uplifting story, intelligent script, with terrific acting all round, gorgeous camera work, lovely sets costumes and music...  what more could anyone ask for !
B0014XCMVM|5.0|To those who are still fixated on Alanis being shrill whiney and angry, listen to \\"Not As We\\" or \\"Incomplete\\" - gorgeous ballads with touching music and lyrics.    To those who wish Alanis was angry again, listen to \\"Straitjacket\\" and come to realize she's just as angry now as she was in 1995 - and she'll always be. She'll also always be as equally happy as she ever was. Alanis has taught me to embrace all parts of myself, and anger is part of that. And I can only pray people either stop calling her angry, or understand that anger is only a portion of her personality, as it is all of ours. We are all one.    To those of you who think her sound has gotten boring, take a listen to songs like \\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\", \\"Moratorium\\", \\"Versions of Violence\\" and explore new sonic sound-scapes produced by electronic guru Guy Sigsworth.    To those of you who love classic Alanis, listen to \\"Torch\\", \\"In Praise of The Vulnderable Man\\" and \\"Tapes\\" - meaningful lyrics set against to simple but heartfelt music. From depressive piano to happy go lucky orchestration to haunting vocal harmonic chants.    To those of you who like a little bit of everything and want to hear Alanis tell her life story in 4 and a half minutes, listen to \\"Citizen of The Planet\\" - a blazing hot mixture of organic middle eastern percussion,  digital sound effects, mind blowing orchestration and Ozzfest-worthy guitar work.    To those of you who want to reflect on life and learn how what we do inside our hearts reflects the bigger picture out there in the real world, and vice versa, take a listen to the lead single, \\"Underneath\\" and also watch the music video for an excellent portrayal of \\"the micro is the macro\\" and \\"the personal is the global\\".    To those who want to listen to what is quite possibly Alanis Morissette's best work to date, and to hear what true art and music sound like together, infused by heart and the human condition, take a listen to the whole album, \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\". Ifyou are willing to open your heart and learn to explore your deepest withins, you won't regret it.    5/5 *****    - Anthony Lucio

Sorry, but I like jazz that makes me wanna stomp my feet and snap my fingers and  make me get up and dance, not put me to sleep. The lyrics are so drawn out and her voice sounds strained. I wish she would do a tribute to Frank Sinatra,the capitol years. I would love to hear her rendition of Witchcraft.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I, like many others learned about Firefly after it was canceled. I have yet to see every episode since I'm intentionally dragging my feet. The movie was one of the best I've seen in 25 years. Well written, great characters and super acting. Entertaining, fun, cool, thought-provoking. What else could you ask for in a series.    Having been around a while, I can't help but compare this with the original Star Trek series, since Firefly is much, much better than you'd expect a TV series to be and consequently, a bit slow to catch on nationwide. The difference is that Firefly is a much higher quality production. Each episode was very well written, the plots were entertaining and thought provoking. Acting was spot-on and makes you a fan of the characters.    What a loss I've felt having just become a fan and learned the series is no more. There is the series on DVD and the movie which I still watch with family on a regular basis.    Check out the re-runs before you buy the series to see if you like it. I'll bet you become a fan like I did!
B00005YU1O|3.0|My first thought was that it looked a bit like a university student's final project, and I don't mean that in a bad way.<br /><br />I remember hearing a little of the buzz when this was new.  Only a little, since I was living in Asia at the time.  But live action was converted to animation through some process.  That sounds like a gimmick, but in fact it's an ideal process for this particular story.<br /><br />I don't know what I was expecting when we popped this into the player, since my lovely wife ordered it.  But what I got was a lot of deep philosophical discussion of the sort that I thought about often as a student, and still do from time to time.  Good brain food here, and a fine example that animation can do more than bring toys and superheroes to life.<br /><br />So on the whole, I'm impressed.  Later, I plan to enjoy the extra features and learn more about just how this was made.  It's a very cool way to use technology, and at its heart it's still a story about people, and one that could've worked just as well without the animation process.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|this movie was such a let down! but maybe i had such high expectations due to the book being so amazing. the movie moved way too fast and left out the best parts of the book. i know it couldn't be exactly like the book, but my gosh. the movie was supposed to be more about mary than anne but was vise versa. the thing that pisses me off the most is that the movie left out mary and william strafford's whole love story! such a shame. i gave it 2 stars bc the senery was pretty, and i love this time period. other than that it was a dissapointment.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|Whenever a movie or book is universally acclaimed, there are two possibilities: either it is the greatest thing since The Iliad or it appeals to a particular interest strongly felt by a number of people.  This movie is not The Iliad.      Most BBC miniseries period dramas have a number of different things going on and offer a number of appeals.  They should, with four hours to play around with.  North & South, by contrast, is a one-note movie.  Even though it begins with a sympathetic view of the plight of the heroine dragged away from the beautiful countryside to the smoke and dirt of the Midlands, this occupies only a few minutes.  For the next two hours, the movie drums away at the plight of the workers.      It does TELL the management side in brief quick dialogue that most people will not understand if they are not in business themselves.  The labor side, however, is SHOWN in grueling detail.  About 1% of screen time is devoted to stating management's side, about 60% to showing labor's side.  If management's side had been dramatized (cheap American cotton driving down profits, threatening the survival of the English cotton industry, etc.), there would have been conflicting feelings on the part of the viewer and real drama.  As it is, we \\"know\\" that management is the bad guy.      Much of the time, the leading lady is wandering around the dirty streets (which gives the camera more time to show the miserable living conditions of the workers) or lamenting with her family.      In the second half, characters drop like flies one after the other.  \\"That takes care of the deaths,\\" the screenwriter seems to be saying, \\"Now, let's get these two together somehow.\\"  Deus comes riding out of the machina and does the job.      Bottom line: recommended for Laborites, Leftists, and Marxists.      Not recommended for anybody else.

B0015519VS|2.0|1. of only ordinary or moderate quality; neither good nor bad; barely adequate.   Shall I say more? I am an avid Usher fan, and I was so pumped when I saw that he was FINALLY releasing a cd (I mean 4 years is an awful long time). I honestly don't think artists should wait that long to release a cd for the obvious reason....Here I Stand just wasn't up to par:( So what are we supposed to do? Wait another 4 years and hope for the best? I expected so much more from Usher! His songs seemed like they were for an older more mature crowd, when all I really wanted to do was hear sexy, put your cd on repeat, dance your a** off music. Which is what he seemed to be so good at before. I was even more upset because he released Love in this Club as his single to reel people in. Nothing about his cd made me want to make love anywhere, let alone in the club for that matter. I don't know, maybe I'm just being hard on him but, I listened to the cd several times, trying to find at least one other song (besides LITC) that I could covet and play repeatedly, or that would at least spice this review up a bit....but to no avail. Here I Stand was just not what it could have been......great:(

080701429X|5.0|Viktor Frankl has written an powerfull book about his years as a prisoner inside a nazi concentration camp. He worked as a psychologist and wrote on the subject of lifes meaning. The book is a powerfull testament to the will of humans to survive in dire circumstances. The book begins with the train full of prisoners rolling into the camp. At once they are stripped of all their belongings. Beginning with their clothes, and then glasses, jewlery and all other personal belongings. This is the first step in the process of dehumanizing them. So the struggle for these prisoners he writes is very much about struggling to keep the idea of yourself as a subject alive. To keep alive ones feeling of self worth was essential for survival. it was also important he writes to have the feeling that one had a spiritual center where one could retain some freedom even though one was imprisoned. Otherwise he or she will regress to feeling very small and in the end becoming a formless member of the herd, like an animal. Once this was achieved, when the personality and subjectivity had been broken and erased the person could be willed to do almost anything. The spirit only survives he writes, as long as the idea of hope does. That is why in the suffering one has to parodoxically have to try to find some meaning. If one dosent then the organism is in great danger of being annihilated. Only those who where able to somehow retain a sense of hope, that maybe somewhere someone was waiting for them, that someone who loved them was thinking about them, that god,even though it seemed impossible, saw their suffering.

B00158K0S8|1.0|Fox has turned Patton into a video game by filtering out all grain and fine detail from the picture. Patton never looked like this till this HD transfer. It's completely unauthentic and does not show the film as intended and made by the film makers. Very bad revisionist HD mastering. Thumbs down, way down. I want to see Patton the film, not Patton the waxy, ultrasmooth video game.

B0011NVC9I|1.0|A little bit of cartoon violence, a little bit of cartoon sex, a dash of religious bigotry, but no connection at all to the epic poem (other than the title) on which it is supposedly based.  If the people who made the movie ever read the poem, they obviously did not understand it.  The viewer's time would be better served in reading the text and an insightful piece of criticism, such as Tolkien's \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and The Critics.\\"
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I knew a hand-held camera was used for this film, but I still was not prepared for the jerky, off-center camera work. Getting old. For me, it was impossible to get to know or care about those involved. The party was   confusion; with too much noise to understand most of the dialogue. Once the creature(s) showed up, though, it did get better.      The mobilization of Army/Airforce units, seemed very quick but the actual combats scenes seemed authentic. (Maybe the chaos started a lot sooner than we know). The creature was just strange enough, to be unique. It seemed as frightened as the people.(No idea where it came from). As you can tell, I didn't really care what happened to people. And I was hoping for the crusading scientist, to give us some Creature Biology lessons.  Can't have everything!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Excellent production. Enjoyed it immensely. Having just visited Bath England ,the Roman Bath, Pump Room and stayed at the Abbey Green it was wonderful to see them portrayed in the film. Having met Ciaran Hinds prior to going to Bath and seeing the places were he walked made it more special to us.
B0017I1FNK|2.0|I still enjoy Emmylou's earlier albums from the 70's and 80's, even some from the 90's, but lately she's just boring, boring, boring. This could be a collection of songs dumped from her latest albums if it wasn't for the fact that they have all been as flat and boring as this one. It takes more than a used-to-be-a-great-voice to make a good album. You can find nothing of those things on this one. Sorry!

B000W4KT6E|4.0|I've never been a big fan of the musical \\"Hairspray,\\" but this is a very good film adaptation. The story revolves around Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a chubby teenage girl who shocks everyone by landing a coveted role on \\"The Corny Collins Show,\\" a television dance program. The plot itself is kind of hokey and there are only a few decent songs in the show, but the film is worth checking out for its star-studded cast, which includes a fantastic performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as a vindictive TV station manager, and Christopher Walken and John Travolta as Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad, respectively. (Their romantic tango is hilarious!) All in all, this is an uplifting, energetic little movie that was a lot of fun to watch.
B000YAA68C|2.0|Rarely (like, almost never) has a film come along with such a gulf between its critical reviews (ie, professionally-considered notions of 'quality') and its popular reception.  The professional film critics universally say this stinks worse than a boiled cabbage and corned beef dinner left in the sun.  Yet the reviews I received from enthusiastic friends were the polar opposite.  They laughed, they cried, they hadn't seen such a touching and memorable movie for years, they were definitely going to buy this for their own.  Letting friendship win out over criticism I rented it.  Sadly, I have to side with the critics, whose judgement about the many flaws in this film is spot-on.  Not since \\"Love, Actually\\"  has there been such a talented cast of A-list actors put to such superficial, sitcommy use.  This often plays like an extended episode of \\"Friends Go to Ireland\\" and would have done even without the presence of Lisa Kudrow as one of Swank's neglected BFFs. Though there are many pretty views of Ireland and New York respectively, they are as glossy, flat and uninhabited as a postcard.  Hillary Swank is a gifted actress in tough roles, but she decidedly lacks softer qualities of vulnerablity or self-parody, both of which are pretty much obligatory for romantic dramedy heroines.  She tries very, very hard, though and is to be given credit for trying.  She also displays a very passable voice doing Judy Garland and a scene of her doing karaoke shows something of a flair for physical comedy.  The script is unsure whether to lean more heavily toward rom-com fluffiness ala \\"13 Going on 30\\" or pathos and winds up being an uncomfortable mish-mash of neither.  This film suffers from the same problem that hobbles all From-Beyond-the-Grave love stories: it's impossible to plug the dead spouse into the movie in any way other than flashbacks or contrived sequences where the bereaved talks to a figment in an otherwise empty room.  Though the device of daily letters from beyond the grave could be effective, the fact that they come from a free-wheeling soul who was not known to put pen to paper while he was living is a tad problematic.  Surely footloose musician Gerry might have devised other methods to communicate with his wife . . .songs, perhaps.  The problem for the audience is that we get exactly one scene with Gerry before his abrupt departure, so it's hard to really know What Would Gerry Do?  Director LaGravanese attempts to answer this question with a series of flashbacks that go chronologically backwards, so that near the end of the movie, we have come to the very beginning of Gerry and Holly's relationship.  Unfortunately at this point, LaGravanese commits a Fatal Movie Faux Pas previously seen in \\"Laws of Attraction\\" by having his protaganists collide in an utterly fantastical Meet Cute on the Roadside in Ireland.  Since such Meet Cutes on the Irish Roadside must hardly ever happen to actual Irish people, what are the chances that every American woman in Ireland on a tourist visa would have a Meet Cute with the likes of Gerard Butler or Pierce Brosnan?  Alas, I had already lost my ability to suspend my disbelief in this film long before this Meet Cute happened.  After a fairly promising start, \\"P.S.\\" falls flatter than an Irish soda bread without the soda.  I give this movie two stars for the gorgeous views of Ireland and the equally gorgeous views of Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as well as some great soundtrack numbers.  Worth a rental for the legions of female Gerard Butler fans out there, though the male fans will want to skip this and rent \\"300\\" again instead.grave could be effective, the fact that they come from a free-wheeling soul who was not known to put pen to paper while he was living is a tad problematic.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|In a previous review, someone mentioned that Testament was left out of the thrash \\"big four\\" (Megadeth, Slayer, Metallica, and Anthrax) even though they've been around since the beginning of the genre.    \\"The Formation of Damnation\\" is a reminder of why the list should be a \\"big five.\\" They not only helped to write that musical blueprint, but are still fine-tuning it today.     Also, is there a more criminally underrated voice in metal than Chuck Billy? In an era where nearly every new thrash band has a singer that sounds like Cookie Monster, Chuck is a reminder that you can growl with personality and soul.     Finally, If you go to guitarworld.com, you can see a recent video interview with Alex Skolnick that is well worth the time for any Testament fan to watch. Great stories about Testament's early days in the Bay area scene, and how they all got back together for this record.

1401322336|5.0|I got this from my brother for my birthday (although at first he refused to get it because he hates when chefs \\"use their own name in the title of their cookbooks\\", but I'm so glad he caved.) I've started looking more for cookING books rather than cookbooks, to teach me different techniques around the kitchen and it's really a fun book just to sit down and look through. It includes great \\"how-tos\\" from picking out meat to differet kinds of chopping, it gives definitions and uses for different herbs and spices, and it does include a ton of very delicious looking recipes. I haven't tried any yet but soon! I can't wait.  If you're the least bit interested in cooking, I highly recommend this book.
0446402389|5.0|For fans of Soviet/Russian mystery fiction this is a real treat.  If you like Martin Cruz Smith (creator of the Arkady Renko series) then I highly recommend this book.  I have read a lot of books in this genre- Gorky Park is one of my all time favorite novels.  Also, while harder to find, Stuart Kaminsky's Russian detective fiction series is a real stand out.  Here, the author just nails it on multiple fronts-  what makes this book even more interesting is how the Stalin regime and the paranoia (justified as it was) it caused is juxtaposed against a murder mystery.  The tension is palpable on every page.  A great book and I hope this author keeps them coming.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|When they were publicizing the theatrical release of this film during a fluffy interview with Matt Lauer on \\"The Today Show\\", Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman came across as two attractive, sensible young women who admired each other to no end. Ironically, that bonding is exactly what works against the movie, specifically the lack of a sharp edge in their characters' intractable relationship which dilutes how far sibling rivalry can go in shaping fates and destroying lives. Granted there's a palpably pulpish tone to this fanciful 2008 historical fiction based on Phillipa Gregory's [[ASIN:1416560602 2002 novel]], but the royal intrigue in the House of Tudor is overwhelmed by melodramatic flourishes and transparent character development. First-time feature director Justin Chadwick (BBC's [[ASIN:B000CEXG0U Bleak House]]) has made a handsome film with an attractive trio of stars, but he places most of his focus on the soap opera elements of the book's adaptation by Peter Morgan, a specialist in merging fiction with truth ([[ASIN:B00005JPAO The Queen]], [[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland]]), and lays waste to what could have been a more fully rounded historical drama.<br /><br />The overstuffed story begins with a cursory portrayal of the Boleyn sisters, headstrong Anne and diffident Mary. Even though Mary is married to wealthy courtier William Carey, the sisters soon find themselves in a competition for the affections of King Henry VIII, thanks to the machinations of their weak-willed father Thomas and their Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Henry is initially drawn toward Mary's gentle nature, siring an illegitimate son as he is still married to the barren Catherine of Aragon. However, Mary's difficult pregnancy and mandatory bedrest opens an opportunity for Anne, who uses all her cunning wiles to land the King. At the expense of Mary's happiness, Anne succeeds but not before the creation of the Church of England and her own ascension to England's Queen. Meanwhile, Henry evolves from gregarious womanizer to haunted despot, and everyone already knows what becomes of Anne at the end. The film's perspective alternates between the sisters, thus reducing Henry to a convenient plot device. Thanks to the film's broad brush strokes, the challenge for the viewer is to monitor the imbalance between the sisters. For instance, Mary is rather bland in her virtue but her story is affecting, while Anne is comparatively intriguing in her blind ambition but her fate feels less than tragic.<br /><br />I still think Johansson is the more natural temptress onscreen, but she actually plays Mary and manages to elicit sympathy to her character with surprising ease. However, Portman gets the lion's share of meaty scenes and runs with them, especially a couple of effective face-offs with Henry. As expected, both are alluring in period costume even as their accents waver a bit. As Henry, Eric Bana seems to have been hired for his brooding persona and beefcake appeal, while the character's lightning-fast transitions make Henry an elliptical figure at best in Morgan's truncated script. Kristin Scott Thomas again brings her innate chilliness to the abbreviated role of Boleyn's mother, while there are mildly interesting turns by Jim Sturgess ([[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe]]) as devoted brother George, Mark Rylance as Thomas, and David Morrissey (Sharon Stone's befuddled paramour in the execrable [[ASIN:B000FS9UKI Basic Instinct 2]]) as the Duke of Norfolk. Spanish actress Ana Torrent brings conviction to her few scenes as Catherine of Aragon. Sandy Powell, no stranger to the period ([[ASIN:B00001U0E1 Shakespeare in Love]]), designed the exquisite costumes, while John Paul Kelly's sumptuous production design feels authentic. Kieran McGuigan's richly colorful cinematography is undermined by his recurring tendency to use a side-swipe effect to transition shots. Production details aside, the film remains stubbornly hollow at its core.<br /><br />Starting with Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras. Thumbnail sketches of the film's historical figures are provided in brief video snippets with insight provided by scholars and various members of the cast. Two featurettes are also included - a ten-minute short, \\"To Be a Lady\\", which discusses the severely limited role of women in the 16th century, a theme addressed pretty well in the film; and another ten-minute short, \\"Translating History to Screen\\", which prominently features Gregory and focuses on how a voluminous bodice-ripper of a book had to be pared down to a running time of 115 minutes. Separately, there are twelve scenes presented, mostly expanded versions of the ones that ended up in the film and none I would consider indispensable to the final cut. Rounding out the extras is a brief reel of a test used to calibrate the HD cameras used during the shoot, as well as eight previews of other films.ith Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras.

B000068TPN|5.0|Sam Eliot steals this movie. Mel Gibson does a fine job, but his character is supported by his Master Sergeant, a dour, laconic guy played to a T by Eliot. The best line in the movie: \\"Sir, Custer was a pussy -- you ain't one.\\" belongs to Eliot. There are lots of reasons to watch this movie -- I just felt other reviewers weren't giving Eliot his due.
B00125WAWS|5.0|I first heard about THE GREAT DEBATERS when my friend and I were browsing through the antique shops of Arcadia, LA.  The owner of one of those shops told me that several pieces of furniture out of her store had been purchased to use in the movie.  That was fascinating.  When you watch the movie, you'll have so much to see -- all the rich historical drama and good acting of a suspense-filled plot -- that you may not notice the authenticty of the set, including the furniture.  If you buy the DVD, you will have enough interesting things to watch again and again.<br /><br />It is sad to realize how things were in the 1930's in the part of the world where I live.  This movie portrays the horrible way black people were treated.  This story of Melvin B. Tolson, played by Denzel Washington, gives background information about the Civil Rights movement.  Tolson's 1935 debate club at Wiley College, Marshall, Texas, stunned the nation.  (I won't give the end of the plot away!)<br /><br />Langston Hughes, the famous poet who authored \\"A Dream Deferred\\", visited Wiley College and said,  \\"Melvin Tolson is the most famous Negro professor in the Southwest. Students all over that part of the world speak of him, revere him, remember him and love him.\\"  Tolson was active on many levels.  In real life he was an English and speech professor, labor organizer, modern poet, novelist, debate coach, drama coach, and football coach! His methods were radical.  At times while I watched the movie, I was anxious about some of his behavior as played by Denzel Washington.  It is amazing that this man was not lynched.<br /><br />Instead, the professor did just fine and eventually left Wiley College to teach in Oklahoma.  Wiley College, located in east Texas between Dallas and Shreveport, is doing fine too.  In fact, it continues to thrive and has one of th best teacher-student ratios in the nation.<br /><br />I digress.  Back to the movie,  I admired the writers and producers, along with Denzel Washington (the director) for having the courage to tell the truth.  The movie protrays painfully true pictures of both blacks and whites of the time. It shows the oppression of intelligent black people by uneducated white people. It also shows the conflicts within a young black man who struggled with issues related to moving into adulthood.  The pain he caused a young woman is played with sensitivity.<br /><br />To modern educators, the students may have seemed wooden in their debates. The professor rehearsed the students and taught them by rote.<br />In our time, we are so eager to make all our students independent thinkers that we do not achieve the discipline that made these debaters successful.<br /><br />THE GREAT DEBATERS is much more than a movie about social causes.

B000WGWQG8|1.0|This is an over-hyped series. It tells the personal stories of John and Abigail Adams very well and in considerable detail. However, overall the series does not live up the promotions as an action-packed, tension-filled drama of the birth of the nation and the first years of the Republic.<br /><br />A true virtue of the series is that it is not chocked full of vulgar language. So, it is possible for HBO to do work that is not excessively pandering to the lowest common denominator. Still the presentation lacks coherence from one segment to the other and from one episode to the other. It may be good personal history but it is not good entertainment.<br /><br />The central problem with this series is that it covers far too much time using far to little film for far too much personal detail. It is devoid of overall theme, flow and action. In fact, if you have seen the 30 second ad for the series on MSNBC, you have seen all the action in the entire series.<br /><br />The cinema, sets and costumes are worthy. The actors work well in their roles but the whole story line is disjointed and often creates hardly more than a series of moments of pregnant silence. I guess that makes it authentic in portraying the New England character, but that should not take ten hours or so to communicate. Besides, all we need is Thornton Wilder for that dark task.<br /><br />A careful psychological study of the Adam's family life could be forgiven if the big ideas of the times were more in play. We get a glimpse, but only a fleeting glimpse, of some of the most dramatic events of Western History. This is a screenplay for the head, but not for the spirit. It conveys the idea of a rather common man thrust into a series of rather uncommon roles. I assume this director is dramatically inspired by Stanley and Blanche, but not by Paine and Rousseau.<br /><br />Unless you hang on every word written about the private lives of the founding fathers, spend your time more wisely if you are looking for an overall sense of the American Revolution. You will not find the fire in the belly and the smoke in the air. You will get a rather gloomy feeling of an age dark with self doubt, but you will not be inspired by the visions of independence and rebellion.<br /><br />The depictions of the creation of the Declaration of Independence, for example, would have you believe that Thomas Jefferson was insecure and that the rest of the delegates had little to contribute. You are to believe the sagacious Franklin and the venerable Adams rescued the self-doubting Hamlet-like Jefferson from the pettiness and venality of all the others.<br /><br />As a glorification of John Adams and his personal prejudices the series works. Yet it does little justice to Hamilton and others, while failing as a depiction of the genius of the age and the flowering of the Enlightenment.<br /><br />The production sacrifices the whole story for the episodic details of the person of John Adams.

It was waste of precious time.<br /><br />PS: Will Smith is a great actor
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Like luminous pearls strung from Red Dirt Girl and Stumble Into Grace on a silver strand, Emmylou's latest is a breathtaking addition in its melancholy wonder. She always finds (or writes) the best songs for her singular style, and attracts top-notch artists with whom to work. Each song possesses its own gentle radiance, and though she tells stories about things I've never experienced, she also sings like she's lived in my skin before. I could listen again and again and again...and I will. Highly recommended.
159562015X|4.0|Upon reading numerous reviews about this book the one thing driven home to me over and over again is how narcissistic we all are.  It's all about me! That being said, Because of it's concise nature, I really enjoyed this book and contrary to many reviews I actually like owning the book.  It allows me to annotate those people who's strengths I need to be reminded of on a regular basis and I carry it with me from home to the office. Although many of my own strengths were not much of a surprise, I was surprised by a few and the action plans were helpful to focus.  But primarily, the value of this book is communicating with others that you think you know. We misread others all the time. Our interpretation of them is not often who they really are!  This book has really assisted me in bringing clarity to relationships at work and at home.  If you have never taken a similar assessment buy this one and enjoy.
0345438205|2.0|A weak ending to a great series. The sense of wonder was gone. Very little suspense and story. This is more Clarke's view of the future than it is a story about the future. Potentially interesting as an examination of Clarke's views on politics, but that's about it.
B000057NVH|1.0|I have never been prompted to write a review but this disc is so bad I felt that if I could warn anyone about this travesty then it is worth doing.  If, like me, you grew up listening to Tubular Bells on the original LP you will be shocked at the remastered version. (SACD Stereo layer)   They have taken a classic piece of music and completely destroyed everything good about it. The reproduction is so tinny it actually hurts my ears. There is no sound stage worth speaking of. The instruments sound like they are all synthesized where of course this was a wonder of true acoustic and electronic instruments played by a real human being. The end of side one with all the instruments being presented by Viv Stanshall sounds like an MP3 at 128.  The mix is so bad that I am actually hearing less than the original. Notes and whole phrases are missing.  The guitar riffs halfway through side one are some of the most powerful ever recorded, but on this SACD they are shrill and lifeless.  I actually had to play a couple of other discs to make sure my system was working OK.  BTW...I am listening to it on the latest mega buck Krell system.  Ouch this really hurts....and it's getting returned.  I'm giving it one star because I have to.  Terrible!

For fancy-pants writers who think King is a no-talent hack...well, he is published.  Are you?
B0009W5K0Y|1.0|This is hands down one of the worst albums I have ever listened to.  I've given it several chances, spaced out so I wasn't formulating any rash opinions.  The production on the album is very flawed since they could have certainly revved the album up a bit.  The guitar work sounds very pedestrian and generic.  If you've ever listened to albums not known for guitars (i.e. albums like Mos Def's The New Danger) you'll know what I mean.  All the same chords used ad nauseum.  Hayley Williams initially comes across as talented, but once you actually listen to a full song you realize she can only pull off a short burst of notes.  She has charisma, but there are plenty of singers out there that have charisma and that can actually sing well.  But the worst part of the album are the lyrics themselves. They are dreadful and sound like a cheap garageband.  If you are 15 you might like this. If you've developed some tastes stay away.
B00138KGCK|5.0|A great album to be sure. And everyone loves the same ole' favorites, Suzanne, Hey that's no way to say goodbye, etc, But . . . I wonder why so few seem to notice, One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong?    I'd like to think he had to veil the song with some light humorous coverings, just so he could relate and share his feelings. Otherwise the hopelessness and tragedy he is describing is too painful to re-live.   If you love deeply, then you also hurt deeply. Would I recommend it? No. It's something few can handle. And why there is such a casual and uncommitted attitude (about love) today. Would I do it again? I'd have no choice.  Listen to it again. Listen to the truth of how it feels to be SO passionately in love with someone that you'd do almost anything for.             Oh you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice,             Oh please let me come into the storm.  These lines are essential. Knowing the danger, he still begs to be accepted. Knowing that just seeing her without her clothes, could freeze him, like it did the eskimo, he still wants in.  And every other character displays similar conditions of helplessness. There are such perfect descriptions of her effect, and power, over each one.      Don't be misled by the whistling and cries at the end, they are simply the sound of insanity.   Doesn't this song touch a sensitive nerve on anyone else?
B000WCBPOG|4.0|I read through several reviews before deciding to order this CD.  While I agree that the bass lines on many of the tracks are distorted almost to the point of a burst speaker-I think that was deliberate decision of the producers.  The producers deliberately played with tempo, instrumentation and stripping away some of the expected elements that you automatically associate with these songs.  If you want to hear the classic Beatles tunes exactly as the Beatles would have done them, then buy the originals.  I do wish that they would have included \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road\\" but you can't have everything. If you are an active listener then you will probably like it.  If you just want to sing along with songs you know like a karaoke star--buy the originals.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  I liked it because I love music and it has a lot of music in it.  Freddie Highmore did a great job as Evan Taylor(August Rush).  This is a good family movie.  It is good for anyone who loves music!
044024238X|4.0|...you would understand the story line of this book.  It captures the life of a workaholic who only realizes she is one when her whole world comes crashing down on her. I don't think this has anything against driven career women but more on people becoming unaware that work consumes everything else in their lives.  And that sometimes, what we think we want is not really what we want or need.  It's not totally far-fetched.  I've read about doctor who became a musician, another professional (I don't remember what) becoming a baker.  I had fun reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light summer read.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|This album is pure gold, the riffs are catchy and heavy and add a touch of southern rock, and it is easy to get lost in the post-rock style melodies.  Vocals are fairly respectable and right on par with Mastodon (if not a tad better). Fans of mastodon would be wise to check them out, as they are similar but offer something new in the process.  With the Red Album they take their first step in living up to their potential and I am looking forward to an even better follow up.
0061537934|5.0|One of my friends mentioned taht there are a book that looked interesting while he was at starbucks. After he gave me a quick overview on what he though it was, I was hooked. I started readings it after work nad couldn't put it down. I love the story line and some of the questions that arise in the narrators point of view really sparked my interest.<br />A fast read for anyone with a weekend that they'd like to read away.
0060558121|3.0|I'm pretty divided on this book. On the one hand, I found it interesting enough to keep reading, but I also though it dragged in spots. All the main action really happens at the end; the plot really meanders up til then. It's a more interesting meander than most, but still a meander.<br /><br />Also, I found his representation of \\"American Gods\\" to be incomplete. How can you really talk about mythology or religion or the state of 'gods' in America without delving into Jesus? Yes, he gets a mention, but nothing in depth. I only say this because various versions of Christianity have had such an impact on American life, and still have all too powerful an impact on American politics. Talking about gods in America while side-stepping Jesus unfortunately seems all too much like a decision made in order not to offend. There's also very little mention (if at all) of Mohammed, Buddha, or the Yahweh of Judaism. So he appears to be pretending that there are no Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, or Jews in America, only worshipers of new technology and media. I can accept the idea of television and internet and cars being gods, but leaving out the other 'gods' worshipped by Americans seems very incomplete.<br /><br />I do always enjoy Gaiman's approach to fantasy however, as a thing just underneath the surface of modern life that you could see, if you only knew where to look. I just wish this book had a deeper statement.

First off the title track is actullay 7 song parts compiled into one 20 minute song. 2112 is a great song and is kind of hard too describe but you have too listen for yourself. 2112 the song is about the future and the album is mainly based off that.<br /><br />  The only song on here that has a chance of being sutibale for radio is, \\"The Passage To Bankok\\", all in all great album buy today
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" (2008), a historical costume drama/romance about the 16th century relationships of Anne and Mary, two sisters of the Boleyn family, and that notorious old Tudor bluebeard, King Henry VIII of England, arrived at these shores in spring.  It boasts a high-powered cast, and lovely location shooting.  It is based on the popular novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory,[[ASIN:B000W4FO1O Other Boleyn Girl]], with screenplay by the currently hot Peter Morgan, directed by Justin Chadwick.<br /><br />This period of English history is, of course, very essentially dramatic, therefore very popular, and often treated in literature, theater, and film.  The Cliffs Notes go: Henry is crazed with lust for Anne, who denies him; Queen Catherine (Aragon, of Spain), will not give him an excuse for an annulment or divorce; he therefore breaks with the Catholic religion, and anoints himself the head of the new Church of England, in order to be able to grant himself his intensely desired divorce to marry Anne.  But he rather quickly tires of Anne, and it's therefore \\"Off with her Head,\\" so that he can marry Jane Seymour, who will give him his fiercely desired male heir, while, unfortunately, dying in childbirth.  Jane will be followed by three more wives, with varying degrees of luck.  There was also, of course, many a mistress --including Anne's sister Mary --- can we now hear a chorus of \\"It's good to be King??\\"<br /><br />The excellent cast is headed by those two luscious young stars, Scarlett Johansson as Mary, Natalie Portman as Anne; both gorgeously gowned by Sandy Powell.  And these girls can act, though their English accents sometimes waver.  Eric Bana plays Henry Tudor.  Ana Torent holds the screen as Catherine of Spain, Henry's first wife.  Jim Sturgess makes his small part, as the tragic George Boleyn, heart-breaking.  Mark Rylance and David Morrissey are good as Sir Thomas Boleyn and Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, the girls' scheming father and uncle, willing to use their own flesh and blood for advancement, as they threw both sisters at Henry, playing them off against each other. Kristin Scott Thomas turns in a towering performance as Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, who sees her children used and destroyed in pursuit of the family's ambitions.<br /><br />Many have quibbled with the historical accuracy of this picture: among other things, it shows Mary as the younger sister, when she was the elder.  But I was a Renaissance History major, and studied this period, and the picture gets the general outlines right.  Human life was cheap, and that of women, be they ever so young, beautiful and blue-blooded, even cheaper.  The picture does not make it as clear as it could that the plot against Anne was orchestrated by Cromwell, her mortal enemy.  But it does show us that Anne's likely true love, Harry Percy, and her uncle the Duke of Norfolk, were forced by Henry to be on the jury that doomed her.<br /><br />It goes beyond the scope of this movie, but the Howards, a rich, powerful, avaricious and ambitious family -- still-- evidently thought they had plenty of spare beautiful young girls with which to tempt Henry.  Later, they were to throw yet another niece, the pathetic young Catherine Howard, at the horny old monster Henry had become, as his fifth wife.  That marriage didn't end well for her, either.<br /><br />\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is, of course, a chick flick, but it's lushly filmed, and completely engrossing, even to those who generally don't go for that genre. Boring, it ain't.their own flesh and blood for advancement, as they threw both sisters at Henry, playing them off against each other.

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|There is little that can up your enjoyment of a terrible film like seeing it on an airplane. Having sat unbored through the execrable Mad Money on the way out to Seattle, I was actually looking forward to seeing this on the way home, knowing it was coming by having of course perused my Hemispheres free in-fight magazine on the trip out. I also had a quite mild desire to see it when it was in theaters.<br /><br />Okay, so we begin with baby Darth Vader Hayden Christenson atop the pyramids, saying \\"Once I was a normal person, a chump, just like you.\\" That's what I like, a movie that insults its audience right off the bat. Turns out Hayden [his character is David] was only a chump until he was 15, when he presented high school sweetheart Millie with a snow globe. The local bully takes it and throws it out onto the frozen river, and when Hayden goes out to retrieve it, he falls in. It's looking all Omen II for him, when suddenly he finds himself in the local library, which is when I discovered that all of this is taking place in Ann Arbor, where I lived from the ages of 18-30. Hayden's mother abandoned the family at five, and his father is a jerk, so he runs away, by bus [when you can teleport in style?] to NYC, where he soon uses his abilities to rob a bank. When next we see him, he's in his 20s and living in a swank apartment in New York, where he uses his abilities to even do such small things as reach a DVD cover that is a foot out of reach. Amazingly, for as physically lazy as he apparently is, he's quite fit.<br /><br />In here we are also introduced to Samuel Jackson as Roland, who is a Paladin, a group of people who hunt and kill Jumpers [as the teleportees are known] because they are \\"religious zealots\\" who believe that \\"Only God should have that power.\\" Sound like a flimsy excuse for a villain? Just asking.<br /><br />For no specific reason, Hayden suddenly gets a jones to see his old high school sweetheart. I say move on with your life, Hayden, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, but he's been established as somewhat of softie, who stupidly leaves handwritten IOU's at the banks he steals from. Now, is he ever REALLY going to pay that money back? Anyway, he goes back to Ann Arbor and finds Millie working as a waitress. She has grown up to quite a hottie in the Avril Lavigne mold, all tight tanks and eye liner. Also there is the town bully, and they get in a fight before Hayden teleports him somewhere and satisfyingly freaks him way the hell out. Then he's back and offers Millie a spontaneous trip to Rome, where she's always wanted to go, and she says sure.<br /><br />So they go to Rome--by airplane! Poor Hayden. That must have been a pain. Millie knows Hayden is lying about where all his money comes from, but is okay with a don't ask, don't tell policy. So after a few days they end up at the Coliseum, which has been Millie's \\"Number One\\" sight to see for ever [since that first magical viewing of Gladiator, perhaps?]. However, despite it being her top priority, they have wasted a few days in Rome before getting around to it, and arrive precisely at closing time. Hayden uses his powers to get her in after hours, whereupon he happens upon another Jumper, who warns him about a coming Paladin attack, which arrives post haste. Hayden is all stupid and getting zapped [the Paladins use these super tazers which supposedly inhibits a Jumper's ability to jump], while the other Jumper is doing the only sensible thing, and appearing behind one of the Paladins long enough to bash them with a baseball bat. Anyway, Hayden gets arrested, and various authorities, of both real and shadowy supernatural government agencies, are on his tail.<br />Around this time my traveling companion, who had been watching the movie as well, leaned over to me and said \\"Does this movie make any sense at all?\\" To which I had to reply that no, it did not. It's just this arbitrary conceit with these arbitrary rules [never fully articulated], for the solepurpose of staging fights and chases that range across numerous locations. These fights and chases are, however, pretty darn cool, once you get past the whole this-is-the-stupidest-thing-ever-set-to-celluloid barrier, and if you have elected to enhance your viewing through one of the many forms of available mind-altering substances, now is when you really want to let that stuff fly, because here's where the movie becomes a bit of a pip in spite of itself.<br /><br />SPOILERS > > ><br />So turns out that Jackson and his Paladin cru are going to kill everyone Hayden cares about in order to get to him, which they demonstrate without harm to Hayden by killing his dad. Hayden has eight hours to kill Roland before Millie's plane back from Rome--alone--lands, which I thought was an okay excuse to give us a tight time frame, although the filmmakers blow it off almost immediately. Hayden suggests that he and Griffin, the other Jumper, team up, and after a while they do. Hayden goes to Millie's apartment, where Roland is in the process of sneaking into, and jumps with her to the jumper hideout. BUT! Roland has a special machine that \\"detects recently-opened wormholes,\\" and allows him to jump there, too! This leads to the first of a few of the cool fights that range throughout a bunch of locations around the world. Griffin also has the ability to jump with objects, so at one point Roland finds himself atop Mount Everest with a London double-decker bus suddenly bearing down on him from the sky. It's all amusingly cool, but you WILL have time to ask yourself why none of these idiotic jumpers don't simply buy a GUN, appear behind the Paladin, and clock them. I suppose somewhere on the DVD there's a bit about how despite the fights, public-threatening crashes, stabbing and electro-torture, they wanted to send a strong anti gun violence message.<br /><br />For a rather cool finish, Hayden, who appears to be enmeshed in Roland's super-snare, relocates Millie's entire apartment into a river, and then into the Ann Arbor public library. He leaves Roland in a cave on a sheer cliff face.<br /><br />There's a short coda, useful only in setting up a sequel [which I thought was ludicrous, until I read today that two sequels have been approved] in which we find out that Hayden's mother is a Paladin, and is going to come hunting for him at some point. Millie has fully adjusted to the jumper lifestyle and is just chillin' with her man. The end.<br />&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS END<br /><br />It's delightfully senseless, and doesn't even stick to the rules it establishes [when it makes the effort to establish rules, which isn't often], but all of this is trumped by the fact that those multi-location fights and chases are pretty cool. The kindest review I can give it is that if it was on cable [and I HAD cable] I would probably watch the last half again.ases that range across numerous locations.

0307346617|5.0|I would just like to say that I am a week out from finishing this book and I still cannot sleep!  The author did a wonderful job of creating a post-apocalyptic world, I particularly like the descriptions of the changes the military had to make to face the zombies, as did my husband who happens to be a military weapons instructor.  His descriptions are in depth and he created a good range of characters to give the full scale of the disaster.  Very well written!

B00139W3NE|2.0|I've heard the rhetoric against this movie and Mr. Pullman's books, and as a religious person myself I was a bit concerned.  But we acquired this movie with a bunch of others at a PTA fundraiser so we watched it with the kids.  And while I think I can see where Mr. Pullman is going - he is an outspoken atheist and I'm told his series of books end with the children killing \\"God\\" - it seemed very toned down in this movie.  At any rate, such an idea isn't really developed in the movie and my kids didn't pick up on any anti-religion agenda.<br /><br />As near as I could tell the story takes place in a parallel universe where people's souls appear as an animal companion (called a \\"daemon,\\" but pronounced \\"demon\\") which doesn't settle into a single form until the child becomes an adult.  A young orphan girl named Lyra lives at a university with her demon, Pan, which is usually in the form of a ferret.  She is given a Golden Compass, or alethiometer, which tells her truth, and she is a natural at using it.  There's also a government of sorts called the Magisterium, which we're told is trying to control everyone (and apparently kidnapping uncooperative children), and there's something about \\"Dust\\" which was a little vague - sort of a link between the parallel universes, I think.  There's a kingdom of polar bears, good witches, a bunch of pirates or gypsies called \\"Gyptians,\\" a wise cowboy who flies a blimp, and a bunch of evil Nazi or Communist-like bad guys.<br /><br />The CG animation is done well enough (not as good as the Narnia movies, although parts are rather stunning) and the acting is fine, but the movie is just plain stupid.  I'm guessing that in order to tone down anti-religious sentiments from the book they've left out so much of the plot as to render the movie practically impotent - either that or the book is stupid as well, but I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt.  I agree with the theme of encouraging children (and grownups) to think for themselves, but that doesn't make it worthwhile.  But all the gushing reviews comparing it to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and other fantasy movies are ridiculous.  The plot was dull, characters aren't developed, the polar bears were cartoonish, the obvious cliff-hanging setup for a sequel(s) was annoying, and in the end it just wasn't entertaining.  I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because one of my kids liked it, but the others were bored stiff. (EDIT: Since then the one child who initially liked it has watched it again and changed her mind).<br /><br />So, if you haven't seen it yet, forget about all the fearful cautions from the religious groups and the overenthusiastic giddiness of the anti-religious groups, and just skip it altogether.make it worthwhile.

B00133KFGW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie due to the fact I've worked with many foster care children in the past. The feelings this kid faces in the movie are faced by many children on a daily basis in our country: Why did they leave me?, Did my parents want me?, Will I ever find them?, If I move to a family or to another home will they find me if they look for me?... etc. Having a fantasy belief that their real parents will come back is one reason why many children resist adoption and try disrupting placements. What's sad is that the majority of the time that fantasy never comes true... and the kid is left alone and unloved.     As for Freddie Highmore.. I think that is his name... he did a great job!
B0013FFMOK|1.0|When you take the title of one of the most well known and influential in the horror writers world (Stephen King and others have all acknowledged Matheson on their novel covers), make a film and call it the exact same thing, what the viewing public rightly expects to see on the screen is a movie that if not completely following the storyline of the novel at least sticks to the basic plot. The only similarity pretty much is that the main character is named Robert Neville.  There's a few others such as he broadcasts for others to meet him at a peer if there is anyone else alive but 99% of this film has nothing to do with the masterpiece novel [[ASIN:1857988094 I Am Legend]].  Plus the 1% that is such as his apartment has reinforced shutter roller doors and other defences built in aren't relevant as we find out the vampires (and I'm just assuming they are vampires as that's what they were in the book but these things in the movie look more like something from The Mummy or Lord of the Rings, I guess we know why they didn't show them in the previews ie they were too embarrassed) don't even know where he lives and aren't as the main part of the book (which influenced many as subsequent living dead zombie film) attacking his home every night.<br /><br />Some changes from the book obviously don't matter such Robert no longer being a blue eyed blond haired guy (although this would have been a great challenge and opportunity to fully test Will Smith's acting abilities) but the whole reason why Robert Neville was a legend in the book not being so in the film is simply unforgivable.  I mean that is the title of the book, the whole realisation of why he's a legend in the novel is the whole point of the title.  This film's reason, is poor and just unforgivable.<br /><br />Great acting by the dog but it should have appeared much later in the film as it did in the novel which made way more sense and highlighted emotion of finding out your not the last living thing on the planet.<br /><br />Even if you are someone who doesn't care that the plot has no similarities to the original book you have to acknowledge the serious holes in the plot line.

For that matter how did the creepy woman and kid get onto the island of Manhattan, and what's with the religious propaganda - \\"God told me where to go.\\" Did the film makers get confused and start thinking they were doing a movie of Stephen King's [[ASIN:0451169530 The Stand]] for a while or something?

B0018SWA56|5.0|One word....fabulous!<br />You will need to read \\"Something Borrowed\\" in order to truly appreciate how wonderful this story is.  I highly recommend both books, but this one is just fantastic!!  ENJOY!
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This truly is one of the greatest movies ever, thought provoking, brilliant, and inspiring. Never has there been a movie that deserves so much credit. You will not be disappointed, I watch this movie in the when it first came to theaters, and then over and over again on DVD and still enjoy it to date. If you ever wanted to be inspired that the human spirit can do great things, just watch this movie and it will make you realize how amazing we can be no matter what the circumstances are!
B0010V4TZU|1.0|I got VW after Paste Magazine raved about them. Talk about overblown. I tried to give them chance, but I couldn't stop thinking that this is music young republicans will be listening at their 'hipster' parties in Minneapolis in September. Just plain awful.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I was reading all the bad reviews, and I have to say... I just don't think those who hated it got it.  This movie is innovative, even beyond \\"Blair Witch\\", because it wasn't exactly scripted.  The whole point of this movie is, basically, \\"what would you do in a disaster of this magnitude?\\"<br /><br />Most monster movies are scripted and acted, and while this falls in our comfort zone, it isn't realistic.  Cloverfield was realistic.<br /><br />Okay, not realistic in that a giant monster is attacking New York.  It's realistic in how it's shot, and how it's experienced.  We're not seeing it through the eyes of a filmmaker and crew.  We're seeing it through the eyes of the people who are experiencing it.  The best way I can describe it is, chances are, if this had actually happened, that is exactly what we'd be seeing on the news.  Remember amateur videos of 9/11?  That's the \\"technique\\" that was strived for, here.<br /><br />Some are calling it out for having Rob go after his girlfriend and his friends following.  First off, there are some people in this world who would go after someone to try and save them in a crisis.  I know, if something similar happened, and someone I really cared about was trapped, I'd go after them.  I did once, in a serious Tornado (F5).  Crossed paths with it many times.  But we both made it out just fine.  So it isn't unrealistic.  Plus, Rob's friends chose to go with him.  They didn't have to, and he even told them not to.  But you have to think about this.  Somehow, the story had to be told.  Rob and his friends going after Beth was a great way to set up telling the story.  Because, let's be realistic... the story-telling device of any movie or TV show ever made is never that great.  Look at the 80's TV Show \\"Murder, She Wrote.\\"  Some people don't understand how murder \\"follows\\" Jessica.  But if it didn't, then there wouldn't be a story for each episode, now would there?  It's exactly the same.  If Rob and his friends had just evacuated, then there wouldn't have been a story to tell from this point-of-view.een a story to tell from this point-of-view.
B000XVT7SW|3.0|Musically, a triumph.  Visually, that's another story!  Too many closeups, closeups of flowers, architectual building details,cactii,flowers.  I was hoping to see more action, the ending of Cavalleria was plain disappointing.  For a much more satisfying experience of this two operas get the Zefferelli  film with Domingo and Obraztsova and Bruson in PAGLIACCI and Domingo, Stratas and Pons in CAVALLERIA.  That's a great double bill.
068987751X|4.0|My 2-year old niece loves this book. I also work at a public library where I often do read aloud to toddlers and they all enjoy this book immensely. It's a good way to teach toddlers about different animals while keeping them engaged as well.
B001041JLE|4.0|What can I say, yet another great album. Everytime MJ enters the recording studio the music he makes is instant GOLD! What I like most about this album as a fan is that even though I wasnt around for the release of the original album I am able to purchase yet another piece of history. The original songs are great to hear remastered and the new remixes to the big hits are also great...nothing but positive notes for this album. I hope to hear more from this monumental artist in the future.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I already owned the first two seasons on DVD, but decided to purchase the complete set since it was such a great deal. The picture quality is dull, and lifeless. Much worse than the original series one I purchased some years ago. Don't be cheap, you get what you pay for, best to buy each season individually.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|As with all Jack Reacher novels this was a quick entertaining read.  It just takes the ability to temporarily suspend belief to really enjoy these novels.  It's not great literature but this book was a good read.  Given how quick the book was to read I wouldn't recommend buying the hardback version but the Kindle version is a great value.
B000W4HIX6|4.0|The movie itself still rocks. The Blu-Ray edition only has a lot of different commentaries for extras - no bloopers and deleted scenes, but it's still worth the money.

Then I tell you that I made about half of it up.  Just to make it funnier.    Scenario 1= pretty good friend.  Scenario 2= slightly desperate and pathetic attempt at humor.  Comes off  a bit needy.
0743290119|5.0|I think some of the reviews are too critical.  This is a fun book that I truly enjoyed.  The pages practically turned themselves.  I though the book was a great summer read...I recommended it to all my friends.
B00006GA48|5.0|I'm back again folks. Yes. I hear cheering and foot stomping. Is that for me? No? For Grand Funk Railroad? Drat!<br />Let me begin by saying that your own beloved Metamorpho never had to suffer the indignity of early teen confusion and later teen indecisiveness. Why? Because Metamorpho is pure spirit and not given into earthly trials and indulgences when young. Rats! I've missed a lot! ;)<br /><br />Ahhhhh....... I welcome you to raging hormones and alpha male heaven with this \\"Closer to Home\\" selection. But why should Metamorpho, such a sedentary creature at heart, be prompted to write about a premier power trio from the late 60's - 70's? Simple. Pure jealousy. And I will entertain your questions later. But, this is the stuff my dragon listens to while locked away in my castle, thinking of his fine lady dragon. Say what you will, but my dragon has funk and soul. Attributes which are essential if your going to be a pet of Metamorpho. Surprised? You shouldn't be. After all, I have strict requirements which must be met. Feel priviledged? I'm letting you all read this, aren't I? And, need I say, such generosity gets my picture on many a dart board throughout the land. Now, that's power folks!<br /><br />Now, getting to \\"Closer to Home\\", which, I feel, is the pinnacle of their powers. Everything fits right, as far as their motifs, their execution and the various grooves they choose to employ. What is this music exactly? Certainly a bit of white funk, sprinkled with rock, grit, and attitude and swagger. Remember here, we are going for the strong male stance, but with some begging but never weakness. The most Grand Funk will admit to is the wolf in sheep's clothing with \\"Mean Mistreater\\". However, it is the pose that matters. Feigned weakness gets you to where you want to go. Not true weakness. That would defy the basic foundation on which this music was built. And we can't have that! Now, put those placards down!<br /><br />Regardless, this is a very fine musical offering and, perhaps, their very best. This is one that I lost long ago, only to seek out this current version again. Despite all the infectious, funky grooves here, I just had to seek it out for \\"I'm Your Captain\\". And, everything is perfect here. You begin with that wonderful wah-wah into the groove of the acoustic guitar, which sets the stage for the scenario. The ship, the captain, are allegorys for a relationship that is threatened by a stranger. Mark Farner makes it very clear that he's not giving up without a fight. But, what sets the song so much forward than the others is the breaks or, rather, passages that the song goes through. There are waves, sailing sounds that perfectly match the music in so many ways. Closer to Home - a sailor closer to the shore or a wayward lover closer to his love? I don't consider Mark a genius by any means, however, this song employs a lot of devices found in many literary compositions. So, applause is appropriate.<br /><br />In all, I would have to say that this selection more than satisfied a need within the growing up, and yearning community that was only superseded by the likes of Led Zepplin. But, to understand the allure of Grand Funk, one need only to look at the raw enegy and power of the live tracks included here. By no means were they confined to being a studio band. And, I think a lot of their success and fame were due to their live performance.<br /><br />In closing, high marks for making this a high water mark. (Sorry folks - I couldn't resist the ship-water allusion). But, if you like that power trio sound, this is different. Not your blues fused Cream. Not your pedal metal of Blue Cheer. But, funky, groove based combination of electric and crude manifestations of sexual energy towards the goal of unfulfilled love. Well, we all have to work towards something in our lives!<br /><br />Now, if you will excuse me so I can get back to that movie that I put on pause, it seems like, ten million times, to review this selectionfor you. You think reviewing is easy for me, don't you? Well, maybe. Certainly as easy as a cabernet sauvignon without a testy (or was that testosterone?) waiter nearby. Ah well........cheers.<br /><br />Steam rolling along ---Metamorpho ;)ou? Well, maybe. Certainly as easy as a cabernet sauvignon without a testy (or was that testosterone?) waiter nearby. Ah well........cheers.    Steam rolling along ---Metamorpho ;)
B000XA5K48|4.0|When I first saw the preview for this movie, I thought, wow they are really making a movie called shoot em up, this is going to be the dumbest movie ever made, HOWEVER after a bunch of my friends went to see it and liked it, i decided to rent it and form my own opinion. Within 5 minutes someone is stabbed in the eye with a carrot, which shocked me because I had never seen it before. The whole movie in itself is pretty cheezy, but, its not a academy award movi its supposed  to be a fun unrealistic movie, Clive Owens 1 liners are probably the best i've ever heard, and Paul Giamatti did a terrific acting job. My only concern is why Clive Owen did this since he is a phenominal actor, I didnt get it. But its easily a cult hit.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I loved this series. It gave me a new respect for Adams and his wife's gift to the American People. I decided to read the book and watch the series because I loved 1776. This did not disappoint. It is a must have to any American history lover. Giamatti and Linney were excellant!
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be in Jamaica when they were filming. By chance I met Steve McQueen in Montego Bay the day we arrived on vacation.  We were staying in Ochos Rios where they were filming scenes above Dunn's River Falls.  Steve just happened to be in MoBay that day. The film is a classic as far as I'm concerned.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Abraham Lincoln's political life has been the subject of many books.  Yet with Team of Rivals Doris Kearns Goodwin provides a unique and provactive look.<br /><br />Much of what she covers is familiar.  Yet this book is more than another Lincoln biography.  It is a multi-faceted reviewof the entire team of personal and political competitors that he assembled to lead the country through its greatest crisis - The American Civil War.  She profiles five of the key players in her book, four of whom contended for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincoln's cabinet - Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, William H. Seward and Edward Bates.<br /><br />The author provides insight into Lincoln's leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation. Goodwin presents a case for Lincoln's political genius by examining his relationships with cabinet selections, three of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in 1860: Seward, Chase, and Bates. These nationally known, accomplished men, originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience  Each was shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer.<br /><br />Yet Lincoln convinced them to join his administration.  He gained their admiration and respect.  The tale of his soothing egos, turning rivals into allies, and dealing with challenges to his leadership, all for the sake of the greater good, defines the book.  Without the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people, the author argues, Lincoln would have failed to lead the nation through one of its darkest chapters.<br /><br />Well-written and throughly researched, this book was a joy to read.  Its only negative is when the reader compares Lincoln leadership style to that we have experienced in this country during the past two decades.  It leaves the reader to ponder why gifted individuals no longer aspire to public service.
B0000088DC|5.0|I have this album in Vinyl and CD format. Let me say the Vinyl just blows the CD outta the water. I just got this LP at a local record store but it is the 180 grahm (audiophile quality) edition. If you are gonna get anything in Vinyl make sure it is in good condition or 180 grahm audiophile quality editions or Half Speed Mastered. If you don't know what half mastered is well here is a break down. What is done is the album is transfered to vinyl at half the speed of a normal 33 rpm record, thus giving you profoundly better quality over your run of the mill LP.     Anyways onto my real review of this record. The guitars and symbols sound very crisp here. Everything just sounds crisp and more natural. Vinyl is just the way to go with all of your favorite music. Most people would be surprised at how much modern music is put on vinyl these days. I give this album a 5/5. It has not one filler song and is mixed really well.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Excellent production and lyrics.  I have been listening to this CD non-stop for the past couple weeks and am still loving it.  It is very addicting!  I have always been a sucker for the more sad songs, which \\"Not As We\\" and \\"Torch\\" definitely rank up as some of her best.  Although the first single, \\"Underneath\\", is one of my lesser favorite tracks, the second single, \\"Incomplete\\", is catchy and meaningful and a great way to top off this all-around great album!
B000002L9W|5.0|Indudablemente el mejor albúm de hard-rock que se ha hecho nunca. Perfecta compenetración y un sonido muy puro. La guitarra de Vai más rockera que nunca y el bajo de Seehan junto con la mejor voz de David Lee Roth, hacen que este disco sea irrepetible.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I saw this on PBS' Masterpiece and enjoyed it so much I wanted to own it and add it to our Jane Austen DVD collection.  If you enjoy the movies that have been done bringing Jane Austin's writing to the screen you will probably enjoy this as well.
0743270754|1.0|A Team of Rivals, by Goodwin, is a review of Lincoln and his cabinet during the Civil War.  The problem with the book is it could have been written in one third of the space.  Very little of the book actually deals with the events of the time. Much too much of the book is devoted to details of the tiniest kind which are of no interest to me.<br /><br />For example, Ms Goodwin lets us know a lot of details about the parties being given by Mary Lincoln, how many steps a certain house was from the center of power, where Lincoln spent his time waiting for election returns, who he talked to during the time he was waiting for election returns, what jokes Lincoln would tell while he was a circuit court attorney, what kind of bonnet Mary Lincoln bought that needed ribbon or strings, how much money was spent on decorating the White House by Mary Lincoln, and on, and on, and on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, not much is said about the Civil War.  Battles, and their results, are recounted in the most abbreviated way.  Lincoln's disappointments in his generals are given very short treatment.  Of course, we are told how many drafts the Emancipation Proclamation went through and who changed what words or made recommendations for changes, but as for the war itself we are told very little.  Too bad, because Lincoln was probably a better general than many of those in charge during the Civil War.  More was needed on conversations with the generals, and less on who attended what party and was wearing what kind of dress.<br /><br />Another shortcoming of the book is its reluctance to criticize Lincoln.  Lincoln was not a demigod without flaws who always made wonderful decisions.  It is true that the author handles some of his flaws and points out some minor problems with his decisions; however, the really large errors are simply not discussed.<br /><br />For example, after the election Lincoln did not go to great lengths to make it clear to the Southern States that he would not abolish slavery and might even support a Constitutional Amendment to allow slavery to continue in the Southern States where it was already a fact.  He would only oppose its expansion to the territories.  By not speaking out more forcefully, he allowed Southern secessionism to go forward on misinterpretations of his stands. The discussion of this decision is ignored.  His decision to raise an army after the Confederates fired on Union forces in Charleston Harbor drove Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina into the Confederacy, but not much is said about this.  This exit of the more moderate and powerful states along the border with the Union had disastrous consequences; however, little is said about this decision... and so on.<br /><br />By failing to discuss important decisions, or even non-decisions, the author leaves the reader with the impression that what ball was thrown by Mary Lincoln was more important than what evaluations may have started, or hurt or helped, the war against the South.<br /><br />The book is easy to read, as are most gossip magazines, but actually conveys little in the way of real information of lasting value.  Most of the information was boring and of little use.  A Team of Rivals is good for tidbits of history but not for a deep understanding of history.  Much better and more complete information, important information, can be had in so many other books that reading this was a waste of time.and might even support a Constitutional Amendment to allow slavery to continue in the Southern States where it was already a fact.

B000OT6V00|5.0|While some good directors never quite \\"get it,\\" it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced \\"Blade 2\\" -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.<br /><br />In fact, just about everything is right with \\"Hellboy\\" -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor. It's graced with excellent acting, spectacular action scenes, and the trappings of clockpunk and Lovecraftian horror -- not to mention that it stars a six-foot-tall scarlet demon with a soft spot for kittens.<br /><br />In 1944, young Professor Broom accompanied an army regiment to a remote Scottish island, where the Nazis -- led by Rasputin -- were about to open a portal to another world, and allow the vast tentacled Ogru Jahad (Seven Gods of Chaos) to enter our world. Rasputin and the Nazis were destroyed, but something came through the portal -- a baby demon, whom Broom names Hellboy.<br /><br />Fast-forward sixty years -- a grown Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones) are working at a paranormal government agency that specializes in policing the supernatural, with the weirded-out Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) just joining the team. Soon afterwards, Hellboy is called on to kill Sammael the Hellhound -- but it turns out that Sammael can replicate himself indefinitely.<br /><br />As Hellboy and his team try to hunt down the remaining Sammaels, the dying Professor Broom (John Hurt) finds that a revived Rasputin and his immortal Nazi followers have orchestrated all this. And Rasputin is continuing to pull the strings behind the scenes -- including using Hellboy's love Liz (Selma Blair), a depressed pyrokinetic. And when Hellboy suffers a devastating loss, his journey will take him right back to his roots -- and the potential destruction of the world.<br /><br />Watching \\"Hellboy,\\" it's easy to see how Guillermo Del Toro because world-famous for the exquisitely dark \\"Pan's Labyrinth,\\" and why he's been chosen to direct the forthcoming \\"Hobbit\\" movies. This adaptation could have just been another paint-by-numbers comic-book story, but Del Toro gives it the kind of grime, quirk, brains and heart that a lasting cult movie should have.<br /><br />Part of that cult appeal is \\"Hellboy's\\" distinctive look, with Lovecraftian tentacle-gods and some steampunky details. And the action scenes are pretty spectacular -- trains, slimy hellhounds, sword-swinging Nazis with chopped-up faces, giant clock cogs, and a fiery explosion in a mental asylum. And there are some truly spectacular action scenes in a vast underground labyrinth, full of ancient hammers and collapsing bridges. There's just enough action and grossness, without going overboard.<br /><br />But Del Toro is able to balance out the action with some truly touching moments, such as the aged Broom's final scenes in his firelit study. And there's a lot of dark humor here as well -- and not all of it is Hellboy's dry one-liners. The movie is liberally peppered with dark humor moments (\\"1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.\\" \\"DID he now?\\"), including some hilariously macabre scenes involving a bad-tempered Russian zombie (\\"This is Ivan Klimatovich. Say hi, Ivan.\\" \\"Go that way, Red Monkey!\\").<br /><br />Most importantly, Del Toro is able to give his characters little human quirks -- hair plugs, love of cats, and Hellboy sanding down his horns in the morning. Perlman is simply amazing as \\"Red,\\" whose gruff scarlet exterior hides a kindly, affectionate heart. Not many actors could emote through that many prosthetics (including a very lifelike tail), but Perlman makes it look natural.<br /><br />Though he's playing a ninetyish old professor, Hurt plays his role with a quiet, powerful sense of goodness. Jones and Evans also do excellent jobs, one as an erudite psychic fish-man (\\"We lead a charmed life,\\" he observes as cockroaches skitter around him) and an earnest young agent. Selma Blair is the one downside -- she sort of mumbles in a monotone most of the time.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" is one of the best comic-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I have enjoyed all of the Reacher series.  This one is entertaining, as always, but just a little too unbelievable at times...
6302470021|5.0|While technically a comedy, what sets this film apart is its inherent coolness - its beautiful cinematography, crazy set-pieces, and wonderful moments all work together to...    Well, okay, it's a mess.  But it's a beautiful mess.  And it stands as one of the finest examples of 1960's cool.  When Peter Sellers walks into Ursula Andress's apartment to the strains of Dusty Springfield singing \\"The Look Of Love,\\" we know we're not in our own world any more; we're in a better one.  One that doesn't make sense a lot of the time, but better nevertheless.      This is one of my favorite films, despite its flaws.  Again, it's not that the film as a whole stands as a masterpiece of cinema (what do you expect from a spy-film spoof with three or four different directors), but because it's full of so many cool, funny, and great-looking scenes.    (It also has some of the most gorgeous women ever to appear together in one movie.  Yowza!)
B0012CJQY6|4.0|To be clear, this is the DVD set of Season 1 re-released in 2008:<br /><br />I broke down & bought the new Sony release of Season 1. Here are my nitpicks about the differences with the original release:<br /><br />The new set is in widescreen, which is a night & day difference from the old set on my HDTV.... The \\"Previously on The Shield\\" segments absent on the original Season 1 set are here. But, the 1st chapter stop is after the opening credits, not the recap. What a bunch of duki! Also, there are no chapter selection menus. All the original extras are here, minus the original script of the Pilot. The credits all replace the Columbia-Tristar logo with the Sony logo....<br /><br />The menus use the same design as the original R1 set. The cover is also the same, without the gold reflective effect the original had.<br /><br />Overall, the technical presentation is much better on this set. Plus, since they're a slim cased set, getting these Seasons will save me space on my shelf....<br /><br />On a side note: This is the best TV show ever made! The characters are real and you get attached to them. You'll hate them one episode, and love them the next. No matter which set you get, you're in for one of the best TV show experiences you've ever had....

B0017R5UAA|5.0|My life was never the same after hearing the song Mykonos, from the Sun Giant EP, on KUSF student radio (San Francisco). I immediately purchased the EP, and it was stellar. I couldn't wait for the full length LP, which I purchased as soon as it was released. All the positive reviews and hype are spot on. This band is like nothing I have ever heard before. Their orchestral, spiritual folk rock sound rivals the best recordings of Simon & Garfunkel, Crosby Stills & Nash, and even the Beach Boys. Brian Wilson is apparently a strong influence, whose dreamy style of harmony is heard on some tracks. I will be shocked if this band does not become famous, but its history of personnel changes and apparent organic philosophy for modesty may cause them to run away from fame and commercialism, which could also cause them to break up or transform prematurely under all the pressure! I sure hope they are prepared to receive and promote all the love they will receive from music fans. They sure deserve it. When the hell is the next album, and when are they coming to my town?
B0011UBDTK|5.0|It's fantastic having the complete series.  I am very impressed with the packaging, it has great photos of the cast, and set-up nicely with the dividers.  I got a great price on the set, and have gone to bed later then I've wanted because the show is so addictive.
B00005JPMZ|4.0|I have always had a soft spot for the Ninja Turtles and I loved the two live action films....yes there were only two! So I was very excited to see the new CGI TMNT, but the horde of terrible reviews came so fast it made my head spin. I finally got a chance to catch this movie on HBO and FORSHAME ON ALL OF YOU WHO HATED THIS MOVIE!!!<br /><br />This was a great story with a great cast of characters. The story takes place after Shredder and the Turtles are not actually teenagers anymore. The story has a lot of emotion and great dilogue between the turtles even an excellent falling out with Leo and Raph that just left me awestruck. Making this an animated film was the right way to go because the action sequences were mind blowing. This was just a great way to lose myself in fantasy for a good hour and a half. As far as I am concerned I don't think anyone should have a problem with this movie and if you did you probably never liked TMNT when you were kid and I feel sorry for you.

B00006AW2M|5.0|After Sgt. Pepper many bands were obviously wanting to evolve. Were it not for that album, I'm sure Jefferson Airplane would not have given us After Bathing at Baxter's, and the Grateful Dead with Anthem of the Sun. Or Zappa with We're Only In It For the Money (which spoofed the Sgt. Pepper album cover and packaging). The Stones obviously didn't want to feel left out and come Their Satanic Majesties Request at the end of 1967. And it was their response to Sgt. Pepper, but to me, it's hardly a copy of that album. The album sported wonderful artwork, complete with that 3-D cover.    Many fans and rock critics have never been too kind to this album, because it's so far removed from their R&B roots. Psychedelia, with some art rock and space rock tendencies is what you find on this album, musical styles many felt the Stones should not have touched with a ten foot pole. And guess what? The music works great. And the music is much better than I expected, given how much of a drug-induced haze the band was in by that time. Plus Brian Jones got himself a Mellotron, first used on the \\"We Love You\\" single and put to great use on this album!    The album is full of great creative twists and turns, with nice Mellotron used on many of the cuts, from the singalong quality of \\"Sing This All Together\\" to the spacy \\"In Another Land\\" (where Bill Wyman handles lead) to the jamming of \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens), and of course \\"She's a Rainbow\\" which received radio airplay. Strings were conducted by none other than John Paul Jones, then doing session work, before finding his big fame and fortune with Led Zeppelin. And you can't go without mentioning their own space rock anthem, \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\". This is simply one of the all-time great Mellotron songs, but for some reason doesn't get mention in the same league as \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" (Beatles, of course), \\"Nights in White Satin\\" (The Moody Blues), \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" (Genesis), \\"Siberian Khatru\\" (Yes)or \\"Epitaph\\" (King Crimson) (and no, not Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", tron was only used when the band performed it live, multi-tracked recorders were used on the studio version, it's \\"Kashmir\\" and \\"Rain Song\\" that you can call Zeppelin's great tron moments) as one of the all-time tron classics. It ought to!    What's also great about this album was it was their first album where the UK and US releases were the same, same cover artwork, same album titles, same track listings. I'm sure many Stones and Beatles collectors, once they discovered the imports often varied greatly, were constantly annoyed why the American releases were so different (and in the case of the Beatles up to Revolver, missing songs). I'm glad that wasn't a problem with either band by this point.    I really think what might turn many people off about this album, other than not sounding like a typical Stones album would be cuts like \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" which many might call a rather aimless jam, and \\"Gomper\\" which many might feel is simply self-indulgent and dated. In my defense, I really thought those were great risks that the band did that I realize not everyone would like. \\"Gomper\\" was in the style of Indian raga, but strangely no sitar, but Hammond organ was used. People were also put off by Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land\\", because most people felt he should never went anywhere near a microphone. I didn't find the song that bad, and you do hear Mick do backup. At least Bill did electronically modify his voice. Then there's those who felt the album was just too gimmicky, from the cover artwork right down to the studio tricks. It's little wonder detractors called Beggars Banquet such a huge relief, because it went back to their roots. In my defense, I felt bands had the right to evolve, even the Stones. The Beatles did, and no one got after them, they even forgave them for Magical Mystery Tour (the film, that is), as the album by the same name was still excellent, inmy opinion (and I didn't find the film that bad either, but there are many that didn't care for it). Even other bands with R&B beginnings evolved like The Pretty Things (F.S. Sorrow, Parachute), and The Who (Tommy) and many of those albums get high praises. And to be honest, Their Satanic Majesties Request was not the flop many made it out to be: it did go #2 in the US charts and #3 in the UK charts. But many bands felt psychedelia was reaching a dead-end by 1968, no doubt helped by The Band released Music From Big Pink, it's little wonder there was a roots rock movement shortly after that album was released, and it showed in the Beatles (The White Album) and the Stones (Beggars Banquet).    This album never got the respect of Sgt. Pepper (of course) or Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but I have to say that the Stones did a great job at their try at psychedelia. It was basically the negative reaction that caused the band to return to their roots with their next single, \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and the Beggar's Banquet album released a year after TSMR. Really, I'm with all those who feel this is an underrated album, I was really taken by surprise. And I have to say this coming from someone not big on the Stones.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The best period drama movie/series I have seen.  I will treasure this DVD.  My day is not complete without watching it before I retire, kind of addictive.  I recommend this movie to those who love drama and romance.  I love Richard Armitage's portrayal (handsome employer), as well as Daniela Denby-Ashe's (beautiful heroine).  Excellent ending, very inspirational movie.
B0014JOLI8|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkland is probably one of my favorite books of all time. It is full of magic and betrayal and keeps the reader up all night! The Amulet of Samarkland is about the ambitious adventures of Nathaniel, a young magician, who struggles to take his revenge only to find himself deep in a possibly fatal conspiracy. He employs the witty and clever dijini Bartimaeus to work with him and at the same time save him with his ancient experience. What I find most interesting and unique to this book are the clever footnotes at the bottom of the pages conveying the humourous thoughts if Bartimaeus. Overall, The Amulet of Samarkland is an excellent read for anybody of all ages. Also, it can be read many times over with the same satifaction at the end every time.
B000IHYY52|5.0|This is a masterfully produced disc.  When you put this in your player and the theme music starts, you know you are in for a great night of jazz.     What truly makes this collection compelling is the well-balanced list of performances.  There are artists new and old, well-known and not so well-known, from a surprisingly varied pool of  jazz sub-genres:  fusion, bebop, swing, latin, and bossa.  There is even a blues performance thrown in.   The performances themselves are mostly very good, with the occasional eye-opening one mixed in such as Marcus Miller's Panther.      The production value of the disc is fantastic too.  I would've loved this even on VHS because it is ultimately about the music; but there is something to be said about the excellent high definition video and sound.  This is truly as close as one can get to being there live.  The disc is also very well organized.  It is easy to switch between sound formats and you can access the performances individually from the main menu too.  Even the artist bios are well done.  In fact, I found this Blu-ray disc so great that I'm now torn between buying the Legends of Jazz DVD collection or waiting for a Blu-ray release.  I will probably buy the DVD set now since the music and the performances are what's important I think.    As far as shortcomings, the only one I found is that the length is on the short side at 55 minutes.  Everything else was perfect.   If you like jazz, you'll love this disc.
0195170776|3.0|This dictionary is a Pop dictionary, and is not really appropriate for scholarly reference or for people looking for more detailed information.  It's fine for general definitions and etymology, but really poor for proper names.             Each proper name entry is the same length (about three sentences), regardless of who the person is.  Thus Tom Cruise gets nearly as much space as Abraham Lincoln, and the entries for Stephen King and Martin Luther King are the same length.  Important historical figures like Jan Hus--the Bohemian revolutionary whose religious ideas predated the Reformation--are nowhere to be found, but if you're looking for Julia Roberts, no problem.             The editorical decisions on the entries for nations are equally bizarre.  For instance, the entry on the United States is only slightly longer than the one for Tunisia.  No offense to Tunisians, but this seems like an absurd attempt to be even-handed and to not make value judgements about the importance of one place over another. The nation entries also don't provide any history, demographics, or topography--really they don't provide much of anything beyond a generic description that tells you what continent you're on.          This is not a dictionary for people who like details.  No definition is more than 2-3 sentences, regardless of how important it is.  The editors also don't make any decisions about what is important.  Why does Bach get the same treatment as Scriabin?  I seriously question the motives of Oxford University Press.  It seems like an intentionally dumbed-down edition meant to appeal to Americans--something we should all take offense at.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I'm a long-time fan of the original Broadway musical, so I kept noticing the differences between the versions.  This does not make the movie any less excellent; its medium is different and some sacrifices have to be made to appeal to a larger audience.  For example, Judge Turpin is shown to be much more openly perverse in the movie rather than the musical, and his piousness is downplayed to make him more of a cheer-when-the-bad-guy-gets-it villain (note that, in the musical, Turpin plays Peeping Tom on his ward even has he's /flagellating himself/ asking for forgiveness from God, making him look more like a tortured soul).  Other than the requisite simplifications to prevent it from taking three hours, the movie stands well on its own with a darker, grittier take; there's definitely more 'dark' than 'comedy' here.  Johnny Depp has been rightfully praised for his performance; his decision to attempt more of a punk rock angle rather than an operatic singer certainly plays to the strengths in his voice and actually strengthens the character as well, given how he manages to spit out lyrics drenched with hate and revenge... musically.
B000W4D27C|5.0|Ever since I bought Precambrian (over 6 months ago) I haven't gone a day without listening to it from begining to end. Every once in a while an album affects me in such a way that my day isn't balanced until I have heard it. The last time this happened to me at this magnitude was Aenima by Tool. This album is pure metal perfection. I am VERY excited about seeing them in S.F. this Saturday. This album was written and put together in such a way that to call it anything less than a masterpiece is by far a sad misunderstanding of what the perfect metal album should sound like. I would describe Precambrian as a score written for the most beautifuly dreadful dream you've ever had.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I love zombie movies, and I love the story /I Am Legend/.  It's a highly intelligent read, and I recommend it.    Saying that, this movie got the \\"Legend\\" completely wrong... but that's the 'third act collapse' and everyone goes on about that.    Saying that, none of this movie's flaws have anything to do with Will Smith.  Will Smith proved that he could really act as something other than \\"Will Smith Versus The X\\" in /Pursuit of Happiness/, and here he proves that he can act when he really does have the screen all to himself, with no one else but a dog to distract from him.  I actually think he even one-ups Tom Hank's performance in /Cast Away/, for *SPOILER ALERT* when his character actually meets another two live human beings, he's been alone for three years and has practically forgotten how to relate to them (Hanks' character seemed to adapt to his return to humanity almost instantly).  Even in the infamous third act, Smith doesn't drop the ball for an instant.
B000TJBNFI|5.0|My favorite part is when Kathy Bates screams hysterically: MISERY CHASTAIN CANNOT BE DEAD. Because it was so over-the-top and in-your-face. I also love the part during the high-impact climactic scene between Annie and Paul when she maliciously called him a: c-o-c-k sucker. OMG so funny!!<br /><br />IMHO, \\"Misery\\" is an updated version of the classic \\"What Ever Happened To Baby Jane\\" because Annie is just as nutty and attention-starved as Baby Jane Hudson. I don't think she had a specific obsession with Paul, instead, I think she was just obsessed with the idea of being near a warm body. She would have done this to anyone! But, Paul was absolutely the perfect victim to be kept hostage because he was such a normal, sane person who would never otherwise have been caught dead (pardon the pun) with Annie Wilkes.<br /><br />Kathy Bates very rightfully won the Academy Award for her portrayal of this whack-job. She did such a bang-up job. As a matter of fact, there's even times when I'm watching \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" (another favorite of mine) when I actually think for a split second that I see Annie Wilkes return! James Caan was just as perfect as Kathy Bates although he received considerably less fanfare. But it's always like that, isn't it? The kooks always get the sympathy and the limelight while the otherwise sane are forgotten about. You gotta love it!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Were this a Moore or a Brosnan Bond film, the first chase scene would've had Bond matching the parkour freejumper move for acrobatic move.  He's a trained ninja diplomat assassin secret agent, you see; he's good at everything.  Freejumper vaults himself up and over a bit of drywall; certainly the best in Her Majesty's Secret Service can do the same.    Instead, Craig bulldozes through the drywall.    And, for an encore, the rest of the movie.    Even the great Saint Connery was guilty of managing to kill at least one henchman with every single shot even at a dead run (I think that was /Dr. No/).  Craig?  Well, he shoots a lot but generally his only one-shot kills were either cheap shots (mook rounds a corner, hello gun, bang) or taking advantage of the environment (gas tanks, gas bags, anything explodey).    Well, we -could- have the supergiant MI6 database of everyone's ever movements track down the bad guy... or Craig could just use people's cellphones in something approximating real spycraft.  Half-monk, half-hitman, all highly-trained thug who's been taught to stand up when ladies leave the table.  Everything a true Bond should be.
6304779356|4.0|It's funny to watch this film again now... since I now live near Santa Cruz (i.e. Santa Carla)    Music's great and the film always makes me laugh at the dry humour... a must watch cult following for this one.    Recommended viewing!
0060574216|5.0|I read this book as a proactive measure to gear up for a permanent full time commitment.  I can say that most of the sample phrases inspected in this book have been hurled at me, or hurled by me at one time or another, in relationships I've had long before Mars/Venus was published.  If I had known then the info provided in this book, I'd probably be married with the kids going off to college by now.<br /><br />But let's look at why I think this book will work for you.  It's been over fifteen years since this title came out.  (I remembered people lampooning and dismissing it when it first hit the market and became a sensation)  This book could be seen as part of the movement in the nineties where men became the kinder/gentler men we see all around us today.  I'm aware that not everyone wants to be seen as or wants a kindler gentler man.  But in the course of men becoming softer in the nineties, women made an accompanying move towards a hardened masculinity in the whole \\"grrrls rule, boys drool\\" attitude.  As a result, the gender lines between respective behavior have been blurred considerably.  Anyone could pick up this book today and see a little of themselves described on both planets.<br /><br />There are helpful ideograms presented here (men=rubberbands, women=waves, men go into and returning from caves, women descending into and arising from their wells).  It's all about cycles and rhythm, and believe it or not, men have their own too. The importance of communication and how and when to say what are tools everyone should have in steering clear of an argument, a major relationship killer.  The anatomy of an argument is also analyzed in detail.  The book ends with how to ask for support and a useful psychological revelation: when you feel safest and loved, painful memories from the past will surface.  It shows you that you may mistakenly attribute those painful feelings to your partner when you shouldn't.<br /><br />There is also an effective chapter on the subtle linguistics of asking.<br /><br />There's bound to be many knee-jerk reactions from readers all around.  People have continued to oppose this book based on the stereotypes it makes, not on its effectiveness.  I for one, am very resistant to self-help books.  I have returned advice books for refunds and even hurled some at the wall in disgust.<br /><br />What's important for me is that books, like movies, music, news, and peer-pressure work collectively to shape who we are and how we behave.  Since the publication of this book, its advice and examples have worked itself into the consciousness of how partners (in a certain socio-economic group) behave, express themselves, and interact with each other.  I can't count how many times I've heard some of the phrases in this book uttered between friends who are in relationships.  Even though many have not read the book, they are utilizing variations of its examples in their every day speech.<br /><br />With divorce rates ever on the increase, I'm quite certain if you were to walk away with 10% of the information presented in this book, regardless of which gender group you culled the advice from, you would have already disproportionately increase the probability of your relationship succeeding..

B000AO4NJA|5.0|With his smooth, velvet vocals, Sam Cooke stands on his own as one of the all time great singer-songwriters, influencing a number of other aspiring artist in the music business, especially Otis Redding, Bobby Womack, Johnny Taylor... the great Cooke was capable of singing almost any style of music in his own distinctive way, mostly soul. This R.C.A. best of recording tells all, the classic ballads, \\"Summertime\\", \\"You Send Me\\", \\"Bring It On Home\\", featuring other Cooke favorites, \\"Chain Gang\\", \\"Cupid\\", \\"A Wonderful World\\", \\"Twisting The Night Away\\", classic Sam Cooke material that will stand the test of time. The only problem with this compilation, it's missing the hits, \\"Change Is Gonna Come\\", \\"Shake\\", \\"Another Saturday Night\\". This was the first Sam Cooke album for me, it also became my favorite.  The remastering is excellent, a giant step from the first released 1990 cd.
0440238609|5.0|Philip Pullman's books are great - fantastic adventure and wonderful narrative. I have read them before but am reading them again having seen the Golden Compass movie recently. The movie was great but the books are so much richer - but that always seems to be the case. Looking forward to the second movie now.

B000EHRVP6|2.0|Really though, what can you expect from the director of that Cabin movie??<br /><br />I thought this would be like the new name in terror films from the way people were talking, but overall, this was just kind of weak.<br /><br />The movie had some good gore scenes if that is what you are into and some naked beautiful women which I always enjoy, but as a movie...ehhh...not very exciting.<br /><br />The story is really linear and boring, not thought-provoking at all, and although I usually love the films that Tarantino endorses, after watching this all that I could think of is, \\"What the heck was that piece of crap?\\"<br /><br />The movie is not completely without merits, as I mention women and gore, but really it was not entertaining.  If I wanted to watch a good terror type of film that is also entertaining and meaningful, I would NEVER watch this.<br /><br />We bought this, watched it once, and then gave it to a friend.  Really, if you are a fan of the genre, then check it out, but I would not suggest wasting your money on this.  By buying it, you are giving people hope for this level of film making, and really, that is just not right at all.

B00004RF98|5.0|I am not going to try to reiterate all of the laudatory reviews from other customers.  But I will restate the claims of many who regard SITR as one of the ten best films ever made.  Without a doubt it is, and that includes all types of films.  Yes, the very theme of the film is a little \\"corny.\\" but so was the era it portrays - when movies were \\"king\\" and the industry was in a tremendous state of transition.  \\"Tongue-in-cheek\\" about covers the story line, which is beautifully woven into \\"the\\" classic Hollywood musical.<br /><br />From beginning to end, the film is a masterful blend of romance, great humor, cinematic history with a clever touch of sarcasm, and some of the best dance performances ever seen anywhere.  The title performance of Gene Kelly actually \\"singing in the rain\\" is the most memorable solo dance routine in the history of film.  But there are some points in the film where Donald O'Connor almost steals the show, and his solo dance number of \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" must be seen to be believed, and he put on some of the funniest sequences ever.<br /><br />The lavish number performed by Gene Kelly with the incredibly beautiful Cy Charisse is simply breathtaking, and Jean Hagen's role as Lena Lamont is truly excellent.  And Gene Kelly?  At least the equal of Fred Astaire in dancing sensitivity, and much more athletic.  You will also be a bit (pleasantly) surprised by the dance competence of Debbie Reynolds, who is at her charming and lovely best in the film.<br /><br />It is an excellent, fast-moving, and wholly entertaining story throughout, and is a masterful piece of cinematography.  I cannot imagine a classic film collection that does not include this wonderfully enjoyable DVD.
B000YAA68C|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie. While the male character was adorable, it left out alot of detail that would make you warm up to them as a couple. From fight to funeral! Why did they cram so much info together? I would have gladly sat thru a couple of scenes for 10 more minutes. Budget, I guess.   I would have really been lost if I hadn't known he was going to die. The family members at the funeral were difficult to recognize as again no real background info except one previous sentence about the mother. It seemed that we to infer alot, too much in my estimation.   The whole movie seemed to revolve around sex. I thought this was a love story. Once again Hollywood tries to prove a misnomer. Sex first, equals love later.   The best part of the whole movie was the end. Scrap the whole movie and start from there. Now there's a plot. A widow visiting the parents of her deceased husband and meeting someone interesting who turns out to be a close friend of her husband and for a kick her bitter mother finds love in his dad. That's a movie that would have been worth watching.
B00125WAWS|5.0|The firm is loosely based on a story set in Texas during the 1930's.  The story is centered around Melvin Tolson (played by Denzel Washington) and his hand-picked group of black students at Wiley College.  Tolson preps his team hard in the debating discipline and leads then on to beat black colleges and acquire an undefeated record. His students eventually get a crack at and beat the white Oklahoma City College which captures national attention.  The Wiley College team goes on to compete against the National Champion Harvard debate team in the hallowed halls of Harvard.  (In reality, the Wiley team beats the USC, the reigning debating champions - but certainly this change in plot line is a more compelling story for the viewer.)      This was an emotionally moving story - with the lynchings, the racism, the double standards - and yet the team was still able to overcome.  The movie was well casted and more so with the students then with Denzel who I felt overacted in certain segments.  Great film...

B0014XCMVM|5.0|When I first heard that Alanis was teaming up with Guy Sigsworth (of Bjork and Frou Frou notoriety), I had some misgivings.  The style Sigsworth always brings to the table didn't seem to me like it would mesh with Alanis's lyrical and melodic sensibilities.  Fortunately for me and the rest of Alanis's fan base (whether hysterical or casual), these two creative minds work extremely well together.<br /><br />Listening through the album for the first time, I was caught off-guard by many of the sounds and melodic choices.  It was entertaining and delightful, but some songs seemed a bit awkward and misplaced.  After the album's close, though, those \\"misplaced\\" songs had managed to slip their way into my unconscious and before I'd even had the chance to play the album a second time, I was already humming their choruses.<br /><br />If you're used to the way Alanis has approached songwriting in the past, \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" may put you off, but once you allow yourself to accept that people grow and styles change, give it a fresh listen, and you'll be overwhelmed with the brilliant musicality and lyrical stylings throughought.<br /><br />A quick rundown of the best tracks on the album:<br /><br />\\"Citizen of the Planet\\" starts out familiarly (go back and listen to \\"So-Called Chaos\\" from the album of the same name), but the song takes a strikingly different direction and accomplishes something its predecessor didn't: strong, emotive vocals coupled with a powerful accompaniment that doesn't leave you hungering for something more substantial.<br /><br />\\"Versions of Violence\\" is ideal for those who like their music with more of an edge.  An unexpectedly brilliant foray into \\"rougher\\" territory.<br /><br />\\"Tapes\\" catches you off-guard.  A ballad that jumps from evoking the anguish of unhappiness to that feeling you get when you border on angry (at yourself) from all the non-stop negative thinking that most of us fall prey.  A beautiful expression.<br /><br />\\"Incomplete\\" is incredible.  One of those feel-good Alanis songs that everyone seems to forget about in favor of dwelling on her anger.  The hopeful lyrics are echoed PERFECTLY in Guy Sigsworth's production of the song.  This is one of those songs I was unsure of my first time around.  I wake up at night and can hear it playing in my head.<br /><br />The second disc of the deluxe edition contains five gems.  If you have followed Alanis's career, you know that her B-sides are never \\"filler.\\"  These songs are all great.  \\"Limbo No More\\" is the best of the five.  \\"On the Tequila\\" is probably the silliest song I've heard in a long time.  Please note that when I say it's silly, I don't mean it's silly in a way that's off-putting.  It's the kind of silly that makes you put it on repeat while driving down the highway with friends.  Just complete and utter fun.  No deep meaning or emotional expression; a total mood lifter.<br /><br />To summarize, this album is not just for new or old fans of Alanis.  It's for anyone who enjoys a great musical experience.  Sweeping melodies and heartfelt, honest lyrics from someone who's not afraid to say, \\"Okay, on that day, I was happy, but then over here I was totally crappy.\\"  (Those are not actual lyrics, by the way.)  No way I would give this album fewer than five stars.everyone seems to forget about in favor of dwelling on her anger.  The hopeful lyrics are echoed PERFECTLY in Guy Sigsworth's production of the song.  This is one of those songs I was unsure of my first time around.

Please note that when I say it's silly, I don't mean it's silly in a way that's off-putting.  It's the kind of silly that makes you put it on repeat while driving down the highway with friends.  Just complete and utter fun.  No deep meaning or emotional expression; a total mood lifter.    To summarize, this album is not just for new or old fans of Alanis.  It's for anyone who enjoys a great musical experience.  Sweeping melodies and heartfelt, honest lyrics from someone who's not afraid to say, \\"Okay, on that day, I was happy, but then over here I was totally crappy.\\"  (Those are not actual lyrics, by the way.)  No way I would give this album fewer than five stars.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|Just listening to this album takes you back.  Lennon, whatever your politics, was a voice for peace in an insane time in this country.  The album reminds me of that time and wonder about other works he would have produced had he lived.  Great collection of songs from an outstanding artist.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|When I first heard that Alanis was teaming up with Guy Sigsworth (of Bjork and Frou Frou notoriety), I had some misgivings.  The style Sigsworth always brings to the table didn't seem to me like it would mesh with Alanis's lyrical and melodic sensibilities.  Fortunately for me and the rest of Alanis's fan base (whether hysterical or casual), these two creative minds work extremely well together.<br /><br />Listening through the album for the first time, I was caught off-guard by many of the sounds and melodic choices.  It was entertaining and delightful, but some songs seemed a bit awkward and misplaced.  After the album's close, though, those \\"misplaced\\" songs had managed to slip their way into my unconscious and before I'd even had the chance to play the album a second time, I was already humming their choruses.<br /><br />If you're used to the way Alanis has approached songwriting in the past, \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" may put you off, but once you allow yourself to accept that people grow and styles change, give it a fresh listen, and you'll be overwhelmed with the brilliant musicality and lyrical stylings throughought.<br /><br />A quick rundown of the best tracks on the album:<br /><br />\\"Citizen of the Planet\\" starts out familiarly (go back and listen to \\"So-Called Chaos\\" from the album of the same name), but the song takes a strikingly different direction and accomplishes something its predecessor didn't: strong, emotive vocals coupled with a powerful accompaniment that doesn't leave you hungering for something more substantial.<br /><br />\\"Versions of Violence\\" is ideal for those who like their music with more of an edge.  An unexpectedly brilliant foray into \\"rougher\\" territory.<br /><br />\\"Tapes\\" catches you off-guard.  A ballad that jumps from evoking the anguish of unhappiness to that feeling you get when you border on angry (at yourself) from all the non-stop negative thinking that most of us fall prey.  A beautiful expression.<br /><br />\\"Incomplete\\" is incredible.  One of those feel-good Alanis songs that everyone seems to forget about in favor of dwelling on her anger.  The hopeful lyrics are echoed PERFECTLY in Guy Sigsworth's production of the song.  This is one of those songs I was unsure of my first time around.

B001152TL6|4.0|I remember when this movie came out in the mid 1990's. This is classic David Lynch weird. Has a great and intricate plot, as well as a start studded cast. Glad it finally came out on DVD.
B00005JPNY|3.0|I saw this movie without reading any reviews or the book so I'll base my comments on what I saw. The use of CGI and real people was very well done. Especially riveting were the fights scenes. The one between the bears and the second between the \\"security forces\\" and the witches. In the bears fight scene, you could really visualize watching two huge polar bears fighting to the death.    Sometimes things occurred, that by the movie's ended, didn't make sense. One of those was while Lyra and the Sam Elliott character while in his flying machine, witches flew overhead. He said \\"they're on their way to fight\\". How did the witches know there was going to be a fight when the actual fight doesn't happen for quite a few scenes later?    The ending left a lot to be desired. There were things left \\"open\\" (that should have had closure) and you also got the distinct feeling \\"there's going to be a follow-up movie\\".     My recommendation is to see the movie, if for nothing else to see the great CGI. The interaction between the \\"real\\" people and the graphics/animation really captures you.
1567184855|5.0|This is sort of part one of 2 books. You don't have to believe everything you read for a book to offer you something of value. This book is very stimulating and can get you to think twice about many things you do in life and how you view what others do. Like what is really most important in life and in all your relationships with people. And that is the value of reading it [Not trying to prove whether it's true or not]. I'd buy it again.

I was a little disappointed with it, after hearing about it for so many years.  The language isn't great, and the boy/girl roles seemed so conventional--dated anyway.  One scene in the book is fantastic, however; it's the one of Aslan's crucifixion and resurrection, metaphorically disguised.[[ASIN:0977708276 Take Me With You When You Go]]
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae makes the \\"Feel Good\\" album of the year. Every song takes you to another place, another mood, another feeling. From \\"Love\\" to \\"Little Girls playing Double Dutch on the concrete\\", you can picture it all. What a voice, what an album of pure, absolute raw talent and fun.  I recommend this album to everyone and have actually bought this as a gift for many of my friends.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|First of all let me say I don't work in a studio but have tried many pairs of headphones but these are my favorites. I've had the same pair of  Sony MDRV600s for over 3 years and loved them but was always interested in owning a professional model of headphones.<br /> After listening to the 7506 I've come to realize how much better they are for accurate sound and they give me a more enjoyable listening experience compared to the Sony MDRV600s . First of all the vocals and treble are much more noticable and clear. The bass really sounds deep and they feel great.Nice and snug without being too loose or too tight.One of the best things about them is they are much more evenly toned than most other headphones especially in this price range.Maybe it's the fact that I've gotten used to the quality and clarity in the sound but I feel like the more I use them the better they sound.The bass sounds deeper now than it did when I first got them and listened to them and the treble sound is even more amazing especially given the fact I don't use an equalizer.Also,like so many people have already said the 7506s give off great volume without being painful to the ears.If you live in a busy neighborhood like I do you would appreciate how much unwanted noise is cut down when you listen to these headphones.<br />  They are great for music, movies,tv and video games. They are true classic studio headphones and are a reminder that great sound is accurate sound.

B0010X745K|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. You have crappy script, crappy acting, and ridiculous characters reacting in ridiculous ways. It was so bad I had to see it through to laugh at how much the movie stunk.    The plot is already silly, but as a sci-fi fan I have seen some pretty silly stuff and still enjoyed it. This movie is severely crippled by the terrible acting, especially when people are reacting to events. The scenes take what seems like years to get where the are going too. Do you like looking at people's faces while they are staring into the mist? Good you will get plenty of that. Do you like it when people stand and scream when they should be running? You are in luck. This is the new millenium give the characters some brains and for goodness sake stop stereotyping!    The religious character is so over-the-top crazy that even I, a Christian myself, routed for her demise. This is a gross misrepresentation of religion corrupting. It is true for some, but the movie was making heavy handed suggestions that Christians are crazy blood thirsty looney tunes. Give me a break.    This is a 2 hour movie. Do anything, read the paper, take out the dog for a walk, throw catch with your kid, but do not see this movie!! You will never get that 2 hours of your life back.

B00005JPS7|5.0|Many of the Marvel Films projects--outside of the Spider-Man (thus far) trilogy--have met with some very mixed results and reviews.  One is left wondering if Marvel has rushed their Universe out there too quickly.  Certainly, Iron Man--given to Jon Favreau to direct, and the controversial decision to go with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark--left many pondering if the right decisions were made in production and casting.     Well...THAT WAS SETTLED.     What we found out was that RDJ was not just a good pick, but a GREAT pick to play the hard-partying, hard-drinking weapons manufacturer who, when captured by terrorists who want him to make a weapon, comes up with a Ned Kelly-like suit of iron (The suit us fanboys recognize as the original Iron Man suit), and proceeds to get medieval on the terrorist encampment.  There were many who thought that Oded Fehr (Of \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"Resident Evil\\" movies) was the more likely choice to be Stark, but RDJ--and his own personal history with alcohol and drugs can't be dismissed in this casting--is nothing short of brilliant.  At points, RDJ does his usual fast-paced one liners and makes them part of Stark, but there are points that--with the epiphany his character has about 40 minutes in--that Downey becomes the performer we saw in \\"Chaplin\\".     The casting is incredibly solid--Gwynneth Paltrow's return to work as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges' take on Obidiah Stane, and Terrence Howard's military liason to Stark, James Rhodes...plus, we can all see the sequel (or sequels) being set up through the movie--Howard's looking at the second suit and saying \\"someday...\\" prepares us for War Machine, and the terrorist organization that captures Stark--the Ten Rings--is an obvious reference to The Mandarin...     But this movie ultimately is made...because Jon Favreau knew more than the bloggers when it came to casting Tony Stark.  He went with Robert Downey Jr, and because of that, \\"Iron Man\\" works...  AND THEN SOME.
0446607274|4.0|Bosch was in a very bad place when he received the call-out.  He was anxiously waiting for his wife, or at least a call from her - she had disappeared again.  She was going back to the gambling and going away from him and he didn't know what to do to help her, to bring her back.  Then he gets the call.  It wasn't his team's turn in rotation - in fact, where he was told to go wasn't even within their jurisdiction - Angel's Flight, a short train hop up and down a steep hill, was within the RHD purview.  However, it was Irvin Irving on the phone and he brooked no arguments, nor questions - he merely said to come and to bring Harry's partners.<br /><br />The crime would tear the flimsy bandages L.A. had put on over the gaping wounds left by the Rodney King beating, by the O.J. Simpson trial - it would tear those flimsy bandages right off.  Howard Elias - the victim - made his living by continually picking at those bandages - by suing the L.A.P.D. whenever he could, by keeping the race card constantly on the table and continually stirring the cauldron of racial strife - all so he could make enough money to keep his opulent lifestyle.  It was pretty much assumed from the beginning that there was a high chance someone associated with law enforcement in L.A. had done this; however, all stones were to be kicked over.  While investigating the murder, Bosch discovered that Elias had a source within the L.A.P.D. - someone highly placed who could get sensitive information to Elias - information that was not supposed to be provided, information that was supposed to be kept confidential.  He also discovered that this source had, right before the killing, suddenly decided to stop providing information.<br /><br />Filled with the blood of the innocent - and not-so-innocent - this book was dark and disturbing to read.  And I really, really enjoyed it.  This sort of story is why Connelly has been such a success over the years; he can write some great noir fiction.  If you are a fan of noir, Bosch, or Connelly, be sure not to miss this installment of the series.or Connelly, be sure not to miss this installment of the series.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Is it perfect? No. Is it remastered? No. But it is perfectly watchable. I had never actually seen the original theatrical version, so it was nice to see Han shoot first. I have ordered this version of the other two movies.    After reading some of the reviews here, I was expecting something horrible. But it wasn't horrible, it was good. Not great, but good. I watched it on a 26\\" widescreen TV with the DVD in an XBOX 360. The 360 had a view option that I could choose so that it filled up the whole screen without any letterboxing or cutting off of the edges. Don't know if normal DVD players have that kind of option, but I would recommend checking to see if yours does.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|This review focuses on the DVD box set- simply put, Blade Runner is one of the best and most influential Sci-Fi movies of all time. If you need a more thorough review, you can check elsewhere as there are many others.<br /><br />As for this boxed set, this is simply the best-ever printing of Blade Runner yet made. The primary things you get:<br /><br />-All prints of the movie. From the original theatrical release (with the narration), to the new \\"Final Cut\\", you get every major take on the movie ever released. Each print also has an introduction from Ridley Scott, where he spends a couple minutes talking about what's unique to the specific print, and what that print happened.<br />-A ton of special features. From the original featurettes made decades ago to the new \\"Dangerous Days\\"- a massive look at every aspect of the film that fills an entire DVD on its own, and is well worth watching if you're a deep enough fan to wade though it all.<br />-The film (the \\"Final Cut\\" version) has 3 commentaries of varying natures, from Ridley Scott who talks mostly about budgets and his craft, to the special effects people who talk more about fellowship on the set and go light on technical bits. All of the commentaries are worth hearing for various reasons.<br /><br />On the \\"Final Cut\\"- Love it or hate it, this is the version of the film Ridley Scott had always wanted to make but that studios never allowed him to. There is no narration, there is the more melancholoy ending instead of the happy ending from the theatrical release, and best of all a few scenes that before had some technical errors have been remastered. Unlike other recent revisits, the director hasn't added in CG dewbacks or replaced puppets with computerized monstrocities- real technical errors like overly obvious stunt doubles were corrected as they should have been.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this movie, this set contains everything you've ever wanted. It contains your favorite print of the film (regardless of what print that ends up being- they're all here). It contains so much behind the scenes material that they had to split it between several DVDs. There are even details down to screen tests included- this set has everything. Get it today.all here).

0375701427|2.0|Meet the ideal American golden boy, Swede, an all-star, perfectly moral glove-making icon who has everything: wealth, health, and talent.  Swede has quaint American dreams: a beauty pageant wife, an oak tree with a tire swing, and a healthy, beaming child to swing on it.  His dream is sullied, however, when that child -- a stuttering girl named Merry (irony!) -- turns into a political terrorist who goes around bombing post offices.  What do you do when your hopes are torn between idealistic paternal love on the one hand, and irrational rage on the other?<br /><br />It's obvious that Philip Roth, when writing AMERICAN PASTORAL, had [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] in mind.  The themes are almost the same, even if the execution is a tad different.  Charles Baxter, in his book of essays, [[ASIN:1555974732 The Art of Subtext]], states that when you have an obssessive and mentally unhinged central character, it is best to have a narrator who can view things from the outside.  [[ASIN:0142437247 Moby Dick]] has Ishmael.  THE GREAT GATSBY has Nick Carraway.  AMERICAN PASTORAL has Skip Zuckerman.<br /><br />Wait a minute.  No, it doesn't.<br /><br />One of the greatest flaws of Roth's Pulitzer Prize winning novel is that Roth wisely takes up the utensil of the buffering narrator, only to immediately discard it.  Skip begins the Swede's story, telling the tale of disillusionment from a distance, but then Skip disappears and never comes back.  The result is jarring and uneven.  And, even worse, it serves to underscore every other unnecessary element to the book.<br /><br />My guess is that this novel won the Pulitzer for two reasons.  First, the prize was more in honor of Roth's body of work than in response to this particular tome.  Second, the book, in spite of its glaring flaws, is unmistakably authentic and pure.  Roth's writing is clear and unblinking, and every detail is so well-fitted, it reads like the script to a documentary.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this wholesale honesty also kills the book.  Roth's PASTORAL is about five times the size of Fitzgerald's GATSBY, but it is only 1/10th as powerful.  Roth is not trying to tell any kind of linear, plot-driven tale.  This is very much an analysis of American culture, it is a 423 page question about the nature of love and ideals, it is a portrait of a God-Among-Men who must find the wherewithal to deal with the Hellish Spawn he has given rise to.<br /><br />The idea is brilliant, and if it weren't for the excruciating and maddening amount of detail and despair in the novel, there'd be a lot here worth poring over.  Unfortunately, Roth spends so much time authenticating his novel with extraneous facts and mullings that there is far too much to wade through before you actually get to the good bits.  Swede despairs and whines and bites his nails for pages and pages and pages while people lie to him, take advantage of him, and listen to him explain every single facet of glove making.<br /><br />Never before have I felt so much like slapping every single character in a book.  Halfway through the novel I bemoaned the loss of Skip.  Where was this dull but at least relatable and grounded narrator that had begun the story?  Nowhere to be found.  Instead, there is Swede, wondering, over and over, what's to be done.  What's to be done?<br /><br />And guess what's to be done?  Nothing at all.  At the start of the novel you learn that the Swede has a new family, a new wife, new kids, a new direction.  He has fashioned, finally, at least a semblance of the American dream, a mask to cover his first failed attempt.  The bulk of the novel is about that failed attempt, but you NEVER learn the steps or details that engendered that massive change from Disasterous Daughter to New Fake Life.  This is a change that you would imagine would be worth examining, this is a process that is at least as interesting as the destruction that preceeded it.  Roth, it seems, disagrees with that.<br /><br />Endingsare hard, hard stuff, even for Pulitzer Prize winners, but this is the weakest of the weak endings.  Most good books end in two ways.  They either simply fold off the conflict and close the curtains, or they pass the story off to the reader to finish for themselves.  Roth opts for the latter, hoping that the mountains of ruminating malarky that preceded it will be enough to encourage some serious consideration.  It doesn't work.  Instead, it feels like an aborted cop-out, a cheap parting shot, a record having its stylus ripped angrily across the grooves.<br /><br />All wind and no sails, AMERICAN PASTORAL is moving on several levels, but those levels push against each other, so that no movement happens at all.  Read it for the beautiful prose, but expect the last page to be the literary equivalent of having a door slammed in your face.  And then maybe you will do as I did: cry out for Skip to help make sense of it all.are hard, hard stuff, even for Pulitzer Prize winners, but this is the weakest of the weak endings.

B00164KYS2|5.0|Okay, I have read a number of reviews that keep talking about how women of all ages, AND gay men will make this a big hit!  However, it seems that Straight Guys won't and can't enjoy this feature?  In fact, here's a quote excerpted from a National Review:  \\"No, \\"Sex and the City\\" may not be for everyone. Straight guys are likely only to see this film under pain of death from their significant others.\\" My question is, what Straight Guy wouldn't want to see 4 Beautiful Women, 3 in their early 40's (A woman's prime age I think -- in my 30's I was always dating older women into their 40's -- women 35 and up are AWESOME -- they know what they want and they're pretty much secure in themselves) and one, Ms. Cattrall who is currently a stunning 51, in a movie that addresses a little bit of everything?  It's an intelligent comedy about relationships that BOTH men and women can obviously learn from.  I went with my fiance and THOROUGHLY enjoyed it!  Needless to say, maybe I just could understand the premise situations a bit more being 44 myself, and visting NYC often, having grown up in the Metro area.  Nevertheless, here's one VERY Straight GUY who watched the entire series on HBO, and then eagerly anticipated the movie!  Quite Honestly, it was 2 stars above the new Indiana Jones, and one over Iron Man.  I'm assuming that the Dark Knight will be a tie with this movie in my mind by summer's end (I'm guessing both 5 stars, but coming from completely different directions).  I don't see a sequel coming for Sex and the City, nor is one necessary, it ended just perfectly.  I will be buying the DVD.

It was an enjoyable and insightful read and completely recharged my writing. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. I highly recommend this book to writers and aspiring writers.

B0016IV2G6|2.0|Wow...hmmm...uh...<br /><br />I love Michael Kiske...I really do.  I've got literally every single thing he's ever done, with every single artist he's ever worked with.  This will not go down on his highlight reel.<br /><br />His voice is still literally amazing, but in this stripped down set, it almost sounds irritating at times...and I really hate to say that.<br /><br />First of all, the songs that he has chosen to redo here are far from his best.  And the manner in which they are redone, just doesn't work.  Everything is so slow, so dull, so lacking.<br /><br />Secondly, the instrumental side to this offering is seriously a one trick pony.  It sounds like the guitarist is continuously strumming the same chords over and over.  It's just downright boring, and after one listen, I think it's going in the rack for a long sleep.<br /><br />It's a known fact that Kiske has changed in recent years.  He's been very open about how he feels about music.  His last solo release was very mellow for sure, but still offered interesting and \\"nice\\" melodies...songs you could relax to, and enjoy for what they are.  This is not the case here.<br /><br />I honestly feel terrible writing this negative review, but I don't see how I could really say anything else.  Kiske's contributions with Avantasia, Tribuzy, and everything else he's guested on prove that somewhere deep inside, the man is still there and able to bring it like no one else.  But this is another story completely.<br /><br />If it wasn't Michael Kiske, I'd give it zero or one star, but for one of my all time favorite vocalists, I'll throw out the obligatory two stars, and call it good.<br /><br />I can only hope that he rethinks what he's doing and in the future gives us what we've been waiting so many years to hear.

This book is no different from the rest of his books which are what I like to call adventure books with a touch of X Files.  This one takes us all around the world to Istanbul, Hormuz Island, Cambodia, and Christmas Island in Indonesia.  The action is explosive as usual.  But this book goes deeper into the Gray Pierce family dynamics.  In addition, Grays relationship with Seichan is very intersting.  And what happens with Monk is not exactly clear.  The addition of Kowalski added some nice humor as well.  I had forgotten him as a funny character in Ice Hunt as well.  Great book as usual.  Can't wait for The Last Oracle.
B000000OU0|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan and you enjoy Acoustic guitar over blasting electric... then their come back album/video is right for you. I bought both CD and DVD for obvious reasons.

0517223546|5.0|The author writes in a style very similar to James Michener; a saga spread across centuries.  Easy to read, a good book for cold winter days in front of a warm fire.
0156034026|3.0|My book club recently read the book in hopes that it would be provide some real insight from an 'Americanized' Muslim.  However we generally agreed 1) the 'fundamentalist' aspect, as in spiritual/religious content or motives, was virtually non existent (unless you count growing a beard); 2) the protagonist's 'rejection of America was flimsy (based on a couple contrived experiences) and motives unconvincing; 3) the device used by the author (revealing his most intimate feelings to an voiceless American stranger in a public cafe) was unrealistic.    On a positive note, the book was a pretty easy read (178 pages) and we learned some of the culture, language, food, and customs of Lahore.
B0014YVC6W|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is fun, clever, action packed and makes you feel good.  I was so excited when I saw there was a Blu-ray version - but what a disappointment.  It isn't any better than a standard DVD - doesn't fill the width of my HD TV.  I have looked at the specs on the case and can find no way to tell this BEFORE I buy.  Any help here?  Or did I get a bad disk? It would be most helpful to have this information available in the product description.
B0014KD46W|5.0|This is simply a great CD. More Traffic like than some of his recent CD's. Great musicianship as always, these tunes rock. They are longer songs which adds to the great feel of this CD. Simply great music!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|The sweeper is great for fast cleanups on carpeting, as in rug under dining table.  New batteries cost something like $12 or so, the only drawback.  I have two, which I keep for those special places where it would be troublesome to use broom or vacuum -- oft-traveled paths, around kitchen counters, etc.  Stores in practically no space at all; I keep them in pantry and bedroom closet against wall, sweeper compacts itself against handle.
B000002KCC|4.0|Raw Neil Young from the height of the 70's. If you listened to it on vinyl you'll remember how real it felt at the time. Neil sort of fades in and out vocally as if he's distracted, preoccupied, wasted. Heavy druggie music that simply is what it is. A classic well worth having but it isn't for everyone. It's damn good though!
B0018RKELY|4.0|You gotta wonder what Billie Joe Armstrong's older siblings were listening to during his formative years... what '60's gems pervaded his subconscious mind, because this CD hearkens back to classic AM radio tunes.  It's fun to listen to the songs, play \\"Name That Tune\\" and identify the groups and hits to which Green Day pays tribute: from the Rascals and the Yardbirds to the Monkees and the Raiders, and everyone in between. While the guitar and drum work is spot-on, Dirnt's bass work is notably superior to the original genre.  Armstrong is undoubtedly one of the cleverest hook-writers of our generation.  When you tire of playing \\"Name That Tune,\\" just imagine the career he could have had as an advertising jingle writer.  (Move over, Barry Manilow -- Strychnine Twitch is here!) Geez!
B000NOKERM|5.0|I decided to buy this special edition to replace my cassette tape of 1987 (U.S. Version) from 20 some years ago.  This turned out to be  such an excellent replacement.  Comes with so much more than just the remastered album.  I particularly enjoyed the DVD and 2 additional tracks from the originally released European version of the album.  The other reviewer said DVD wouldn't work for US region, but it played fine on my standard JVC $100 DVD player.  I highly recommend this special edition, especially, if you don't already own their recent releases such as Live in the shadow of the blues CD or Live in the Still of the Night DVD.
0385340567|2.0|As a big Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan, I'm sorry to say I was thoroughly disappointed by Nothing to Lose.  I found the plot to be repetitive and dull, the villains lame, and the ending and politics to be out-of-character for Reacher.  Nobody's perfect, so I will definitely be back for the next book and hope that this one was just an anomaly in an otherwise terrific run of books.
0316143472|2.0|I read the critics' reviews on this book and picked it up without a moment's hesitation. Once I'd reached page 50, I realized something. This book isn't funny. Now, I'm not one who looks for laughing out loud when I read a book. Intelligent humor, like the kind I believe Douglas Adams provided, is always my preference. I didn't go into this read looking for the equivalent of a stand-up routine, but I found that, while Sedaris' narrative is well constructed and delivered, what it delivers is no more than a story you would expect to find on a Saturday afternoon movie on some local channel. I found the story to be slow and not at all enthralling. I don't intend to insult the author nor his previous works, but I feel like I traded in $17 for a story I'd beg relatives not to retell for the millionth time. Granted, I've not finished this book. If I am wrong, I apologize. However, if after 50 pages the author cannot captivate me, I can't see the point in finishing their novel; especially when there are so many other books to read! All in all, I was very disappointed. That's just one man's opinion, though.
B000NQDC1A|4.0|... since the recordings are primarily examples of the instruments discussed in the extremely informative 90 page book that originally came with the LP version. Luckily, used copies of the book are available separately (though some of those are quite pricey).
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|This movie is one of the most God-awful portrayals of Tudor history I have ever seen. It even beats out \\"The Tudors\\" in it's inaccuracies and outright fictionalizations.<br /><br />They completely miss the mark on the time-line, the ages of the characters; they skim over important events, they portray main characters falsely - in short, they totally screw up this movie. If you are going to do an historical film, you should make it as true to history as possible.<br /><br />The historical truth of Henry VIII, Anne and Mary is much more compelling and fascinating than this tripe. If you want to see a more factual adaptation, watch \\"Anne of a Thousand Days\\".<br /><br />The ONLY good things I can say about this movie are the costuming is gorgeous and the acting is well done.
0393061310|5.0|Pulling together research from a wide variety of fields, Diamond sets out to answer the question of why civilization as we know it developed and flourished in some parts of the world, while other areas were left behind.    The gist: it's all about the geography. In order for civilization to develop, people have to be living in large groups, with food plentiful enough so that some people can be spared from the business of survival to specialize in organization and crafts. In order for that to happen, they must have agriculture and livestock. In order to have agriculture and livestock, they must have either native animals that are domesticable or trading opportunities to obtain them. In other words, it all comes down to where they started from.    I admit to a little hesitation before I chose this book. I read through several reviews, and quite a few reviewers claimed it promoted the concept of racial superiority, and I really didn't want to end up reading several hundred pages of racist propaganda. Still, the majority of the reviews were positive, and there were also quite a few negative reviews complaining that it overlooked the racial factors, so I was intrigued enough by the question to give it a try.    Guns, Germs, and Steel is decidedly not racist propaganda. Diamond bends over backward to ensure that it's not, and even raises the very intriguing question of who's actually smarter--the westerner with the comfortable lifestyle or the jungle native who has to depend on his own knowledge and judgment for survival.    What I enjoyed most about the book was how thorough it was, putting together... well, I was going to say all the pieces of the puzzle, but when it comes to human history, that's just not possible--but enough of the puzzle to see the big picture, rather than just the small segments you get by focusing on a single discipline. It's not enough to describe, for example, how the development of language affected civilization--it's put into perspective alongwith all the other developments happening at the same time.
B00000JPH6|5.0|After watching this movie many times I wanted to have it on DVD. I was debating if I should get this version or the Limited Edition, but I read through another review that the limited edition didn't offer many extras, and for the price isn't worth it. This DVD is great, and at a cheap price, a must have for fans of this classic movie. Also there is a sequel coming out in a few years so it's a great time to refresh yourself on the world of the Dark Crystal.
B000002MP2|5.0|I remember hearing this cd way back when I was in fifth grade and I still listen to it once in awhile. Its far from there best cd but contain the classic tracks Longview, Welcome to Paradise, Basket Case, and When I Come around. The whole cd flows well and I recommend it to anyone who likkes music. Its too bad they started the whole crappy pop punk scene we have now.    By the way, Longview is one of the greatest songs not only of the 90's but of all time.
B000002OX7|5.0|Every one can argue back and forth on the Who's greatest album.  But this album goes sooooo far beyond that.  This album is one of the few fundamental pillars that define rock and roll.  Its place belongs right between Sgt Pepper and Led Zeppelin IV.  Any one who does not get that is musically illiterate.  Period.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|Great movie.  Good dialogue and intricate plot.  Sometimes had to rewind because I didn't catch everything.  You have to pay attention.
0440229081|3.0|Some people may find some kind of message in these books, but I've read Clay and now Skellig by this author and the quantity of religion in those books is very annoying, plus I'm an atheist. Maybe religious people will appreciate more the book, anyway there are passages in which religion is not mentioned that are entertaining.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I had no idea what this film was about. I was absolutely stunned by the acting, the storyline, the direction, the background music and even Dustin Hoffman's little cameo. This film is about 150 minutes and yet is worth every bit of it. I would compare this film with greats like Prestige, Passion of the Christ, Amadeus and maybe even American Beauty. I compare it with Amadeus because of the setting, the extraordinary sets, with Prestige because of how effective and tactful the film-making is - unpredictable. Why I compare it with Passion of the Christ and maybe even Apocalypto because of the crime & punishment factor. It is American Beautyish because the central character goes through certain varied self-absorbed emotions to get what he wants. And then the character sees nothing but he wants and what he must do both in and out of order.<br /><br />I do not know why people didn't like the film. I'm happy some didn't get it. I am now looking forward to reading the book. I will not bother recommending this film to people who I think won't like it, simply because this is a film only to be appreciated by someone worthy of understanding it's craft and poignance. I loved the first one hour, hardly any dialogues, the film was amazingly easy to follow. The last thirty minutes had me so gripped that I felt a bit emotional out of the sheery beauty the central character brings out.<br /><br />The Perfume is a film about survival, faith and hobby. Three cheers and much respect for the makers.
B000002U8G|5.0|I saw this on sale and I thought to myself, I'll come back again and if it's still there, I think I'll get it. It was and I did. And let me tell you, reader, it's great. This '71 release doesn't sound dated, and it stands up strong to Led Zeppelin IV and Who's Next, among others. It's just as good as DSOTM and WYWH. Go get it, and there's no need to get hight to it.
0316067601|3.0|This would've been a better book without the entire first half. Far too much time is devoted to subjects that have been covered many times (\\"The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228\\" for example provides an in-depth narrative on SEAL training.)     The second half of the book is highly dramatic and, at times, touching. Still, my overall impression of the book is that it offers too much testosterone and not enough insight. Which is a shame because there are enough truly compelling passages to make you realize what a great book it could have been.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|A must buy for anyone who likes Kung-Fu movies.  Stephen Chow is at his best, the movies is easy to follow-even though it is subtitled.  I found myself laughing through most of the movie, a strange combination of humor and artistic approaches.  A must buy.  The blu-ray transfer is top-notch for picture and sound as well.
0618680004|3.0|I find myself thinking \\"How am I supposed to review a book written by someone who is smarter than I am?\\"<br /><br />So instead of doing what most people do -- instead of attacking his arguments -- let me talk about the book's structure, style and flow.<br /><br />Which is to say, there is some.  Dawkins first explains his position.  He then outlines his intended goal, and how he intends to get there.  He tackles each argument for the existence of god with a counter-argument based on essentially the same thing every time.  I call it the \\"my position isn't as logically bad as your position\\" method.  In other words, he admits that he has no proof god does not exist.  His only support for his argument for atheism is the unlikelihood of god's existence in terms of probability.<br /><br />Essentially, Dawkins is saying \\"I'm better than theists because my belief is more believable\\".<br /><br />Which, to me, is not worth wrapping hundreds of pages around.  So I found the book to be a bore after the first 5 chapters or so.  He could've distilled the salient points of the book into a single essay.  And for that, it gets 3 stars, which I feel is generous.
B00136JOVG|5.0|Everything you could want from his long career history of music is here.    Definitely 'essential'! Highly recommended!
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|On first listen, I was struck at the melancholy tones, slow pace, and darker lyrics. But as I listened more the music was enjoyable. When in a mellow mood. Some say the music is depressing, I don't find it so at all. But I suppose it depends on what you listen to music for, is it uplifting? Motivating? Nah, I certainly wouldn't use this music to exercise to, but to work to, commute, or just listen, I find it more and more enjoyable...
B00008YJHC|5.0|This is not the top of the Pixies lineup, but it's still better than 99% of the music out there.  Best songs are \\"The Happening,\\" \\"Rock Music,\\" \\"Dig for Fire\\" and \\"Velouria.\\"  This album has a more pop feel than most Pixies, which I think just shows their versatility as a band. . . one of the reasons they were so good is that they really knew how to change it up, and their different albums evidence that.  The best of the Pixies in my humble opinion would be \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and then \\"Come on Pilgrim.\\"  Also awesome is \\"Doolittle,\\" which gets a lot of hype, but for good reason.
B00005JPFH|5.0|If you have seen the first two prequels of the Amazing Spiderman, then prepare yourself for a sequel treat. This time, we visit the life of Peter Parker (Tobey MaGuire) as he believes his secret life as the web-swing hero of New York is finally becoming manageable and hopes to improve on it. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has accepted her role as the web-winger's fiancé, and is preparing her own success story as a Broadway singer. Peter's best friend Harry Osborn and son of the late Green Goblin (James Franco) however, is slowly succumbing to the 'voices' of his father. In addition, there are two new villains, The Sandman (Thomas Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) who are destined to challenged and threaten the Spiderman. If that is not enough, a strange and powerful Symbiote life force arrives from outer space to ensure that Parker's life becomes anything but happy. If you enjoyed the Special Effects of the first two films, you are in for an astonishing visual surprise as this 3rd movie multiples everything you've come to expect. Stan Lee would be proud to be an integral part of the life of his creation. Nuff, said. ****
0316776963|5.0|only a quarter the way through it but so far its a hit and right on.
B001ATNPCK|5.0|This album is easily the best offspring album produced since the 90s, making it to my top three, (Smash, Ixnay, R&F R&G)The first 4 songs are absolutely dope, drawing from their original punk style and throwing in a little new extra sauce.     Their ballad type songs are incredible as well, with Fix You being one of my favorites already, which is strange considering it goes in a completely different direction from the offspring norm, even from the offspring pop norm.    From start to finish there isnt a song that i feel the need to skip, with all of them giving me that warm fuzzy feeling i get when i hear a quality song. Its been a long time since I've gotten that feeling from an entire album, even longer so for an Offspring album, but with their 8th album they've done it!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We'll keep buying from Amazon because the prices are much better, but there are printable on-line instuctions, hints & free variations from the game's inventor available (including rules & pieces you can print & paste on cardboard) at Mayfair Games. There are also some variations from some other people, but at my house we're going to stick with the inventor's versions because his seemed better. Making the new pieces is how I spent my lunch break today. It's not too hard to get the right size & color if you scan the blowup of the piece (which will be way too big) & then downsize & adjust the color with the scanner program.  We played the game with my new volcano piece this evening.    We would easily give it all 5 stars, except it would be nice if the carboard were a little thicker or laminated. I do like the wood pieces. They're like the OLD Monoply houses.    If anyone remember the Bookshelf Games that were popular in the late 60's & early 70's, (yes, you really can be that old & still like board games)this is like a cross of the best parts of Feudal, Stocks & Bonds, & Acquire. Those games gave two transplanted Texas something to do during 3 long & very cold Wisconsin winters 30-some years ago, but this game has the best elements of each of those.    I played the trial of this game on-line & enjoyed it, so I bought the board game to play with my son & daughter-in-law. It's long, but not too long. We all like it very much, even though so far my son wins almost always. We are making it harder for him to win as we work out our own stragedy. The cool thing is, every game layout is different, so every time we play it's really a fresh start. We invited a neighbor to play yesterday. At first she looked bored & confused, but after the first game she happily stayed for the second round & when that was over, she said she'd like to play again soon. Suprisingly, playing with four took less time than playing with three, even though we stopped several times to explain the game.Yesterday I ordered the combination of fish, river, & extra cards to have more choices & we're anxiously waiting for them to arrive. It looks like I'm going to have to get the expansions as soon as my budget allows since other family members have asked when they can play. Anyway, I think it's a great family game for about age 10 & up, depending on the child's ability & attention span. A kid who can sit still for a while to read a book and who has some mathematical ability could play as well as an adult, but it's took long & involved for the kids who can only sit still for a fast action video game. That's my best Grandma type advice, anyway.    Happy settling!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|You have Anne, poor little Anne she is looked over mistreated and ignored by her own family, even though she gave up the man that she loved for them.  This movie has rich and lush visuals, to me this it the best of all the Jane Austen, in my mind I could never decide who I love most, Captain Wentworth, Colonel Brandon or Mr. Darcy.  Oh, I have tried to pick but its impossible.  Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne the first time I read it, I just cried, when I see it in this film, I remember very well being that fourteen year old who was awkward and shy and identified so closely with Anne.  Oh, if you have a romantic bone in your body, you will adore it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am sad to say that I have not read the book and currently unable to due to personal reasons, but would one day love to enjoy that privilege as David McCullough is by far this Century's most influential, important, and provocative historians in my opinion and it is also in my opinion that anything with his pen should become required reading at least in our public schools possibly replacing some of the tired and repetitive history books of today if not within our colleges and universities.<br /><br />That being said, this masterpiece within a mini-series is simply magnificent.  The actors that were chosen for this are incredible and reflect the true spirit of the great heroes upon whose shoulder we stand upon today.<br /><br />Much of what is salvaged and known about John Adams comes from the many correspondences between him and his wife Abigail, played by Laura Linney, who is revealed as his most important and revered confidant and the only person in the entire world who truly knew him and could give him his much needed courage and confidence in the daily face of tyranny, corruption, and deception most of which came from people who called themselves his friends and allies.<br /><br />[NEXT PARAGRAPH MAY CONTAIN POSSIBLE SPOILERS]<br />Both Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney express convincingly the love that John and Abigail Adams had for each other and the true nature of which John had truly needed from his wife in order to face his trials.  While Abigail indeed offered her gentle and loving embrace to an often fragile and uncertain man, her honesty despite the cost of his pride often saved John from many near fatal mistakes from which had he proceeded without her counsel would not have been able to return from.  Thus making it very clear that whether near of far, this important bond despite at times separated by thousands of miles of oceans, was in many ways responsible for keeping our fledgling country together.<br /><br />And John Adams himself as revealed by David McCullough made me identify with a common everyday man who gets dropped into the middle of something that ends up at times to be much bigger than he is, or at least, bigger that he is ready for.  There were so many times that I had to simply stop the Tivo and wait a day to watch it again, that's how well the character was played that I truly identified with this man and the trials he faced, especially when he had to face them alone.<br /><br />Personally, I believe this story as portrayed is one of the best American stories every delivered.  I say this only because I personally believe, from what I took away, that it is truly a story about America and what it means to be an American.  Simply it defines loyalty, not to any government or person, but to an ideal, to \\"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\\"h a common everyday man who gets dropped into the middle of something that ends up at times to be much bigger than he is, or at least, bigger that he is ready for.

B001794FOK|4.0|I went into watching this movie with lowered expectations.  After all, this film didn't do all that well in theatres, and from information I had read/heard, the film itself was started and stopped and then restarted again with virtually everything about the film changing in the process.  Basically I expected it to be a bit of a train wreck that likely couldn't live up to the relatively neat promise of the main premise: the star character was someone that found he had the ability to teleport anywhere instantly.<br /><br />Pleasantly enough the movie doesn't do a bad job in delivering a fun ride.  Sure enough, the star does have the ability to teleport anywhere but his ability comes with potential consequences as there are people who believe that no one should have the power and ability that he, or others like him, has and those people will stop at nothing to permanently stop 'jumpers'.<br /><br />Hayden Christensen plays the lead role here with Samuel L. Jackson (with bright white hair) playing the leader of the opposing side.  Christensen does well enough in his role, and Samuel L. Jackson delivers a solid enough performance as well.  Add in reasonable performances from the supporting cast, mix with some action and adventure in the form of good vs. evil fight scenes set in exotic locations and you get a movie that does a reasonable job delivering on the responsibility of being entertaining.  No it's not academy award type stuff, but it's good enough.  Were half star ratings possible, it'd be 3.5 for me.  Without the half star rating system, I'm rounding up to 4 stars.<br /><br />Picture on the Blu-ray disc looks quite nice.  The movie is relatively short, with a somewhat family friendly PG-13 rating which seems mostly related to the action and violence in the fight scenes (and perhaps a little related to a scene that finds the female lead stripping her shirt off...) Little or no objectionable language.<br /><br />Turn your brain off a bit going in and you should find Jumper reasonably entertaining.  Certainly worth a viewing via rental, though thanks to a load of extras, the Blu-ray package isn't a bad purchase..

B00172MAO4|4.0|Music: 5 stars.... Compilation: 3 stars<br /><br />When Radiohead decided with the \\"In Rainbows\\" album not to re-up with EMI, it was only a matter of time before the label would squeeze a few more drops out of the money machine that Radiohead was for EMI. The label simply had to find a good time and excuse to do so, and that time has come now (new tour!). The band has made clear that it has nothing to do with this \\"best of\\", all the while also acknowledging that EMI has the legal right to do this. Now the question is: is this compilation any good?<br /><br />\\"The Best of Radiohead: Special Edition\\" (2 CDs, 30 tracks, 135 min.) is a very generous overview of Radiohead's best songs from the 7 albums it recorded for EMI. CD1 (17 tracks; 76 min.) brings the \\"greatest hits\\", and hence not surprisingly focuses on tracks from three albums: a whopping 6 tracks from 1995's commercial breakthrough album \\"The Bends\\", including the singles Just, My Iron Lung, High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, and Street Spirit (Fade Out) and also the fabulous title track. 1997's \\"OK Computer\\" album, viewed by many as one of the most important albums of the 90s, gets 4 tracks, including the singles Paranoid Android, Karma Police, No surprises, and also Lucky. 2000's so-called experimental \\"Kid A\\" album gets 3 tracks: Optimistic, Idioteque, and Everything In Its Right Place. With that, 75% of this \\"best of\\" compilation is filled. The remaining 3 studio albums get a mere 4 tracks: the monster hit Creep from 1993's \\"Pablo Honey\\"; Pyramid Song from 2001's \\"Amnesiac; and finally There There and 2+2=5 from 2004's \\"Hail to the Thief\\".<br /><br />CD2 (14 tracks, 63 min.) brings deeper tracks from the various albums, and is just slightly more of a headscratcher to me than CD1. There are 2 singles that didn't make CD1 (Knives Out from \\"Amnesiac\\" and Go to Sleep from \\"Hail to the Thief\\"), and after that it's a bit all over the place: You and Anyone Can Play Guitar From \\"Pablo Honey\\"; Planet Telex from \\"The Bends\\" plus Talk Show Host, a B side of that era; Airbag, Let Down and Exit Music (For a Film) from \\"OK Computer\\"; The National Anthem and How To Disappear Completely from \\"Kid A\\"; I Might Be Wrong, You and Whose Army, and Knives Out from \\"Amnesiac\\"; and even the live mini-album \\"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\\" is represented with \\"True Love Waits\\". Note that this Japanese release includes You and Whose Army, not included on the US or European release.<br /><br />In all, while it is always possible to split hairs and argue over the selection of the tracks, it is difficult to be upset with the final result. EMI actually did a pretty good job of it! I will say that I am not crazy with the sequencing of the album. I would have preferred a chronological sequencing, for one. Notice that on CD1 the 3 tracks from \\"Kid A\\" are scattered and buried in the second half for some reason. For anyone not all that familiar with Radiohead, if you are wondering whether to buy this, or to buy the single CD, I would urge to buy the single CD compilation. If you like what you hear there, the next step is to explore the individual studio albums of Radiohead. I have no idea to whom the 2CD Special Edition is marketed to, to be honest. The causal Radiohead fan doesn't need that much and the rabbit Radiohead fan already has all of this. But the music is fantastic, let there be not doubt about it.w Host, a B side of that era; Airbag, Let Down and Exit Music (For a Film) from \\"OK Computer\\"; The National Anthem and How To Disappear Completely from \\"Kid A\\"; I Might Be Wrong, You and Whose Army, and Knives Out from \\"Amnesiac\\"; and even the live mini-album \\"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\\" is represented with \\"True Love Waits\\".

I will say that I am not crazy with the sequencing of the album. I would have preferred a chronological sequencing, for one. Notice that on CD1 the 3 tracks from \\"Kid A\\" are scattered and buried in the second half for some reason. For anyone not all that familiar with Radiohead, if you are wondering whether to buy this, or to buy the single CD, I would urge to buy the single CD compilation. If you like what you hear there, the next step is to explore the individual studio albums of Radiohead. I have no idea to whom the 2CD Special Edition is marketed to, to be honest. The causal Radiohead fan doesn't need that much and the rabbit Radiohead fan already has all of this. But the music is fantastic, let there be not doubt about it.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|What a concept- a movie centering on a woman whose chief concern for a mate would be his character!  Amazing in this shallow world!  Of course it did take her quite a while to figure him out.  I recommended this movie to all my kids and neices and nephews, especially the unmarried ones- since some of the sense of focusing their search for a mate should be to find one who is a truly responsible, kind and loving and this movie is bound to rub off on them as they watch.  Everyone who saw the movie absolutely loved it.  Deliciously romantic! Can't praise it enough!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|My biggest worry, when I learned that Guy Sigsworth would be producing the album, was whether Alanis would, indeed, still \\"rock.\\"  With Guy Sigsworth, a man known for his work with Björk, Frou Frou and the occasional Madonna/Britney Spears song, I was afraid we'd have an album of electronica that lost what made Alanis...well, Alanis.  I'm glad that I was wrong.    Flavors of Entanglement opens with a familiar Alanis song, \\"Citizen of the Planet,\\" that espouses the virtues of identifying not with the country you live but to embrace the world as a whole, blooms into a bass-heavy chorus that rocks like anything she's written.  But it's the tiny little flourishes and the electronic additions that makes it feel fresh.      Things continue on this pace, moving into \\"Straitjacket,\\" a song that's probably my favorite for not only its lyrics but for its swirling electronics.  It seems ironic that the songs I like best are the ones that utilize Alanis' innate rock sensibilities, but spins them through a techno/electronic sheen.  But it's the truth.  Then we have \\"Versions of Violence,\\" which further spirals and teases but also interweaves careful lyrics about violence, both hidden and seen.      Things slow down for the beautiful (and heart-breaking) \\"Not as We.\\"  Here is where you can recognize Alanis' sometimes awkward lyrics that, for whatever reason, work in the context of the song:  \\"From scratch begin again / but this time I as I / And not as we\\" sounds awkward when written, but in the context of the song works beautifully.      These are probably some of my favorite songs on the album, but I have to say there's not one on here that I don't like.  Truthfully, all the songs seem familiar and typical Alanis lyrics/themes.  In \\"Not as We,\\" I feel hints of \\"Simple Together.\\"  From \\"Incomplete,\\" I feel the longing wish that one day everything will be okay, a la \\"That I Would Be Good.\\"  With \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man,\\" there's \\"Head Over Feet\\"'s praise of a man who treats people right.  She writes these songs because she's good at them; she's masterful at taking her own life's experiences (as in \\"Not as We,\\" for example) and, while making it a fiercely personal song, making them universal.      The difference, though, between this CD and a lot of her post-Jagged Little Pill CDs, is that Flavors of Entanglement feels honed to a perfect shine.  While going over sometimes familiar territory, this album is full of masterpieces.  Instead of taking away, Guy Sigsworth's production only adds to everything I've enjoyed about Alanis, taking her in different directions.  One song even sounds like it could be on a Dido album (\\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\").  In a career that's seen a few ups and a few downs, Flavors of Entanglement probably wouldn't win over any of her staunch critics, but it did renew my interest and reminded me why I loved her music.  Definitely a must buy.
1416550518|5.0|I could not put down this great read.  It is set in a fascinating time that paralels \\"Upstairs, Downstairs,\\" the late Edwardian era through the 1920's.  A tableau of interesting characters set up against a rapidly changing scenario.  Romance, intrigues and lots of questions.  Does it get any better?  Read this book!
B00005JKGK|5.0|Yes, it's a girly movie, but who says guys don't have the same problems? It's not enough that many mothers and daughters have communication issues but add cultural differences on top of it and you've got a collision waiting to happen!    The mothers grew up in the old country and each have a unique and heartfelt story to tell.  The mother's were survivors and were able to escape the life they were born into and found new lives for themselves.  Who says baggage doesn't follow you and the next geneartion?    The American born daughters clash with their mothers growing up but finally have the heart to heart talk with their mothers that can finally unite them.  A little communication can go a long way!
B00166BL6Y|5.0|This was the only tull album I'd never heard, I was hesitant to pick up the collectors issue because of that fact,$20.00+ too. But as often I've discovered that I really enjoy the first albums put out by artists, they're always playing from the heart and soul, not quite stars yet and hungry for the limelight, fortune and fame. This album simply blew me away, I never realized they started out playing bluesy,jazzy,tunes.It is absolutely great music, So glad i purchased it you will too..You can't go wrong.
1881273156|5.0|Although THIS rendition says it's for married couples, the information applies to EVERYONE! This book changed the way I talk and listen to others, how I deal with co-workers, my parents, my friends, the kids I teach, and how I approach new relationships. It's a MUST-READ for anyone who desires to better communicate, or \\"get people,\\" in general, and more importantly those in our inner circle.    It can be read in a day, even for the slowest of readers, but I caution you: it is jam packed with scenerios and life application. Approach it like a dry sponge to water!    The nice thing about books...you can re-read them and pick-up what you've forgotten, or may have missed, the first time!
B00013RC8O|1.0|Can I please get my money back? This movie is terrible. There is one thing that I have never done as an avid movie watcher, and that one thing is fall asleep during a movie. Bad or not, I haven't fallen asleep on a movie....Until Vanishing Point somehow found it's way into my theater room. I'm telling ya, whenever I'm having a night where I just can't fall asleep, I'll pop this terrible movie in and in 10 minutes I'm sleeping like a baby. I bought this movie for Five Dollars and I feel like I got the short end of the stick here. I feel flat out robbed. With a weak American Dollar, paying $5 for this movie is a bit too much.     The acting, chases and the Nascar plot sent this movie spinning around in circles, literally as the disc flew across the room. I don't understand the positive reviews of this movie. What is there to like? Save your five dollars please. Don't be suckers people.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|A comic book movie is only as good as its villain. This movie has TWO of them and still doesn't manage to create any sense of drama or danger.  The extended cut does nothing to remedy this.<br /><br />My hope in purchasing the extended cut was that footage featuring more character development would add to quality of the film a la the Daredevil: Director's Cut, unfortunately this was not the case.<br /><br />NO scenes of Blackheart and his minions posing any type of threat to the Earth or anyone else outside of a bar full of bikers.<br /><br />NO scenes indicating why we should care about Johnny's \\"Bearded Buddy\\" when he gets killed.<br /><br />And most unfortunately, NO digital replacement of Eva Mendes by ANYONE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE!  Seriously, a monkey in a wig would have put in a better performance than she did, my goodness!<br /><br />The bottom line is that you don't care about anyone in the movie besides Johnny Blaze and even then it's just the basic empathy you have for any stranger who has lost a loved one.<br /><br />If you didn't like the first time, this version isn't going to change your mind.

0385341075|5.0|I had great expectations for Mister Pip, shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize (and, in my mind, far more deserving than The Gathering). I'm pleased to say that my expectations were truly met.  This imaginative, courageous, and heartbreaking book captured my own imagination and will stay with me a long time.<br /><br />The book takes place on a lush tropical island -- a paradise -- with Garden of Eden overtures. Here, Mr. Watts -- the only white inhabitant, a somewhat eccentric schoolteacher -- and Grace, the mother of the main character Matilda, wrestle for her soul, through fiction and religion.  Both are products of imagination;  both have the power to transform and both are redemptive. And ultimately, the moral values of both Mr. Watts and Grace emerge to be essentially the same.<br /><br />There are surprises at the end and heartbreaks -- no spoilers -- that have haunted me since closing the last pages. There is wisdom about the power of imagination and reinvention, the nature of true courage, the way we repair ourselves with stories old and new.<br /><br />And in the end, Lloyd Jones says it best: \\"Perhaps there are lives like that -- poured into whatever space we have made ready for them to fill... we needed a magician to conjure up other worlds and Mr. Watts had become that magician.\\"  Nothing is ever quite what it seems, and both art and religion have power and limitations.  With its sparse, haunting prose and powerful story, Mr. Jones has conjured up some magic of his own.
0765348780|3.0|The first thing I'll say is that I probably would have stopped reading this novel after a couple hundred pages except for two things:<br /><br />1. Many reviews here mentioned it's slow going and confusing at first, but picks up near the end.<br /><br />2. I'd actually read the prologue of the third book in the series (Memories of Ice) first, and had been blown away by the writing and imagery.<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad that I continued reading, but I'm going to start with my dislikes because I want to end this review on a positive note.<br /><br />The book as a whole is somewhat confusing initially because the author throws a huge amount of names at the reader.  Places are given little 'context' and a large cast of characters is introduced quite quickly.  For awhile, each chapter or couple of chapters then introduce more places and more characters.  It is not easy to keep all of it straight.  Sometimes the reader is left to wonder what a word means when referencing a character.  ie, there's one specific case where one character notices another, but the word used to describe the new character could be anything from the character's name, his rank, or even his race.  Erikson is also not particularly good about describing the non-human races.  I'm a believer that mannerisms or descriptions of non-human races shouldn't be the focus of every sentence in which they speak or act, but I do think that a description to fix their 'look and feel' in the mind of the reader should be done fairly quickly, and Erikson often doesn't include any of this until well after a race is mentioned for the first time.<br /><br />His descriptions of battle scenes can be quite confusing in this book.  Plus, I was left wondering why the two sides shown in the beginning needed such huge 'traditional' armies when magic more or less trumped them the way a nuclear bomb would trump a World War II army.  I have begun re-reading this series, and the scene I'm referring to stuck out even more.  I'mnot sure the soldiers in the huge army brought to assault a fortress were ever described as doing anything more than dying under incredibly powerful waves of magic.  It was obvious the mages in the assaulting group were expecting something along those lines... so why would you even bring the army in close until after the mages got done with their jobs?  I suspect the answer is because Erikson wanted to show how powerful magic could be in his world, but it still didn't make much sense.<br /><br />The characters are pretty stereotypical in most cases, and there really isn't much fleshing out of them as time goes on.  This, by the way appears to be the case  through at least the third book in the series.  If a character changes, it's usually because of an outside influence that forces the change, not due to any real character development (there are a couple of exceptions).<br /><br />The final thing that I didn't really like was that the characters often seemed to be behaving more like \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" roleplaying parties rather than real people.  There were times when it literally felt like I was reading multiple D&D adventures rather than a coherent novel.<br /><br />So what did I like about the book?  The first thing is that it's part of a much better series than this first novel would indicate.  Without giving much away, many of the characters in this novel have significant backstories and depth that only becomes revealed in the later novels.<br /><br />I liked that the world was dark and felt reasonably realistic for a magic heavy novel.  It focuses a great deal on politics and war, and generally does a good job.  The magic itself, while mechanically confusing initially (and it gets better explained later in the series) is quite interesting.<br /><br />Even though Erikson's ability to introduce an intensely evocative scene isn't at full strength in this novel, there are hints of it from time to time when you can almost see an epic image or sequence in yourmind's eye as if it were on a movie screen.<br /><br />I know I haven't given much of a synopsis of the novel itself, and the main reason is that I finished it over a year ago.  While I remember specific scenes in great detail, the overall flow and plot of the novel eludes me.  This isn't really a negative knock, as  I have this problem with a great many books, but my impression is the plot does meander and take awhile to actually get anywhere.  Still, if you have the time and patience to get through what really feels like a prologue to the rest of the series, I think it's worth it.  I might recommend that you do what I did and pick up \\"Memories of Ice\\" in a bookstore, and read the prologue.  If it hooks you, I think you'll find the build up worth it.  While I gave  the book '3 stars' (and this isn't one of those cases where it's really 3 1/2 stars to me), the series up through 3 1/2 books is closer to 4 - 4 1/2 stars.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Elbow's new album, [[ASIN:B0015I2P0Y The Seldom Seen Kid]], is simply an awesome understated gem.  It just goes to show you that if you produce beautiful nuanced music it will fly under the radar 90% of the time.<br /><br />It's so interesting that as Coldplay is morphing into a guitar-synth alternative band with their newest album [[ASIN:B000RPTQ1C Viva La Vida]], Elbow has stepped into the void of piano-band in the rock alternative world.<br /><br />While I really do love both bands their music is really different.  The record that Elbow has created here really stands on its own and is truly an instant classic.  It is a rare new album that I play start to finish three times (as I always do when listening to a new album) and don't find a single song to be out of place.  The entire album rocks, both as a total work and with each song taken on it's own.<br /><br />Like Paddy Casey's newest album [[ASIN:B0013ND334 Addicted to Company]], this is another example of a band that is bigger in Europe getting a formal introduction to the US. Maybe the success of Amy Winehouse has made record companies more bold to cash in. This is also another example of music that does not offend but may not always inspire.  I personally love both albums but this Elbow release just blows everything out of the water.<br /><br />The entire team behind this album has done a great job.  The vocals and lyrics of Guy Garvey are certainly a big part of this record, but the entire band really can be heard on this guy.  Craig Potter on keyboards in particular is given center stage, but Mark Potter also has some strong guitar riffs, such as on \\"Grounds For Divorce.\\"  The rhythm section is rounded out with Pete Turner on bass and Richard Jupp on drums.  Richard Hawley does a guest vocal and guitar on the number eight track, \\"The Fix.\\"<br /><br />Production is attributed to Craig Potter.  That's an amazing accomplishment in and of itself.  Self produced albums are rarely this great.  The liner book has some cool art along with the lyrics and more info about the recording.  It's almost like a little story-book, and for liner geeks like me is a welcome extra compared to the bare pictures that are often included in CD inserts.<br /><br />The record company has clearly decided to highlight the songs \\"One Day Like This,\\" \\"Grounds For Divorce\\" and \\"Mirrorball.\\"  All three of them are awesome and have the potential to be hit singles.  Still, I found so much to love on this album those weren't even my favorites.<br /><br />\\"An Audience With The Pope,\\" \\"Weather to Fly\\" and \\"Friend of Ours\\" are all subtle and smooth tracks with great lyrics, nice vocal melodies and harmonies and solid musicianship.  \\"Some Riot\\" could have come right off of a Pink Floyd record.  And \\"The Loneliness Of A Tower Crane Driver\\" had an amazing operatic feel to it, and could easily have been confused with Coldplay but for the simple guitar chord bridge.  To each their own.  Like I said, I really did love all these tracks to varying degrees.<br /><br />I know that Elbow has been around but this is the first album I really got to listen to closely.  And I'm glad I did get to listen to this.  Everybody has different tastes, but considering I rarely praise an album this much the fact that I wasn't a fan before this should lend some weight to my view.<br /><br />Check this out.  I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Enjoy.and more info about the recording.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|If you or someone you care about has ever, is or will ever visit a doctor, this movie is worth looking at. If you pay every month for health insurance, this movie is worth looking at.<br /><br />What I found the most compelling and valuable was Moore's comparative studies in health care systems here and outside the US.<br /><br />I think this movie provides us with another perspective (an unspun look) at our medical 'care'.<br /><br />I strongly urge everyone to borrow, rent or buy this film so that you may make the most informed choices regarding your own health care.<br /><br />There is nothing more precious than our health.  This movie reassured me that \\"no, I'm not seeing things...the medical treatment I'm receiving seems to worsen with every office call!\\"<br /><br />The movie will more than likely have you fuming...so be prepared for some much needed, bitter tasting doses of the truth.

0061537934|4.0|After reading this novel, you will never look at your own dog the same again.  This is a quick read -- perfect for the beach or sitting on a plane.  It's a book that will capture you early.  Then it manages to drag on, nearly putting you to sleep but you fight on because you know the ending promises a most specutacular and creative finish.  Trust me, Stein delivers an ending that will leave you wanting more.  Perhaps the most thought provoking ending that I've ever read.  I'm giving it 4 Stars because the middle 100 pages or so nearly cost me to discover a most memorable ending.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|Such beautiful people for being in mid-evil England. Very nice teeth as well. Did they do veneers back then? Well no English accents to try to figure out at least. The sex scenes certainly left me wanting more, I suppose the films budget couldn't afford a nude scene from Portman or Johannson. I wonder how much that would cost? We did get to see them doing the childbirth scenes where they are all sweaty and screaming in pain though. I guess we'd all kill ourselves had we had to watch another Kiera Knightly Bonnet movie. If you're trying to get out of the dog house with your wife or girlfriend, bring this home and cuddle up on the couch with her and spend the next 2 hours of your life watching these hot babes chase after the King of England, then again staying in the doghouse may be the preferable alternative.
B000H7JCG4|4.0|This is my favorite tv series, but Season 1 is definitely not without its flaws. Certain episodes bore me to tears (\\"The Green Room\\", \\"Higher Education\\", and \\"April Is The Cruelest Month\\" with Chandler. Yes, THAT Chandler) and Brandon has a new love interest in almost every other episode. And he pretty much ran the gamut from a friendless 'poor little rich girl\\", a teenage single mother, his old sweetheart from minnesota, a supposedly talented tv actress (who was one of the most annoying characters ever), and at the end of the season Andrea Zuckerman (almost). The best episode of the season is \\"Perfect Mom\\". When Jackie Taylor shows up to host the mother/daughter fashion show high as a kite is just priceless. Anyway, things only get better from here up until Season 3 so enjoy it while you can.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is a great little movie, beautifully made and wonderful music. This is for all those people that grew up with the Beatles.
B00000JGOH|5.0|Although highly popular for its time (labelled the Best Film of the 90's), in those days anything even hinting at post modernism, (one aspect, mixing genres); a speculative tale about the Master experiencing \\"writer's block\\", falling in love and the beloved becoming his Muse for the greatest love story of all time, seemed, in my arrogance, too main- stream, even somewhat stupid. Well, what a fool, what a young fool. Seeing the DVD for the first time the other night exploded all my pre-conceived ideas - what a well-produced, directed and believable story.<br /><br />This is a Romantic Comedy like no other.<br /><br />Gweneth Paltrow as Viola De Lesseps was well deserving for Best Actress in a Leading Role as her understanding and feeling for all the roles she played (both Romeo & Juliet) and Viola, exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Joseph Fiennes, however, though an intense performance, was maybe too over acted, but done with passion, revealing the true passion of an artist and a true genius.<br /><br />In fact, all the performances are first rate.<br /><br />Personally, films done in a \\"theatrical format\\", have alway been intriguing, (Hitchcock's \\"Rope\\" for example) giving the audience (perhaps unconsciously), the perception that they're actually seeing a live perfomance.<br /><br />The final scene in the actual play, performed in the film, (the death scene) was done very well and quite moving.<br /><br />Shakespeare, as time moves forward, is becoming harder to teach, enabling that 'penny to drop' with students, understanding Old English. This film would be a good \\"primer\\" for the i-pod & cell phone generation to catch a glimpse of the English language read and spoken in its original beauty.<br /><br />A wonderful and fun picture enabling a new generation to find, and perhaps continue, to appreciate the Master.<br /><br />Excellent.
0385340567|5.0|It is interesting to see that people review a book based on their own political biases instead of the quality of the writing and the story. While the story gets a little repetitive as Reacher goes back over and over again between  Despair and Hope(great names, perfect symbols for a nation's emotions in the 21st. century) but it dawns on you that that is Jack Reacher's core character; he won't let go of an idea or a problem and never quits.  The ending of this novel is the most satisfying of ANY novel I have read.  You gotta read this one.

B0018QCXGY|5.0|This is a great film.  I have watched it numerous times and I still enjoy it again and again.  The way it was filmed really makes you part of it.    You get those that whine and complain about the shakiness, however some may have a legit problem - others are just whiners that don't want anything other than perfectly steady film.  If it was perfectly steady, they would be complaining it all looked fake.  Blah blah blah!    Watch it.  Enjoy it. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION on it.  If you don't like it, sell it here :)  - If you do - get your review up!      Can't wait for Cloverfield 2!

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Sam and Dean never fail to disappoint. This DVD has great episodes. The writing and story lines are great and our heroes are very human in the out of this world arena they live in. I'm not a fan of blood and gore so close my eyes once in a while but otherwise this is very entertaining for adults who like a little bizarre with their everyday TV experience.
B0010358D0|5.0|I'm a professional animator and a huge 3D tech-buff - and this movie fed both addictions ;)  If you liked the first Appleseed, you'll love Ex Machina - the animation is better (still mocap - but better action), the characters are redesigned and look a little less stylized (but manage to avoid the \\"uncanny valley\\" effect. Set design, rendering, and effects overall are improved.  The story, while not what I would call \\"amazing\\", is good, and is a little less \\"Japanese\\" in that there is a more clearly defined \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" - so it's more palatable for those not familiar with hard-core Anime (i.e. most American viewers).  Overall, this video is a visual feast filled with over-the-top action - a \\"must see\\" for Anime, Sci-Fi, and Action fans.
0385340567|1.0|Boring and contrived. It's strange that Jack Reacher knows so much about physics, chemistry, calculus, and philosophy, and yet he has never been known to read a book. I have read everything in the Reacher series and, although this one was pretty boring from the start, I was willing to wait and see what was going to happen. But when Child went into his anti-war rant toward the end, I closed the book and threw it into the garbage. Goodbye Jack Reacher.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|After seeing this in the theatre, I was ready to give it 5 stars.  I love period movies, especially about the Tudors, and I really enjoyed this one.  However, after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, I realized this movie should have been much better!<br /><br />When I ordered the DVD, I had already resigned myself to little or no features.  Elizabeth, and Elizabeth: The Golden Age were sorely lacking.  Most period movies have few extras, despite having such a treasure trove of history to mine.  However, I was surprised and delighted with the excellent selection of special features on this DVD!  First, there are several deleted scenes, many of which should have been included in the film.  For the most part, they centered around Mary and gave more insight into her life with her husband after Anne supplants her, plus some calculating scenes with Anne.  One scene with Mary's husband upon seeing her \\"bastard\\" child of Henry was quite poignant.  All of these would have enriched the movie to be more than just two women in rivalry for a king.  It could have been 5 stars and would no doubt have pleased more people who saw the film.  Also included in the extras was a feature called \\"To Be Lady\\" about court etiquette and the precarious life of a woman, even noble, in those times.  It featured interviews with the author, some college history professors, and the cast/crew of the film.  Women were often exploited in that time to the benefit (or detriment) of their families.  And Mary and Anne were no exception.  Another excellent feature was about translating history to film.  They discussed the book v&iacute;s &aacute; v&iacute;s the movie, what they used of history, how the expanded on Mary's lesser known character.  I have not read the book this film is based on, and didn't feel any urge to do so after seeing the movie.  However, these two features and the interview with the author and cast have piqued my interest in the novel.  I definitely intend to read it now.<br /><br />Many DVDs throw in biographies of the characters just to have another extra to list.  They are usually nothing more than frozen screen shots a viewer clicks through.  But, this DVD included bios of 5 principal characters which included interviews from the author, historians, the cast and crew, coupled with footage from the movie.  They were like mini-bios from A&E.  Very well done, and I would recommend first time viewers of the movie watch before the film as they really help to keep the characters straight (such as Mary's two husbands, William Carey and William Stafford who look enough alike with the same name that I sometimes confused them).  The DVD also includes a commentary, which I didn't listen too because I find them very boring.  Overall, a fantastic set of features on a single disc edition.<br /><br />As to the film, I thought the costumes and sets were phenomenal, the story was very good and the casting spot on.  The cinematography is expertly done, and helps set the tone and tell the story as much as the script.  Some viewers have complained that Natalie Portman wasn't good as Anne Boleyn.  I've read a lot of history books and historical fiction on Anne and I thought she played the part true to the person (if not the book, which I can't comment on).  Anne Boleyn wasn't a raving beauty, she was striking.  Her major appeal came from denying Henry and being intelligent, ambitious, manipulative - in short, a match for him in many ways.  She intrigued him.  Portman brought all these qualities to light in her portrayal.  Scarlett Johansson actually exceeded my expectations.  I have only seen her in a couple movies, and the parts didn't require much effort.  However, I thought she embodied the somewhat naïve and soft Mary, who is quickly disillusioned about the real world, and even her family.  The two women played against each other beautifully.  In one of the features, the director mentions how in the book it is often not clear which of them is \\"the other\\" Boleyn girl and that he uses this in the film.  He does, and it works to great effect.<br /><br />Eric Bana as Henry is perhaps the weakest casting choice, but he wasn't bad by any stretch.  History bears out that Henry was young, handsome, charming and athletic until injured falling from a horse so Bana fit that fine.  Bana is best as the temperamental king who is at once attracted and disgusted by Anne's manipulation, and drawn to Mary's docile nature.  His interactions with other characters didn't really stand out, but the movie was focused on the women so this was fine.  Two other stand outs were Anna Torrent as Queen Katherine of Aragon and David Morrissey as the Duke of Norfolk.  Though her role was small, Torrent's Katherine made a big impact.  She commanded every scene she was in.  She was at once regal, and pitiable, as the victim of her husband's desperation for a male heir.  Morrissey played a consummate politician - calculating, controlling and just a bit sleazy.  Without him, it would be difficult to sympathize with either Anne or her family.  His ruthless game of chess, in which they are pawns was vital to the film. Yes, liberties are taken with historical fact, but some license must be given to film as its own art form just as for a historical fiction.  Not much is known about Mary Boleyn, but this film certainly stirs the imagination of what she may have been like.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this DVD!n the film.

B000P0J0D8|4.0|OK, maybe this should be obvious, but...  There are no special features on this disk--must be the earliest release--and, let's be real, that's always been one of the best things about this format.  Yeah, good movie, story, actors, acting, but bite the bullet and buy the director's cut with all the goodies.
014305841X|3.0|When I discovered that a disk was bad, I contacted Amazon and they quickly sent a replacement package. Some of /those/ disks were bad, too, but between the two sets I had enough good disks to have one good set. Seems like the manufacturer went too far trying to have these CDs made at the cheapest price.  Book is good, but I wouldn't want to repeat the experience.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|The biggest problem I had with this movie is, unfortunately, unfixable.  Because the entire premise hinges on the style in which it was shot - a style that wrecks havoc with my motion-sickness.  I spent only half the movie really watching the screen, and had to rewind to see the interesting bits, and still ended up with a nagging headache and an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.  And the crushingly disappointing thing is that I really liked the premise of the movie!  There wasn't a huge amount of gore, the fact that there were mere glimpses of the monster was well-done in a very old-fashioned (and in my opinion, far better) way, and the rather open ending was, although predictable from the opening credits, still the best possible wrap-up to the story.<br /><br />The acting could have been better.  It seemed a little flat and unbelievable at points, and a few of the characters grated on my nerves.  And, of course, the entire movie was completely unbelievable.  I can't say much specifically without giving away the plot (and I dislike it when people do that!) but I will say the resistance to weapons by the monster and the words and actions of the military personnel didn't ring at all true.  But then, it is a horror film, so I'll grudgingly half-accept some of it as part of my suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />However, if you're a person who likes answers and plots wrapped up in tidy little packages, this is not the movie for you.  Nothing is really explained.  There are so many open questions left for the viewer to fill in any way they see fit.  Anyone who enjoys that in a movie will have a field day with this one, those who don't will be nothing but frustrated.<br /><br />I'd say get a group together and pack the Dramamine - it's a good Friday night creature flick.  And more than half the fun will be talking about it afterwards.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is possibly my all time favorite album of heavy metal music of any kind. It has a unique sound of its own, the bass is rather quiet on this album, but actually I think this very sound is a part of why this album is so good, the unique sound grows on you. It sounds kind of like everything unnecessary is stripped away, and I think this sound fits perfectly with the general feeling of this album and the themes in its lyrics. I don't think it could have been mixed any other way without sacrificing some of this album's uniqueness. When you compare the sound to the Black Album, of course the latter has a more well-rounded sound but in some way it also lacks the edge of this album. I like both but I prefer this one.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law and she loves it. I own one as well and it is great on hard wood and carpeting too. Worth the money!
B000VWYJ8Q|3.0|I won't get too in-depth with this review as other posters have already covered the strengths/weaknesses of the film. In a nutshell, if you liked the first two you'll probably enjoy this one. There's nothing revolutionary here but the film is exciting and well-made. I very rarely write reviews but felt compelled in this instance. I've purchased this product twice(one from Walmart and once from Amazon). In both instances, the standard dvd portion of the disc worked fine but the HD DVD portion was unplayable. I have dozens of HD DVD titles and this is the only one that will not play. The only HD DVD player I have is my XBOX 360 drive. I'm not sure if there is a bad batch of Bourne Ultimatum discs or if its simply a compatibility problem with the XBOX 360 drive. If you plan on purchasing this item(and especially if you play your discs on the 360), prepare for the possibility of technical problems. With all that said, 4 stars for the movie but only a 3 stars rating b/c of possible product defect.
0553582445|4.0|Fitz Chivalry had always wished that his life would be his own. After completing the last task assigned to him in \\"[[ASIN:B00127OEFC Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy (3 Mass Market Paper Backs Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin & Assassin's Quest)]]\\" He has finally gotten his wish. 15 years have passed and Fitz has spent the majority of his time in relative seclusion. Most people whom he cared for believe him to be dead. Now it is just Fitz, his wolf and an adopted son living the simple life Fitz always dreamed of.  That is until he receives a visit from some of his old friends from Buckkeep. It turns out that Prince Dutiful is missing and it is the request of Fitz's old mentor Chade and the queen herself that Fitz return to court for a new assignment. Together with his old friend the Fool, Fitz must track down the Prince and return him before his betrothal ceremony...<br /><br />Hobb has done it again. She has to be one of the best writers working on fantasy novels today. In reality the story is not overly complex and there isn't a vast amount that happens however Hobb's writing keeps you entertained somehow even when there isn't a lot going on. Her ability to draw complex and interesting characters is second to none.<br /><br />The Good: Hobb's writing and characters make this book. The story although not overly complex wove an interesting enough maze in which to watch Hobb's characters wonder. It was great to revisit the characters from \\"The Farseer\\" trilogy and see how they have changed in the 15 years that have passed.<br /><br />The Bad: There was one part that was bad but it would be a spoiler to give it away but you will know what it is when it happens.<br /><br />Overall: If you are a fan of the Farseer trilogy or \\"[[ASIN:B00127UT4C Robin Hobb's Liveship Traders Trilogy (3 Mass Market Paper Backs Ship of Magic, Mad Ship & Ship of Destiny)]]\\" or any of Hobb's other works then pick this up and give it a try.
B000AADYUI|1.0|I had heard all sorts of positive reviews about this album and I thought I'd take the plunge... since I'm a long time fan of the JA - especially enjoying the Jorma/Jack/Marty/Grace creativity I thought that this might be worth digging into, if even half of what the reviewers wrote were in sync with me.  Unfortunately, I found this CD to be uneven and even 'juvenile' at times.  Perhaps I wasn't in the right 'mood', but if I need to be then I missed the time for this music as I gave that up several decades ago.  I was truly hoping for something special that spanned the years - like David Crosby's fabulous 'If I can only remember my name'.  I'll probably listen to it again and if I feel the same way I'll donate it to the library.
B00005RYKU|5.0|I did not get the product that was in the ad but the movie is great!
6305508550|4.0|I defiantly would say that this is a must have for your home collection. It is too hilarious to just rent and watch once. I am sure that many people can relate to the lack of enthusiasm about their job or the many office obstacles that may get in the way of them effectively doing their job.   The movie starts off with Peter on his way to work. He is in slow moving traffic, which in turn causes him to be late. While he is in traffic the camera goes to the right of him and shows an elderly gentleman with a walker walking faster than the vehicles are moving. This is one of the many funny things that stand out. Make sure to keep an eye out for Milton. He plays sort of a hero to the main character Peter and the rest of his co-workers. Milton's incoherent mumbling about his red Swingline stapler, lack of receiving his paycheck, not receiving his piece of cake and the location of his desk show the inconsistent policies that Initech portray.   Again I recommend this movie to everyone because it will keep you laughing the entire time.
B000024D4R|5.0|This album is one of Pink Floyd's best albums.  It is not quite as good as DSOTM or WYWH or The wall...but it had a feeling to it that was very nice to me.  However, it doesn't sound exactly like other Pink Floyd music.  As one of my friends said, its like Pink Floyd's weirdness and normal rock mixed together.  I got mad at him at first, but I think he was right.  This is Pink Floyd as hard rockish/normal as possible.  Enjoy it....the songs are great
B00005JKHP|2.0|I just started watching the old Star Trek series about two months ago, and I've grown addicted to it.  It's like my Lost.  It's just really great TV, cheese and all.  I love it.  Then it dawned on me that I should be watching the movies.  If the series is good, the movies must be great!  But this movie, not so much.  This one is DEFINITELY a renter, man.  It is true that it's great to see the intros of the old cast and all, but that aside, the movie is lame in a way I never foresaw.  At least half of it is waiting around for stuff to happen, or VERY drawn out displays of the environment.  I should really go back and time how long the intro was where they show the Enterprise for the first time.  And then the scenes of when they venture inside the alien are all unbearably long.  It's a movie that could've easily been condensed into forty minutes worth of substance.  The effects are good, the characters are decent (though lacking somewhat), the plot is forgivable, the audio is atrocious, and the story just....really takes too long to get told.  I was disappointed.
1400082773|2.0|This is a novel based on the author himself.  Interesting, but deceptive, of course..Not a pure auto-biography.  A display of conceit..
B000002NJS|5.0|I heard this album years ago, but lost some of my collection of CDs which I had this stored.  After listening to this CD again, I recall how hot Ray of Light is.  The remixes of some of the songs on this album are brilliant, and those are the ones I did not lose.  : )
B0000UJL96|4.0|I'm a big fan of Star Trek, but mostly of the newer shows (TNG and DS9 in particular).  However, my interest did begin with the original series and the cast's subsequent movies.<br /><br />It has been more than a decade since I last saw this particular film (probably since it first hit theaters) and I'm pleased to say that it ranks among the best of the first six films.  Rather than attempting to create a search for God ([[ASIN:B0000AUHOH Star Trek V - The Final Frontier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]) or any similar story that would be REALLY stretching believability, this one relies on a good old 'whodunit' plot.<br /><br />It has all the good elements of a good tale as well:  False accusations, wrongful imprisonment, a (not so daring) rescue, suspicions aplenty, and turncoats to keep the plot interesting.  It ends in somewhat of a race to find out the conspiracy behind the murder before something terrible happens (not to spoil anything), so it does keep you on edge.<br /><br />All in all, an outstanding film.  If I could rate it 4.5 stars instead of 4, I certainly would.  Why not 5?  Because that represents 'perfection' to me, and only a handful of movies fall under that category.<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of Star Trek, you'll enjoy this movie, I believe.  If you ARE a fan, however, you'll like it that much more.  I heartily recommend it!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As I've always believed, Madonna is queen of all disco, pop, techno, club, etc.  She's on the ball.  Madonna knows exactly what we all want...love!  She gives it to us in her music and performances.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This has to be one of my top movies. Yes the theatrical cut was a mess, but Ridley saw it coming. The beginning is great in that Mr. Scott comes up front and explains in short what we are about to see and why the story is what is was supposed to be. The characters are more developed and the Orlando \\"pretty boy\\" problem seems to be absent in my opinion. I would agree with, \\"Bloom doesn't have the gravitas of Russell Crowe in the lead (then again, who does?)\\" The director thought he was the right person for the job and he's the boss applesauce. Great editing, and a wonderful soundtrack.<br />I love the way David Thewlis pops in and out. He comes from and goes into nothing a couple of times. Ghassan Massoud is wonderful as Saladin. Eva Green's role is the only fly in the ointment. Her lines seem forced and sometimes a little corny. Her fault or the writer, who knows?
B0016AJU2C|1.0|Great voice and vocal but her Album is weak and the songs are not that great. Alanis we need something better from you. You are a good artist work harder. One think I do hate about Canadian singers: they don't have they own identity, and they are always copying from American singers. Canadians be Canadians and do some Canadian things. Alanis ALBUM is like a copy of American sounds and melodies. Don't buy it if you like your money.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I like this work out for when I'm short on time or as an add on workout. One downside is I don't like how Jillian constantly stops to make pointers.  It can be distracting.  Some of her comments are cheesy, but the workout itself is decent.  Not as tough as Cathe Friedrich's DVDs, which are still my favorite workouts---she does the entire workout with you.  For 3 short 20 minute workouts though, you can't beat the price on the Shred workout.

1400032717|3.0|I doubt my review will be worth anything, what with there being 1,400-plus reviews already. But I thought I should tell of my opinion seeing as I am mildly autistic myself, & have interacted with other autistic beings from all across the spectrum.<br /><br />I'm sure you already know what this book is focused on: a 15-year-old boy named Christopher, plagued by a case of autism more severe than my own, & he plays the literal-minded narrator. Indeed the author pulls very hard to make Christopher sound like an authentic autistic person, & I can't say he failed. This story is more about him than the murdered dog, his family's turmoil, anything.<br />& yet I had a very hard time liking Christopher. His character never shines a single moment of empathy for others. Very bluntly he tells his audience of the people surrounding him, but his voice holds such devoid distance as if these people are hollow shells not quite alive. At one point in the story, a torn person pleas for Christopher to hold their hand... just this once, & Christopher refuses apathically.<br />I strongly dislike being touched, however I will suck it up & allow myself to be touched or even reach out to hug someone if I feel they truly need it.<br />As much as I know that these are the lines that separate the mild from the severe cases, it still remains hard for me to feel for Christopher knowing that he cannot feel for others beyond himself. (On another note, some people with autism are known to feel physical pain with skin to skin contact. Christopher never mentions such a thing, so it seems clear that he `feels' like me when it comes to touching.)<br /><br />Despite this stoic nature, the story unfolds in such a way that others' emotions bleed through the pages via bits of dialog & in their simple actions. The situation is a tender one & very raw at its root.<br />At the same time I found the other characters unlikable as well. While it becomes lucid later, Christ's father seems to cage his son, banning his curiosity. In a turning point of the mystery behind Wellington the poodle's murder, something harsh is revealed about the father that places him in a very ugly light.<br /><br />- - spoiler - -<br />As for Christopher's estranged mother, let me spell for you a summary of her explanation letters: `I'm so sorry I had to leave you Christopher, but you must understand that you are an unbearable child. I hated my life & it was all your fault.' Not to mention the fact that she flatly abandoned him in the first place.<br /><br />But all this ugliness makes for a very raw & potent read. Each of these characters in their flaws feels very real.<br />& the simplistic, blunt writing style itself feels very fresh & novel.<br /><br />I just wish people would stop saying `this book is an insight into the autistic mind.'<br />This book is an insight into ONE autistic mind. We are each very different people. Just from this review you should be able to understand that.nt of the mystery behind Wellington the poodle's murder, something harsh is revealed about the father that places him in a very ugly light.    - - spoiler - -  As for Christopher's estranged mother, let me spell for you a summary of her explanation letters: `I'm so sorry I had to leave you Christopher, but you must understand that you are an unbearable child.

0316143472|2.0|Seriously - why all the rave over this guy? After reading the reviews of this book and his others I thought this would be a sure thing. How disappointing ... I have gotten through about 50 pages (admittedly not a lot of the book) but those 50 pages included 4 different stories. None of which made me laugh, not even a little. Sure it's readable, and certainly more entertaining then most books; but not nearly as earth shatteringly fabulous as other will lead you to believe. Even the writing is not impressive, I have been passed so many incomplete thoughts I am lost. Perhaps you need to have read his other books to understand but he constantly refers to people as if you already know who they are but I for one do not; I think to myself \\"is this person his brother, his boyfriend, a stranger or an imaginary person\\" ... I have no clue but I keep trucking along.<br />If you are already a Sedaris fan or if you are desperate for something to pass the time in jury duty ... go for it. Otherwise do not waste the time or money.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Many bands have died off from not being able to evolve, mature, grow, and explore.  With this album, Linkin Park has shown that the group can branch out and try something new.  Not everyone is going to like it, but then again, no one liked hearing that the earth was round when they believed for eons that it was flat.    That being said, I have to say that, as a Linkin Park fan, it took me many listens to fully enjoy this album because I was just so resistant to the new sound.  Don't get me wrong - my favorite songs are the ones that sound like Linkin Park, but I have to say, Shadow of the Day, Hands Held High, Leave Out All The Rest are beautiful songs.    This album will not immediately astonish and please, but after multiple listens, you will enjoy it.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Most people think Juno, [directed by Jason Reitman] is a movie about teens getting pregnant. Well, if that is what you think, it's totally wrong. Juno, the main character, finds out she's pregnant and tells her parents. Of course her parents flip. But luckily she and her friend find a family that would want to adopt the baby once it is born. Juno starts to have a schoolgirl crush on that dad. She knows she should not get involved in anyway, yet she does. Then Juno realizes that she should be with someone else.     This is a very funny movie. It shows a lot of family problems. A lot of time Hollywood shows sisters being as close as friends and mothers being a best friend. In the movie, Juno shows that a family isn't like that. There are problems, especially if you're pregnant.   You have to see this movie. The actor Ellen Page [Juno] is amazing at this role. She really takes on a sixteen- year-old who is dealing with other problems than just being pregnant. The music is great in this movie. Anyone would love it!
B0015KO52S|5.0|Just completing this album in the first week of March the band surprisingly unleashes it without any foreknowledge so that nobody, \\"the fans, the press, radio, etc., has an upperhand on anyone else regarding it's availability, reception, or perception,\\" said Jack White, in Rolling Stone.<br /><br />\\"Consolers of the Lonely\\" kicks of the album with the title song \\"Consoler of the Lonely.\\"  This songs tambourine shakes and shuddering bass adding to a carefree and high-spirited kick off comes off well as the first song on the new album.<br /><br />\\"Salute Your Solution,\\" the first single for the album is a fast-paced stomper starting with a strong Jack White guitar riff before a muffled bass riff kicks in halfway through, adding a psychedelic twinge.  The album then breaks into a mixture of 4 stars and five star songs.  Those I consider to be 5 star songs in the first half of the album, including the two just mentioned, are \\"Old Enough\\", \\"The Switch and the Spur\\", and \\"Top Yourself.\\"<br /><br />For the second half of the album the songs I gave 5 stars to included:  \\"Rich Kid Blues\\", \\"These Stones Will Shout\\", and \\"Carolina Drama\\", which is a slower, blusier song as White tells the story of a troubled boy with \\"blue tatoos\\" named Billy, is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Overall, this is an astonishing follow-up for White and his second band.<br />The songs show this band as having or showing their ability or achievement in the rock music genre, although the band is clearly influenced by a number of different genres that come out in their music.<br /><br />The Raconteurs album definitely shows the effective and forceful, but not forced music the band is capable of producing.  Each song stands strongly by itself, but, the combination is a contour of a body constructed so as to offer minimum resistance to a fluid flow.  It all comes together perfectly.<br /><br />This is an album that will stay in my music rotation for a long time to come.  I look forward to the album growing on me as well, as I listen to it even more.  Job very well done.more.  Job very well done.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|This movie is about a team that goes from being mad to being normal and from always doing bad to always doing good. Coach Carter is about a basketball team that lives in a rough town and a rough high school. The Richmond Oilers had a really bad coach until the new coach Mr. Carter came around. Coach Carter used to go to the school and broke a bunch of records and knew a lot about basketball. Ever since Coach Carter started to coach, the team progressed and he lead the team to the state championships. This movie is very inspiring and I would give it four and a half out of five. This movie shows you that you can do anything if you believe in yourself. This movie is PG-13 so I would not recommend this to younger kids. This movie is also a true story so the movie always keeps you on your toes. Real \life

She loves this book and the surprise eyes at the end make her smile every time. I'd recommend buying this book and Ten Minutes Till Bedtime by the same author.  If you buy that book, on one of the pages you can see the same illustration as in Goodnight Gorilla outside the window. My 4 year old loves to put the two books together so you can see both illustrations side by side.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I just saw a movie called I am Legend. It was good. It was about a man living on his own in New York City who is trying to stay alive from the zombies that are trying to kill him.  The zombies can only go out in the dark. A lady and a kid that are searching for a cure for the zombies save him. The guy is also looking for a cure and he has a lab to try new things to save them. I liked it because it was about a single man on his own fighting for the human race. I liked how brave he was, I am normally the one who does the daring stuff.  Some day I want to do something good for mankind that's, and why it relates to me.
0143038419|5.0|Some of you have completely missed the point. Society does put these standards in your face about marriage, children, how one should live his or her life. When someone deviates from that path, other people freak out/judge. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with not being traditional: married, kids, blah, blah, blah. If that's what you want, great. If not, that's great too.     Some of you seem to be traditionalists which= close-minded. Sorry to offend, but hey, not everyone is the same. That's what makes life special. I grew up in the deep South, very \\"religious\\", conservative, close-minded people who see life as one path. God forbid if you follow another path. I believe in one God, BUT  if someone doesn't believe in one God or no God at all, who am I to judge?    I think it's wonderful that she found inner happiness without comprising. We should not live for other people's expectations. I loved this book, but I can see very traditional women becoming upset. Maybe this book strikes a nerve into some buried feelings about your own life. Are YOU  truly happy? Have you fallen victim to society's standards?     And about the author not acknowledging the poor in India. How many of you acknowledge the poor in your OWN country? How many of your have been to poor ghettos/barrios/trailer parks in the United States and given back?  I'm sure if you have, the time was minimal and at the end of the day you went back to your  comfortable lifestyle.     I also think that some of you may be jealous because you wish you had the nerve to do what she did. I'm sure many of you are happily married, but I guarantee that some of you are not.  Instead of doing anything about it for fear of being alone-labeled and/or judged as self-absorbed, you stick it out, because society says you should.  Who says you always have to think about other people-don't assume that everyone does or should believe in your values/morals.
B00003CXA2|5.0|A movie filled with wonder and loss, emotions and dedication, and deeper meanings of what we see of people, Forrest Gump is a really wonderful movie. I can't stop watching it. I love the twists and turns, and I also like how Forrest's deeper feelings are shown. Friends, enemies, and lovers are combined into this film. In this movie, Forrest Gump, a seemingly stupid man who does whatever people tell him to, is telling the story of his life, starting when he is six. His story goes through high school and college, and then goes to the army. Through his story he meets Jennie and Bubba, the love of his life and his best friend. He meets enemies, and is devastated by loss after loss. I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed a lot, but afterwards I had to sit and think about what Forrest had gone through. This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion.  Forrest's deeper feelings will really make you think hard about people who are different or dumb. Quotes like \\"Stupid is as stupid does\\" and \\"mama always told me life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get\\" make you laugh at first, but then make you ponder about what Forrest is thinking and how true his thoughts are. His friendships are very emotional as Bubba dies and Jennie refuses to marry him. He goes through hardships that make you think of your own. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that anyone who watches it will, too.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I love Sex and the City and this collectors set does not disappoint.  The pink velvet cover is very chic and the episode guides are very nice as well.  Each season is compiled on two discs which is much better than the original seasons that were released individually and in those horrible plastic cases that broke every time you tried to open them to watch a disk.  I highly recommend this to all fans.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|When `Rent' first took the stage at an off-Broadway theater in 1996 the history of theater instantly changed. Jonathan Larson composed the Pulitzer Prize winning revolutionary rock opera. Rent was loosely based on Puccini's opera `La Boheme'. Rent has been on Broadway for twelve years and will be closing September 7, 2008.   RENT is about eight starving artists living during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1989 living in the East Village in New York City. \\"Measuring their lives in love\\" the eight struggling bohemians must cope with poverty, illness, starvation, life, love and trying to pay off last year's and the current year's rent.    The eight friends are Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), a nerdy love-struck film producer who is trying to get his big break. Rodger Davis (Adam Pascal) is a washed up songwriter with HIV whose girlfriend Amy recently died of AIDS. Mimi Marquez, the drug addicted dancer at The Catscratch Club who falls in love with Rodger. Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel) is a bisexual outspoken performer who dumped Mark for a lawyer named Joanne Jefferson. Joanne (Tracie Thoms) is a lawyer who is sick of Maureen mooning over other men and women. Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) is a computer-age philosopher at NYU with AIDS who falls in love with Angel Dumott Schunard, a gay Drag Queen street performer who \\"provides a comfortable home for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\\" (Angel from \\"You Okay Honey?\\" song from Rent). Last but not least is Benjamin \\"Benny\\" Coffin III an old roommate of Mark, Collins, and Maureen who recently married Allison Grey of the Westport Greys and is now the landlord of Avenue A, who hopes to evict all the homeless from Alphabet City and build a cyber studio.   Directed by Chris Columbus (Known for Home Alone and Harry Potter) this powerful and riveting movie moves even the hardest of hearts and leaves everyone crying and with a feeling of hope. If I could give it a million stars instead of five I would! This is one of the best movies ever created and Jonathan Larson is a GENIUS!!! The acting is amazing and the singing is phenomenal times 5,25,600! Do yourself a favor and watch RENT!    WARNING: This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. RENT includes a mature theme involving drugs and sexuality and strong language.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|If you're gonna watch this and enjoy it at all you have to know what you're getting into. I loved the book version but even that is a sensationalized version of historical events.     This movie is NOT by any means meant to be a serious portrayal of what happened between Henry VIII and the Boleyn family. It IS a very entertaining interpretation of what might have happened given the very spotty records we have from the time.     Sets and costumes are gorgeous, characters are written to be larger than life and the dialogue made me go \\"Oh, snap!\\" more than once in the theater. Acting is fine, Portman may have overplayed a little but she *is* portraying freakin' Anne Boleyn. Johannson makes Mary Boleyn a very sympathetic character, the heart of the movie. If anyone falls flat it's Bana who makes Henry VIII seem like a dunderhead totally being played by the ambitious families pushing their daughters into his bed to win influence.    Honorable mention to Ana Torent playing the role of Queen Katharine, who is forced to take both Boleyn girls into her service just so Henry can have access to them. Awk-ward!    Finally, if you like the movie at all, check out the book. The book is ALWAYS better ;) Part of the reason plotlines seem a bit tangled and incomplete in the movie is because there is so much detail involved and only 2 hours to cram it into.
B00166BL6Y|4.0|Two discs.  71,55 min. each.  Remastered sound.  I must first make a confession-this is still my favorite album in Jethro Tull's catalogue.  So with that in mind,here we go.  Recorded rather quickly and on the cheap,this contains a lot of why British \\"rock\\" music was so interesting.  Take a bit of blues,some Roland Kirk-style flute,including singing into the flute while playing,a slight bit of folk music,and some good old rock and roll-English style- and there you have it.<br /><br />In 1968 I can remember purchasing this as an \\"import\\" from Tower Records.  On first listen,I thought,what in the world is this?  At the time very few people seemed to like it,thinking it a curiosity.  Now we have the 40 year anniversary release,and if you liked the original,you'll like this.  The new stereo mix lets the various instruments breathe a bit and the overall sound is cleaner than previous releases.  There is a curious overall \\"lightness\\" in the sound,not in a negative way,but the combined force of the music is not as immediate when compared to the mono version.  Being of an age when mono was the only way you heard most music,maybe that's a predjudice that can't be overcome.  However,it's nice to have both in one handy package,along with other tracks from the period.<br /><br /> The BBC session,while sounding a bit flat,is certainly nice to have.  The first track,So Much Trouble,has the Tull slide guitar-harmonica sound which we all know.  It's interesting but not truly essential. My Sunday Feeling and Serenade to a Cuckoo both follow the originals.  That could also be said for the rest of this session.  Not until we get to Stormy Monday do we hear a track not from the album,but a song Tull had in their live repertoire at the time.  This track demonstrates why this album has always been a favorite of mine.  Here they take a blues tune,add some jazz drumming and flute and Ian Anderson's best blues vocal,and come out at the end with that \\"This Was\\" sound.  The two final tracks pretty much follow the originals,but as I said,for anyone who likes this era of Tull,thats just fine.<br /><br />As for the new stereo mixes of Love Story and Christmas Song on the second disc,they too have a much more \\"open\\" feel than previous recordings.  Unlike the majority of this album,Christmas Story looks ahead to the Tull sound that went on to capture the imaginations of Americans everywhere.  The vocal is pushed forward and the sound is leaning towards the minstral-folk sound Tull would make famous.  The four mono tracks,all period singles,  that conclude this set are typical Tull at that time,though I must say that One For John Gee is a personal favorite-what with the flute,bass and drums all pushing into jazz territory.<br /><br /> So,like I said,if you liked this album and found so much to listen for throughout the original album,you will like this.  Included is a booklet with period photographs,the original liner notes,and input from the band members looking back all those years.  This is an album,that,while dated, will never go out of style,as long as people are interested in something,as Ian Anderson says,that is a bit off.llow the originals,but as I said,for anyone who likes this era of Tull,thats just fine.

B000268QB2|3.0|I've heard good things about Keane, and had heard the debut single \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\".  I finally got around to giving \\"Hopes and Fears\\" a good few listens, and for me it just boils down to this:  this is musical wallpaper for the uncritical listener's lifestyle schemata.  It's safe mid-tempo rock music that all sounds perfect, it's been auto-tuned and beat-corrected and tweaked within an inch of its life, with soaring melodies by a singer who can obviously sing but who's voice lacks a distinctive character (unlike Bono, or Thom Yorke, or even Jeff Buckley) that sets him apart from a throng of imitators.      Proclamations of wonder about the fact that there aren't guitars and it still sounds great are pretty pointless, because drums and vocals are so dominant in this kind of music... turn the volume down real low and see what you hear... vocals and drums.  It would be far more impressive if they could have a massive hit with guitar, keyboards and bass and took away the drums.  The recording studio (and producer, engineer, mixing engineer) should get a cut of the profits from this, actually, it's SO important to the sound of this record.      Anyway, kudos to Keane for sticking it out and to the main songwriter for not joining Coldplay when he had the chance long before this record came out.  Their efforts have paid off, and I'm always glad when musicians can make a living at their craft.  I just hope they invest wisely, in case they don't last.
B000XA5K48|4.0|I enjoyed every loud, gunfire-blasting moment of this movie. Paul Giamatti (Mr. Hertz) is an evil, foul-mouthed crack-up, occasionally on the phone with his wife during gun battles. A perfect foil to Clive Owen's (Mr Smith) dark, gun-toting, sure-fire bad-guy killing demeanor. Monica Bellucci as Donna Quintano, the prostitute is as beautiful as ever. A myriad of predictable shootout chiche's as you'll ever see in a movie. Which makes it all the more enjoyable.
B000XV6VOK|5.0|I *am* a history buff (historical writer, researcher) and I honestly did not think I'd enjoy 'The Tudors' at all. For one thing, it's a period that doesn't really interest me and for another, Henry VIII is fairly well known in terms of the history of the Kings and Queens of Britain.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by how much I *did* enjoy it. It made the history very real and very accessible to modern audiences in terms of pacing, plot and narrative structure; the dialogue was a good mix of historical anachronism and modern; the costumes were to die for (god, I want Anne's red gown!); the characters were engaging; it was easy to quickly become deeply invested in the show and the story of the history.<br /><br />It's not 'pure' history by any standards, but it's certainly got enough scandal, plotting, sex and pretty in it to satisfy just about anyone with even a mild interest in history and Henry's life.
B000001EXR|4.0|If so.. you already know that this is a good, if under appreciated album.  Pick it up, listen to it... you will like it.
B0015GDVTU|5.0|I really loved this movie. When you feel like crying and laughing this is the one to watch. Love Gerard Butler.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan is the \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" of Star Trek films. Nothing in Trek (or Star Wars) even touches it! As far as Trek movies  go, the only other one that approaches this is VI.  It's too bad that Nick Meyer did not do all the films. This one has it all!    Best Effects  Best Storyline of any Trek film.  Best Acting from Shatner (De Kelly and Nimoy always ruled)  Best Villain! (Khaaaaaan!)  Best Battle Scenes  Best Score (Thank you James Horner)    This movie, along with \\"City On The Edge Of Forever\\" from TOS, is the absolute BEST of all Trek.  Forget TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise - they are all bland and washed out compared to these ballsy masterpieces.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|One of the more entertaining SciFi films to come along for 2008.  Enjoyed it...was good fun.  Can't wait for the sequel.  The DVD was nicely put together.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|By itself this is a cool movie.  The problem is putting it into context with the other videos.  The sequence should be:<br /><br />GITS (1995)<br />Stand Alone Complex (2002-2003)<br />GITS II: Innocence (2004)<br />Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig (2004-2005)<br /><br />However, GITS II and SAC: 2nd Gig to me are so similar they make each other boring and uninteresting.  If you follow the sequence correctly, you'll want to skip the 2nd Gig, but if you are like me and saw the 2nd gig first, then Innocence seems like a rehash of the anime.<br /><br />GITS was a great movie which worked on concepts of self and being in an exciting way.  SAC did the same in new ways, though the philosophy was terribly cute.  GITS II and SAC 2nd Gig though don't have that same compelling philosophical background to make these animes bigger than themselves.  So, while GITS was a 5, this really can't be more than a 3.
B000VSBX34|5.0|I also saw this film at the theatre when I was young.  I also have this in VHS and now in DVD.  I'm happy with my purchase of this dvd.  It's like watching a long music video but better.  Funny as the first movie they made.  I also recommend this film to Beatles' fans as it has a lot of action and comedy.  Even folks who don't know the Beatles' that well can't help but like this one.
0345441184|5.0|This review is for the 2000 hardcover edition by Del Rey - beige cover. I saw it in a bookstore, and it is truly a beautiful edition made with  with quality paper (thick, smooth pages). If you are looking for a collectible item for your library, this is a good choice.
B0000542D2|5.0|The first time I saw the film, I was a kid.  I went to the movies with my grandmother.  I was already of fan of the Beatles and my fave was Paul.  My grandmother and I really enjoyed the movie.  I bought the VHS and I still have it.  Now I have the dvd too.  Such a good film.  I like all things Beatles.  I recommend this movie to the person who needs to see the Fab Four in their native land, singing and larking about.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Exelente Producci&oacute;n. Tanto el CD/DVD son muestra de la perfecci&oacute;n de este cantante llamado Josh Groban. Sus canciones reflejan el sentimiento, la energ&iacute;a y la puresa de la palabras escritas para componer las canciones.<br />RECOMIENDO 100%.
B00150D664|5.0|This is a great book to own if you are a U2 fan, and would like to know more about the members; their history, their past, present, and future...    Fair warning! This book is the hardcover version, and it's very heavy & bulky... I bought this book to take on the bus with me to read, but there's NO WAY I'm gonna try to haul this giant heavy book with me!!!    But other than that, excellent book!
B000VSBX34|5.0|It's really simple; this is my favorite movie. I've seen it dozens of times. It was unavailable for years, so my husband finally saw it (in 9 or 10? segments) on YouTube.  ANYTHING is better than that.<br /><br />To repeat: THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. There are already enough reviews here to explain the \\"why\\" of it.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|Im think this is a great cd. i like the artic monkey,but this will be hard to beat if they ever do a 2nd,cd i see this cd  get 3 stars on most reviews, om mind its 4, and i know what im talking about!!!i've been listen to music a long time , go uk.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|In my freshman literature seminar, I was put on the spot by my professor and asked how I liked Pride and Prejudice. After a few throat clearings, I admitted that I had not been a fan and in fact found the language so dry so as to make the novel boring. I certainly am not alone in thinking this, and most who do tend to be male. That being said, this movie was incredibly entertaining. I've heard marvelous things about the long BBC version (many people watched it instead of reading the book for my seminar), but it's hard to imagine it being better than this. Knightley reminded me of Winona Ryder in Little Women and played her character splendidly. I highly recommend this for girls and guys alike. You'll love the dry British humor and the wonderful scenery. Maybe even more than the book itself.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|Buy it, watch it, enjoy it for what it's worth as a story. Sure it's graphic but with Jake and Heath as real actors...we pretty much know who and what they are in real life. The story would have been less convincing and more focused as \\"gay cowboys\\" if the actors were unknown. Heath did play a quiet, dark man while Jake was an all out lets give in to life and forget what they all think. Anyhow, like Jesus Christ Superstar and The Passion of the Christ, one must review the movie and not make judgements based on others views. Oh and I'm not making comparisons just that those movies also were critiqued for their content too.
B0017KP93U|3.0|Music's fine - can't really quibble with the song selection. But where's the deluxe packaging promised in the advertising blurb? And the \\"essay/liner notes\\" are a load of pompous, posturing drivel that provide minimal insight on the band or its music - an opportunity wasted.
1400079179|5.0|I never used to read fiction books/novels for pleasure. I had to force myself to read required books in college. Then one day, about two years ago, my wife borrowed this book from my brother. I decided to give it a try. I read it in 3 days. I could not put it down. I then proceeded to get Dan Brown's other three books and read them immediately. I now have a personal library collection and read novels every chance I get (Steve Berry, James Rollins, etc.). The story, the puzzles, the twists.....unbelievably well thought out. I am most impatiently awaiting his next novel. Thank you Dan.
B00008EY65|5.0|News flash! The Nazis tried to open up hell! And that's just for starters!<br /><br />What determines a man? That is the question posed at the beginning and the ending of this fun flick steeped in horror and sci-fi and poured out as a quaffable entertainment. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Ron Perlman glows as Hellboy, aptly named as the only thing to survive the explosion to close the gate to Hell. Those closing it are American agents from the Bureau of the Paranormal situated in the States. After defeating the Nazis in the opening scene, they manage to capture little Hell baby who is so cute with his red skin and huge right clay hand and horn knobs on his forehead. Th agents from the Bureau of the Paranormal take him home. After all, he is, well, paranormal.<br /><br />Hellboy grows up with two companions: Abe Sapiens, sort of amphibious man, and Elizabeth, a firestarter. The professor teaches each how to control and utilize their special skills. The viewer learns this during the rolling of the story. We next meet Hellboy as an adult--and here I was expecting fearful scenes, but Hellboy loves cats. That settled it for this viewer. Cats everywhere in his cozy apartment. The professor has trained Hellboy to eliminate monsters. But that is how he is trained. The question again: What manner of man is he?<br /><br />The question is answered in the last action scene. John, the agent assigned as his special assistant makes the case that a man is determined by his choices, what decisions he makes. Man is not destined to be one thing or another. There has always been choice. The fact that the choice is played out in battle with a multitude of hell creatures and a hell monster makes the decision even more memorable.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended film! It is campy, creepy, and with context and comraderie. It't quite different from what you might expect!
0440241413|5.0|I must admit that I got a little bit edgy as I started to read this book.  Past due bills, maxed-out credit cards - who wants to be reminded??  But then the story took over and I fell for Becky Bloomwood - our heroine and financial journalist.  She's fashionably fabulous and just like her, who can resist a good sale?  I loved the \\"Brit-speak\\" and found myself calculating the currency exchange between pounds and dollars - just another little thrill to go along with this funny story.  I enjoyed myself right along with her as she goes about discovering the best deals and felt my own heart skip when she receives the bills and the overdue notices.  It was nice not having to read anything like that with MY name on it - and that's part of the fun too - you can escape the bad stuff and really enjoy the good.  It's a lot of fun reading along and wondering if she'll ever learn her lesson.  Along with the shopping mania, Becky finds love - in the handsome and smart public relations company owner - Luke Brandon.  Right away, you wonder if he's a possible love interest - she doesn't seem that interested at first, but they meet and meet again and you ride right along with the possibility that they just might get together. You get to know her parents, their neighbors, childhood friends, her roommate and a whole cast of characters that build up the story and keep it very interesting.  This book is full of relationships that don't get too heavy, but add just the right snap.  This book \\"goes down nice & easy\\" and I enjoyed it very much.  It's nice when you first discover an author for yourself and are immediately drawn into the characters.  I'm halfway through the next installment in the \\"Shopaholic\\" series and can't wait for more.  I definitely give this book BOTH \\"thumbs up\\"!
B000M4RG42|4.0|Normally I wouldn't purchase a war film and there were a lot of reviews that were pretty negative but I took a chance and am glad I did. This film is not really about war but is a study of human frailty and what can happen when faced with something horrible and ugly such as battle. Many reviewers missed the boat on this film because they were looking for a lot of action and didn't see what was really before them. Some said it was too long and slow and yes it is a longer than average film but in no way did I find it slow and plodding. Some didn't like Clint Eastwoods attention to detail or the fact that there was a lot of back and forth between the present and past but this was needed to fully expose what these tree young men were going through mentally. At least one reviewer disliked the idea of the \\" drunkin indian \\". Ira Hayes didn't become an alcoholic because he was native american, he turned to booze because he couldn't deal with the horrors of what he had to see and do during that war and because he hated being called a hero. Many soldiers turned to alcohol during the war, men of all ethnic groups. Several reviewers compared this film to Saving Private Ryan, big mistake. These films are completely different. This one is designed to make you stop and think about how these three men dealt with the after affects of war. If all you want is a lot of mindless action and shooting then perhaps this is not the film for you. I happen to think it was a good film and all the actors did an outstanding job. This one stands on it's own.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|If you read the book then you are in for a huge disappointment. Anne is not played with half as much cunning as  she is portrayed in the novel. The mother is something of a feminist and stands up for her children rather than plays a submissive woman. It is one thing to have so many historical inaccuracies but to have so many inaccuracies that relate to the novel as well is just ridiculous. Why make the crappy movie at all?     The costumes are beautiful. The Americans trying to mingle with the British is okay. I also think it a bit funny that Anne's necklace is the same one that can sometimes be seen worn by America Ferrera's character on Ugly Betty. I'd rather watch Ugly Betty anyway.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank was an aspiring writer, a young lady, and Jewish girl who was in hiding in the attic in Amsterdam, Netherlands during the horrors of World War II. Anne's personal diary resurrects the actual horrors of the war and the holocaust which claimed her life as well as her mother, sister, and other residents in the attic. Life was hard enough as a Jewish girl in Hitler's time, it was practically impossible to survive much less thrive. This diary explains how Anne coped with daily horrors and daily living situation being unable to speak above a whisper rather than not be heard. Her legacy is her diary and it humanizes the inhuman experiences that harmed so many innocent people regardless of religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Anne writes candidly about her struggles with a sense of optimism. We can only imagine how she survived and thrived in the attic despite her circumstances. You never get the sense that she blamed the world or others for her situation. She has this sense of optimism and hope all through out despite her fate as she died in Bergen-Belsen right before liberation. I wonder if she had lived that the world would never get to know this fascinating young girl as she transformed into a young lady of so much promise and hope. She gives us all hope that life is not always doomed but it's how you look at it.
B0001I561E|5.0|This is as close as we'll ever come to seeing the inside of Robin Williams' brain. They called him in, and as he started to riff, they added more and more animators and essentially drew his creative process. I think he did something like 40 something characters as the genie, including William F. Buckley Jr. and Jack Nicholson. Even if you're not a fan of animation, strap in and take the ride. You won't be disappointed.
0385340567|3.0|Some of the reviewers are puzzled why so many readers give this book three stars despite their obvious disappointment with it. Well, here's my explanation: Reacher alone is worth five stars, as is Child's ability to focus on fascinating bits of minutiae as Reacher meditates on everything from the shape of the perfect coffee cup to the inner workings of a cell phone and to create interesting encounters with peripheral characters. Then there is the good will amassed from the previous Reacher books. We're subtracting stars due to high expectations not met, but not willing to give up on Child or Reacher. I'm torn myself between wanting to express my disappointment, and not wanting to discourage an author who has created a great and memorable character and whose average is mostly riveting. Ironically, this was the first Reacher novel I bought in hardcover, because I had just finished plowing through the rest and couldn't wait, and it was the most disappointing.  It wasn't the book's so-called liberal politics (which some of us might call mere observation). Reacher doesn't exist in a vacuum; he's an intelligent man, and he's complicated enough to be a soldier to the bone without backing everything the military does. But in this book, his motivations were more than usually hard to swallow. He goes out of his way to court trouble, and yet oddly enough - for a thriller - is rarely seriously threatened. His opponents mostly just collapse. (Increasing SPOILERS ahead...) The salt-pepper-sugar triple plot never holds together.  We are asked to believe in a company town so thoroughly controlled that its citizens become a raging mob on cue (like the 'Star Trek' episode where the populace goes crazy when Landro tells them it's the Red Hour) and yet there are enough independent thinkers within it to operate an underground railroad for AWOL soldiers.... Reacher comes and goes, is caught and let go, vaguely menaced by \\"the guy with the wrench\\" or \\"the big foreman\\" but you never are afraid for him or feel any real tension. The book feels like a 200 page plot padded out to 400 pages by repeated visits to the same place and the driving of the same roads, over and over. Once you understand the ultimate threat, you hope for a grand showdown, but the villain is easily defeated, and Reacher's final act - the detonation of a dirty bomb! - is utterly out of character. After all, this is the same Reacher (or should be) who once allowed himself to be kidnapped because he wouldn't risk firing his gun with a trajectory into a crowded intersection. Now, he's willing to create a three mile blast zone (and he could only have guessed the circumference) to prove something? Unfortunately, even the requisite romantic interest left me cold. As usual, she is referred to by her last name - Vaughan - and, as usual, she has a great body, a law enforcement job, and a flexible attitude to being loved and left, but even within those bounds, she never adds up to a real person. She goes rather quickly from being completely indifferent to the evil town next door to aiding and abetting Reacher in his nightly forays, and while her personal situation (which does include a touching episode) could certainly lead to schizophrenic attitudes, her ultimate tirade against Reacher and quick emotional collapse felt forced rather than real and made me positively dislike her, especially when she gave him a completely unnecessary put-down in bed. Hey, lady, Reacher never pretends to be the World's Greatest Lover.  He just acts happy and grateful for it in every book, which is something I like about him, and I suspect other female readers do, too. Which circles back to... five stars for Reacher, with maybe one star off for acting out of character, and another one off for a rather lame plot, but high hopes for the next one out of the gate.
B0015519VS|4.0|I was introduced to Usher in 1993 when his track \\"Call me A Mack\\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 2 Pac and Janet Jackson movie [[ASIN:B00000297F Poetic Justice (1993 Film)]].   To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of the track because I had purchased the soundtrack for songs by Dogg Pound, 2 Pac and Pete Rock & CL Smooth.   When I heard the DeVante Swing produced \\"Can U Get Wit It\\", I quickly changed my thinking.   This song was 100% better than \\"Call Me A Mack\\".   [[ASIN:B0000013G7 Usher]] ended up being his self titled debut and was released in 1994.   \\"Think Of You\\" was the 2nd single and was produced by Puffy and \\"Chucky\\" Thompson.  [[ASIN:B0000013H7 My Way]] was released 3 years later and featured one of my favorite Usher songs of all time \\"You Make Me Wanna\\".  \\"You Make Me Wanna\\", \\"Nice & Slow\\" and the title track pushed the CD to sales of more than 6 million units.   [[ASIN:B00005LKGT 8701]] was released in 2001 after the plan for his original LP was scrapped after the single \\"Pop Ya Collar\\" flopped in the US and several of the tracks had leaked to Napster and other internet sites.   \\"U Remind Me\\" made people easily forget \\"Pop Ya Collar\\" and tracks like \\"U Got It Bad\\", \\"U Don't Have To Call\\" and \\"Can You Help Me\\" proved that the sales from \\"My Way\\" weren't a fluke.   [[ASIN:B0002ZYDKQ Confessions]] was released 3 years later and sold an unheard of 1.1 million units in its first week of release.   \\"Yeah!\\", which featured Lil Jon and Ludacris, was #1 on the charts at the time and the other tracks that I had heard, \\"Burn\\" and \\"Confessions\\" Parts 1 and 2 didn't hurt either.   Once this CD was re-released later in 2004, Usher achieved another #1 track with \\"My Boo\\", which featured Alicia Keys.      When I heard the track \\"Love In This Club\\", I clearly wasn't a big fan of it.   The video was entertaining, especially since Keri Hilson was in the video, but the song or the Part 2 version with Beyonce and Lil \\"T-Pain\\" Wayne doesn't do anything for me.  Maybe if I wasin a club, then I would want to hear it.    The 2nd single, \\"Moving Mountains\\", is a much better track in my opinion.  Usher focuses on the lowlights of his relationship and how all the drama and unexpected turns have caused him to get to the point where he realizes that either she is going to change or this is going to be over for good.   \\"This Ain't Sex\\" is a nice uptempo track that has Usher telling his woman that the physical part of their relationship is just as special as the other aspects of their relationship.   I have heard better Usher slow jams than \\"Trading Places\\" but I am sure that the ladies, married or not, won't mind hearing Usher narrarate a tale where the roles get reversed once in awhile on the date and afterwards in the bedroom.   \\"What's Your Name\\" would be better had will.i.am stayed off of the microphone but once you hear this track you will wonder why tracks like \\"Echo\\" and \\"Dat Girl Right There\\" w/Ludacris were left off of the CD.  If you are married or seeing someone that is worth introducing to your parents then \\"Something Special\\" should be one of your favorite tracks.  Jermaine Dupri and Maunel Seal produce a nice midtempo jam and Usher takes care of the rest with his vocals and honest feelings towards his woman.   \\"Love You Gently\\" is the Usher that I am use to on tracks like \\"Nice & Slow\\", \\"Seduction\\", \\"That's What It's Made For\\" and \\"Can U Handle It\\".  This should be the next single as Andre & Vidal do their job on the production like they have been doing with Jill Scott, Musiq Soulchild, etc. for years.   \\"Best Thing\\" clearly isn't the best track, but I can definitely relate to the subject matter as hopefully Usher has definitely dedicated his last song to Chili.   I have heard better Jay Z performances but if you have been a man in this situation before, you will be able to relate to this track.   The same can be said for \\"Before I Met You\\".   Once again, I have heard better Usher slow jams but the subject matter is clearly something that any man that is married or actually committed in a relationship can relate to.  Stargate and Ne-Yo have teamed up once again on another r&b release on \\"His Mistakes\\".   Usher talks about a situation where he is tired of paying for the mistakes that one of his woman's ex's made.  He understands that there is a recovery period, but Usher feels that he has been paying for those mistakes made by other men for too long.   Amen!  \\"Appetite\\" has Usher remaining commited to his woman but he also is fighting with the side that still wants to creep and be with other women. In the end, he realizes that staying committed to his woman is the #1 priority.  Stargate is back once again with \\"What's A Man To Do\\" as Usher talks about a situation where he allowed a possible love triangle to form as his heart is now in 2 different places with 2 different faces as he puts it.  He wants to be honest, but he knows that being honest may cost him both of his women.   Usher's brother, James \\"J Lack\\" Lackey, who also produced Lloyd's \\"Get It Shawty\\", produces a stellar midtempo jam in \\"Lifetime\\".   Usher reaffirms his dedication to his woman as he discusses almost giving up on love and appreciating the fact that he has found the right woman for him.   The album closes with the stellar title track that is produced by Dre & Vidal.   If you are in any type of commited relationship, you should be able to appreciate this track.  This is clearly my favorite track on this CD.  If you can wait out the silence inbetween you will also catch the bonus track \\"Will Work For Love\\".  It isn't a bad track, but you will understand why it's a bonus track after a couple of listens.      Overall, other than both versions of \\"Love In This Club\\", you get a pretty good CD, in my opinion.    Is it on the level of \\"Confessions\\"?   No, but this CD is clearly better than all of these 1 star and 2 star reviews that I am seeing.   If you like both versions of \\"Love In This Club\\" and you don't like the rest of theCD, then I can understand that.   Some people want to hear a whole CD of \\"Yeah\\", \\"That's What It's Made For\\", \\"Nice & Slow\\", and \\"Can U Handle It\\" everytime he comes out with a CD.   At  the time that \\"Confessions\\" was made, he had just broke up with Chili and he was fighting with the fact that he still loved her and how he thought she would forgive him for finally being honest.  Fast forward 4 years later and Usher now has a wife and a son.   You can't expect that everytime an artist releases a CD that you will get the same type of CD every single time.   I feel that a fairer rating of this CD is between 3 and a half and 4 stars.    If you enjoyed Usher's past work, then I don't see any reason why you shouldn't enjoy this CD after a couple of listens.    James' Top 5    1) Here I Stand  2) His Mistakes  3) This Ain't Sex  4) Lifetime  5) Moving Mountains    Honorable Mention:    Love You Gently  Something Special  Before I Met You  Best Thing w/Jay Z  Trading Places

B0014Z4ON4|4.0|A year before the events of \\"Raiders of The Lost Ark\\", Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is in Shanghai enjoying an evening of entertainment and making a deal with a ruthless gang of Chinese mobsters for a ancient Chinese artifact. But after a bad deal, he escapes on a plane from Shanghai with spoiled nightclub singer Willie (Kate Chapshaw) and 11 year old Chinese boy ShortRound (Ke Hu Quan)as later they crash land in the Himalayas and find themselves stranded in the jungles. Only until they discover a village where the children of the village has been taken including sacred stones by a cult, it's up to Indy and his two new companions to head to the palace of a young prince where beneath it an evil cult called Thugees and their warlock master Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) has captured the children of the village into slaves and Indy must save them.<br /><br />Considered the black sheep of the franchise, this entertaining and quite dark installment is underrated by fans of the first and third movies. Steven Spielburg directs once again and George Lucas produced and made the film's storyline, this movie is often scorned by fans because of Kate Capshaw with her complaining & screaming and of course ShortRound. Well i disagree on the ShortRound character cause he did provided some laughs and i agree that Kate Capshaw's character was a pain in the butt, the film did had good atmosphere with some memorable action sequences like the mine cart chase. There's a sense of creepiness through the film like the memorable bug area, some dark humor like the disgusting feast sequence and the gory but effective moments like the infamous heart ripping sequence that caused the MPAA to create the \\"PG-13\\" rating in 1984. Despite some flaws, the movie is a gritty and exciting but it's not as good as \\"Raiders\\" or \\"Last Crusade\\" nor as fun as \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" but it's not as bad as some fans proclaimed.<br /><br />This DVD has excellent picture and sound quality from THX with some goodies like an introduction by Steven Spielburg and George Lucas, two featurettes, Storyboard sequence, photo galleries and interactive DVD-Rom Lego Indiana Jones game demo.troduction by Steven Spielburg and George Lucas, two featurettes, Storyboard sequence, photo galleries and interactive DVD-Rom Lego Indiana Jones game demo.
B00006BSGZ|3.0|The disc is OK - but the sound leaves something to be desired. However, I have a tape of the same concert and the sound is equally poor, so we have to blame the old-fashioned technology. However, by the time you have paid for postage and packing and then customs and VAT, the discs are very expensive.

Pack could barely be classified as used & new, since the box was in bad shape, discs were bouncing inside and it was a miracle they aren't (too) messed up. Video quality is average.

0962477060|5.0|99% of books out there are written with a piano-centric bent and of all the books I own this is the first that is for guitarists as 1st class citizens!  My only suggestions are: 1) You HAVE to get the DVD with it. While the book is GREAT there are some concepts that once you see on the DVD make easy sense while without it you can be left very confused. 2) is use supplemental books on theory (if you want a more in depth understanding). Bill teaches as if you are with him for personal lessons but it is impossible to tailor the teaching style to your learning style in a book or DVD. He does an excellent job of getting the information to you in a way 99% of people will understand.   What's more is at the end of the first DVD he shows you some very simple leads that will have your friends and family amazed.  The VERY best part of the whole series is the author himself. He will actually answer emailed questions and spend a ton of time helping you understand concepts in the book. I even had to call him (about an error with my credit card-I ordered direct from him) and he spent over an hour on the phone with me talking about theory, guitarists and how the series was developed.  My point is that these books are written by someone who really cares about your improvement and didn't just do this to make money.    He even let on that he is in the process of getting the vol III DVD together. Get the first two with the DVD so you will be ready for the vol III DVD and you will be 20 years ahead of where you are now in a year. I don't review many things but this is one that I truly believe in. My only regret is wasting 20 years before I found his series otherwise you would all know my name and mention me with the likes of EVH. Oh well, I'll work on that for next year :)

0786948523|5.0|The new monster manual (MM) is a vast improvement over the 3.5 MM. The new system of minions and standard monsters MAKES SENSE, not all monsters know how to take punishment. The new monster stat blocks are so much easier to read and use, you no longer have to look through 3 books to use a monster. When I ran my game, I found it so much easier to use then the 3.5 manual.The art work is also fantastic, and there are several new monsters that are very cool and innovative.     Yes, there is less description of the monster in this MM then in 3.5. BUT THAT'S GOOD. It's the DM's job to fit a monster into his campaign, and I find that all too often the stereotypes portrayed in the 3.5 MM don't fit with the way I want that monster to in my campaign. All the time I find myself telling my players that, \\"Hey, in my world, this monster is different...\\" And it is so hard to break the stereotype that player get about monsters. This books gives the DM leeway to reinvent monsters for their particular campaign. The 4th edition MM doesn't attempt to define every monster. Overall this new MM is a great tool for DMs, and a superb edition to the already superb 4th edition of D&D.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Of the four Sarah Brightman CDs I own, this is my favorite. I can listen to it over and over. Her La Luna CD is aslo a good choice.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I recently bought the set to watch before the movie came out. I was a little hesitant after reading about the problems other people had with some of the disks. After watching the entire set, every disk played perfectly. I had zero problems and everything arrived better than I could of hoped.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Purists have and will continue to argue this particular release into the ground with a host of complaints that range from \\"The audio mix is bad!\\" to \\"Lady Madonna was never number one on the charts!\\"  But while it may come as deep shock to them, not every one approaches The Beatles as if they were holy relics, not everyone considers them \\"essential,\\" and not every one feels it necessary to purchase every album the band made.<br /><br />Quite obviously I tend to fall into this category.  I like quite a few of The Beatles' recordings, but they never spoke me in a gotta-have-it way, and although I like \\"Come Together\\" I'm not going to buy ABBEY ROAD in order to obtain it.  But while this compilation doesn't include every one of my favorites, it does include enough of them to make me willing to put a few of my hard-earned dollars on the table.<br /><br />It is true that #1 is open to \\"number one according to who?\\" arguments, but even so the collection does gather twenty-seven of the band's best known and most popular releases--and also offers a fairly good overview of their style as they moved from mop-top-pop to psychedelia with plenty of innovation and serious musicianship along the way.  It may be true that some of the songs sound better in original monoaural; it may be true that every selection could stand a meticulous remastering--but I personally had no complaints about sound quality.<br /><br />This is really a recording for two classes of listeners: novices who know little about the band and would like to test the waters and old hands who like certain songs but don't like them well enough to go to the expense of replacing scratched up albums with CDs.  You'll still have to do that if you want the likes of \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" and \\"Octopus Garden\\"--but this collection really does hit most of the obvious notes.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B000066SJZ|4.0|I'll start by saying, Toto is my favorite band of all-time, bar none!    Having said that, I don't think this multichannel SACD got the treatment it deserved. As expected from one of the finest recordings of its time, the stereo track is awesome........but, I and I imagine most, people buy SACD for the multichannel track, and I don't think this one delivers. The only song that is really \\"opened up\\" in 5.1 is Africa, every other track appears to just have a bit of reverb or echo here and there. Not the precise localisation of instruments around the listener you get on some other SACD recordings. I must say, my expectations of this SACD was quite high when I heard Elliot Schiener was involved in the 5.1 mix, which makes it even more disappointing having heard some fantastic sounding 5.1 mixes he has done in the past. Eagles, Hell freezes over and Fleetwood Mac, The Dance, to name just two. I only have a few SACD/DVD-AUDIO discs to compare it to, and it falls short compared to the likes of  Pink Floyd, Dark side of the moon and The Eagles, Hotel California.    Don't get me wrong, I love this album, and I believe it should be a staple in every bodies record collection, but the multichannel version could have been better.    Cheers, Wags.
B0014466LI|1.0|This is Def Leppard's best album by far and no mean feat considering the drummer only had one arm by this time! Every track is brilliant and every pain-staking detail was taken in the recording which means the sound quality is also very, very good for a 1987 disc. It's frightening how much better it'll sound once they get around to remastering this thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not one of those times.  Given the very hefty price tag on this thing in order to justify upgrading from your existing copy, it has got to be a major improvement at least from the aesthetics of the cardboard sleeve and especially when it comes to sound quality.  The cardboard sleeve is nothing to shout about given what is currently out there e.g. The Band, Hall & Oates etc that have been very well designed from thicker good quality cardboard which is so well assembled that you don't fear it coming apart when the glue wears out like it is here.  The inclusion of the inner jacket replica and an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese also isn't enough to justify a ridiculously expensive upgrade either.<br /><br />The biggest crime though is the SHM-CD \\"remastered\\" sound quality which is really very, very poor.  In fact, my existing old copy sounds even better!  Listening to both, there is nothing to distinguish between the two except for the cardboard sleeve with the SHM-CD label on the front and the vastly different sound quality which is so much better on the old copy.  I'm very very disappointed to have waited so long and this is what they have come up with: poor mlps design and very, very poor sound quality that is even worse than my existing old copy.  I have placed SHM-CD orders for other albums that are due to reach me soon and I hope and pray that they are much, much better remastered versions than this one.<br /><br />Given the very high price on this baby for a version that is so much worse than the unremastered old cd that you already have, this is a rip off and a major waste of money in these uncertain economic times.<br /><br />Avoid with as wide a berth as possible!f money in these uncertain economic times.    Avoid with as wide a berth as possible!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I normally do not take the time to endorse products, but I have to with Jillian Michaels's 30-Day Shred because it's just fantastic!  Prior to trying the video, I had been running/walking on the treadmill for an hour a day, seven days each week, with very minimal weight loss results.  In addition, I restricted my calories to about 1200/day, but still...I was lucky if I lost two pounds each month.  Once I started doing the Shred, however, the pounds began to melt away--I've now lost 23--and my body has not been this toned since high school, which is saying a lot after two children!  Like some of the other reviewers, I alternate levels sometimes, and also do about an hour of cardio each day too, so I cannot comment on whether or not the Shred would work well by itself.  But coupled with a little extra cardio, I believe that most people will see the results that they want.  Yes, the video is challenging, but there's something inherently satisfying about pushing one's body to the limits.  In addition, as Jillian says, when you push your body and achieve success and confidence, that transcends into all areas of your life--I am living proof of this, as I am now training for my first half marathon--something that, even six months ago, I would have thought an absurdity for me given the shape I was in.  I highly recommend this video, both because it actually works, and because Jillian is very motivating.

Although all the tracks have been tuned down to E flat tuning for the guitar (so if you've been trying to play along with the cd and have been finding it hard to do so this is the reason) this is done to accommodate David Lee Roth's singing range. While the first two albums showcase the brilliant guitar genius of Eddie Van Halen, this album involves the rest of the band a little more and takes a little of the spotlight off the guitarist alone which is a good thing as it shows a band that is growing together as a unit.<br /><br />The remastering though is the 2001 version and so if you already have the old cd of this version, I'm struggling to find any extra value that will justify the hefty price tag on this baby when you are essentially paying for cardboard that isn't one of the better mlps designs that I've seen out there.  The cardboard is thin and flimsy and looks as if it will come apart once the glue gets old.  For examples of good mlps designs, check out The Band and Hall & Oates releases which are simply works of art on good quality thicker and stronger cardboard.<br /><br />This is essential listening although this mlps version does not represent good value for money and if you already have a 2001 remastered version in the jewel case, you are better off sticking to it as this is no real upgrade to me.

B00177Y9ZC|5.0|If you enjoy sci-fi action this is the movie to watch.  It can be slow at parts, but the visual affects and the actual idea of a jumper far out weighs any negative side effects.  This movie is only part 1 of a trilogy so keep in mind if something dosen't make sense, or is not fully explained, you will more than likely have everything cleared up for you in the coming movies.  Hayden Christensen did an excellent job in this movie, if you enjoyed his acting style, and expressions in the Star Wars movies, you will enjoy him in this movie.  Samuel L. Jackson also plays a terrific bad guy.  This movie is definetly a keeper.
0321356683|5.0|The second edition of \\"Effective Java\\" is almost like a completely different book from the first.  There were new chapters addressing Java 5 topics such as generics, enums and  autoboxing.  Existing patterns were rewritten for Java 5/6 - both conceptually and for the code examples.  For example, overloading now address varargs.  The number of items grew from 57 to 78 as well and the author removed the old ones that are obsolete.<br /><br />As a reference, chapter one provided a table to quickly find items on Java 5.  The appendix provided a cross mapping to find items from the first edition in this copy.<br /><br />For those new to \\"Effective Java\\", it is meant for intermediate to advanced Java developers.  It provides best practices, recipes and idioms for working with Java.  The author is good about listing both advantages and disadvantages to choose when to apply a tip.<br /><br />When thinking about my favorite chapter, I have trouble picking just one.  I'm torn between the concurrency and enum chapters.  The book goes beyond the common \\"use enums over constants\\" and goes into things like EnumBitSets.<br /><br />I learned a lot reading the first edition of this book and learned just as much reading the second.  If you have the first edition, but this one anyway.  And if you haven't read the first edition, get your hands on the latest copy!
0375842209|5.0|My 13-year old niece is an avid reader and for her birthday each year, I usually pick out several books. I perused the Youg Reader's section at PageOne bookstore in Albuquerque and there was the Book Thief.     Of course, I always read my selections before I hand them over, and I can say that I have never been as moved by a tale since I read the Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank. When I read Anne's story at eleven, I had no idea that my own mother and grandmother had survived the Holocaust, fleeing Paris in 1941 to hide in the South of France. Hide in plain sight.    The Book Thief is so much more than the story of an illiterate girl growing up in Nazi Germany who adores her father and learns to read. It's the story of how love transforms, a love of words, a love of books, a love of the hungry Jews marched through her town on their way to Dachau, a life of stealing back what the Nazi's could not burn or take away.     It's the story of Liesel, and how an extraordinary young girl learns to stand up to death and find solace in the most ordinary of things. You will not forget her.    The book reminds me of my grandmother and mother, and those in my family who did not run, who died in Drancy or Auschwitz, and I hope my niece will take away as much from this book as I did.     If you've read this book, buy it for a friend. I immediately recommended it to my book club. If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?

He makes such a good heavy/mid-level manager.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if you can handle extreme violence with your laughs. It's a real crowd pleaser.
B00144VBBS|1.0|Toby Keith's 35 BIGGEST hits? My God, the only thing bigger than this guy's cowboy hat is his ego. Granted, he's had a few hits since 2001, when a national tragedy lurched him into the spotlight with \\"The Angry American.\\" I'll also admit that since I live north of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the Hudson River, I don't have cause to hear his stuff with regularity, but saying that Toby Keith had 35 hits (and according to the title, that's only the `biggest' ones) is like saying that Bucky Dent (a `Yankee') hit 35 home runs a year - It just ain't so. Who does this guy think he is? Elvis? Hank? George? Hell, even the estates of Lefty and Jimmie had the good taste to restrain themselves from such pomposity.<br /> I guess I don't need to tell you that contemporary country music is certainly not about restraint, and Toby Keith is the perfect representative for the state of contemporary country music. As the old joke goes, `everything's big in Texas,' and these days, everything's big in country music, from the size of the hat to the size of the production. Problem is, that production is so bland that it's generic. Synthesized keyboards and processed echo dominate most of these tracks. You could erase Keith's voice and replace it with some Celine Dion drivel, and you'd end up with a perfectly serviceable (and perfectly awful) pop album. About the only thing that defines this as `country music' is the subject matter (cowboys, drinking, divorce, trucks...) and Keith's big ol' hat. I thought that songwriting style and instrumentation were the main factors in determining whether or not something was `country', but I guess I'm just too old-school.<br /> If Toby Keith is writing for the `contemporary' country audience, though, then he must think they're a bunch of dumb-%$es. He overstates the obvious on virtually every song and leaves nothing for the listener to discern. A good example is his jingoistic rally cry for American revenge (Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue\\"). Another example of a guy who simply can't imply anything that can be overtly spewed  is \\"I Wanna Talk about Me.\\" He just doesn't know how to be subtle, does he? It's telling when the best song on disk one is a duet with Sting (\\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\\"), and the best song on disk two is a duet with Willie (Beer for My Horses\\"). I know a lot of country fans will figure that I'm the dumb-a%#, but if this is Country, then I'll let Celine Dion eat my hat.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|I was hoping for more from Next. The premise was so interesting. The story seemed like a winner to me. But in Next they just didn't do very much with it.<br /><br />A man that can see two minutes into the future gave me visions of an action movie version of [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]]. Instead we wind up with Nicholas Cage as a [[ASIN:B000B8LWZS Neo]]-clone. I wouldn't think seeing two minutes into the future would give anybody superhuman reflexes enough to dodge bullets fired point blank from a machine gun.<br /><br />Really this is a two star movie that was bumped up a star by an extremely well done shoot-out near the end. Also, Julianne Moore shows us that really she's too good to be doing this stuff. Still, since she's here she does her part gamely
1847670911|3.0|\\"Dreams from my Father\\" is a well-written and interesting memoir by the emotionally disturbed neurotic who just captured the Democratic nomination for president. Mr. Obama- whose therapeutic efforts at dealing with abandonment, self-esteem and identity issues involve writing books, running for public office and generally sticking it to Whitey- here reveals the detailed roots of his very obvious mental problems. Despite being debunked as self-serving fiction by the very people populating this narrative, this book nevertheless serves a valuable function as insight into Obama's imaginary personal mythology. What's important here isn't the literal truth of the events described but what this inventive tale that Obama has woven about himself actually tells us about the man. And what that story tells us about the Man Who Would Be King is that this country is on the verge of enthroning a delusional Black nationalist fanatic with a Messiah complex and daddy issues. Just as the world had no excuse for being unaware of Hitler's ambitions, since he had detailed them quite openly in \\"Mein Kampf\\", we are unable to plead ignorance of the fact that Obama should be in a psychiatrist's office, not the Oval Office. Don't say you haven't been warned, America.<br /><br />As I mentioned, this is a well-written book with an engaging story. I find it hard to believe that it wasn't written without the help of a ghost-writer, since it seems to employ way too many slick novelistic tricks for a young, first-time author to have mastered, but since no attribution is given we'll have to give the devil his due. Obama is a sympathetic protagonist; one can well understand his anger and obsession with a horndog father who abandoned him. We feel his confusion and pain growing up without a clear racial identity. And we can see his frustration with a irresponsible mother whose sole purpose in life seems to have been to chase after dark-skinned men, whatever the consequences for her children. I think we can understand why Obama was driven to become a drug-abusing, emotionally fragile, half-crazed, Black nationalist SOB. The only problem is that he doesn't seem to have gotten over his problems at the time of this book's writing, and I am unaware that he has overcome them now that he's running for president.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it was his mother and grandparents who raised him, Obama displays little love or sympathy towards them. Instead, throughout the book, Obama's attitude towards his White family (the only one he knew) seems to be one of dismissive scorn. He constantly cuts down his grandparents and derides them as clueless buffoons, i.e. the \\"typical White\\" people of recent political controversy. His mother he reduces to nothing more than a silly liberal girl with a bad case of jungle fever, which was probably true, but it's still a good example of the man's egotistical callousness that he could trash his own mother like that, especially when she did a darn sight more for him than the rutting dog who sired him. What's funny is that other accounts describe his relationship with his mother and grandparents as warm and close. Perhaps he threw them under the bus here to gain a little \\"street cred\\" in the Black community. Towards White people in general he has nothing but contempt. From around the age of 12 he began to identify himself as Black and see the world through a Black nationalist lens. One example of his madness is his admission that the presence of a White Santa Claus in a Sears catalogue drove him to rage. We are given no indication that his views have ever changed, especially since he attended a racist Black church up until a few weeks ago and only disavowed its pastor under political pressure. Far from being the post-racial candidate that idiotic college students see him as, Obama is utterly obsessed with the issue of race and the advancement of the people he sees as his own. However, Black people should take cold comfort in his racial andpolitical loyalty; in an unending series of internal monologues redolent of JD from \\"Scrubs\\", Obama critically analyzes the character and motivation of everyone he comes across and almost invariably finds them- Black and White- pitiable in comparison to his Royal Superciliousness. Barack Obama is the Black Holden Caulfield- he's the only pure and righteous teenager in a world full of phonies.<br /><br />Obama's famous trip to Kenya may have given him the satisfaction of knowing (half) his roots, but we have no evidence that it quieted the demons that disturb him. Even at the end of the book, Obama admits that he longs for \\"a time before Babel\\" when, presumably, there are no races, nations, or bad people, where cupcakes are plentiful and he can have his daddy back. Such sentiments are fine for poets and small children, but the man with his finger on the button needs to have his feet on the ground. Get over it already! Barack Obama reveals himself here to be an angry and arrogant 34 year old man who sees White people as the enemy, who is still pining over an absent daddy, and whose childhood scars seem to have left him with a juvenile desire to live in a fantasy world unrelated to realistic possibilities. Has he really changed that much in the intervening years? I'm not carrying water for McCain- I think they're both certifiable. As a wise man once said- \\"If Obama and McCain are the answer, then it must have been a pretty stupid question.\\"alty; in an unending series of internal monologues redolent of JD from \\"Scrubs\\", Obama critically analyzes the character and motivation of everyone he comes across and almost invariably finds them- Black and White- pitiable in comparison to his Royal Superciliousness.

B0011UBDTK|5.0|This just arrived today and I am very excited to finally own the set.  However, I thought the pink velvet case would come in the cool Plexiglass cover my friend's came in.  I was able to get mine at the $109 price, so I don't think I'll exchange it for the $196 set just because of the box.  But if I was buying it now, and the 2007 set is $199, and the 2005 is $196, I would get the 2005 set just so I could have the plexiglass box that protects the pink velvet cover.  It just goes along with the fancy shoes, and self-indulgence of the show.  And it is so far from my life of crayons, diapers, and strep throat that is being a mom and nurse.  I want the fancy box!!!
B000YENUI6|4.0|This is a terrific movie. Viggo Mortensen gives a fantastic performance as a Russian gangster. The plot is inventive and the look inside the world's most brutal organized crime group is fascinating. However, this movie literally doesn't have an ending. A minor plot point is tied up towards the  end of the movie, but the main conflict of the story is left unresolved. Cronenberg doesn't seem like the kind of director who makes sequels and I've heard nothing about a sequel, so I guess we just have to draw the conclusion that he's just a bad storyteller. Either that or the studio ran out of money or someone misplaced the last portion of the script. Either way, it's a real let down.<br /><br />As a digression, it should be noted that this movie deceptively misinforms us as to the ethnic/religious makeup of the \\"Russian\\" Mafia. Of course these criminals can in no way be regarded as true Christians, but by the huge crucifix tattooed on Viggo Mortensen's chest and the fact that the Russian mobsters celebrate Christmas, Cronenberg not surprisingly is trying to make us think that the \\"Russian\\" mafia is  made up of native Russian Orthodox people when in fact the Russian Mafia is almost entirely Jewish. An enlightening expose of the Russian mafia is Robert Friedman's [[ASIN:0756757525 Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America]]. It would have been interesting for this movie to have shown how law enforcement's war against the Russian Mafia is being hampered by Jewish organizations who fear the anti-semitism that would result from the prosecution of a predominantly Jewish crime group. Friendman reveals:<br /><br />\\"...law enforcement did little to stem the rising tide of the Russian mob....A large part of the problem was political: the Russian mob was predominantly Jewish. It was for that reason, asserted Campanella and other New York State and federal law enforcement officials, that seven years after Campanella's two-man Russian mob unit in the NYPD was inaugurated, it was shut down in a highly politicized, characteristically New York City type of reaction. The effort had come under considerable criticism from the Jewish establishment, which complained that the adverse publicity generated in the hunt for Russian Jewish criminals would foster anti-Semitism and jeopardize the continued emigration of Russian Jews to Israel and the West.\\" (Red Mafiya, pg 83)in a highly politicized, characteristically New York City type of reaction.

0743454537|5.0|I recently read \\"Nineteen Minutes,\\" and really enjoyed the book...and the unexpected ending. Considering how much I liked it I decided to try this one. I have to say I thought long and hard about the title, and the meaning of the book while reading. I was sure I would be able to sum up the ending. Finally, about 100 pages left in the book I \\"had it.\\" I knew where the book was going and I think I was more excited I figured it out before the ending was revealed. Then...wham...a totally unexpected \\"thing\\" happens and it was nothing I could have ever prepared for in an ending. I hope all Picoult's books are this amazing, because I think she's found a new fan! Her books are so envolved and require the reader to step back and look at the whole picture...sometimes...it's pretty tough!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|As a septuagenarian one is faced with sometimes alarming changes in nearly every facet of one's daily life.  Among the plethora of differences between life in 2008 and 1948 (I was already a teenager then) is what is permissable on the screen, large and small. (Television literally did not exist, nor did the dial telephone, if you can imagine.) Despite my adapting (sometimes willingly and sometimes kicking and screaming), violence (anything bloody) continues to appall me. But not in this incredibly brilliant series, in which the masterful writing and acting create that which makes the otherwise incomprehensible thesis and all that is connected to it fitting . . . suitable . . . I was told by the young couple who recommended I see it not to miss a single episode.  I not only hold with their wise suggestion but add, \\"Do not miss a moment of an episode.\\"  Not merely because of the excellence but because every second . . . every nuance is necessary to comprehend the essence of the totality.  I have, in fact, not only separated myself from Bush supporters but from those who didn't \\"get\\" DEXTER.
0439796636|5.0|I decided to pick up War Horse after the nice, new cover caught my eye in a local bookstore and immediately brought it home, cracked open the cover, and allowed myself to be swept off into Joey's story.<br />I love the fact that this book comes directly from the \\"horses point of view,\\" which is similar strikingly familiar to Black Beauty by Anna Sewell as to compared to Michael Morpurgo's War Horse.<br />The story starts out with the description of a painting of a horse, and than jumps into the horse painted in the picture, Joey, who is bought by a farmer and brought home to Albert, who loves and cares for him similar to Joe Green did in Black Beauty. The stories end similar, with different twist. But we aren't focusing on Black Beauty here...<br />Joey ends up being sold into war, where he learns the task of bearing men through the machine fire of war, dragging the dead away in carts and even being used to pull the cannons to the front lines. His life is hard, but he does the best he can under many different owners, the majority of them kind and caring, from going to the English to the Germans themselves, we see the innocence of the Deutschlanders struggle to fight the war against the British and the French.  Joey also makes close friends with a fellow war horse called Topthorn, a tall, black stallion that seems a lot like Ginger. The two remain together for a long time, always partnered up and never too far away from the other.<br />All the while Joey wonders about Albert.<br />This is a nice story to read to anyone whom loves horses and there point of view on things. The war that Joey took part in was a frightening one and isn't for young children. I found this a nice read and a nice companion to Black Beauty. So if you love World War I, and horses, try picking up and reading War Horse.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater are an amazing group of musicians, and Octavarium epitomises them, in my opinion. I really liked everything in this album, from the slow \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" to the epic 24-minute title track that ends this album.    I always feel it's best to start an album with the second or third best song on the album, so as to hook the listener, but keep space for something better to come. And I must say, starting with \\"The Root of All Evil\\" really fit this. It's a great song, and one of my favourites from Dream Theater, but I think \\"These Walls\\" and \\"Octavarium\\" are better.    What I really like about this album is that each song sounds almost completely different from all the others on the album. \\"The Root of All Evil\\" is a heavy, driving piece, \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is a slow ballad, \\"These Walls\\" is another driving piece with slightly more electronic influences, \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is probably the most uplifting-sounding of all the songs, \\"Panic Attack\\" is another driving piece with still more electronic influences, \\"Never Enough\\" sounds kind of like a Muse song, but ten times better, \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is uplifting-sounding, but still nice and heavy, and \\"Octavarium\\" is just epic. \\"Octavarium\\" has I think four or five style changes within it, so I can't really classify it with just one sound.    Another one of my personal beliefs is that a band should end an album with their best and/or most epic piece. Now while \\"These Walls\\" is my favourite song, \\"Ocatvarium\\" is truly epic. My favourite part of the song is probably from about 16 minutes to about 20 minutes.    So yeah, this is my favourite Dream Theater album to date, and I think it's their heaviest album to date as well.

B0017I1FNK|5.0|There's a certain ruminative, even wistful, tenor to this latest Emmylou Harris CD -- she seems, (dare it be said about a country-rock, roots, alternative singer?) genuinely spiritual, or at least philosophical, about the meaning of her life.  And by extension the meaning of everybody's life.  She's always had that in her music; witness \\"Prayer in Open D\\" or \\"The Pearl\\", but here it has some of the resonance of an organ in a church on a fine Sunday morning.  Granted, as that one philistine reviewer has it, some of the old rockabilly rhythms are gone, but some things are more important than others and this album is about those things.  People are going to differ about which track is the most appealing, but taken as a whole the CD represents an exquisitely developed sensibility, the highest musicianship, the most uncompromising production values and a voice that can make angels weep.  I, for one, thank God we have her.  Six Stars.
B00151G08Y|5.0|This album is wonderful, from start to finish. The selection may be a bit small(10 tracks), but every song could be two or three rolled into one. Although this is still Drum&Bass at it's core, Pendulum have done an amazing job of combining Rock with electronica. Some songs are very 80's, some very 90's, but all are uniquely Pendulum.
B0010X745K|3.0|The movie started off well. The hero goes downstairs with his family to wait out the storm. The next day he goes out with his son to pick up supplies. I like the scene with everyone in the store starting to panic when the bleeding man come running into the place. I even like the scene when the young man got suck out the garage door. Then it went down hill for me, the bible, thumping preacher woman was so over the top. I expect her to die when the bug laid on her chest. Instead, it turn around and left. It didn't mine killing the check-out girl. I guess the grisly scenes was to keep the audience from noticing the bad plot. Just when I think this movie can't get any worst, they threw in a crappie ending into the mix. The Hero, kills everyone in the car, so he can save them from a horrible fate. Oh, he just happen to run out bullet, so he can't kill himself. He gets to face the creatures alone. Only, it not a creature, it the army. I gave this movie a three because I like the first thirty minute.

It's certainly understandable that isn't for every taste, but the specific criticisms on the book's style simply are not valid.    The prose is not plodding nor is it purple. Mameh is not one-dimensional. Conflict comes naturally from the characters, and the characters are created with care, credibility, and (as much as we can know) historical accuracy.

1423101464|5.0|THE BATTLE OF THE LABYRINTH is the fourth book of Rick Riordan's projected five-book opus, PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS.  The series began with THE LIGHTNING THIEF and has constantly picked up steam as it's progressed.  I've been reading the series to my son, and we're looking at the fifth and final book coming out next year with a mixture of anticipation and dread.<br /><br />We want the next book.  We want to know how everything turns out for Percy, Grover, Annabeth, and the rest, but we don't want the adventure to end.  Riordan's imagination and zest for action is matched only by his wit and humor.  We've become fans and end up talking about the books and Greek mythology quite often.<br /><br />If you haven't read the series yet, you've missed out on a lot.  And you'll probably want to stop reading this review now.  Otherwise you're going to trip across some spoilers for the earlier three books.  Riordan's books, Percy's adventures, are an organic tale, growing and adding to canon with each new volume.  Things just don't stay the same in Percy's ever-changing world.<br /><br />Well, nothing stays the same except Percy's continuing bad luck with schools.  At the beginning of this one, Percy's mom has a new boyfriend that gets Percy into a well-respected school that Percy normally wouldn't have a shot at with his past record of suspicious destruction.  Sure enough, almost as soon as Percy sets foot on school grounds, he's attacked by demonic cheerleaders (the empousai, from Greek myth) and the school BURNS.<br /><br />I couldn't help laughing throughout the section as I read it.  Friends of Percy are going to be blown away by the sequence even though they're expecting it.  My son and I kept cracking each other up for days afterward.  These books just keep on giving!<br /><br />The book turns more serious, to a degree, when Luke's plans to invade Camp Half-Blood are revealed.  Luke, Percy's arch-enemy, is still trying to bring the Titan Kronos back to life so he can wreak vengeance against the Greek gods.  Camp Half-Blood, because it houses and trains so many of the demi-gods - the children of the gods with mortal parents, is a prime target.<br /><br />As always, Riordan establishes the roots of his story in traditional Greek myth.  This one deals with Daedalus, the famed inventor that created the Labyrinth that housed the Minotaur.  According to Riordan's story, the Labyrinth has become - to a degree - a living thing that continues growing throughout the world and time.  I loved the concept and my son was totally engrossed in the idea that the world was honeycombed with magical tunnels.  This is the kind of thinking I've come to rely on the author for.<br /><br />There are other adventures that take place before Percy, Annabeth, and Grover find an opening to the Labyrinth and climb down inside it, but once they're in place the adventure kicks into high gear.  They're chasing after Nico, the son of Hades, that no one else at the camp knows about.  Percy feels guilty about the death of Nico's sister and doesn't want everyone weirding out about the younger boy.  Percy still believes he has a chance to set things straight between him and Nico.<br /><br />Grover's situation has gotten more dire regarding his hunt for the god, Pan.  With all the failures Grover has racked up, the satyr community is thinking about pulling Grover's searcher's license, which means he can't continue hunting for Pan.  A lot of things are at stake in this one.<br /><br />Tyson, Percy's Cyclopean half-brother, stars in this one as well.  I have to admit, Tyson is one of my favorite characters in the books.  Tyson, with all his childish innocence, has won a special place in the hearts of my son and I.  Every time Tyson's on stage we're just waiting to see what he's going to say or do.  In this one, Tyson gets to meet Briares, one of the Hundred-Handed Ones, an ancient from Greek myth.  Briares's reaction to his jailer is hilarious and I don't want to spoil it, but my son and I went around doing it for days, to the point my wife believed we'd taken leave of our senses.  She hasn't quite gotten into the Olympian view yet.<br /><br />In addition to all the great imagery and dialogue, Riordan continues piling on the Greek mythology in this one.  I love how he twists it and brings it into our world.  And he dangles each cliffhanger and reveal of the plot with evident glee and precise precision.  This next year of waiting is going to be a long one.wife believed we'd taken leave of our senses.  She hasn't quite gotten into the Olympian view yet.

0743201140|4.0|There were many things I liked about this book and some that I found difficult.  Buckingham's theme of focusing on one's strengths rather than weaknesses (as so many development programs and activities do) is an excellent one.  He also provides a very good strategy for doing this:<br />1. How to distinguish your natural talents<br />2. Having a system to identify your dominant talents<br />3. Having a common language to describe your talents.<br /><br />Let's start with the first - \\"talents\\".  In talents, Buckingham distinguishes between what is innate and what can be acquired through practice.  He categorises one's expertise into talents, knowledge and skills and makes the quite valid point that a person can improve performance in an area through practice and developing knowledge and skills.  However, the extent to which overall performance (or expertise) can be enhanced is limited to the degree of innate talent. I liken this innate talent to aptitude.<br /><br />The system to identify one's natural talents is based on the StrengthsFinder Profile.

0756404746|5.0|This is one amazing book. I read it for 8 hours straight, and couldn't pull myself away from it. The writing is superb. Being a very picky ready, I am beside myself to have found an amazing new author to follow.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|This album was great... I would suggest it for any Testament fan. The drumming has improved alot, the speed is so much better than the last couple and the band has truly come together in the best way possible on this cd. Welcome back the thrash kings, HAIL TESTAMENT!!!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|The cast in this sitcom is the most remarkable I've seen so far.  All of the characters are interesting, hilarious.  I've been really addicted to this show. Excitedly look forward to it every week.  Try it, and you will like it!
B00164DWEA|3.0|I saw this movie on a whim on opening night, and it turned out to be so-so for me. It begins well past the point when Bruce has become afflicted by gamma rays, and he's already trying to learn how to control what's inside him. Of course, the government and all their bad guys come to hunt him down, bringing his heartrate up to 200 again and again. (We find out it's his heartrate that brings out the Hulk, so he's got to be on the lookout, depending on his faithful wristwatch whenever it comes to anger, running, or yes, sex.) Eventually he encounters Blonsky, a soldier who quickly becomes obsessed with the Hulk. Blonsky (Tim Roth) becomes dangerous when he offers for himself to become something that could combat Hulk, but his greed and lust for power get in the way, and he's soon out of control. Isn't that how it always is? The special effects in this movie are pretty much amazing, just about the most high-tech you can get nowadays, and the fight scenes will blow you away. I loved the character of Bruce, and Liv Tyler was lovely. Sure, it was entertaining, and I suppose that's all that matters, but if you want to get critical here, well...    I enjoy Edward Norton. But he shouldn't have been cast in this. He's a wonderful Bruce Banner, but when he becomes the Hulk, I see absolutely no connection between the two; I cannot picture this skinny, nerdy guy (no offense, but hey) to be anywhere inside that thing. Now, I'm sure this is what the producers may have been going for: let's cast someone who's the complete opposite of what he turns into, so when he turns into it, wow, it'll be even more amazing because he'll look all the more bigger and stuff! Uh-huh, didn't work. The only other downfall is that this movie, unlike many other Marvel movies I've seen, is also catered VERY much only to guys. I'll explain this by saying that there were several references that I, as a girl, just didn't get. Not sure what it is, but you've got to up to date with your Marvel knowledge to catch all the goodies.     Overall a pretty good movie! Lots of action, good acting, nothing that should hold you back from seeing it. Enjoy!
B000A2RRF4|4.0|This is definately the best of Michael Jackson. Except for the hand over his crotch several times, the moves are definately Jackson, and no one can compare
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|The only positive thing to say about this bad movie is that the costumes are  well done.  The script is terrible, the acting is wooden, the interiors dark with lots of fireplaces.  Eric Bana is not lustful, and there is no sex to speak of. There is no comparison with the lively sexy fast-moving Tudors on cable television.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|This is my favorite CD so far this year and I think will probably stay at that rating for quite some time. It's a mix of Fiona Apple, Sarah McLachlan and Sara Bareilles' own style in there. I would recommend this CD to anyone. Give it a try!
0765342294|4.0|I found this book to be pretty well written, relationally anyway.  You can empathize with several characters at once in such a way that it helps you understand their interactions better and how they relate to and think of one another.      The real fun of this book is the psychology.  You see the child and the adult in Ender and the others at the same time.  Plus, not only is it a game for Ender and his teachers, but it is also a game for the reader.  Ender's Game is really unique in the way the characters experience, experiment with, and exhibit leadership.  You learn with them, and you question and test ideas with them.      The occasional mentions of religion were interesting, especially with the knowledge that the author was a Mormon.  I love how Card was able to explore a life with subtle and hushed religions but how they impacted Ender and other characters at the same time.  You could see the author seeking out what is in the core of the soul.  Maybe we're all not that different in the end.  Do we secretly find ourselves just as evil and depraved as others who may even have a reputation for it?  Is there hope?  Is there a way to be good again?  What is it that spurs us toward purpose?    Warning to the reader, there are some graphic scenes of violence, but this is necessary for the plot and its underlying themes.  Don't worry; there are plenty of fun scenes for the imagination as well though.  The battle room scenes are especially fun as they force you not only to imagine the scene but to think through the logistics of it at the same time.  Once again, you learn the elements of zero gravity and multiple dimensions at the same time as the characters.      Overall, the book is an excellent read even for those who aren't as interested in sci-fi.  I am living proof.  The end was a little overboard sci-fi for me, but I still enjoyed it as it brought good closure to the story and tied up some of the key themes.  It's a fun and easy read (minus the violence which canbe tough to stomach in one sitting), and I hope you will enjoy it.  While it's certainly not my favorite book, I would highly recommend it to anyone.    Oh, and I have the author's definitive version (ISBN-13:  978-0-8125-5070-2).  If you enjoy reading a lot and the relationship between the characters of a book and the reader, I highly suggest you read the introduction.  :)
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this Movie.  It left me with a smile on my face.  Just a wonderful movie.  Perfect for kids of all ages!  I guess somes Rodents besides Mickey Mouse are very cute, as long as they are not living in your house!

B00001U0E1|5.0|This is one of the most romantic stories I have ever seen.  I have watched it on cable many, many times and finally had to have my own. It is truly a bitter sweet love story. This is what real love stories should be like.  Even the bedroom scenes were well done.
0783225482|5.0|My best friend's wife told me about this movie a couple months ago, but it wasn't until the other night that I had a chance to sit down and watch it.  I don't know why it took so long for me to actually do since I absolutely adore all three of the films stars.  Bruce Willis was for the longest time my favorite actor (I grew up on his macho action films); and seriously, is there any actress as talented as Meryl Streep?  Goldie Hawn is a newbie to my list of great actresses, mostly because I never truly have her the time of day until recent years.  My wife is a huge fan and so I was forced to accept her and after some time I realized that I had come to really enjoy her and what she brought to each and every role.<br /><br />`Death Becomes Her' is, as many have noted, a black comedy.  It is dark and mysterious and utterly hilarious.  At times it is disturbing, at times it is sexy; at all times it is uproarious.  The film revolves around two rivals, the successful actress Madeline Ashton and her homely school friend Helen Sharp.  Before Helen ties the not with fianc&eacute;e Earnest Menville she brings him to one of Ashton's shows where he meets and falls for Madeline.  After Earnest leaves her for Ashton, Helen slips into depression only to discover a secret that gives her the extra boost she needs in order to exact her revenge against Madeline.  The only problem is that Madeline has discovered the same secret; a potion that guarantees them immortality, at a price.<br /><br />Bruce Willis may be better known for his action performances, but when you analyze them you realize that comedy is not beyond him.  His quick witted hero in `Die Hard' is known for those chuckle-worthy one-liners that helped cement him as an iconic character.  Here Bruce shines as Earnest, fully fleshing out his characters simple nature which adds to his endearing qualities.  A stark contrast to his co-stars, Willis plays down his looks and develops a character that is goofy and reserved and ultimately adorable.  Goldie Hawn is fantastic as the witching Helen Sharp.  Her beauty is on full display as she seethes and loathes her way into our hearts; seriously.<br /><br />This film BELONGS to Meryl Streep, though.  Her performance is insanely perfect; so much so that I actually felt bad for Goldie Hawn to have been upstaged so drastically.  Each and every one-liner just melted off her tongue as if it were liquid gold.  In talking to my wife afterwards I told her how you never really think of Meryl as a comedic actress because her dramatic turns have always garnered her more attention.  It really wasn't until her double-whammy in 2006 (with `The Devil Wears Prada' and `A Prarie Home Companion') that I took notice of her comedic timing.  This is a brilliant example of her range as an actress.  Honestly, I don't think there is any performance she can't pull off.  Like I've always said, Meryl is always solid; even when she isn't `amazing' she is still better than half of everything else out there.<br /><br />`Death Becomes Her' may not be ingenious.  It's plot is not intricate or necessarily `smart' or `mature' but the script is tightly written in order to keep the laughs bellowing from you mouth throughout the films entire running time; and those Oscar winning special effects (I don't think I'll ever get the image of Meryl's head sinking into her neck out of my head; and quite frankly I don't want to) only help to elevate the films comedic as well as dramatic worth.  Zemeckis knows how to get the best from his actors; even when his films are less than brilliant.  Here he marvelously draws pure comic gold from his cast, which includes a mystifying turn from Isabella Rossellini as Lisle con Rhoman, the witch responsible for this boatload of laughs.ately adorable.

B00005MP58|5.0|I am a big fan of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite of her books.  Colin Firth makes every woman wish she had a  Mr. D'Arcy in her life.  All of the other actors were also outstanding in their portrayals.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Most everyone has seen Sound of Music, but this fortieth anniversary of the film includes a reunion of those who made it so well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching every moment.
B000OV170W|4.0|I had been hearing people talk about this book for so long, I finally had to read it.  It was a page turner, in most parts, and I can see why Jodi Picoult is so popular.      The story and dilemma were heartbreaking, and overall I am certainly glad I read this.  I can see why there is so much talk about it.  The surprise ending (I thought) was wonderful.  It added a lot of extra character.  I added an extra star just for that.     Three things, though, I didn't particularly care for: 1) overall I thought the whole book was just a bit overwritten 2) I didn't care two whits about the story line between Campbell and Julia and thought is was an annoying distraction, and 3) Picoult did not expand enough on the character of Jesse, in particular, Jesse and his parents.  I don't mean to sound too critical, though, I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to most of the people I know.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|I have this performance on DVD and love it, so I was excited to get it on CD to replace my (good but not as good) Original Broadway Cast CD.  The cast in the 10th anniversary performance is unparalelled in my view, so no regrets there.  In the CD version, though, some of the editing that was done for TV/Video is a bit annoying on CD, as are all of the (well-deserved) applause at the end of numbers and the assorted coughs, throat clears, popping balloons, etc. that are unavoidable in live performances.  Those things are much more bothersome on CD than in the DVD.  So I will probably keep my original Broadway Cast performance as well.  If you don't have it, I'd skip this CD and buy the DVD instead.  That's still the ultimate!
B000RPSVE0|5.0|Terezi'n/Theresienstadt by Anne Sofie Von Otter, Benct Forsberg, Christian Gerhaher and Daniel Hope is a wonderful musical tribute to the musicians murdered by the Nazis in the \\"model\\" concentration camp, Terezi'n.  It is lyrical and lovely and worthy of listening to for many hours.  I participate in an annual Holocaust Remembrance program, and I am trying to figure out how we can incorporate this CD into the program.  I am pleased to have purchased it.
B0014DBZT2|4.0|I won't waste your time with overused and flabby adjectives.  Suffice it to say, Nick and his Bad Seeds cohorts slide into middle age with chops, prowess, and style.  If you liked his previous work, this should suit you just fine.  If you've never listened to the father of Goth-lounge then this is just as good a place to start as any.  Of course, the teens might find him boring, but then many think if one isn't wearing eyeliner, one has no street cred.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Amazing movie. Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic as Bill the Butcher. Although I'm not a fan, DiCaprio does a really nice job as well. Long movie but keeps your attention. The violence is done very tastefully so it's not all blood and gore. Highly recommended.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|After watching the movie on HBO I had to purchase the book.  I couldn't wait until John Adams came out on DVD. One of my favorite things about the movie is the music, so I was thrilled that the soundtrack was made available as well.  I highly recommend this series. Paul Giamatti deserves an award for his portrayal of John Adams; I was really impressed with him!
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Excellent series, Stallone at his best, literally. He stars all six of em, wrote all six of em, and even directed 4 of em! He's a one man army. Maybe that's why he did Rambo. A lot of people mistake these movies for action packed thrill rides but they're not which is why they get dissapointed after watching them. Rocky is a story about a broke boxer just livin life as happy as can be. Then hes givin a shot at the title against the world heavyweight and he becomes a legend. The best part is after all six movies I realized that Stallone never broke character, Rocky was always the fun loving smartass he was in the first movie some 25 yrs ago.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Why does it seem that the serious artist that will be remembered far beyond their death were fairly miserable and penniless in the end?  Is it the artist mentality?  Is it the lack of commercialism?  Is the disconnectedness from the everyday mundane world that sets them apart?  Whatever it is, Radiohead has that quality.  I highly expect them to die a penniless and love-less death, like Mozart, like Dali, like Bosquiat, like Miles Davis...need I go on?  I highly suspect this is Thomas Yorke's lot in life.  Just because he and his band of Radiohead's are so far head and antlers above the rest in musicality and inventiveness.  Yep, they are heading for an early and tragic end.  Just watch and wait, and you too will be entertained.<br /><br />\\"In Rainbows,\\" is yet another genius work.  Let me tell you where I'm coming from.  I was a very very reluctant Radiohead fan.  I started with OK Computer when it came out and approached it with the attitude of, \\"What's the hype?\\"  I listened to it along with my wife in a drive along the beaches of Normandy in France.  I wasn't sold.  I kept buying Radiohead albums and wasn't converted until let's say Kid A.  I, all the sudden, started seeing them as more than modern day Pink Floyd rip-offs and realized the musical worthiness was here to stay.  Yes, Thomas Yorke was indeed a musical prodigy.<br /><br />With \\"In Rainbows,\\" Radiohead only steps it up a notch with the bar they set for all others to try to reach.  Not only did they revolutionize the music distribution industry with their unique approach to \\"pay what you feel the work deserves\\" approach to album release but they again created something a cut above.  They are indeed musical geniuses.<br /><br />It's a solid mellow listen all the way through.  From the opening track of \\"15 step,\\" with its electronic other-worldness and it's danger mouse-like beats to the rocking \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" Radiohead has a little something to meet all tastes.<br /><br />If you want to get on the bandwagon for a band that will be talked about in the same breath as the Beetles, Stones, and Floyd, then get Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows.\\"  If you want to miss the train, then certainly go pick up Madonna's latest, Brittney Spears or Kylie Minogue's latest hits.  Don't miss out on these sublime Brit's.  You won't be sorry.  ...mmwalked about in the same breath as the Beetles, Stones, and Floyd, then get Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows.\\"  If you want to miss the train, then certainly go pick up Madonna's latest, Brittney Spears or Kylie Minogue's latest hits.

B000OD1OU8|3.0|I never thought I would ever say that the movie was better, but it is. The book is OK, but no where near as good as the movie with Matt Damon. The book starts out real interesting and hits some good action points here and there but then it draws out real slow for a few hundred pages, finally climaxes at the end, I already got the Supremacy and the Ultimatum so I will go ahead and finish the trilogy but I would much rather read Tom Clancy than this ever again.    But for those of you who love action packed books, I strongly suggest Clancy for you.
006135323X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot. A lot of nice research examples and it gives you a extra understanding in the buying behaviour of people. But I rather missed the scientific data behind all the examples (at least some extra tables with percentage would be nice). And the author is very focused on his own research. A lot of time I wondered if some of the behaviour he describes is more a cultural phenomenon or biological one. When finished with the book I was left with a lot of questions. I read [[ASIN:006124189X Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (Collins Business Essentials)]] before this book and would recommend it if you like this book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you haven't seen Band of Brothers, drop everything and get it!  It's very engaging and entertaining.  I bought this box set for my boyfriend last Christmas and he absolutely loves it!  For a historical war drama, this set is easily the best!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Alanis Morissette's new album  Flavors Of Entanglement is a stunning departure from her previous work.It effectively blends her earlier anger present on Jagged little pill, but with a more grown standpoint.Standout tracks are: Not As We , Straitjacket,Incomplete,In praise of The Vulnerable Man and the bonus tracks Orchid and Madness.The album has very different sonic melodies and lyrical infusion that's going to make this a classic album. She sings of everything from being broken hearted to being frustrated with anger and her view of the events we face every day. Looking inside outside and forward it maintains its anger but not without objectivity. The songs remain effective as you could feel yourself in them as anyone.This record has original but approachable songs that will suit a lot of peoples taste.The bonus tracks are well worth getting, the stand out is Orchid a beautiful ballad with sonic backdrops that give it a character all it's own.This is one recipe you should order full.
B00005MP58|5.0|No movie does Jane Austen's most famous novel as much justice as this miniseries done by the BBC. I try to watch every version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that's released and this is by far the best I have seen! The movie is about 4 hours long (2-discs) and takes great effort to be as true to Austen's novel and spirit as possible.     If you can only own one version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", make this version it - once you have watched this movie, nothing comes close. While the more modern version with Kiera Knightly is good, it cannot begin to comapare to this move. I just love, Love, LOVE this movie!
B0013FNC38|2.0|This cd to me was a disappointment! I was led to believe that cd would bring new styles and sounds to his audience, but it pretty much sounds the same as his previous albums.  Don't get me wrong, his style is unique and he is great at it, however, I didn't like this album.  Maybe for him this album is aesthetically the best he has done so far, perhaps because of personal journeys/growth, etc....but I didn't feel it. As a woman, I felt that some of his lyrics made women out to be objects of pleasure...very sensual inflections in his writing and music.  He has the right to express whatever he feels/went through,and I'm not a feminist or anything, but to me it didn't cut it.  His last albums were just plain fun and quirky, and this one wasn't.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a while.  Who, what, when, why... I DONT KNOW IT DIDN'T SAY! and that bothers me.     AWEFUL. sorries.
B000063DGC|4.0|As the title suggests this release is a tribute. To one Randy Rhoads to be specific, killed in a bout of (terminal as it turns out) stupidity as the light plane he was in crashed as it was buzzing the tour bus. Band biographies are rife with stories of bands cavorting about like chickens with their heads cut off and most of the time all ends well. The tragedy is that it doesn't always and this pretty darn tasty Ozzy live album is not only serviceable in it's own right as a release but does show the talents of the deceased guitarist. Which only reinforces the loss.<br /><br />Song selection is pretty good with lots of metal, some metal and for a bit of garnish some metal is blasted out of your stereo with only a few let ups of pace. In this case that's probably a good thing as Ozzy works best when firing at a manic pace. And given the guy repeatedly tells the audience to stand up - even for Revelation (Mother Earth) which is one of the mellower cuts - it's probably a necessity to really blaze away.<br /><br />And blaze this does. Tunes such as I Don't Know, Crazy Train and Mr Crowley all work very well live as they are built of pretty strong stuff. Suicide Solution is a perfect choice for inclusion here as it is essentially about another life cut too short, in this case that of Australian vocalist Bon Scott. Steal Away includes Tommy Aldridges' drum solo so be warned, but the extended guitar solo on Suicide Solution is pretty welcome. As the collection unfolds the scarcity of any let up is impressive and a few Sabbath standards are dusted off in the guise of Iron Man and also Paranoid. I dunno, the first one never really made any impression on me, perhaps you had to be 15 in 1973 or whenever it came out. But the latter is a far more communicative track and really sounds pretty darn metallic and anarchic here. Perhaps my favourite version of my favourite track with which Ozzy is associated.<br /><br />Goodbye to Romance is well placed after Paranoid and it shows that someone was paying attention to the pacing of this thing which speaks of focus and a certain care factor. And the humour of No Bone Movies is probably a good way to close out the album proper before some Randy Rhoads out-takes finish the disc in a way that makes you contemplate...stuff.<br /><br />Produced and engineered by Max Norman this all sounds consistent and a couple of liner notes by the Prince of Darkness himself add a certain touch to things. A pretty good live album all round and for Ozzy fans probably a must purchase and the sort of album that will have a very long life span as new generations of rivet heads explore the history of their chosen genre.tion to the pacing of this thing which speaks of focus and a certain care factor.

B000W10AEI|5.0|Better then looking at this movie on blu-ray then on regular dvd. Very, very clear and excellent sound.
B000000OSG|4.0|Coming out at the same time as Use Your Illusion I in one of the biggest days in metal history this album contains a swathe of hard rock and metallic styles. For my mind part one is the more metallic and this the more maudlin of the dynamic duo. But as I said it has a range of styles like Civil War which is the sort of thing that a band with expanding horizons would do, numbers like the visceral Get In The Ring, the bouncy though metallic Shotgun Blues and Breakdown (a personal fave) and sicker more cerebral stuff like the sneering disdain in Pretty Tied Up. We also get an industrial sicko in the brief My World which speaks to a certain doom obsessed juvenile brain wave but is certainly no less valid for that.<br /><br />My reasons for giving this album only four stars - though a very strong four stars mind - is that it has more tunes that to me don't quite work. Tunes like Locomotive is fine but doesn't seem to quite work as well as some of the more cerebral tracks nor work as brilliantly as blasts of hard rockin' metal. So Fin and Estranged leave me utterly unmoved and I didn't really need an alternate set of lyrics to Don't Cry. And why do some bands like Dylan? Much ground is recovered however due to the maudlin aspects of tracks like 14 Years and Yesterdays and the mega song You Could Be Mine. And to think Lars big upped Metallic' songs association with one of those overblown Mission Impossible movies...silly bloke. And while after most of two decades on some cringe factor may be accrued to the band for having a song so closely associated with a movie it was a huge hit (both the track and the movie) at the time and perfectly suited to the collaboration.<br /><br />And that's about it, if you don't already have this get out from under the rock you've been living under and get this and Use Your Illusion I as soon as possible as they are well produced expansive works that show that focus and talent can achieve good results and if your good enough you can develop your bands sound and take your fanbase with youand take your fanbase with you
0930289234|3.0|Brace yourself. This is the contrarian review. I've had this recommended to me since the 1980s, and finally decided to put my nickel on the counter to see what it's about. I'm underwhelmed.<br /><br />It's got some nice things going on. There are a few reversals of loyalty, some of them more grounded in making it through the day than in high ideals. That works for me. Sanity as a negotiable quantity works for me, too, I'm sorry to say. Moral and social issues, in combination, dominate the last one or two of the original comic series. Those matter, at least to any thinking reader. Open-ended (mistakable for weak) choices left Adrian where he wanted to be - I hoped for better. Even so, I follow along with all of that. But.<br /><br />I come for the art, too. Gibbons's drawing and Higgins's coloring narrate, effectively, even if they don't innovate. I want my eyes to learn, to be brought to a higher level of seeing a story told. Didn't happen. Nice, but only nice. And, I have to admit, the story didn't snag me until the last two or three of these dozen-ish comic book reprints.<br /><br />I like comics. I like good ones a lot. I like this one. I just don't like it all that much. I'm not sure I'll keep it. Maybe back then it advanced the frontiers of comics - but today is today, and it doesn't.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000000OSE|5.0|Yep, the full five stars here and I'll tell you why;<br /><br />One reason is that this work feels optimistic, even when it's addressing pretty dour issues, it's an expansive work by a band that worked hard with their production team and developed their sound further than they'd had the opportunity to on their debut. They sold a squillion of these things at the time and the way the album works on a number of levels is part of the reason why. One level is the pure molten metal songs like Don't Damn Me and Dead Horse and Garden of Eden which show that when the faux nastiness is left behind and a genuine feeling of unclean sneer is available then you will connect with people. It shows how metal can make you think and can at times open up some unpleasant internal cans of worms. And then there are the tracks that make this a cool done-me-wrong good time blast like Dust n' Bones, You Ain't The First and Bad Obsession. Not to mention the good time humour of Back Off Bitch. In fact it's pretty hard to pick a single drop of the ball here. Even the cover of Live And Let Die is pretty good and really, if your going to sing a song like that would you find it more believable coming from these guys with Axle Rose in full roar than Mr Sensible Shoes McCartney? I'm mean really...<br /><br />As to the band, these guys are so famous it's hard to come up with anything original to say other than that there is/was a certain synergy within this band. After all I'm sure that Duff, Izzy and Sorum are good musos but it's hardly relevant, these are just strong songs. They speak their piece well and with verve and commitment and that's enough to carry the day. And as for Slash, well as I write in 2008 the guy is probably the most recognisable guitarist on the planet to the average punter. And while I feel that his most brilliant riffs are perhaps on Appetite the guy here shows a solid and varied palette from which to paint. Which means the rhythm section can get on with the job of laying either a solid as oak blues base for a song or a crunching metallic bed of nails, whichever is required.<br /><br />Five stars all the way and a hugely important album that any music fan with even a modicum of rock in their veins should acquaint themselves with.k blues base for a song or a crunching metallic bed of nails, whichever is required.

B0013FXWX8|4.0|I'm just this guy, y'know? I yam what I yam, and no one to date thought very much of it. Maybe the opposite, if you focus on a wedgied eighth grade. But I'd give anything to be this way-awesome master of way-awesome beatdown skills (on all those guys who beat me down, at least), as long as it isn't too hard. Heck, I'd take a fair beating too - not like I haven't done it before - as long as the cool guys let me hang with them.<br /><br />If you're still with me, then KFP is your ultimate fantasy. The golden goal is to find that unique power that each of us has within. Yeah, and everybody wins the race and gets a hug at the end. But maybe, just maybe, that one thing about you really can stand tall in some squirrely place in the world. Then, you are Po. Po Panda.<br /><br />Perhaps there's a reference here to Li Po, the classic drunken poet - perhaps not. I really don't care. It's just a fun flick with lots of satire on the traditional \\"work hard forever\\" themes that don't work so well in the current decade. Po is the guy you really want to like, even if he's ... well, y'know, not so hard-working.<br /><br />The animation matches the best of today's, and voice casting backs up the animated characters as well as any. My one kvetch, and little, is that Angelina Jolie's voice was way too smooth for Master Tigress. My ears just kept looking for a rocky rasp that her honeyed soprano never delivered. My problem, not yours, not hers.<br /><br />As long as you don't take the martial arts too seriously, this is a charming and humorous riff on taking them seriously. See it and laugh at it. If you can be polite about all the rest, it's warm fuzzy fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00003003R|4.0|Strange feeling I have about this one. Part of me screams that this is a cynical way of grabbing a few more dollars for tunes that have already been paid for. But part of me figures that if some bands can put out live albums after only one proper studio album (yes I'm talking to you Evanescence) then surely after three albums, the Lies collection and the Spaghetti Incident then `the most dangerous band on the planet' deserves to be able to put out a live release.<br /><br />And what a raft of tunes to choose from. The reasons for this bands mega bucks empire is writ large across the two discs of this collection that is quite impressive if for no other reason than that you feel like it was largely recorded at the same gig. Which apparently isn't the case. So the people who put this together really knew what they were doing. And the tunes themselves speak for themselves. If your a fan like me you'll probably already have all the studio works and it's just a matter of completism. For me it was an easy choice as to whether to buy this or not, listening to stuff from either their early or late periods will have you grinning from ear to ear. Strangely enough in a weird way the band are now considered a `classic' band and accorded a devout following within the hard rock and metal universe. Which is strange indeed if you were there at the time.<br /><br />Fans of the band can buy this with confidence, as the discs unfold you'll not feel ripped off. Even if like me your not necessarily a fan of the live album format. And with 22 tracks spread over the collection your getting your moneys worth. Not to mention the booklet complete with photos of the band and examples of flyers for their early gigs which adds to the sense of history inherent in this release. As for those who may be new to the harder end of the music spectrum or just new to the band itself, it's a toss up whether you'd be better off getting this or the greatest hits album that consists of studio tracks. While I rate this as a very healthy four stars my heart tells me you should get the studio best of collection in order to hear the tunes as they were originally intended and to hear them the way those around at the time heard them for the first time.ery healthy four stars my heart tells me you should get the studio best of collection in order to hear the tunes as they were originally intended and to hear them the way those around at the time heard them for the first time.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Sitcoms are coming back in full force! CBS is running the show with hits like Two and A Half Men and How I Met Your Mother. This year a new one was added to the bunch. The Big Bang Theory is the story of two supergenius roomates Sheldon and Leonard whose lives revolve around numbers, chemical equations and a lot of Science Fiction pop culture. Suddenly there world is turned upside down when the beautiful blonde Penny moves in next door. Now two worlds hystericaly clash as the boys learn how to live life and Penny learns to tolerate them.<br /><br />I was part of a focus group watching the pilot and I was laughing from begining to end. I think it may be hard for the average TV watcher to get some of the jokes and references, but I also feel to really appreciate this show you have have people like this in your life! My own younger brother is a former jock watches sports all the time and would never touch the subjets touched upon on this show. Still, he had me for an older brother so he gets a large portion of the references and therefore he thinks it's one of the best shows on TV. I have to admit I am somewhat classified in the geek category. I love Sci-fi/ fantasy movies, I'm an cartoon watcher, love working on computers and all that stuff. But I have a few of friends that are way over the top than I am. They go to cons, playing rpgs, dress up to movie premeres and know all the details that make this planet tick. So really you may not get this show unless you live it!!!
B000JCETDS|4.0|How do you review an album that's not meant to be taken seriously on almost any level that is the soundtrack of a movie that was a comedy full of in jokes about hard rock and metal? Answer? With great difficulty. So here is a brief run down of what you get;<br /><br />Jack Black and Kyle Gass basically spend a lot of time twanging acoustic guitars in a plentiful supply of acoustic tracks with vocals delivered by Black in a nicely produced work where it's actually important to hear the lyrics. The album basically follows the course of the film and a number of the tunes like ....well like a bunch of them don't really make a lot of sense taken out of that context. So you really need to see the film dudes. But other parts of the disc do work even if you've yet to catch a look at the film, like the lead track and track #13 Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown). The whole thing works better if your into hard rock and metal and essentially if you liked School of Rock or the film picking this up on the cheap is a good move and it will be a mood lifter when you want to listen to something that won't melt the pet beagle.<br /><br />That's about it, all that remains is to point out the long and distinguished list of guest musicians like Meatloaf, Ronnie James Dio and Dave Grohl and it's quite clear that all the people on the album have some talent and it's kinda funny that they were all happy to get into this project.<br /><br />Cheery listening but just be warned that a lot of the tracks will probably be guilty pleasures of comedic worth to you but your not going to put a lot of the numbers here onto your self burned greatest hits disc to play in your car.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|What a joy!   Fantastic album start to finish.  I fell in love with \\"Mercy\\" upon first listen and had to have the album.  Surprisingly, the other 9 tracks are all a bit more mellow and nothing else sounds like that fantastic single.  Even more surprising is that I love the other nine tracks just as well if not more.  Easily the best album I've heard in 2008.  The only thing that sounds better than this CD is the vinyl version!  I don't quite get all the comparisons to Dusty Springfield, whom I also adore.  Duffy (other than the letters in her surname) has no similarities to Dusty vocally.  In fact, I think her sound is completely unique.  She's soulful and adult beyond her years!  Pay attention to the gorgeous track \\"Warwick Avenue\\" which should be the follow-up US single and the closer \\"Distant Dreamer.\\"  Outstanding!  Can't wait to hear Aimee's next direction she'll take!
B000000OQF|5.0|Wow, this is the third gunners review I've written in a row and I'm starting to feel like a cheerleader for the band. Not that I'm an uncritical fan (hey, wait til I review The Spaghetti Incident and Lies) but it's just that this band put out three albums that are pretty much essential listening for anyone with a plectrum sized piece of metal in them.<br /><br />This debut full length is the catalyst that sent the `most dangerous band in the world' into the stratosphere. Produced by long term producer Mike Clink and a serious machine in Geffen behind them the band have here created an album that captures the sweaty zeitgeist of the times perfectly. Every single aspect of the late 80's glam/hair metal explosion is here and amplified so it's no longer cheesy or fey, just very committed, very serious and very much in possession of a certain air of authenticity. The difference between the men and the boys so to speak.<br /><br />It's hard to pick highlights from this album that treads so exquisitely that space between hard rock and metal, utilising the more communicative blues based structures of the former and marrying that to the more meaningful, somehow more unclean aspects of metal decadence and total acceptance of the seedy downside to the drink/drug/girls spiral that most other bands couldn't wait to sing the praises of. And that perhaps is why you can still put this on with less of a feeling of partaking of a guilty pleasure after all these years. Where so many other bands of the time you sort of feel like looking over your shoulder to see if anyone is seeing you put the disc into the stereo. Not naming any names of course!<br /><br />As for lowlights there aren't really any. When you delve beyond the chart hits like Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, Welcome to the Jungle and past the more obvious pieces of metal magic like Rocket Queen and the more seedy triumphs such as My Michelle the lesser heralded numbers like Think About You and Anything Goes are still top notch tunes that would of been standout tracks on most other albums from the Sunset Strip circa 1987. Respect.<br /><br />If your one of the few people on the planet who don't own this album you really need to buy it. Now. What are you doing still reading this? I said buy it!

8185300534|5.0|I purchased my first copy of this book 25 years ago, have purchased or read hundreds since and never found any writing more essential to Self-realization than I Am That. Every mind blowing word comes from a simple man who had never received a formal education beyond primary learning. His photo alone will send you into the mystery.<br /><br />Nisargadatta's teaching is simple and radical. Give every spare second of your free time to being conscious to the only fact you know...I Am. What is that? Look, intuit, be still and realize. Stay with what you truly know and be this awareness always. I am not aware of any spiritual teacher who has offered more truth than this book contains in its 110 dialogues with students. Yet, as Nisargadatta says himself, \\"A quiet mind is all you need...\\" Our freedom is realized within and as our own Self. Nisargadatta points where we must BE. Anyone who takes up his advice as their own contemplation can realize the Absolute Self. This book is never the same in any reading and it nourishes the true in you. It flows like water that's headed home to the ocean. Jump in and let the current have you. I Am That is a timeless classic. Don't just read it, live it and be happy.<br /><br />Sundance Burke, Author [[ASIN:0980091233 Free Spirit: A Guide to Enlightened Being]]

B000LQLRBO|5.0|I purchased this lp brand new and also have 4 different releases; 20th aniversary CD, 30th aniversary CD, and the 30th aniversary SACD mix.  But this record sounds better than all of them it just has a much airier feel than even th 5.1 mix.  It is a must have for any fan of true sound.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|It's really nice when something off the beaten path of current music trends breaks through and makes a mark. This is one of those times. Take a little Motown and mix it with a little British Invasion, and this could very well be the result.     Like many people, I bought this CD based on hearing the hit track 'Mercy', and it may still be my favorite song on the disc. However, I am finding that this is one that grows on you more as you listen to it. Most of the disc does not have the same attention grabbing power of the song 'Mercy', but do not let that detract from what's good about it.     To me the disc starts a bit slow with Rockferry (A very 60s Brit-Pop sounding ballad), Warwick Avenue (another ballad), Serious (soulful but downbeat), Stepping Stone (early Dionne Warwick sounding but another ballad!). After that Duffy delivers a beautiful stripped down bluesy vocal over only an electric guitar on the appropriately named 'Syrup & Honey'. 'Hanging On Too Long' is almost a variation on 'Heard It Through The Grapevine', and nearly owes it a credit! 'Mercy' has more energy than any other track on the disc, and I wish a little more were injected elsewhere on the disc. 'Delayed Devotion' is another great track, sounding like an old Supremes hit. 'I'm Scared' and 'Distant Dreamer' round out the disc nicely, making for a short, but refreshing disc to listen to as an alternative to other current pop.    I like the disc, though wished there would be one or two more upbeat tracks. It's a throwback, but nothing wrong with that in my opinion. It's like having new material from the heyday of a long gone era.    I also think the disc flows better if the songs are re-ordered. Try it this way; Warwick Avenue, Delayed Devotion, Hanging On Too Long, Mercy, Distant Dreamer, Serious, Rockferry, I'm Scared, Stepping Stone, Syrup & Honey.

B0019J1JXI|5.0|I don't know what to say - I'm speechless over this album. Donna Summer has really come back into music in a HUGE way, very similar to Cher's big splash with her come back album \\"Believe\\" several years ago. Even if you never cared much for disco, or for Summer's more pop-oriented style of singing in previous works, there is something for practically everyone on her newest album \\"Crayons\\". This album absolutely rocks. This is shaping up to be the summer of some really big come backs for quite a few individual artists and bands (REM, & B-52's to name a few). Donna Summer is HIGH on that list of singers who've proven recently that true talent is always good, no matter the decade.
0765315246|5.0|I am no big time book reader, I had some time to spend so I read this book first in eBook format on my phone.  Enjoyed it so much that a couple months later I bought it in paperback along with Ghost Brigades to enjoy it more and go further in the series.  Not thinking much into it when I bought it I wish I also got the third book, \\"The Lost Colony\\" because despite work I finished both books in 3 days and was left wanting more like a drug crazed addict.    Old Man's War tells of a normal man doing great things, and the way John Scalzi writes it got me laughing and even feeling for the poor \\"old\\" man.  He doesn't get into too much technical detail like other writers do, it's an all out no bull style of writing and he ain't afraid of using certain words either. His writing really comes out in The Ghost Brigades, but no need to write a review for that as by the end of this book you'll be wanting the next.  I don't think I will be able to handle it when I am done with The Lost Colony.    But anyways, the Universe Scalzi creates is truly great.  And I hope more comes out, even if it doesn't include the characters we have come to love in this series. Buy it, I doubt you'll regret it.
159562015X|5.0|We have all heard the adage that, if you work hard enough, you can become anything you want to be. Rath challenges this. We all have different strengths, and very seldom is someone very successful in something that is not his/her strength. Don't follow the path of greatest resistance!<br /><br />Rath criticizes the widespread societal practice on dwelling on failure instead of success. For instance, there is excessive attention paid to poor grades in school instead of to the good ones. He also believes that talents are innate, and change little through life. He even cites a study (p. 18) that indicates that the child's personality traits at age 3 are very similar to those at age 26.<br /><br />After extensive research, the Gallup Organization developed a list consisting of 34 common talents, each of which is described in this book in a separate chapter.  I will briefly describe a few of them. A person with the Analytical talent is good at picking apart ideas, projects, etc., not to destroy them but to make them work better. He/she would do well in marketing, database management, or medical research. A person with the Intellection talent likes mental activity. He or she would do well in studies of philosophy, literature, or psychology. The Learner constantly wants to learn something. He/she might learn best by teaching.<br /><br />Evidently, this book has hit the chord. It has been a bestseller for many years, has been translated into several languages, and has been used by businesses, schools, community groups, etc.

1416550518|5.0|The House at Riverton by Kate Morton is a powerful dramatic novel about secrets and love. In 1914, Grace Reeves starts working as a housemaid at the age of 14 at the Hartford estate of Riverton outside of London. She quickly becomes entranced by the three children of the house: David, 17; Hannah, 14; and Emmeline, 10. She soaks up their games, hopes, and dreams, a life she will never have of her own. But years later, a shooting occurs and it shatters all of them, and now in 1998, only Grace remains to tell the story of what really happened that night and all that came before. Grace is a wonderful character of her times: in service before WWI, and as times changed with WWII, she worked as a Red Cross nurse, then became a student while being a single mother, and finally an archaeologist with a famous mystery writer for a grandson, Marcus. The book is written as audiotapes that Grace records for Marcus as enticement to return from a self-imposed exile. The book feels like a ride up the first hill on a roller coaster. As the characters are introduced, there are lush descriptions of both the setting and time, but with each turn of the page, the tension ratchets up until near the top, the reader is breathless with anticipation. The drama of family secrets and lies has rarely been done so well. Grace's guilt begins with a lie when she was just 14, but shapes the events around it until tragedy is the only possible outcome. Moron's debut shows amazing promise; this is definitely a writer to keep your eye on.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Having waited 17 years for another full album from Donna Summer, this was definitely worth the wait.  This CD has been in my car stereo since the day after it was released and I have been listening to it non-stop.  The songs are fun and uplifting, especially the title track \\"Crayons\\" with Ziggy Marley.  Originally I didn't like the song \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" but after hearing Donna talk about how this came about it is now one of my all time favorites.  Donna created a character to sing this song which is the best example of her technique.  She molds her style to the song and the music and this album showcases that talent better than any of her others.
B000002H33|5.0|When this came out doesnt understand its importance. Just a great record with incredible maturity after the equally impressive 'Ride The Lightning'. There are over a thousand reviews so i cant add much. The raves? believe them. Its a must own for ALL Metalheads and Rock fans. This CD showed you can be Heavy, Melodic and also a bit Progressive. Very original and aggressive for its time.<br /><br />They would be the first extreme metal band to get signed to a really good label and deal, opening many doors for other bands and the genre in general. Their success was truly from word of mouth and touring. Best part was they had the music and chops to back it up. From 'Battery' to 'Damage Inc.' there are no throwouts. The musicianship was definitely stepped up a notch from their previous 2.<br /><br />The fact that people had the guts to give this 1 star sickens me (60+ people?). Because you know that they were'nt around in '86 to feel its impact, or they compare it to todays Punk-Metal and/or Goth-Death Metal.  And/Or they are just morons.. More than likely its the latter, because even people who dont like the style of music can appreciate it on some level, and they obviously arent musicians who can appreciate it.....<br /><br />This CD meets its post-hype. Its importance and influence in todays metal scene is undeniable. A blueprint and staple in American Metal history regardless of some of the crap they would spew out later.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I won't comment on historical inaccuracies here since I am not that familiar with them, especially in regard to Henry and the Boleyn family.    This film is very entertaining to watch and it is visually pleasing, with the period costumes, castles, and other trappings of the century represented.  Portman, Johannsen and Bana do good solid work as the main characters in the royal intrigues.  The film also gives a good example of the low status of women at that time and how they were expected to produce male heirs or else fall into disgrace and be abandoned by their domineering husbands.      There was a tremendous amount of pressure placed on young women not only in that regard but also re: their entire family's position and future.  Girls were married off not to men they loved, necessarily, but to men who could provide wealth and reputation or even repair broken relationships or warring empires.      The ending was spot-on in showing that Henry's desire for a son and his despair at not having one should not have been such a worry for him, considering that he and Anne produced Queen Elizabeth I, who ruled England for decades.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie rocks! The cast was stellar. The idea of gossip and its consequences is a great theme for a movie/play. Joan Crawford, although her part was small, played it to the hilt. The parting comment after the final showdown was a \\"Oh no, she didn't just say that!\\" momement. Rosalind Russell as a nasty woman, yet with a lot of physical comedy was excellent. I thought that fact that they didn't show the husbands was one of the best techniques ever.

This book is what it is and to hold such high expectations to the point of letting it ruin your day is absolutely missing the point of the author's message.  Paul Arden is simply providing his insight in small passages and if that approach works for the reader all is well but if it does not:  \\"stop, drop and roll\\"!   Simply put this is a great and easy read that accomplishes it's goal:  to make us think!
B000009RC2|5.0|The Mahavishnu Orchestra gathered a set of virtuosos to participate in the new genre of Jazz-Rock fusion started by the great Bitches Brew.  The musicianship displayed in this album is amazing.  For example, the drumming during the first minute of 'Vital Transformation' is simply complex and very technical, and Mahavishnu himself, John McLaughlin, displays great guitar playing throughout. The Mahavishnu Orchestra has a highly complex layered sound, shown off greatly in 'Awakening'.  Every song on this album is a masterpiece in my mind.  Easily one of my top 5 favorite albums.

B0013FNC38|5.0|Over the years my musical interests have changed. I once was a country fan, then metal & hardrock, but as I've gotten a little older I have started to gravitate toward more melodic music. I was listening to the radio and heard \\"I'm Yours\\" and was blown away. Being a guy with a romantic streak in me this song's hopeful, uplifting look at love really raises my spirits. The song also has just a great melody and catchyness to it that will rattle around in your head for hours.<br /><br />That's the song that hooked me, but \\"Lucky\\" with Colbie Caillat was the one that reeled me in. Two great voices singing a great song, that will remind many people of their feelings for their lover/spouse. \\"If it Kills me\\" rounds out the trio of romantic songs.<br /><br />\\"Butterfly\\", well, the title is nodoubt a reference to an anatomical female feature. So, as you can imagine this is very sentual song. Sentual not pornograhic in nature. \\"Butterfly\\" has a definite R&B/Funk flavor to it that makes you want to dance. I've seen people mention that his song in particular objectifies females but I think it is largely done in very good taste.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is filled out with songs about divorce,lost love,over analysis, and being fallible.<br /><br />Great CD overall, one of the best I heard in years.

0307346617|5.0|I got this book for the holidays from my husband and I could not put it down. I finished it in a few days, took it to work & read with it hiding under my desk. It was completely engrossing & suspenseful & terrifying. It has so many perspectives, & all of them are completely believable. Max Brooks makes a zombie apocalypse seem like a very real nightmare, & has presented an image of what the world could actually be like in the event of one. You will prepare your home & family.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|The mother of all comically dysfunctional families hits the road in an equally dysfunctional VW bus in this funny, off-beat, charming film about a group of people who--despite their differences and personality quirks--can come together in support of each other when the situation calls for it. Cleverly directed and brilliantly acted, the movie boasts a humorous plot (sometimes predictable, but always entertaining), and some of the best ensemble work of the year (2007). Greg Kinnear is moving and spot-on as the father, Richard Hoover, a determined would-be self-help guru who enthusiastically pitches his nine-step program to potential buyers while his own family members flounder about in various states of depression, unrequited love, professional failure, and teenage angst. Toni Collette is Sheryl, the caring mom, who supports everyone's ambition whether it is healthy or not. Alan Arkin's performance as the foul-mouthed grandfather deservedly won the veteran screen and stage actor an Oscar. Steve Carell is excellent in the role of Frank, Sheryl's suicidal brother, a gay Proust scholar and professor whose inamorato, a handsome grad student, has taken up with a rival prof. The youngest member of the family is seven year old Olive, wonderfully acted by Abigail Breslin, for whose sake the quarreling Hoovers pile into the VW and head for a little girl beauty pageant in California. Finally, the Nietzche-obsessed, emo teenage son Duane, brilliantly perfomed by Paul Dano, very nearly steals the show with his temper-tantrum scene in the back of the family bus.    The actors are so good that it is difficult to single out any one performance as outshining all the others. I have never been a big fan of Greg Kinnear, but he impressed me and was truly superb as a man on the brink of bankruptcy who attempts to remain positive-thinking and ebulliant in the face of failure. It was a pleasure to see Steve Carell in a semi-serious roll, his verbal exchanges with Richard and Grandpa in the bus, and with Duane at the beach in California, are funny and sensitively-handled at the same time. Abigail Breslin is perfect as the wannabe beauty-pageant queen. Her earnestness and genuinely childlike spirit are seen to good effect against the glitzy backdrop of a beauty contest in which simpering children with bouffant hair, layers of makeup, and frothy girly-girl costumes a la JonBenet Ramsey pose provocatively and strut the length of a mini-catwalk. About Paul Dano a great deal has been said in connection with his work in \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" He is a superb young actor with an impressive range, and his surly, sulky teenage Duane provides the film with some of its best moments.    Admitttedly there are one or two moments when the predictability of the plot can be a bit much, but this is more than made up for by the film's hilarious conclusion which is anything but predictable, as well as uplifting and moving.     In reading some of the reviews below I was amazed to see that there were viewers who found the movie \\"distasteful,\\" \\"disgusting,\\" or \\"dirty.\\" These individuals are clearly close cousins to some of our worst (and most humorless) Puritan forebears, and should probably pack up and head for seventeenth-century Salem as soon as they're able.
B00138F52Q|5.0|Dear Amazon: Can I give this 6 stars? I hereby do such:     ******    In 1973, I think it was, Journey came to Hawaii and performed at a local \\"Battle of the Bands\\" contest in a tiny venue called Andrews Amphitheater. I was there and I will never ever forget that night as long as I live.     They did this on purpose to test out the material for this album on a small audience. They had not yet released the album and nobody had ever even heard of these guys. They came on last, at about 8:00 in the evening, after a day of mediocre local garage bands dueled it out.     What happened then was beyond any superlatives I can think of. I cannot begin to described the state of utter awe and amazement that struck everyone there that night. It goes without saying they blew all the local bands who had played that day off the stage; they then blew everybody in the audience completely away, everybody listening outside who didn't buy a ticket, as well as all the passersby who didn't even know what was going on.     I was close to the stage, and after they were done, I shouted to Neil \\"Hey, how making an album!\\" and he smiled and replied \\"Iya, or two or three, hopefully!\\" Fateful words indeed.     Here, now, in 2008, that night remains the single most memorable magical musical experience I have ever had. If any of you Amazon readers were also there, chime in, I'd like to hear from you.      What a pity they went off in their pop direction, and ruined what could have been one of the greatest bands of all time.
0767020308|5.0|I own three Emma's: this one, Paltrow's and another BBC production from the 70's. The mettlesome Kate Beckensale is perfectly cast opposite Mark Stong as Knightley who brings needful gravitas to the role. The deception of the pretentious Frank Churchill is stylishly carried off by Raymond Coulthard. And who could not admire the lovely Olivia Williams as the silent suffering Miss Jane Fairfax? The talented Samantha Morton is the ill-advised Miss Harriet Smith. None detract from this virtually flawless production.<br /><br />Only one thing could improve: A release in anamorphic widescreen as I've seen aired on public television instead of this full-screen (1.33:1) version.<br /><br />Update 10/19/2017 -- Yay!

May this book aid in the evolution of your consciousness.  May you experience peace, harmony, and true happiness
B0014XCMVM|5.0|In my opinion, Alanis should have been the front woman  of an alt-metal band instead of the oft-pop singer-songwriter she has been. Her best songs were always the songs that rocked.     This album finally takes us back to the future again with an Alanis using her haunting and shrill voice over the kind of instrumentation she needs. There are some ballads here and some folky songs but I want to highlight the ones that make the album easily worth the price and merit a 5 star review from a total snob such as myself(A gangsta rap and heavy metal snob, at that).    Track 1 - Citizen of the Planet    Track 4 - Versions of Violence. This is beyond a doubt Alanis's best song. If you like harder ALanis songs like \\"sister blister\\", \\"man\\", etc, then the album's price is worth it just to get to this song.    I have a love/hate relationship with her music. Most of her catalog is too whiny and wimpy for me, and I like some soft music. But along the way Alanis has given us some serious gems. Without them, I give the album as a whole 3 stars, but I paid the price of admission and I'm happy I did to get at the 4 songs on here that utterly rock.
B0014XCMVM|4.0|In my opinion, the songs on the extra CD are better, or are at least as good, as the songs on the first disc so it's definitely worth the extra couple bucks to get the Deluxe Version to hear Orchid, Madness, Tequila - some great tunes.  All in all, this is a typical Alanis CD - if you like her, you'll like the CD.  A lot of drama, self-realization, poetic lyrics, self-indulgence, and unfortunately, an overabundance of synthesizers.  I love it all except that last bit - way too much use of electronics.  I've been waiting a LONG time for this CD and it doesn't disappoint.
B00004W510|5.0|The Band is the BAND and this is their best album.  Every song is a gem.  I almost regret that this version of the album, with added tracks, has been issued since the original with its 12 perfect songs doesn't need any additions.  But don't let that stop you.  From rollicking good time music like Rag Mama Rag and Jemima Surrender to the melancholy of Whispering Pines and Rocking Chair the Band does something very few albums or novels can do well: bring to a life a cast of characters from another time and make them human.      While every song is great, King Harvest stands at the top of the Band's work with its desperate farmer pleading for nature to save his crops.  The ensemble playing is incredible.  The highest achievement in songwriting and performance.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, is not always an easy read but it is a life changing book and a must read for anyone interested in Self Growth and consciousness raising. It has profoundly impacted my life by changing the way I look at everything. With this new focus the mundane becomes less important, while the state of consciousness or presence that I carry into every moment of everyday is now all important.  With this new direction, that is living from the inside out, things that used to matter don't figure so much in my life. While the everyday matters less, every person, place or thing has become more sacred, more worthy of respect.  I highly recommend this work for everyone who is following a spiritual path to Self Realization by recognizing the Sacred, the Divine in all.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief deals with heavy subject matter - it's set in Nazi Germany and is narrated by Death - but the story is so compelling I found myself savoring every page and reading slowly so it wouldn't come to an end. I've never read a fictional book about the daily lives of ordinary people in Germany during World War II, and that is certainly part of what made The Book Thief so interesting.    The main character is Liesel Meminger, a 9-year-old girl sent with her brother to live with foster parents when her father is arrested for for being a Communist and her mother expects she will soon follow. Her brother dies on the trip to the foster home, and Liesel steals her first book from the man who digs her brother's grave. She settles into the household of Hans and Rosa Hubermann and makes a new life in a town very near Munich.    War is everywhere around them - from book burnings, to Hitler youth meetings, to Jews marching through the streets on their way to concentration camps, to food rationing to bombing by Allied planes. And Death narrates the events of Liesel's life dispassionately, but with wonderful details and with the kind of foreshadowing that made even the hardest events of the book easier to read.    The Book Thief is a rarity among books - a truly original tale that I intend to read again and again. I highly recommend it for mother daughter book clubs and anyone in high-school and older.
0805079831|4.0|Very comprehensive, extraordinarily researched, intense conclusions mark this thought-provoking book.  I would like to say everyone should read this book but this book was not written for the \\"common\\" person.  I would hope that both presidential candidates have someone read this book and discuss the ramifications of it with the whole team of advisors.  This is pretty scary stuff in here.  The only reason I could not give it 5 stars is because I think Naomi Klein is writing for the professors and grad students so the writing can go way over most people's heads.  Most people do not understand basic check-book balancing let alone Friedman economic theories.  I wish she had written \\"down\\" a little more to make this book easily accessible to more people.      When she writes at the end how important her researchers were for her, that is an understatement.  I thought this was one of the best researched books I've ever written.  Hundreds of hours of research had to go into this book.    The book starts off slowly with the descriptions of individual shock therapies which I thought she spent too much time on.  When the book starts into the history/politics side, it blossoms.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I stopped being a huge (and I mean, huge!) Madonna fan in the 90s, however I continued to follow her career and to go to her concerts. After the double disaster of Music and American Life, this CD is just another good one (not as good as Confessions though). The voice is certainly not great, the writing is awful most of the time (all of these 'get,' 'feel,' come on!) but it's perfect for the gym (if you skip She's Not Me and Spanish Lesson, which are definitely unbearable).
B0014XCMVM|3.0|Flavors of Entanglement is a CD that is primed for \\"success\\", but this is also its biggest downfall.  It has three extremely radio friendly songs:  Underneath, Versions of Violence, and Moratorium.  These songs are guaranteed to drive sales with all of the entrapments of a hit CD.  However this is a collection of songs that no one is going to remember two years from now.  There are some songs that are just absolute failures:  Citizens of the Planet, and Strait Jacket.  Both are harsh sounding with odd lyrics.  The rest of the songs are forgettable and average.<br /><br />This is a shame because Alanis Morissette is a very talented singer.  I remember being impressed by her first hit \\"You Oughta Know\\".  However she has been wasting her time on disposable pop that doesn't reflect her true potential.  With better songwriting and a good producer, e.g. Rick Rubin, she could make music that would be much more transcendent.<br /><br />Download this:  Moratorium
B000VUFJ4Q|1.0|I like the album. It's really catchy, but come on why by the same album just becasue of a few new tracks...I could see if it was a single, but the same album..It is not like the record companies are going broke...her album went triple platnium and she broke a few records.
B000002UYZ|5.0|The Beatles - often called the greatest rock and roll band of all time. It would be impossible to pull off a complete greatest hits collection without including dozens of their songs. The next best thing? The double-sided albums \\"1962-1966\\" (red album) and \\"1967-1970\\" (blue album).    As a new fan of the Beatles (I was born after the murder of John Lennon), it was this album that first allowed me to fall in love with the Fab Four. Sure, all of their hit songs aren't included. But it is a great introduction to the early years. More comprehensive than the \\"#1s\\" album, it features such classics as 'She Loves You', 'Yesterday', and 'Yellow Submarine'.    It's evident on \\"1962-1966\\" why the Beatles have become so well-loved. While their early songs don't feature the most though-provoking lyrics, the melodies are downright fun. It's hard to listen to a song like 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and not sing along. However, these master songwriters expanded their horizons beyond that seen in Motown; with tunes such as 'Eleanor Rigby' and 'Michelle', they added a bit of continental flavor to mainstream rock.    Wondering what made the Beatles so spectacular? Or looking for a more comprehensive greatest hits collection? Check out \\"1962-1966\\". It truly showcases the best of the early years.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Excellent show.  Keeps you on your toes at all times.  The unexpected is handled consistently not to let the audiences loose interest.  The characters are very interestingly defined and expectations for the next episode are very well manage by the thread of the story and the production sequels.      It is regrettable that the second season has not been aired yet.  Hast it been produced?
0385340567|1.0|I have purchased every one of Lee Child's books, and preordered this one.  And it is so disappointing.  It is boring.  It goes on and on with Child's trademark word for word descriptions, to the point where I started skipping over PAGES.  The plot is a mishmash of crazy evangelists, the Book of Revelation, US army secrecy, underground railroads for AWOL soldiers, and a whole town full of cancer-ridden maniacal people, who for some reason cannot leave their feudal prison.  None of it holds together, and after awhile, I simply did not care about any of the characters, or the outcome of the story.      And I was looking forward to this book, too.  Darn.
B001437DMA|3.0|Satch's biggest problem is that he raised the bar so high with previous releases that it's nearly impossible to live up to that lofty standard with each subsequent release.  This is a solid effort, although not as heavy as you might want. Actually, he waits all the way until the last two tracks of the cd to start putting the pedal to the metal, and even those two cuts don't match the catchiness of his strongest rockers.  While not among his best work, it's good and it's Satch, and certainly better than 99% of what's out there in the rock instrumental genre.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|While it still wouldn't be quite accurate to describe the Dillinger Escape Plan's work with such labels as \\"song-oriented\\" or \\"mature,\\" there's no denying that Ire Works represents the continuation of a significant progression for the band once known largely as some of the craziest noise merchants in all of extreme music.  Their legendary debut Calculating Infinity became an instant classic with its combination of stunning instrumental skill and relentless pounding aggression, but starting with the one-off Mike Patton-fronted EP Irony is a Dead Scene and continuing with 2004's Miss Machine and now this latest full-length, DEP have dealt out their aural punishment in less consistent and more meaured doses while adding increasing levels of accessibility and diversity to their sound.  That the band has been able to expand and modify their sound without sacrificing the intensity at its core--through consistent lineup changes, no less--is a testament to their nearly unparalleled musicianship and creativity.  And those fans who have remained with the band from the beginning have been rewarded here with DEP's most complete and best album yet.<br /><br />Of course, despite all the changes to be found on Ire Works, the band's older fans should still find plenty to like.  About half of the songs here are signature DEP punches to the face, complete with the manic guitar runs, pummeling irregular rhythms, and imperious howls that fans have come to expect.  Even on the more traditional tech-metal tracks, though, the band never succumbs to predictability--witness Horse Hunter, where the heaviness fades out and then comes roaring back without warning every time you're about to get comfortable.  However, it's on the other, less traditionally psychotic tracks that DEP really branch out and give their listeners some new sounds to absorb.  Black Bubblegum sees Greg Puciato's normally confrontational vocals alternating mainly between acerbic sneering and falsetto crooning, with a catchy melodic refrain that would've been unthinkable during the Calculating Infinity era.  Milk Lizard is one of the most straightforward tunes the band has done this far, but any concerns about its relative accessibility are more than offset by how outrageously awesome it is, from its insanely infectious main riff to its big sweeping chorus to the free-jazzy piano bits that pop up about midway through.  The oddball instrumental When Acting as a Wave and the cavernous, menacing epic Dead as History even introduce some electronic elements that combine with DEP's customary scathing guitars to create an industrial-tinged sound that portends an interesting new direction for the band.  It's not quite Skinny Puppy or Ministry, but it's a start.<br /><br />By the time the album closes with the atmospheric, six-plus-minute epic Mouth of Ghosts, it's clear that DEP are positioning themselves as more than just your average angry tech-metal band.  Overall, Ire Works is yet another classic effort from a band that's managed to transcend its hyper-aggressive roots without abandoning them.  Five stars, easy.dic refrain that would've been unthinkable during the Calculating Infinity era.

0743270754|5.0|This is a terrific book that not only offers a great biography of Lincoln and the Civil War, but does so through the lens of his Cabinet.  By using the Cabinet, the author allows herself to make full use of extensive records that would be less applicable to a biography just about Lincoln.  The book's thesis, that Lincoln's inclusion of his party rivals for the presidency was key to his success, is certainly well argued in the book.  Unfortunately, it is probably representative of a different time despite modern hopes.  Recently, Barack Obama cited Lincoln's experience in discussing his own potential Cabinet.  But what worked in Lincoln's day would likely not work in ours.  Back then, the government was small enough, and the White House staff small enough, that Presidents had to work directly with Cabinet officials.  Despite Lincoln's personal feelings about Salmon Chase for example, there was no White House Economic Adviser for Lincoln to look to for economic advice instead of Chase, or to use as a go between.  He had to engage with Chase day in and day out by necessity.  In modern times, even if a president could get over his initial dislike for a person in appointing them to the Cabinet, as Lincoln did, that person could then be pushed to the sidelines and ignored.  Not so for Lincoln.    But as with many biographies, this book suffers a little from the author being too close to the subject.  Lincoln does no wrong here, or when he does it pales next to the wrongs committed by others.  Hard to believe that anyone, even Honest Abe, could be that perfect.    Having not read anything this in depth about Lincoln, I must admit I did not realize how good a politician he was in terms of his story telling, hand shaking, and recall.  Learning about his political skills, which reminded me of Bill Clinton, was of great interest.    Overall, a great way to learn about Lincoln, the Civil War, and an era of American politics.
B000K4X5XA|3.0|I remember watching this movie at home and thinking wow, this is great!  However, I was 12, the special effects were good for the time and I had nothing to compare it to (remember,I was 12).  Anyway, this movie came free with my PS3, so no harm, no foul, let's see how it looks...  The transfer is not that good, especially the early scenes with Brando.  But that's not the only problem.  Unfortunately, for me, I've seen Batman Begins, X2, Iron Man, Spider Man, just to name a few.  When comparing current comic book based movies now, with Superman then, it's not even a contest.  Gene Hackman and the rest of the cast did what they were supposed to, ham it up.  I mean, it's a comic book, right?  I'd compare Superman with the first Batman with Jack Nicholson, another really bad movie.  The Donner take on things, compared to Christopher Nolan, Bryan Singer or, hell, even Brad Bird, is hokey, pure and simple.  I don't get how Margot Kidder ever got the part as Clark's love interest.  The special effects are cheesy (especially the Mr. Roger's neighborhood that almost gets washed away when the dam breaks.  I know this is heresy, but face it, the movie has aged badly and noone should fork out any money for the blu-ray version if they already have the DVD.  Even then, go rent it first.  If you're honest with yourself, you'll realize that your tastes and expectations have changed, for the better.

067165991X|5.0|A magnum opus - one among many - of Henry Kissinger.      A long book, like the length of his Harvard thesis on which it is based - which was a record setter at Harvard - and the institution of the \\"Kissinger Rule\\" on limiting the length of theses at Harvard.      The length of the book - it is necessary.  It is well worth it.  It is in-depth.  It is a definitive study of diplomacy in a multi-polar environment.  Entangling alliances.  The construction and use of balance of power politics.  Real Politik.      International diplomacy and politics based on power - both actual and perceived.  Balancing.  All of this theory or reality?  Both. Constructed on and from - or merely descriptive of - real world in-depth diplomatic history.    Diplomatic history which Kissinger researched, analyzed, synthesized.    If you desire to learn about diplomacy, this is required reading.  It is also excellent with lots of details on how the European powers manuevered diplomatically and how they calculated and balanced each other's military and other power.  The balance resulted in a long term stable Europe.  A Europe for which for a time was free of large scale war.  His main thesis in the book concerns the positive results of the use of a balance of power and real politik strategy, which he argues resulted in a long term period of peace on the European continent.  The balance and thus the peace, eventually broke down and war broke out.    If you are serious student of diplomacy, foreign affairs, international relations, power, political science, or history, this book is excellent and rewarding.      It does not matter if you are not a fan of Kissenger or real politics or balance of power theory.  His analysis of history or his theoretical synthesis is an important part of the overall conceptual framework international relations and thus is required reading.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I saw this film on Cinemax last night and I think I need to see it again. What started as a taut, emotional, sexual rollercoaster ended up losing steam midway through and wrapped up too neatly for me.     Some incredible themes were explored in this film, mainly the exorcising of people's personal demons.     I absolutely loved the relationship between Rae and Laz, brilliantly portrayed by Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson. Really, I think it's some of the best work either actor has ever done and the film is worth watching just for that!     And Justin Timberlake was surprisingly moving in his role. Very impressive!    And the blues! Oh! The blues! AWESOME MUSIC! I loved getting a taste of that culture.    But again, there was this weird drop in pacing about 2/3 of the way through and I really wonder what got lost on the cutting room floor. I'll have to give it another view to see what I might've missed.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|I must say I've enjoyed the work of all 4 main actors (Winslet, Diaz, Law, and Black) in other films, but they are all sadly wasted in this one.  And casting Jack Black opposite Kate Winslet?  Totally unbelievable.  The only semi-believable character is Rufus Sewell as Winslet's cad of an ex-boyfriend.  The basic plot sounded like fun and had real potential, but much of the dialogue sounded like something a high school student might have written.  And I'm not trying to insult high school students who aspire to be writers, but most of the dialogue is truly immature. The only reason I'm giving it even one star is because Jude Law is so good to look at.

This woman has a way of taking you somewhere else with her angelic yet powerful voice.I've never seen anyone who can convey and pass emotions the way Tarja does.Musically,this album is very dark and beautiful.I was surprised by the Alice Cooper's Poison cover,but in a very good way!

0316010669|5.0|This review will be brief, but decisive. Like the \\"blink\\" - the book's namesake.      blink - refers to the first few seconds (really two seconds) or less - moments really - in which split-second decisions are made. Often life and death decisions. Often decisions which are - by their nature - most often based on preconceptions, prejudice, prejudgment, or ingrained - evolved - subconscious beliefs, stereotypes, and conditioning.    The book, through several cases or examples, explores split-second decision making.  Decision making when you are pressed. Decision making under great uncertainty - where all the facts are not known and you don't have time to get to know them.  Decision making when you don't have time to reason - or to consciously really thinks out.     It is about how time constraints impact decisions.  How they impact the quality of the decisions.      Where all you really have is your \\"intuition\\".  Which is often right, but is also often wrong.      Through a case study-type analysis, Malcolm Gladwell, a brilliant thinker and writer - an original and ground breaking thinker - explores the issues related to these split-second or less than split-second decisions.    If are interested in learning about the brain, decisions, and human psychology and sociology, then I highly recommend this book.  If you are not interested in any of the foregoing, but want to see a brilliant thinker and writer in action (Malcolm Gladwell), then I urge you to buy and read \\"blink\\".

0743201140|5.0|This book is the follow-on to \\"First, Break all the Rules.\\"  The latter targets management while this book is for the individual.  If you buy your own copy of the book, you get a code with which you can take their Strengths Finder online survey.  (You can now also go to the web-site and take the survey for a fee; they used to require a book purchase.)  That tool gives you your top 5 strengths, in order, which is what is missing from First, Break all the Rules.    With your strengths in hand, you can now look at your career, your role in your company, and the direction of your life.  In my case, I understood why I wasn't happy in the previous year with my job.  I had been \\"promoted\\" to \\"leadership\\" for all of my good technical work and was no longer playing to any of my strengths.  I HAD to make a change, which was to get out of the \\"leadership\\" role.  Management wasn't very happy with me.  I continued using the recommendations in this book and formed my own training plan that \\"exploited\\" my strengths and developed them further.  Its been 5 years, and both me and my management are happy.  In fact, this year was my best performance review and raise ever!    My opinion is if you have read the book(s), then take the quiz, that can skew your quiz answers.  I believe the strengths it identified for me, just not sure that the order wasn't affected by my having read both books in their entirety first.  Thus, consider reading this book first even though it is second in the series UNLESS you are a manager and only have time to read one of the two books.  (In that case I would take the quiz using the code from this book, put the book down, and read First, Break all the Rules.)

B000002KNY|5.0|A brief survey of the musical landscape from about 1963 until the present yields the following results:<br /><br />1.  There are a lot of people who write and perform songs that are about nothing;<br />2.  There are some people who write and perform songs that are about something;<br />3.  There are precious few people who can write songs that are essentially about nothing and in constructing and performing them, turn them into songs that are about something.<br /><br />David Byrne's unique genius, as far as I can tell, is his ability to slot himself (with band in tow) into the third category.  Now perhaps this isn't quite a fair, accurate assessment of his body of work, because in a sense the songs he wrote during this period are indeed about something, in fact they are about a lot of things.  But the jumble of ideas is essentially nonlinear, and the stories these songs tell are more in the performance and arrangement of ideas than via a standard narrative.  This was something almost unprecedented for the \\"pop\\" music world, and I think this album was where it reached its apex for Byrne and co.<br /><br />On songs like \\"Air,\\" \\"Animals,\\" and \\"Drugs,\\" for example, it's hard to determine what the message is.  But the way these songs are performed is gripping and provides them a weight you'd never suspect from a cursory read through the lyrics.  Take for example the absurdist lyrics to \\"Air\\":<br /><br />Air...Air<br />Hit me in the face<br />I run faster<br />Faster into the air<br />(I say to myself)<br />What is happening to my skin?<br />Where is that protection that I needed?<br />Air can hurt you too<br />Air can hurt you too<br />Some people say not to worry about the air<br />Some people never had experience with...<br /><br />Air...Air<br />It can break your heart<br />So remember when the weather gets rough<br />(You'll say to yourself)<br />What is happening to my skin?<br />Where is that protection that I needed?<br />Air can hurt you too<br />Air can hurt you too<br />Some people say not to worry about the air<br />Some people don't know s*** about the...<br />Air...<br /><br />Ok what the - ?  But give this a listen, Byrne's lyrics channeled through his one-of-a-kind high-pitched vocal performance and set against a tight, edgy guitar-driven white-boy funk workout.  The paranoia and claustrophobia are virtually palpable.  It's as if the air is pursuing, attacking the narrator.  Or perhaps the narrator is only perceiving this to be the case?  Is the danger all in the paranoid's head?  Or is it real?  The song offers no resolution.<br /><br />This album is varied as well, some lyrics almost telling something of a semi-linear story (\\"Life During Wartime\\") or making a point about everyday existence (\\"Heaven\\").  The common theme is the examination of small things, details in our lives that we might miss if we weren't careful to pay attention to them.  \\"I got some groceries, some peanut butter, to last a couple of days,\\" intones Byrne about halfway into \\"Life During Wartime,\\" and it's easy to believe that this mundanity would be of significant concern to a man hiding out in a building during a war.  On \\"Animals,\\" Byrne scolds non-human creatures for \\"living on nuts and berries,\\" setting a \\"bad example\\" for the rest of us.  I like to think of this as a statement of supreme irony (after all, the animals are surviving quite well but look at humanity!), however the lyric leaves a lot to the listener's imagination.  It takes a mind like Byrne's to think of concepts like that, and enjoy it or not it does provoke a reaction from most people.  That's art.  The very definition.<br /><br />The album is also a relentlessly edgy, herky-jerky tight funk workout which remains one-of-a-kind no matter how many other bands try to emulate it.  If it weren't so overtly weird, it might even play well as a party record.  I was born two years after its release so I have no idea how it was received by the public at the time.  Honestly, compared toa lot of new wave stuff from that era, it's really not that extreme in some ways.  A matter of context I suppose.<br /><br />In sum, this is a brilliant work and holds up just as well now as it ever did.  I love all of the music that this band created, through their final few (poppier) albums, but this one remains the most striking to me.  A rare moment in history where depth of performance and attention to compositional detail transformed abstraction into something concrete and tangible.nd holds up just as well now as it ever did.

I was really surprised and nervous. i stood there and talked about the one story that grabed my attention lately specialy with the fact that i just came from Amsteredam. I talked about Anne and her story, her diary and the amazing sense of words and expressions she had. I talked to them about my passion towards her days and her hidden Annexe she hide in for almost 2 years. everybody listened and were totally into the story and me .

So her experience is even far worse than probably anyone on earth.     It seems that to many, because one singer has had it rough that all singers should sing like they've had it rough. That is not fair and just plain wrong. I hope as you listen to this album more you hear something you enjoy listening to as I do. I Try listening to every album without comparisons. It can be difficult sometimes. You hear that accent and your mind goes to England right away.

B00005JO20|5.0|4.5/5 Stars<br /><br />This remake of one of the most cherished films of all time wins an award for something, a minor one, but still an award and that is that it's probably the best remake of all time.  Not much considering its competition, but still it's something.  King Kong (2005) is certainly worth a look, but I must say some critical response to the running time of over three hours considering it could easily be two hours and still give the same level of emotion, but in the end the film manages to entertain for most of its long running time, as did Peter Jackson's previous films: the big screen adaptations of Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The plot should be familiar with most movie goers.  Director finds map to island, gets a film crew and a young actress and goes to shoot a film.  A hostile native tribe captures the young actress and offers her to their center of worship: a giant gorilla they have titled \\"Kong\\".  The crew of the ship lands and proceeds - with state of the art weapons for the 1930s - past the gates and into the jungles of Skull Island.  There prehistoric creatures aren't quite extinct and they end up in a fight for their live, while the director's schemes end up with the capture of the newly pronounced \\"King\\" Kong and ship him to New York where - as expected - more mayhem ensues.<br /><br />The special effects are well done and can live up to expectations, especially the ones for Kong - not so much the dinos considering the much better dinosaurs we were shown over ten years ago in Jurassic Park.  Regardless this new adaptation of a classic tale of Beauty and the Beast has a level of emotion the classic 1930s version lacked, and that is certainly worth an acknowledgement on it's on.  In this film you can really care about Kong as more then a monster, but as an intelligent creature that just wants to be left alone.<br /><br />The cast was selected well, me being most surprised by how well Jack Black pulled off a dramatic role because I was expecting cheesy comic relief from him throughout the film.  This film is touching and incredibly visual, but it has several weaknesses.  There are too many characters that they try to build up only to be killed early in the script and that wastes time (but a few extras, two in particular are well worth it).  Also Peter Jackson suffers from a similar flaw he had in The Lord of the Rings films.  His action sequences are just too long, just like how he'd have a two page battle from Tolkien's book and have it go on for an well over thirty minutes or add ones that weren't in the books.  Americans like action, but when they drag to movie on to this point they seriously will have people checking their watches wondering how much longer this monkey will be smashing things up.<br /><br />A good film that I thoroughly enjoyed and most people will, but I can't guarantee that it can hold up to repeat viewings the way The Lord of the Rings films can.<br /><br /> (PS:  If you like the theatrical cut I highly recommend the Extended Edition.

0061544493|1.0|I was under the impression that this book was going to be a guide to dressing yourself to look your best. I was dead wrong. It started out by saying that you don't have to have a lot of money to be classy and I agree whole-heartedly. But then she completely contradicts herself the rest of the book. She name-drops pretty much every high-end designer you could think of. It's a blatant advertisement for her denim line. It is also the most repetitive piece of \\"literature\\" I have ever read. Every subject she talks about she uses the same exact wording. She always tells you that you \\"this type of clothing (e.g. t-shirt) you have to spend money on if you want to look good.\\" I could understand if she said this about one article of clothing, but she said it about ALL articles of clothing. She pretty much scrapped her statement at the beginning and the book turned out to be a way for her to show off how much money she has and how wonderful her husband is. Long story short: I read this on an airplane and I had a choice between this book and a skymall catalog. I chose the skymall catalog.
0385340567|1.0|I have always been a huge Reacher fan, primarily due to the edge, the apolitical background and the personal quest for right and wrong. However this one really let me down. So typical of the the \\"New York\\" publishing chic: Bush is bad, Iraq is evil, Christians are creeps, workers are exploited by cruel capitalism. I am surprised we didn't have an evil oil company involved, a group of fundamentalists planning to blow up an abortion clinic or a global warming devastation. I thought Lee Child was above all of this.     Hopefully Reacher will get back to his \\"old self\\" in the future.

B00005JKC3|5.0|4.5/5 stars<br /><br />\\"Hulk\\" 2003 is very different from what you would expect from a typical summer popcorn creature-feature.  From the advertising campaign it appeared to be a mindless special effects extravaganza with little to no plot whatsoever; AKA Summer Fun.  For those who went to see it with that mindset it was undoubtedly a not so pleasant surprise.  Most of whom who saw this on its initial theatrical release obviously had not foreseen Ang Lee's philosophical drama, and they instantly retaliated causing Hulk to fail in most ways.<br /><br />I was surprised, but not in the way these common viewers were, because I loved Hulk.  It is a superhero movie unlike any other comic based film in the last twenty-five years.  This is a film that is filled with heart and emotion and delivers it fully in ways no other film of this genre has done before it.  The art direction and special effects are astounding, and helps bring this comic character to life and oh so much more.<br /><br />The plot starts off rather simply with David Banner, a geneticist who has been studying regeneration, experimenting on various animals and finally ends up injecting himself.  Eventually the mustached scientist has a son - Bruce Banner - who has apparently inherited his father's lab created gene.<br /><br />We now skip forward several years as Bruce begins studying exactly what his father had all those years before: regeneration.  This only ends in what can only be described as disaster as an exposure of \\"Gamma Rays\\" causes his inherited gene to emerge transforming him into the not so jolly, green behemoth known as the Hulk.  From there we are thrown into several well done action sequences as the military under the command of Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a very human and well-crafted performance by Sam Elliot) begins an attempt to capture Bruce/Hulk to obtain this gene.  Only complicating Bruce's hectic life is the reappearance of his crazed father who also cares more about the studies of his past opposed to his son's well-being which goes beyond abuse before finally leading up to an enormous CGI confrontation between mutated father and son.<br /><br />The Hulk does lack in the category of CGI at times with quality going up and down during a few cuts, and an adrenaline junkie will not enjoy the level of dialogue and drama that fills this plot that must have been a cinematic fusion between King Kong, Frankenstein and Marvel Comics.  Ang Lee perfectly utilizes the split frame, thus turning this film into a living comic book and the entire cast does their part in moving the plot along.  This isn't so much a superhero film as it is a doorway looking into the delicacy of humanity.  You know and care about the characters, and you can certainly care about the man beneath the giant green muscled frame of the Hulk.  That is what the movie is about, not a giant green man smashing things up for ninety minutes like so many 2003 movie goers were expecting.<br /><br />Sadly this film didn't hit the audience it should've due to Universal's careless advertising that passed this off as a popcorn film.  If you're someone who likes emotionally compelling and ambitious tales Hulk (2003) may be the superhero film for you.  If you liked Frankenstein or any of the King Kong adaptations Hulk will probably be a movie for you, just don't go in unprepared to think about the material you're viewing.

If Obama doesn't make it to the White House (And I pray he will) he has an easy option for an alternative career as an author.  \\"Dreams From My Father is a masterful book, poetic in nature and detailing an incredible array of gifted and very special relatives that figured into Barack's  life and DNA.

B00164DWEA|3.0|This version of The Incredible Hulk was actually much slower paced than I thought it would be. The Hulk is really only shown about the same amount of time as the last incarnation. The acting was rather bland across the board as well.<br /><br />Now the good stuff. The final battle was pretty good and the movie as a whole wasn't nearly as boring as the Ang Lee release. I also thought the CGI was much better even though it looked blurry at times (it could have been my theater's print). There is also a nice little scene with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark at the end.<br /><br />Worth a look, but I would wait for the DVD.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I have loved Jason Mraz since he began and he has never failed to please.  This album is similar to Waiting for My Rocket To Come (in my view) and not quite as peppy as Mr. A-Z.  I love his fast, wordy, intelligent songs. (I still have Geek in the Pink as my ringer on my phone). This album seemed a bit slower paced, but I love his voice and his jazzy twang. I never liked scat until I heard Jason do it.<br /><br />He has a skill with words beyond any artist I have ever heard.  Read his journal on his website and you will be amazed.  I think he is one of those unassuming but highly intelligent people.<br /><br />We Sing is an album I could put on while reading or entertaining guests.  Not too overpowering, but not total background music either.  I need to listen to it a few more times to really get the \\"feel\\" for it, but I had to do that with WFMRTC as well, and now I love every track except the last two.<br /><br />I saw Jason perform at the PF Chang's Rock N Roll Marathon in Tempe, AZ just before he put out Mr A-Z and he performed a few of his new ones (though we didn't know that's what they were yet!) and he was absolutely the most entertaining concert I have ever been to.  Anyone who has a chance to go see him live should!  He broke into opera at our concert, like he does in one of his tracks on Mr A-Z (Mr. Curiosity, I believe - just in case you didn't think that was him -it is!  I saw him do it with my own two eyes!)<br /><br />I always wait in anticipation for anything new from Jason, and this album did not fail to please.  Also, anyone who can get his Live from the Eagles Ballroom DVD and CD set should- it is wonderful.  He does a great song called \\"Not So Usual\\" which has become my personal theme song.<br /><br />Everyone, buy this album and support this unique and engaging artist!

It's not just that we want Reacher to shut up and fight, it's the absolute extreme nature of the politics-- he all of a sudden sounds like Jane Fonda instead of Mike Hammer.  Worst line said something about how a wounded soldier is garbage to the Army.  That's the worst kind of crap, and Mr. Child should pay attention to more than newspaper exposes about one wing of Walter Reed Hospital.  If he'd actually MET a wounded vet, he'd know better.
0385340567|1.0|Jack Reacher is (was) my favorite fictional character. I pre-ordered this book, based on the sensational series of Reacher novels that preceded it. (Note to self: reconsider pre-ordering books in the future as wife found same book at local BAMM store two days before my copy arrived.) I devoured this book with great relish. The first 64 chapters were vintage Child! Reacher is ever strong and street-smart, while also being vulnerable. There was the inevitable (temporary) feminine romance. And, Jack willingly injected himself into several deliciously tense situations. Child is an artist at building drama and tension and Reacher's fight scenes are, again, things of beauty.    So, what's not to like?    Imagine anticipating the latest Rambo movie for months. Then, you get to the theater and the movie starts. Sly is slicing through the bad guys left and right and you are really getting into it. Then, suddenly, Rambo leaves the jungles of SE Asia and joins an anti-war peace march led by \\"Hanoi Jane!\\" Why, you'd say \\"Wait a doggone minute! Rambo would never do that! That is WAY out of character.\\"    That is the left-turn Child takes with Reacher's character. Do I feel let down? Wish that was the case. I feel betrayed, stepped on, spit on and taken advantage of. Child turns the novel, in Chapter 65, into a political diatribe that is disgusting. If he did so only with the plot, well, I wouldn't have liked it. But, he does so with his central character. That is the line Child stepped over.     I put this book down in the midst of chapter 66. In fact, I gave the book away. Short of some sort of resurrection, I cannot imagine purchasing one of Child's books again. Lee, you deceived me in the worst way. From everything I read leading up to this novel, Reacher's character would have never taken the position you had him assume in this book. It is not only unbelievable, it tarnishes the entire series of novels.     Good riddance.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm a fan of Victorian-era movies in general, but this is one of my favorites for several reasons.  First, it's more like Charles Dickens than Jane Austen, which is a welcome plot/theme change.  It's nice to see people with real struggles other than getting married, and it's nice to see more than just upper middle-class and upper-class people portrayed.    Second, the characters are good people, but far from perfect.  John Thornton brutally beats a man for smoking in his factory.  Margaret Hale has a number of rude moments with Thornton and lies to cover up her brother's involvement in a man's death (though the circumstances of course make it more understandable).  I don't like seeing movies that portray completely dysfunctional or depraved people, but I also like characters to be realistic and human.  I think the portrayal of characters in this movie struck a very good balance in that area.    Third, the political issues in the movie are very fairly presented for both sides.  The union workers are portrayed as honest, hard-working men who are only trying to earn a fair wage to support their families.  I do have to say that most of the mill owners are portrayed as greedy fat cats, but Thornton not so much.  He's portrayed as being tough but fair with his workers, and in some cases even generous.  And throughout the movie he makes some very good cases for capitalism.  Overall, it shows that neither side is perfect, and that the biggest problem affecting relations between the workers and masters is not greed or grumbling, but a refusal (at least at first) to understand each other.    Overall, this is an excellent movie.  I do have to agree with those who have bashed the closing scene--it would have been absolutely scandalous to kiss in public in Victorian society.  As far as I'm concerned, other than that scene, it's pretty much a perfect movie.    Clark
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This the story on DVD of Jomn Addams who was the presadint and was the most powerfull man in the WORLD and fought in the sivel wars and beat the Brittish (or Red Cotes for you history bufs) and was a lawyer and travel to france and but didn't speak french but was friends with Tomas Jefferson who invented electristy.  This is a powerfull story and movie which was acted very powerful by Paul Gimmuati who plays Jon Addams.  Even though Paul doesn't play lots of diferent roles in the movie like the GREAT EDIE MURFEY does in him movies, Paul instead focus his energy on only one role, and does it good!     Lauren Linnenny plays the great Mrs Jon Addams and think she's all smart and try to keep up with her husband but history and science show that a woman back in the olden times wasn't as smart as a MAN face facts it's a fact don't blame me I didn't make it up don't shoot the messger it's just science anyway Mrs. Jon Addams is in the movie allot which take time away from important movie plots like the sivel war and the signing of the Declaratun on Indepencense and the boston mascara.  There was some cool senes where they was at war and it started to get like Band from Brothers there for a minute but they never really showed much warring which is a GYP and a RIPOFF come on dawg you know they were fightin a war why not show it more for pete sakes its the sivel WAR you know there was more fights than ONE histry PROVE that in histry books if the writer ever pick up a histry book he would know that.     Then Jon Addams goes to France where they all wear makeup (even the DUDES, dude!) and he hated it in Frace because he was a true american not like that TRATOR Tomas Jeferson who sleep with slaves and was a trator!!! But they still are good friends anyway even tho one of them is a presidint and one of them is a terrist go figure it was before Sept 11 so who knew!!!!     I recomend this movie for you to watch and give it FIVE STARS even though it is a ripoff and there is not enough war and guns and esplosions and olden times cannons.  It's LONG though so be prepare to watch this for allmost THREE HOURS because there were three epsodes. If you like history and don't get offended by the past which ain't allways PC then this the movie show for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This isn't a \\"gay film\\" as much as it is a compelling and touching story of two men who find each other in a difficult period of transition. I guess that technically makes it a gay film, but it's so much more. This movie could be enjoyed by anyone and everyone. It's an instant classic and is one of the best, most romantic films I've seen.    I happen to really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times since it came out. The cinematography is excellent and shows the beauty that can be found in the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\", as well as how naturally gorgeous Southern California actually is.     I really enjoyed the acting and wasn't, the combination of the writing, acting, direction and camera work gives this film a very honest feel. You can tell that everyone involved really cared about the script. All of the actors are great, but both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe shine in this production - they are both very talented and charming actors and I honestly hope that we see more from the both of them in the future.     While there are things about the ending of the movie that feel a bit contrived, the sweetness of how it unfolds really outshines any criticism I have.     It's definitely worth checking out.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I am very grateful for Frank Miller's stubborn attitude.  Without it, 300 would just be another hollywoodized comic adaptation.  The fact that Frank Miller was so picky, saved the original concept of the graphic novel.  Some history buffs have concerns with the film, but that's because it's a graphic novel with some faint connections to history.  I don't watch this film as a documentary. No! This film is about the amazing personalities of 300 men.  It is an inspiration to all of us warrior out there fighting to succeed in life, metaphorically.<br /><br />But anyway, besides all that mess, 300 is an atom bomb of new stylized action.  I totally agree with the review that stated something like \\"it is the new matrix,\\" because it is really a groundbreaking film.  The slow-mo/fast-mo action scenes are incredible and should be appreciated for their quality.  Zack Snyder did not miss his shot on any scene.  Word for word, and stab for stab this movie is beautiful.<br /><br />Speaking of words, Frank Miller is one of the most incredible dialogue creators of all time.  When people say \\"there's too much talking and storyline in this movie\\" that's because most films don't fill the gap between action with powerful dialogue.  Action films must have balance.  300 has balance like the spear-throwers that stand poised within the battles.<br /><br />So we have an excellent script and source.  We have testosterone-injected action.  What else do we need? The movie cannot survive without a great cast.  Gerald Butler, Lena Headey, Dominic West, David Wenham, and Vincent Regan all could not have been easily replaced.  This is not because of their individual efforts, but because of their connection as a whole to the material.  They all had the same gleam in their eye that convinced me that they were there, when really they were in front of a green screen the whole time.  Gerald Butler has earned the medal of one of the best action stars of all time.  He deserves so much more credit and he needs a role besides a P.S. I Love you romantic.<br /><br />Some people don't bother with reviews because of their length.  I know I've done it too.  So I will make it short and sweet.  Frank Miller's graphic novels will always make amazing movies if he is involved.  If you enjoyed this film you must also see SIN CITY.  These two films are a couple in my favorite movies of all time. If you love action, then see the mother of all hack-slashing, spine-tingling, and heart-pounding films.  300 is a classic of our time..S. I Love you romantic.

B0000067L4|5.0|This is the final release of then new material along with live tracks by the late great Cream.<br /><br />I bought this on vinyl when it came out and it has had a special place in my heart ever since. The live tracks, I'm So Glad, Politician and Sitting on Top of the World are excellent.<br /><br />Apparently I wasn't the only budding guitar player to dig this album as a kid. I saw both Eddie Van Halen (1984 tour) and Yngwie Malmsteen (Trilogy tour) quote the opening phrases and the first cycle of the solo to \\"Sitting on Top of The World\\" as part of their Spotlight Solos. Of course I was in Git-nut heaven both times.<br /><br />A Wikipedia search revealed that Joe Bonamassa listed Goodbye as one of the records he was most influenced by.<br />I also like the studio tracks, Badge being the hit but What a Bringdown smokes as well (I love the breakdown here, good headbanging material-ha).<br /><br />I also was impressed with the mastering of the CD reissue. I always felt the level was a bit low on vinyl (especially the live tracks) and this was corrected for the CD. The sound is totally full bodied and present.<br /><br />Cream is gone but not forgotten.
0312360266|4.0|i enjoyed reading this book and all three that are in the serise can't wait for the forth book to come out.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This is a well-done film with much greater character development than that of your typical action flick, and a very welcome lack of computer-generated special effects.  The ad campaign for this film was purported to sell it as a kind of \\"Gladiator\\" on the high seas but this is not a purple-prosed melodrama - it's nuanced and much more affecting because of it.      On an audio technology note, the surround sound recorded cannon volleys are very dynamic and may have you ducking.
B000002HO3|5.0|Simply Red was on Satilite TV and I really enjoyed it. He was performing in Sicily. The music was great and I believe he really loves to perform. It shows. I like it when he gets into the music by dancing to it.
1582701709|1.0|I was recommended this book by colleagues and friends.    I read through it and realized if one truly follows the suggestions in this book, one is more likely to suffer from delusions than to actually get what they want. I mean how on earth can one imagine that the universe will work toward making our wish come true just because we express it?    Common sense would tell us to  make the best of our situation. To take life as it comes. being positive works when we see the good of our situation, not worry about what we cannot have and enjoy the present moment for what it is. This book does the opposite. It tells us go all out and wish hard for things we want. To not accept the way things are and to not make the best of things!
6305212112|3.0|I had never seen this movie and always had heard good things. I am sorry but I found it depressing and the underlying theme of two women attracted too each other was annoying. Either be truthful and up front or keep it out of the story. Totally sucked in my opinion. Sorry
B000BEZPQE|2.0|Of course, because it is a slipknot album and they rock, the album definately has potential...  however Corey's INCREDIBLY bad vocals on the album destroy any chance of this being \\"the greatest live album ever\\"  Do yourself a favor, buy the Disaterpieces DVD....  and you'll see Corey in all his glory, without his voice all messed up.....you want greatest live album ever it's Disaterpieces, not this waste of 20 bucks.   His voice is beyond TERRIBLE in the album.....  almost to the point where you wonder if they even listened to this before they released it.  No lie, it seriously sounds like someone else singing Slipknot songs.....dont waste your time with this,  get Disasterpieces....
B00004U45G|5.0|Given it is the Black Crowes and Page I expected good things, however I was blown away.  If you like bluesy, sexy, powerful driven music - then this is for you.  This combination makes In My Time of Dying, Custard Pie, Celebration Day and Out on the Tiles rock.  They slide through Ten Years Gone, Your Time is Gonna Come and The Lemon Song in ways that will give you new appreciation for the music.  Page hits a few sour notes in his solos, but beyond that this is certainly worthy of purchase.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I was delightfully surprised when I found out that this and the Final seasons were both out.  I loved Charmed and watch it every day on TV.  I'm glad to have these two seasons because I can watch them over and over again.  I'm just sorry they quit filming.

B000002J1S|5.0|It is a well known fact that Peter Gabriel has proven himself quite the observational songwriter much like Bob Dylan, as I hear the other reviewers say. And yes, it's quite true, actually. The songwriting is incredible; Peter tells a long story through this dual-disc effort about someone named Rael. I'm not certain of how the story goes, but long story short, it is quite the musical effort you'd expect from someone like Peter Gabriel. I am aware that there are many Genesis albums out there, many of which are from the Phil Collins era. But if you are willing to check out one of the older Genesis albums from the Peter Gabriel era, make it this one.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|If you're just getting into Nightwish, this is the album to get; it's got the same full orchestra, pounding metal power, and high production quality as Dark Passion Play, but on Once you have Tarja, and that makes a big difference.    I think new vocalist Annette sounds fine on DPP, but it's just a more generic sound.  No doubt some will view it as more \\"accessible\\" than Tarja's operatic vibrato, but I think Tarja's voice - Wagnerian, bombastic, over-the-top - was just a better fit for the Nightwish sound and overall concept.      While I concede that the whole idea of symphonic metal is pretty far removed from most of today's pop, Annette's vocals give Nightwish more of a pop sound, and one closer to other female-fronted acts.  With Tarja, they were unique.      So that brings us back to Once.  I think it's the best Nightwish album ever.  Personal favorites for me are \\"Wish I Had An Angel,\\" \\"Planet Hell,\\"  \\"Creek Mary's Blood,\\" and \\"Ghost Love Score.\\"  I can do without \\"Romanticide,\\" but other than that this is one great album.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|***** 2007. Based on Richard Matheson's [[ASIN:0765318741 I Am Legend]] and directed by Francis Lawrence. Dr. Robert Neville is the sole survivor of a pandemic that started in NYC. For three years now, he has tried to find an antidote to the virus at night while infected people are haunting the city. I'm fed up with these reviewers who consider that this film is bad because it doesn't do justice to Richard Matheson book. When Van Gogh paints a face in green or orange, you don't say that his painting is not good because the face's color is not the model's, do you ? After the already very good [[ASIN:B0009MDPYM Constantine (Widescreen Edition)]], Francis Lawrence prooves with I AM LEGEND that he's a real filmmaker one will have to count with in the future. His film is simply the best science-fiction film since Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]]. Masterpiece.
B000002UDD|5.0|This is the pinnacle of classic thrash. If you enjoy banging your head and blowing out your speakers, I highly recommend this album. This masterpiece is so extreme that it's like drinking a milkshake made of liquid metal or eating nail casserole. Megadeth has always been a step ahead in speed, volume, and originality than their other 'metal' competitors, and this album truly demonstrates why Megadeth was, is, and will be the heaviest band ever.     Why people give this album bad marks is as mysterious to me as why people listen to post-Master Metallica. The production is a little grainy and rough, but I'd say it suits the selection. It bolsters the raw intensity of the songs and adds a chaotic, overwhelming force to the album as a whole. Whatever you do, don't get the remastered version. Sure, you'll get your sliver of 'Rust' on the side of the case, but the 'improvements' they added to it strip many of the songs of their feel, primarily the first two tracks (my favorites). Though this lineup wouldn't last, everybody was on the mark for this album, despite how high and drunk they probably were when they recorded it.     You don't have to buy this album, but your life won't be complete until you've given it a whirl. You'll be a lost soul, cursed forever to roam the earth and listen to crappy music. If you like angsty garbage that all sounds the same, you can buy 'Reign In Blood' and listen to the same track ten times in a row. And if you have a man-gina, well, there's always '..And Justice for All'. However, if you like innovative, pulse-pounding thrash metal that is rife with passion and precision, that will leave you enlightened as much as it will devastate your mind, buy this CD now and your only regret will be that you did not steal it sooner.
044661758X|4.0|\\"The Concrete Blonde\\" may be the best of the four Harry Bosch books I've read so far (\\"Echo Park\\" might be on a par, though I read it too long ago to be sure now).  It's full of follow-ups and revelations.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, and more than one red herring.  Had I stuck with my first choice for the murderer, I'd have been right, but like a practiced magician, Connelly uses a lot of misdirection to pull-off the trick and entertain me to the end.  I'm glad he outsmarted me.  Was a better ride that way.  Can't wait now to read the next one, \\"The Last Coyote.\\"
B000UD08HW|5.0|David Gilmour at his best. If you have a decent surround sound system and like Pink Floyd, settle down with your favorite refreshment and turn the volume up as loud as you dare. This blu-ray shows Gilmour's perfectionist attitude about mixing and recording to your advantage.  Wow! Wish you were here, indeed.  Easy rider
B0012K1ILW|2.0|I think I've listened to this cd, once all the way through. My  question is... Aren't you supposed to release your outtakes after  the the original cd has dropped?  Hopefully, PT 2 will be much  more focused and musically challenging.
B00164DWEA|4.0|It has become my habit of late to provide a disclaimer concerning source material.  I try to avoid judging a film based on its original source if it has one (in this case; the comic books).  However, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" sort of forces you into mentioning the source material.  It also is helpful to use the first film \\"The Hulk\\" as a point of comparison since Marvel did not dispense with that films story line completely.  With that said, lets get into the point of the title above; though entertaining, this film had serious flaws that kept it from the greatness achieved by the landmarks \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"Iron Man\\".<br /><br />-BETTER THAN BAD<br />Many people absolutely loathed the first Hulk film.  The story was slow and drawn out, Eric Banna was inappropriate as Bruce Banner, the villain was horrible and many complained of the CGI as looking too \\"Video Game\\". The new film corrects much of this.  The stories pacing moved along nicely and with purpose.  Ed Norton fit into the Bruce Banner \\"suit\\" perfectly in both physique and demeanor.  The villain (Tim Roth) was both well developed and formidably exciting.  The visual FX... the visual FX...  Well 3 out of 4 isn't so bad I suppose.<br /><br />-WORSE THAN GREAT<br />If you thought the first Hulk film looked fake then be prepared; this stuff does not look real at all.  I actually thought the first film did a more convincing job of capturing the texture of skin.  In the new film the Hulk's skin looks like salamander skin; always shiny.  Unfortunately this was not the only glaring flaw.  In a comic book movie you expect to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the obviously preposterous characters.  That's cool.  However, you should not be expected to suspend logical behavior and reason.  The military conduct in this film would certainly result in, at the very least a court marshal and at worst, public execution.  I thought the days of open warfare on college campuses were over since Kent State (Never mind the heart of downtown anywhere).  There are also other annoying plot holes and miss-steps that knock this film down a little.  On a personal taste level, I felt the final battle could have been more exciting if some extreme haymakers were included.  You know; punching your rival half way across town?  It was more of a cat fight with scratching and pushing that suffered a little from O.A.D. (Obscured Action Disease).<br /><br />-IF ONLY IT WERE INCREDIBLE<br />Here's where source material actually becomes important.  If you never watched the Hulk TV show, read the original comic books or even saw the first Hulk film then you will NOT get the most out of what this film has to offer.  The main reason the first film matters at all is to understand how he got to where he is at the start of this film.  This might be the only thing from the first film that was kept.  Despite the flaws I pointed out, I enjoyed this film much more than the first one because it maintained the spirit of what the Hulk is; \\"HULK SMASH!!!!.  In the theater where I saw this, there were about four little clusters of \\"Hulk Savvy\\" viewers who chuckled, clapped and snickered at all the little inside jokes.  These may have been the highlights of the film for me.  For those not familiar with the Hulk history; you will not get the jokes and the film will lose a fair chunk of its value.  Unlike \\"Iron Man\\" this film does not stand alone quite so well.<br /><br />-THE VERDICT<br />Compared to \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Spiderman\\" this is a much darker film and not nearly as high on the fun factor.  I would not bring younger children to see this.  The violence is very scary, the language a little rough and there is one bedroom scene that starts out a little hot and then calms down for safety reasons.  Though not without flaw, this is certainly better than \\"The Hulk\\" and especially entertaining for those familiar with the history of this comic book icon.  The first film, \\"The Hulk\\" gets 2.5 stars.  I give \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" 3.5 stars.  It's not bad, but not great either.

1400095204|5.0|My book group only reads award winning books, I select them all except one each year, this is a little a scary because I want the group to always love the time they spend reading. Well this book will be one of those books, their are very developed characters,good history lessons,  lovely descriptions of the flowers and trees and then as the war starts engulfing them...the starkness of what is left in their towns is painful. It is not a light book, but a book that you will not want to put down and will not want it to end. You will feel Love of family, Love of county and a vivid descriptions of Love and Hate of mankind.

B000PC0U1W|4.0|I love this movie, and so do my kids!  I can't tell you how much of an interest in English politics my youngest has taken too since we began watching V, but in a household that watches parliament instead of the house of congress, it's nice to have my kids take an interest.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|Sure, there are similarities to other newish, neo-soul Brit girls like Duffy and Amy Winehouse, but Adele Atkins seems effortlessly able to take her own corner in music...she's bluesier than the above two, and seems not about having hits but pure expression...not unlike Laura Nyro, or even a modern quirkier Alison Moyet, or a bluesy Lisa Stansfield...<br /><br />I really like how some tracks are just Adele and her guitar (or bass), and some are beautifully orchestrated with glockenspiel on top...it's like the choice and amount of instrumentation and arrangement are just as important as the song itself (she wrote 11 out of 12...the other is a nice cover of Bob Dylan's \\"To Make You Feel My Love\\")...nice variety and track order, so much so that it flows perfectly and no tracks get old...there is a timeless quality here...\\"Chasing Pavements\\" is a total stunner...sounds like a classic lost Northern Soul track...just lovely.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the 5-track live US bonus disc, that's awesome...her expression here is pure and true...plus her positive attitude and exuberance between songs is infectious...please never lose that quality Adele...I love that blues cover of \\"That's It, I Quit, I'm Moving On\\", and her rapport before the song...like \\"This is a cover, it's the blues, it's all good, we love playing it\\"...in a giggly way...<br /><br />If this is just Adele's debut, at just 19...wow...it's scary what she will come up with next...hopefully it's no fluke...<br /><br />This record just proves that there is room for all British females here in the States...next up...Amy McDonald!!!
B0012K1ILW|5.0|First, let me say that Mama's Gun is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I've never tired of it.  I really didn't care for Worldwide Underground, which really hurt because I love Ms. Badu.  I got this cd and popped it in the stereo and then came to a halt and had to stop and look through the lyrics and gave it a good listen.  This is not a snap your fingers driving down the street with your girls kind of cd.  You will not want to play it before a date or going to the club.  However, you will love it if you are tired of tired lyrics and pre-packaged \\"divas\\" who can't sing, think or inspire.    I just saw Erykah in Chicago and was blown away by the way she shared with her audience.  She gave a full 2-hour performance.  Her voice was on, she danced and she delivered a show.      I will not pretend to be on Erykah's \\"level\\" and to know everything that she is talking about.  But I will say that I enjoy her willingness to stay creative and true to herself.  Her authenticity and eccentricity is something that admire and haven't grown tired of yet.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I am fortunate enough to own both the original LP and the remastered CD. I love them both. This music is not for one who simply wants to be entertained. One must mentally interact with it.While all the musicians are exemplary, Bill Bruford's brilliant percussion is the glue that holds these compositions together.  At first glance, it falls into the genre of progressive rock...only because when it was produced, the term fusion was not used to describe music. There is a solid rock performance, no doubt; but it is far more complex with underpinnings of jazz and classical...21st century schizoid man is a very \\"tight\\" yet meandering composition, with a most brilliant variations in  timing. I talk to the wind is light and ethereal...you can really \\"feel\\"  the wind. Moonchild vividly describes the presence and movement of a little being experiencing her world.  The Court of the Crimson King, majestic...with an interesting little interlude where you can vividly imagine This mighty king beholding  little puppets doing a jaunty little dance in the court. You must really listen to appreciate what a brilliant set of compositions this album holds. If you do not give it your full attention, you will miss a unique musical experience. I would love to see a ballet choreographed to this album.
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease will continue to stand the test of time forever. I am in my fifties, my son is 18. I enjoyed the movie's music when I was his age, he enjoys it as much now, 34 years later from the time I first did. Apparently the music is timeless. Just as it moved people to sing along, dance or click their fingers at the very least when it was first heard, so does it continue to do the same now.      I can almost see my son introducing this music to his  children in the future, and their enjoying this as much as I did then and now.

Although the film has a surfeit of action and gargantuan battle sequences (involving more devastation than Cloverfield), Leterrier's Hulk is little more than King Kong. An insipid love story, predictable villains and jargon-drenched palavers don't help the mighty green giant from becoming anything more than a typical superhero. At least the attention to seriousness is comparable to Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of Batman.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has accidentally unleashed a gamma poisoning mutation within himself that causes his body to transform into a hulking green monstrosity. Unable to control the raging Hulk, which is summoned by his anger, he hides away from the world in the crowded favelas of Brazil. Bruce converses with a mysterious Mr. Blue through an encrypted satellite connection, in the hopes of learning the secret to removing the contamination from his body.<br /><br />Meanwhile, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) diligently scours the globe looking for the elusive Banner, who he tricked into experimenting with the radiation for use as a military weapon. The General's daughter, Betsy (Liv Tyler), is still in love with Bruce, but he keeps his distance to prevent hurting her or causing the deaths of innocent people. To help with the manhunt is Russian professional tough guy Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), on loan from the Royal Marines. But after witnessing Banner's unbridled powers as The Hulk, Blonsky desires such abnormal invincibility for himself - leading to further freakish experimentations that will unleash an abomination.<br /><br />The opening title sequence for The Incredible Hulk rapidly sums up the entire Hulk origin, thereby leaving the brunt of the film to serve merely as an episode of adventure. The General occasionally fills us in on missing pieces of integral information, but for the most part, this film could serve as both a remake and a continuation (a retcon, in comic fandom) of Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003. Not having much to live up to, The Incredible Hulk easily outperforms its predecessor, but not to the point of undeniable success. In an age where comic book movie adaptations are no longer once-a-year or out of the ordinary, this latest attempt sadly feels like a typical superhero movie. The special effects are better, the editing is certainly more tolerable, and the characters are handled with more sincerity and seriousness, but the story is frightfully familiar and rather un-involving.<br /><br />Attempting to create reason behind unexplainable elements such as The Hulk's ability to keep his pants on (which is both impossible and largely unnecessary), the film temporarily forgets that it is still leaps and bounds from being even slightly reasonable. It does distract us with Cloverfield-rivaling destruction at Culver University and New York City, and the Hulk-Abomination fracases are magnificently constructed and shot. The Hulk doesn't defy gravity or fly around like Lee's original version, but occasionally his movements are too light and graceful for his tree-stump figure.<br /><br />Director Louis Letterier does succeed in making a darker, more violent and more serious Hulk, and the references to other Marvel creations, the expected cameos, and explosive action remains. But despite crafting a better Hulk, the story and overall entertainment value can't compete with the choice superior superhero movies that demonstrate both creativity and heart - such as Iron Man and Batman, which are more frequent than ever before.<br /><br />- Mike Massiea continuation (a retcon, in comic fandom) of Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003.

0743243153|5.0|The Road Less Traveled is a classic that explores personal discipline, love, growth and religion.  It is inward looking, insightful, sound and practical in many cases.  There are some areas that are controversial, and this can detract from the material a little.  But, each person must choose his or her own path...as the book points out.<br /><br />Scott Peck does an  excellent job of presenting this material on self-reflection, analysis and addressing personal growth in a positive manner.

Men from Mars Women are from Venus explores the differences between the needs and communication styles of men and women.  The book is written primarily for both men and women over twenty five.<br /><br />John Gray explains that men and women are so unlike each other that they might as well be from different worlds.  For several years before this book was written many felt it was improper to discuss gender differences.  Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus and other books like it fed this oppressed need.  The high volume of sales reflects the desire that men and women want to learn more about each other.<br /><br />John Gray makes some significant contact with his readers on some key issues. For example, Gray argues that men mistakenly offer solutions to problems (problem solvers) and inadvertently invalidate feelings.  Women tend to offer unsolicited advice and direction.<br /><br />Another important concept that Gray explores is that men aren't always willing to discuss what is bothering them (John Gray calls it going to their cave).  Women want to address relationship issues immediately. Gray explains that understanding male and female differences helps a couple to accept each other and work together for a better relationship.<br /><br />Although very good in some important places, it is lacking in others. The  shortcomings of this book need addressing.  First, Gray generalizes male and female characteristics without adequately addressing individualism. His generalizations oversimplify how men and women act and react.<br /><br />Next, Gray doesn't adequately address the similarities between men and women.  In some cases he goes out of his way to show how men and women are different when it can be easily argued that they are alike. For example, John Gray writes that the primary love needs of women are: caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation, and reassurance.  He says that the primary love needs of men are trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval and encouragement. Gray ignores that men need caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation and reassurance and women need trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval, and encouragement.<br /><br />Some people take Gray's thesis as gospel without questioning its validity.  For example, a book published in 1995 book entitled: He's OK She's OK: Honoring the Differences Between Men and Women by Jeannette Lofas, and Joan MacMillan quotes the love needs of men and women noted in John Gray's book without further question or comments. The point Lofas and MacMillan are trying to make is to accept the differences between men and women.  This is well taken, but using a quote from John Gray's book without  exploring whether these needs are really gender specific makes this part of He's OK, She's OK lacking.

B000H5U832|5.0|Movie Summary:<br />While on his way to a tie-breaker race in California, Lightening McQueen, a famous racecar, gets into trouble in a little town called Radiator Springs. He is sentenced to repairing the road that he tore up. While there he makes friends and finds out that doing things for others can be more rewarding than putting yourself first.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br />Really cute story about true friendship, keeping your word and doing the right thing. My preschool son loves this movie. He is always asking to watch it. We've seen it dozens of times and it never gets old. My husband who never likes animated films enjoys CARS. Sure to be a Disney classic.
1878424505|1.0|This was a big disappointment. It was recommended to me by a \\"personal coach\\" along with a few other books.

I tried my hardest to get past that and finish the book.   Unfortunately, I hit the wall about halfway through.

I will be disappointed if new stories from this very gifted writer continue to begin in the vein of \\"Ananya fidgeted with her bangles and the ravika of her sari as she waited for Satrajit, her parent's favored candidate for her hand, to arrive from MIT where he had just secured a professorship in astrophysics.......\\"  Lahiri's is an interesting and compelling literary universe, but unlike the real one, not inexhaustible.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Christian Bale is one of the greatest actors of his generation.  That said, the Machinist is a unique psychological thriller in that the protagonist looks like Death warmed over.  Bale is so bone-thin, it lends to the fear factor and the realism.<br /><br />The story is about Trevor Resnik, a loner machinist who works the graveyard shift.  Strange events begin to occur, and Trevor believes there may be a conspiracy against him.  As the viewer is drawn into his world, brief moments of happiness, respite from the fear, do not last long before we are plunged into another waking nightmare.  We long for release for Trevor, and it is granted at the end, but not after a bit too long of a rollercoaster ride of mental adrenaline.<br /><br />Recommended, but I recommend the futuristic action film Equilibrium more.  Bale is his best here, physically (thank God) and of course in acting ability.
0385340567|4.0|Jack Reacher's latest isn't as good as \\"Echo Burning\\" and \\"Without Fail,\\" but it is better than \\"Die Trying.\\" It's on a par with \\"The Enemy.\\" The writing is taut and intelligent. Child is good at giving information about characters and plot, and the mechanics of his writing are high polished. Once in a great while an English word creeps in (\\"spanner\\" for \\"wrench\\"), but Reacher is a believable American military character. The plot ranges in believability. The set up of two contrasting towns in the middle of nowhere is striking. There are two sub-plots that work very well and one that almost works. (You be the judge of which is which.) One of them is heartbreaking and centers on a clinic scene that is the best thing Child has written. The only thing that isn't as taut as it should be is the very finish, and it's better than average for any other writer on the planet. My reading time wasn't wasted and Child didn't miss the target by much. Maybe he was just too ambitious and too rushed at the same time.
B0018CNNTY|1.0|I'm a sucker for anything fantasy or science fiction oriented! I give each and every film the benefit of the doubt! What troubles me so greatly is that The Fall starts out as delightful - and then turns into something very ugly!<br /><br />Keep in mind this about an innocent and rather naive child somewhere between 8-10 years  of age.  She is manipulated into assisting an attempted suicide.  This is no potential mercy killing, either! It's about a  grown man who will descend into the pits of hell to emotionally scar a rather vulnerable child. He has no self control or conscience! All he cares about is killing himself, so why worry about collateral damage!<br /><br />Nor is this some backwater hospital. It's state of the art for the 1920's! Where famous people and orange-harvesting, migrant workers cross paths. But this \\"modern\\" hospital lets a young child run around with impunity, literally sharing a bed with middle aged man who is known to the hospital staff as suicidal. Hey, but its the 1920's and this crazy non-sense doesn't raise so-much as an eyebrow!<br /><br />But when the child, who may have fractured her skull from falling - because she made a second attempt to raid the morphine in an unlocked and unguarded pharmacy - we get to watch this very disturbed man turn his delightful story, that he created from thin air,  into a nightmare of gruesome death and destruction. To add insult to injury, we then get to see our young hero start crying hysterically while lying trapped in a hospital bed, no-less, totally at the mercy of  this lunatic!  If this is not child abuse, I don't know what is!<br /><br />At this point, I said to myself, doesn't this young child actor have any parents? How could they let their rather young daughter act in such a twisted movie? Isn't this a form of exploitation?<br /><br /> My next thought was: \\"This is such a sadistic story, and I paid my hard earned  money to watch this unmerciful, pain-inflicting non-sense.\\" I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of entertainment!<br /><br />My only consolation is this god-awful film is currently running in only 1 obscure movie theater in a metropolitan area of well over a million people!

B00000C28M|5.0|I give 5 stars to this performance despite poor broadcast recording quality & outrageous freedom the pianist takes tempo-wise. First, I'm not one of those blind Gould admires who give 5 stars to every recording he made. Secondly, I'm familiar with all great recordings of this concerto. What makes this performance truly great is Gould's audacity to break the traditional mold of how piano concerto should be played, and to bring forth completely new and creative conception of the music.    Although, before the performance, Bernstein comments on 'who is the boss' problem in concerto performance, Gould has no interest in dazzling display of piano part. Neither the conductor nor the pianist is the boss here, but the symphonic grandeur of the music itself takes centre stage. It almost sounds like Bruckner symphony with added piano part. The effect is curiously thrilling and deeply romantic as architectural beauty and subtlety of the piano part are more vividly captured in unusually slow tempo. I've never come across more delicate playing of the slow movement since I listen to Fleisher's magical account.    The most unfortunate thing about this recording is the disgraceful audience on their coughing campaign throughout 1st movement. They apparently did not heed what Bernstein said before the performance. They are the miserable narrow-minded kind who believes composer's markings are holy doctrine and denies any other possibilities of interpretations. This recording is a monument to remarkable open-mindedness of the conductor and bravery of the artist as well as a testimony to disgusting conservatism of classical music world in general.
0812975219|5.0|i find it fascinating the diverse reviews this book has received, it seems to have a polarizing effect on readers!  for me the book was engrossing, but admittedly i am a fan of taleb's writing and philosophy of life.  while he is clearly not concerned with journalistic rules he is able to communicate his point.  so what if his sentence structure is not perfect.  what i appreciate most about his works, fooled by randomness included is that they caused me to think, and rethink my own beliefs and perceptions about life.  i felt challenged by the content and relished the opportunity to ponder paragraphs.  this is the strength of his writing (in my humble estimation) to cause the reader to think.  a worthy read even if you are prone to focus on the impossibly difficult particulars of writing in the english language...

0141439831|2.0|I'm not reviewing Thackeray's novel, which is truly fantastic, but rather this Penguin edition, which is truly terrible.  There are two major problems with this edition:  the explanatory notes, which are clumsy, and the lack of Thackeray's illustrations.   First, the notes: for some reason, the editors decided to divide the notes according to chapter numbers, rather than by page numbers, so that you need to remember what chapter you're reading in  order to find the right note.  This is extremely inconvenient.  The Oxford edition, in contrast, more sensibly lists the notes by page number.    Second, the illustrations.  In the Penguin edition's introductory \\"Note on the Text,\\" the editor, John Carey, says that he chose to leave out the illustrations because they are \\"embarrassingly bad\\" owing to Thackeray's \\"incompetence as an artist.\\"  The fact is, some of the illustrations are really funny and good.  More generally, a long text *with* illustrations is simply more entertaining than one without.  Again, the Oxford edition does better by including all of Thackeray's images.    I generally really like Penguin editions of Victorian novels: their versions of Dickens's works are the best out there, I think.  But Vanity Fair is an exception.    So do yourself a favor: read *Vanity Fair* and read the Oxford University Press edition.
0316067601|5.0|Instead of addressing the story of the SEAL training program and the battle itself, because so many have done it before me and probably done a better job than I could, I'll address the criticims regarding the author's comments about the \\"liberal media.\\" (1) like never before, the competition among the media has resulted in a frenzy to get a story out as quickly as possible if the editors believe it will sell more papers, get better ratings etc. Speed, not accuracy or the truth is the goal of the modern day media. I can't respect people who do such a poor job in their own profession criticising people who are performing a job that nobody in the media has a clue or the abilty to perform. To the modern day media, a dead soldier, sailor, airman or Marine is a number to be added to a total to cite in their story.   2) It is a rare academic who has served in the Boy Scouts, let alone the military. Duty, Honor, Country are foreign concepts to academics who dwell on relative morality, the lack of truth and the trivial. Senior academics working in US colleges are for the most part, people who avoided serving in the military during the 1960's and 1970's, who are not only ignorant of the military or law enforcement, they despise those people who work in those professions. William Ayers, the former friend of Obama is a prime example of this type of person, no remorse, no regrets about what he has done or how he has lived his life, even while he feeds at the public trough provided by the government he despises.   3) Finally, our modern day politician who, like the academics, avoided service in Vietnam or in the case of some, managed to get safe jobs because they were the sons of senators etc. Much as I dislike Al Gore, I do not include him in this category because as I understand it, he did not choose his job, the Army told him what he would be doing and where and in his case, it was Vietnam. I can respect that. But, for the most part, the men and women serving in the Congress may know a lot about appropriations for the military, but really, have no clue about the sacrifices made by the people in the military and frankly, I believe they don't care unless these people can be used for political purposes.     So, there are 3 groups of ignorant and dispicable people who exert far more influence than they should about the \\"rules of engagement.\\" What to do about it? Unfortunately, there isn't much of anything that will be done about the ROE or these people until another 9/11 or worse occurs, then these same people, much in the same way they hate the police until one of them is robbed or killed, will be clamoring for the military \\"to do something.\\" And the military will.

1897299214|5.0|I finished this graphic novel about 2 months ago and it still stays with me. Guy Delisle excels at delivering \\"big picture\\" descriptions of life in Pyongyang and North Korea as well as the more unique (or odd) details of a Westerner just trying to pass his time on a job in a nation closed off  from the world.    His art compliments the mostly lighthearted take on his often puzzling encounters.  It also helps the more serious matters subversively arrive.  Delisle briefly pulled back a curtain and introduced to me to a place and people I've known very little about.  My curiosity about Pyongyang and for details about life in N.K. has only continued.
B000005KQT|5.0|Picture yourself in a crowded juke joint or blues bar on the southside of Chicago in the late '40's. Muddy Waters is about to play. He's already gone electric; I mean, he had to, to be heard over all the talking and yelling and what not. His harp player has about blown out a lung trying to be heard over all that din. Walter Jacobs has been doing a bit of experimenting himself, in an attempt to amplify the sound of that little instrument. Tonight he actually grabs the microphone off the stand, bumping it up close enough in his clasped hands to touch the harp. He cranks up the volume and starts to blow. The sound coming out of the amp is unlike anything anyone's ever heard. It's got a deep, heavy, honking, sexy wail, nothing at all like the unamplified harmonica sound of \\"country\\" blues. Men and women alike dance ecstatically, screaming and crying in excitement, over this new and intoxicating sound, this amazingly sensuous and insinuating beat. Necessity is the mother of invention; the guy was simply tired of people yelling that they couldn't hear him. So, being the innovator he was, he came up with a simple adjustment in technique.<br /><br />This small act completely revolutionized the blues. Walter Jacobs, probably more than any other individual, has influenced every person who has ever played electric blues. When it comes to harp players, he is the undisputed king, the god, the creator, the originator. You can listen to anyone who's ever played amplified harp since it begun, somewhere late '40's, and you will hear Little Walter's riffs. Most people would probably admit that Little Walter is the reason they play harp at all!<br /><br />This set contains all his best stuff, done after he went out on his own. Imagine this for a three-piece band: drums/bass/harp. That's it; no guitar. He actually played sets with this lineup, and blew the doors off. Most of the tunes on the set here do contain guitar, but it's clear that the lead is Walter and his harp. He wasn't content to just play ten-hole Marine band harps either; he incorporated the rich sound of the chromatic harp into his repertoire.<br /><br />All blues fans and most of all, those enamored, bewitched, and obsessed with the wonderful sound of electric harp need to own this record and commit it to memory.y ten-hole Marine band harps either; he incorporated the rich sound of the chromatic harp into his repertoire.

B000E6ESL2|3.0|I saw this when it was in theaters and I was, to say the least, confused. I did like it-I loved the whole idea of it, the story itself, and the acting was wonderful (Ryan Gosling never disappoints); but I was still confused. My boyfriend at the time, who saw it with me, got it for me on dvd when it came out and I'll admit I didn't watch it again until a few days ago. This is a movie you need to watch many times for you to start to really \\"understand it\\" and for me, it's one that I WANT to understand. There were many things that I noticed the second time around that I missed when I saw it in the theater and helped to put everything together for me. It's like a puzzle, trying to put all the little things that may seem insignificant at first, together into the \\"whole\\" of the movie.<br />I'm not going to go into specifics because who knows, something I think is a huge part of the story may not be for someone else. You need to come to your own conclusions about the whole thing.<br />I'll just say that for those who haven't seen it-if you like movies that make you think about them well after they're over, watch this movie.
B00177YA1K|1.0|This is lame, it just a single disc version of the movie with a couple of audio commentaries and none of the special features which are on the current \\"Deluxe Edition\\". Oh yeah, it comes with the widescreen and fullscreen version. As if that's anything to rave about.      Other than that, this is an awesome movie that's very funny, has great action, special effects, and story.  Overall one of Will Smith's best movies.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Absolutely my all-time nomination for BEST Made-For-Gay-TV film is \\"Shelter\\" (2007), an outstanding film produced by Regent for here! TV.<br /><br />Zach (Trevor Wright) is a 22 year old who is aimlessly spending his life in the working class town of San Pedro, just inland from the fancy homes of Laguna Beach.  Besides his dead-end job as a short order cook, Zach helps to take care of his disabled, widowed father, as well as his young nephew Cody, whose single, alcoholic mother also lives with them. Zach is also an avid surfer and skateboarder, but his real passion and talent is as a art, specializing in \\"tagging\\" walls of buildings with his creative designs.  When his best friend, Gabe, away at college, Zach assumes he'll be going surfing alone, until Gabe's older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe, who most gay fans will remember from \\"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss\\"), arrives in town to stay for a while.  The two develop a friendship ... and more, as repressed gay leanings surface once he gets to know the openly-gay Gabe.  Zach initially fights his feelings, tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, and fears the ridicule of his buddies and sister if they found out.  His sister already made it clear that she doesn't want Cody being around \\"that (derrogative term for homosexual)\\", and Zach worries what could happen to Cody if he is not around to help with his care.<br /><br />A realistically-portrayed coming-of-age/coming out masterpiece of a film, beautifully photographed and above-average acting, music and direction. A sweet, almost lyrical story with a positive message, showing that \\"love\\" transcends anyone's definition of a \\"family,\\" to include supportive friends who help you realize your ultimate happiness in life.<br /><br />DVD includes director/actor commentary track, \\"making of\\" featurette and trailer. Winner of \\"Best Film\\" at several gay film festivals, with three also honoring Trevor as Best Actor.  Definite high tide, five big stars out of five!
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|I think my title pretty much sums it up. I listened to this CD many times, but the only song I truly liked (and would have liked it to be longer) is \\"Be Myself Again\\".  I wasn't expecting \\"disco\\", I think that's over, nor was I expecting the hip urban sound this CD mostly comprises.  Donna is capable of anything and to me, this CD just doesn't do her justice. Some talented collaborators and producers would make all the difference with Donna's talent.  When I first heard that she had signed with a new label and was thinking of doing some older stuff like maybe from the 60's and 70's I wasn't expecting what \\"Crayons\\" turned out to be.  I still love you Donna,; it's just not my cup of tea I guess. I truly hope others enjoy it and as always, wish Donna the best of everything!  That being said, I'm very happy that others are obviously enjoying this new effort (and I can tell it was a major effort on Donna's part)A++++ for having the guts to let loose and experiment with all the new genres  she's never explored, and I'm more than happy that it's a success!  I really look forward to a new release with better material. I've bought every thing ever released (many more than once) and will continue to do so, so please don't wait too long...  I saw your \\"Crayons\\" concert in Boston, and as always, you kept me spellbound! You mixed the old with the new so well, I can't wait for some more new!
B00005JPLW|5.0|Wow a movie without a politically correct message.A film where soldiers are not portrayed as suckers fighting for an unjust cause.A story about standing up and taking a stand against tryanny.No wonder it was so well recieved.A generation spoon fed p.c. bs finally gets to see a movie that speaks to the heroic ideas born within.
1400032717|3.0|I recently read this book because the lower level English classes in my school (I'm in the smarter class) read this as an assignment and I was interested, as I have a friend with the condition (or whatever else you'd like to call it) otherwise known as autism, and he's normal compared to this kid! Still, this book was a very interesting read.    Christopher Boone, a 15 year old Brit, is pretty much a cripple - he has a severe adversion to 2 colours, is superstitious over seeing cars on the way to school to determine his luck, and throws all these random maths and science figures between the actual story. Imagine all the crap his dad has to put up with - it's all within the covers of this book.    Christopher has a mixed style of speaking - he calls people by their \\"formal names\\" (Mother and Father - hasn't he ever heard of Mum and Dad?) but often rambles in his sentences about meaningless things (though I liked his explanation on the door problem from game shows).    I'm not going to mention anything else, as pretty much all the other 1,576 (or thereabouts) reviewers have already explained it. So to sum up: Definitely not one of the best books I've read (I don't read much), but I'd recommend it for an out-of-the-ordinary read.     On a slightly-unrelated note, I wonder what Christopher would think of the South Park character Timmy? (He'd probably laugh at him because he's even more crippled than he is!)
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This gal just absolutely sings her little heart out on this CD! Wow! I read about her in an article on MSN, where she was said to be similar to Amy Winehouse. I like Amy Winehouse (although am put off by her public shenanigans to say the least) and thought it was worth a try, especially since the disc was only $7.99 when I found it.<br />The music is powerful, soulful, and catchy. The CD goes with me from car to office to home each day. I really enjoy it!
0375714839|5.0|This is my first Graphic Novel, but not my last. I loved the story and I felt that the book had a really nice flow. Marjane Satrapi as an exceptional story teller and has a very strong voice. I read this shortly after seeing the movie, and though I loved the movie, I felt that it left alot of important stuff out. The book really helped fill in some of the gaps, and you also got to see Satrapi's personality a bit more. I look forward to reading her other works. If you have never read a Graphic Novel, this is a great place to start.
0385338724|5.0|I have read and loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. I looked forward to this one, and it did not disappoint. As all of her books have been, it was a quick read - one I didn't want to put down.
B000YAA68W|4.0|A non-conventional coming of age story set in Iran's Islamic revolution, this movie is touching, thought-provoking, sometimes funny and downright heartbreaking. I loved the simple animation that stayed true to the original form of the graphic novel of the same name.     After I saw this film, I read the book and fell in love with it too. I highly recommend checking that out as well, because there were a few things left out that I felt could have added a little more to the story.  I think for dramatic effect they left out the part of the book when she actually became good friends with her first college roommate and went home with her for Christmas and had a great time. I think that story would have added to the movie because we could have seen Marji actually loosen up. Other than that, I have no other complaints. Great Movie!!
B000SINT52|5.0|This came out before it was cool to hate Bush.  Moore should be thanked for that.  While not his best effort (editing was a little poor, IMHO), there are some must-see moments.  If you've decided you're going to defend our rotten president no matter what, you're sure to hate this movie.  If you think the media has told you what you need to know about America under Bush, you're sure to be surprised.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I can't really add anything to the 200+ reviews. But I will say that this movie has heart, passion and a nontraditional romance that left me in tears. If you have a passion for music, this is definitely worth seeing.     EDIT 6/20/08 - I just saw the Swell Season Concert in Chicago a few days ago and it was by far the best concert I'v ever been to. Even if you don't love the film, you need to see the group live, they are amazing! Can't wait till the come back.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This was particularly enjoyable for me since my grandfather is an alumnus of Wiley College.
1883217040|1.0|I read the reviews, I went through the site, I checked around... Seemed like a great book to get a hang of jazz theory...     I have one problem though...I can't read music. And NOWHERE in this whole reviews or description is it mentioned that this book has ONLY MUSICAL NOTATIONS.     I've bought a few books on music and have actually picked up quite a bit through tabs (My instrument happens to be the guitar.)    Now when I get to the returns section it says I have to ship it right back to the US of A... while all incoming packages are shipped by Amazon to a local courier who then delivers it to respective addresses.    What a sham! Overall all those who might be toying with the idea of picking up this book BEWARE. ITS MANDATORY TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND NOTATIONS.     Otherwise well the money's down the drain... at least for me for now I guess...
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|My husband and I are each 40 years old but we loved the fresh and clean appeal of the movie.  We saw it with our neighbor and were impressed by the plot and the effects.   It was a well done movie that held your attention and left us feeling satisfied.   We wish more movies were done this well and with a more thought out plot.
159102594X|2.0|I would normally not judge a book from series harshly, but this one simply did not work for me. I read the whole thing and would not buy the next installment simple based on this one.    -A ton of completely random battle encounters with bandits, soldiers, assassins, that are simply there for the author to put in some action.   -Pointless swearing. Does not add to the book's themes at all.  -\\"Huh\\" \\"Ugh\\", etc, are only funny the first few times. Totally overdone.  -Little to no conflict. Some empire and some barbarians are doing stuff, while the good guys prepare for the defense. Who the empire people, or the barbarians are, we have little to no insight. Your generic conquer without much reason plot device.  -No likeable characters. Glokta is interesting/original but annoying. Overall, the worst problem here is that none of the main characters are driving the story. They are pawns, while non-POV characters are the players. Not a good choice there.  -Your basic superpower magic is also present. Thankfully none of the POVs wield it.    What did I like about the book? I could not really say. 2 stars because I am nice.
B000ICL3CE|5.0|I have close to all of The Cure's studio CD's plus many that are rare but for some reason had never purchased this one.  Although I already had several of the songs it was definitely worth the wait to hear a couple of songs for the first time.  The whole CD is consistently great and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is builiding their collection of works by this unbelievable band.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|You'll need a spare battery for your 40D and this one is the real Canon accessory. Allows you to use one battery and have a spare in the camera bag so you can keep on shooting until the dead battery can be recharged.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Although not exactly like the book (are they really ever?), I really enjoyed this version.  If you have seen the previous movie Persuasion and thought it a good movie, you will find this newer version even more wonderful.  I especially like how deeply the director involves you into the emotional and human aspect of each character.  This is what Austen fans expect and I believe Persuasion 2008 by BBC delivers.
B00164KYS2|4.0|SATC is just a really long episode of the season, and it was great! I went into the movie expecting to see another episode, and was not disappointed. The girls, Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte have continued on with their lives, albeit some changes have happened, and they still question their happiness and what they want in life. All of the girls are encountering a problem with which they must deal in their lives. From problems with each other to problems with their significant others. This movie has it all, anything a SATC fan would want. Sex, nudity, clothes, shoes and great dialogue.<br /><br />The movie is a most for every SATC fan, you will love it. It is full of laughs and cries and gorgeous dresses and shoes (the most important part of course). This movie was one big, monumental fashion show. Heck, they even go to a fashion show at one point. Steve outdid himself and he was as adorable a ever (how can you really hate him!?). I just wish we would have seen more of Harry and Mr. Big and all the other men.<br /><br />My favorite part (without ruining the plot) if when they are talking about happiness and they say that it is not possible to be always happy. Charlotte promptly volunteers that she is always happy, well, not all of the time, she is not happy all of the day! Dear Charlotte, she has all that she wants, and by the end, the girls get to a place, where they finally living their lives.
B00005JNS0|4.0|I love Pixar films, they are always poignant, yet funny, not to mention the animation is awesome.  While Cars is not my favorite Pixar movie, it was still entertaining and fun to watch.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen is a flashy and selfish race car on his way to California to race in the big Piston Cup race and while on the highway his ride (a Mack truck called \\"Mack\\"heh) falls asleep and somehow the ramp drops down and lets a sleeping McQueen out onto the highway.  While Mack continues on his way oblivious McQueen is not on board, McQueen suddenly realizes that he can't find his ride and is stuck in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />He speeds around looking for Mack and unfortunately, gets a police car from a small town of Radiator Springs off route 66, on his tail.  He gets in trouble and ends up having to serve a community service sentence by fixing the road into town that he messed up in his police car chase.  McQueen isn't too happy about this as he's supposed to be in California for the race in a week, but the town leader, Doc Hudson (who presided over his case as judge) is adamant he serve his sentence and McQueen is resigned to his unlucky fate.<br /><br />I thought there were a lot of funny parts in the movie and I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes.  Instead of \\"cow tipping\\", there is \\"tractor tipping\\", and the scene where McQueen and Tow Mater (a rusty tow truck) decide to go tractor tipping was hilarious.  Another funny moment was when the 2 Italian cars that owned the local tire store, and their love of all things Ferrari, finally meet a real life Ferrari (their reactions were so cute!).<br /><br />I loved the message in the movie.  That fame, fortune, and looking out for number one isn't what life is all about, that the love and companionship of friends and family is far more lasting.  It was heart-warming to see the change in the brash Lightning McQueen, as the town of Radiator Springs and its locals, slowly effect his outlook on life.  He begins to realize what is really important vs. what he thought was important before in his flashy race car life.  The ending fit into this theme of what really matters in life, winning no matter what or realizing winning isn't everything (Oh, be sure to continue watching after credits roll, there are scenes after the ending showing what happens after the race).<br /><br />This is a fun-filled movie, with some humorous moments, and while not the best Pixar movie I've seen it was still a good one.  I don't think I've ever seen a bad Pixar movie. =)is really important vs. what he thought was important before in his flashy race car life.

055357342X|1.0|I guess my taste in fantasy is not similar to those who review the books on Amazons site.    I was stunned to read all the reviews of how great this book series was and then to read them.  There were many plots.  Unfortunately most of the plots ended up going no where.  When you get to the end of the book you kind of go huh?  Some plots had detail that made you wonder if you were in an R-Rated type book. I guess the idea was to not leave anything to your imagination but just describe really gross and disgusting scenes.    There were a few sections which gave you hope that the story was going to take off as the reviews indicated, but it never happened.  In the end you were left wondering if there was another book coming since most of the plots didn't come to a conclusion, they were just kind of left hanging.  As I got closer to the end with few pages left I was wondering how is he going to wrap everything up.  Well the laugh was on me, he simply didn't wrap them up and the one he did, didn't make sense if  you've read any good fantasy.    I couldn't recommend this series of books to anyone!

0307277887|1.0|I watched the first season of Dexter and couldn't wait to read the books that spawned it. I got the first two books out of the library and eagerly started reading number one. The sinking feeling came on page 8. This is the passage that caused me to despair.<br />\\"No,\\" he said.<br />\\"Yes,\\" I said.<br />\\"Oh, no,\\" he said.<br />\\"Oh, yes,\\" I said.<br />He screamed, \\"NOOOO!\\"<br />Despite this I continued on. The prose is fairly average. The characters are painfully stupid. Dexter only seems smart because everyone around him apparently flunked out of elementary school. The commentary on Miami traffic is actually kind of funny. It did have occasional tense moments, only spoiled by the fact that I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to anyone, not even the main character. On an amusing note, there is inadvertant homoerotic banter between Dexter and Masuoka. If you must read the book, see if you can find it!

B0018QCXGY|1.0|You'll root for the monster.    Created by the people who scared the bejeezus out of audiences with the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield rehashes the same idea (unseen/glimpsed menace+scared people+video camera=movie) almost without adaptation except that here, the menace part is taken care of by a thirty-storey Godzilla-knock-off that wanders around Manhattan for a bit monster tourism: It eats people; it breaks stuff and it magically appears whenever the plot goes from thin to laughable.    Filmed from the viewpoint of someone who barely understoods how to work the camcorder, Cloverfield is shot in a naturalistic way that requires you to believe that someone will hang onto and use a camcorder through bridge collapses, military counterattacks and being chewed by Doberman-sized monster-fleas.    It starts at a loft party, which the plot rapidly pares down to four upscale twenty-somethings with whom the average moviegoer shares nothing whatsoever and who are so shallow, and/or so stupid that you quickly miss the point of anyones wanting to save them; leaving the only point of interest in the movie how quickly the monster will come and put them out of *your* misery and minus plot-sense or sympathetic characters, you quickly find yourself rooting for the monster; because the monster at least is interesting.    For all intents and purposes, the Blair Witch Project, created a genre a new and independent type of movie with its own characteristics, but it is one that Cloverfield makes you want to see the end of because what comes out of it in terms of plot isnt hopeful, or natural, or uplifting or exciting in any way that is surprisingly or even believably resolved.     There are reasons to make movies this way but none of them treat the audience like a friend that they like. The advantage to a director or to a studio of making movies Blair Witch style is that you dont need writers to make them; all you have to do is to find some talented actors and tell them, okay, youre really, really scared because of *topic*. and point a camera at them. The main weakness of this idea is that you can only make one of these movies (the Blair Witch Project itself) before everyone knows the magic trick and all the reasons why you should keep writing talent around become obvious.     You dont need writers to make a movie like Cloverfield: you need them to make a movie like Cloverfield good.
1401207529|3.0|It might've been a great story when it was first written - but I don't think it stood test of time. It is a retelling of what everybody knows anyway. Miller does good storytelling but that doesn't help when the story is weak.
B00164DWEA|5.0|Marvel got it right this time.  Everything that was wrong with the 2003 movie was fixed this time around.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is a great comic book movie.  Imagine an updated big screen version of the old TV series and you'll have a good picture of what this one's like.<br /><br />Ed Norton is one of my favorite actors and he doesn't disappoint.  Hurt, Tyler and Roth all do great jobs in their respective roles.  When studios hire actors with credibility and talent, good things happen.<br /><br />The plot and dialogue, with few exceptions, are good. The special effects are about the same.<br /><br />Without question, the acting, plot/storyline, dialogue, setting and theme are also drastically better in this release.<br /><br />It wouldn't be a Marvel movie without a few cameos.  None of them are shocking.  The movie also ties in well with the other Marvel movies and the comic book itself.<br /><br />Go see it if you like the Hulk.  Don't let any disappointment you might have had from the The Hulk (2003 film) stop you.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show.  This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under.  Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people.  This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely.  Is Dexter a good or bad person?  How do we really feel about him?  How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time.

B0016A2FFG|5.0|Lay It Down is an amazing statement. This is among the most satisfying discs I've listened to in years. It delivers right up the middle in the sweet spot of staying true to who Al Green is (no silly attempts to sound like an erstwhile 20 year old) while somehow seeming totally fresh, deep, and tight. Man - good, good stuff. The title track and Take Your Time are highlights (reinforcing Rae's position as a force).

I thought \\"Timeline\\" might've been the worst movie I'd ever seen, but after \\"Jumper\\" came along, I'm starting to look at Paul Walker as the savior of Hollywood.  Christensen is so horrendous, he singlehandedly ruined Star Wars. Even the ones he's not in.  He sucks that bad.  His acting style is comparable to an autistic block of wood with constipation.  The man simply cannot act, and yet he continues to get role after role.  Add to this the fact that the script of Jumper felt like it was written by a group of one-armed mongoloid chimps, and you have yourself a movie so ridiculously awful that many people walked out of the theater halfway through.  I stayed because I apparently have a morbid fascination with terrible movies (see aforementioned \\"Timeline\\"), but I was so mad afterwards I wanted to smash Christensen in the face with a wok.  Please please do not buy this movie.  It will only encourage him to make more.  We need to stop this before it gets out of hand.      I hate Hayden Christensen.
0452289963|1.0|I don't know.  It's easy to write this stuff and think this stuff but at the end of the day when you have bills to pay and other drama, it's hard to put all of it aside and detatch youself from it.  I mean, IT'S LIFE.  Tolle might disagee with that statement, but the bils in the mailbox are real things and no amount of detachment is going to assist me in stressing a lot of the time in my daily life about some things that are difficult.  I found the book to be kind of high fallutin' and cold.  But then again, it's only me.
B00133KFGW|2.0|O.k., here's my review, my short review. I don't recommend that you buy, nor rent this movie. It's too much like Oliver Twist, with a hint of Forest Gump. It's a love story none the less, but in every aspect, your typical Oliver Twist. What ever you do, don't watch this movie.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|For those lucky enough to have heard the live versions of these songs found on the Internet from their 2007 American tour, they'll probably notice they grooved and moved far more to those tracks than the extremely boring, mellow versions found on \\"In Rainbows\\".  Thom was inspired as all hell at those shows, and it showed in the music, but this album is simply a bunch of boring rehashes of great songs done way way better live on the small theater stages in 2007. And what the hell did the band do to \\"4 Minute Warning\\" on the bonus CD?! They butchered what was probably their best song since \\"Exit Music\\"!
B000S0GYRU|1.0|Lately I have been craving a good horror movie I have not seen before. When I saw this at the video store, and noticed it was an older movie, made int he late 70's and said it was the 2-disc collectors edition. So I figured it must be a classic movie if it's 2 discs from that time period.    Also on the cover it reads, \\"the only thing more terrifying then the last 12 minutes of this film... are the first 83\\"    *BUZZER SOUND*  WRONG!    I was bored after the first ten minutes of this movie. The opening seemed OK and looked promising, but once the \\"actresses\\" start talking to each other, I had to cringe, it sounded like bad over dubbed voices that you can find better quality from in a porno movie.    There was a couple of scares here and there, but they still left me yawning. The more this movie went on, the more bored I was becoming. And I have seen enough of these kind of movies where I force myself to watch it to the end in hopes it gets better then to bother doing it again with this one. So I switched it off.    I dunno what the fascination with this thing is. It was dull, boring, slow paced, the sound of there voices was *cringe* and I really could not bare to see where it was leading to in the end.    It may have been lit nicely so you can see the rain in dark out side shots nicely, but the color inside the buildings they where in was nauseating to say the least.    I dunno, maybe it got better at the end, or maybe you need a mind set that finds Clockwork Orange to be a great movie and think Napoleon Dynamite is actually funny.    I don't care if I get 1000 replies in disagreement, this was how I saw this film, I gave it it's chance, and it did not appeal to me at all. The editing needed to be cut down to give it a faster pace, and the music, good god, who the hell composed the score? It still gives me a headache thinking about it.
B0013FXWX8|5.0|I went to see this film recently. And let me tell you...it was awesome!!! This movie should win the Academy Award! I personally liked it better than the Shrek films!

Thanks.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|It's only missing Bill Berry... The band turned back the clock about 15 years, Stipe got angry and Buck plugged in and turned it up. I'd really lost track of my old favorite band the last 3 or 4 albums since BB left. They seemed pretty self-absorbed and experimentally moody in their efforts. Glad I took the leap on this one. Overall, the tone and tempo reminds me of Monster or Life's Rich Pageant.

My only complaint is that it was much too short! I was thrilled to see the producers were contemplating additional episodes. Enough gushing, go watch it for yourselves!
B000HT386M|5.0|I bought this film because when I rented it it made me cry and I knew I wanted it in my collection. It may be the ONLY Adam Sandler movie I will ever own. The story is wonderful, the acting really good and the funny moments in it aren't overdone or immature as much as Sandler's material is. The hidden gem in this film is Sean Austin and Henry Winkler. Both do a wonderful job with the parts they were given. I highly recommend this film, esp if you enjoy a good cry.

0061537934|2.0|Anyone who knows me knows that I am an off-the-deep-end animal lover and I cry even at benign \\"animal\\" films like Babe (\\"That'll do pig, that'll do...) let alone anything tear-jerky or involving the death of pet. And \\"Racing\\" puts its message way up front, in a forward that makes it clear from page one that the charming narrator is gonna die, putting all the cards on the table (so I am not really giving any spoilers).    I noticed here on Amazon a video from the publisher, one so elaborate it is like a mini-movie/commercial for the book -- it had to have cost a fortune, including all the music and editing. That's very disheartening -- it underlines what I was only going to imply, which is that this book was probably written with the moneymaking potential of a sentimental movie (and the big money advances that entales) firmly in mind.    Books (and films) about sentient animals (not just dogs, but obviously pigs, cats, horses, occasionally parrots and let's not forget the detective sheep in \\"Three Bags Full\\") are so ubiquitous now that it's not merely a sub-genre but practically an entire industry.     It is in the \\"dog story\\" that \\"Art of Racing in Rain\\" is most successful. Enzo is a mixed breed mutt (though oddly depicted on the book jacket as a pure bred yellow lab) owned by a young man, Denny Swift, who is crazy about auto racing. (Hint to author: if you are writing about a racer, it is overselling your hand to name him \\"Swift\\" -- it's like having your protagonist being an author and naming him \\"Typewriter\\".)    Enzo, a ridiculously smart and literate dog (he's been educated by 24 hours a day of PBS TV) with the intellectual equivalent of a PhD. His observations about life can be amusing, and he wants more than anything to be reincarnated in his next life as a human with opposable thumbs. Again, these are the best parts of the book, even though Enzo often doesn't seem very doglike (unlike all dogs I know, he doesn't seem to care much about food) and though he can't read, he has a complex understanding of things like dogs being color-blind. (This mystified me: as a human, I can see far fewer colors than a prey bird, like an eagle -- but unlike Enzo, I can't NAME the colors that I am not capable of SEEING.)    The book is far less convincing as the story of down and out dog owner, Denny. Has there ever been a protagonist with WORSE luck? He struggles as a young married parent (maybe because he deliberately impregnates his 20 year old girlfriend on their first date), has lousy jobs, dreams of racing cars but bungles every race he is in. His beautiful wife gets BRAIN CANCER (cue the theme from \\"Love Story\\"), his monstrous in-laws try and steal his adorable little daughter by manipulating the legal system. Heck, a previously UNKNOWN and never mentioned teenage cousin appears from NOWHERE, accuses him falsely of statutory rape and causes him to lose custody of his beloved child. His life seques from one tragedy to another, a constant tsunami of lousy luck, until....    Well, I guess you have to read it. It's a short book and probably a good beach read for this summer. You can't be overly critical or take a book like this TOO seriously; after all, dogs really don't watch TV and they probably don't get reincarnated WITH THE SAME EXACT NAME. (Hint #2: if your reincarnated dog is named Fluffernutter or Tinkerbell, does that mean when he reappears as a human child he will be called by that name?) Oh, and you can gain some comfort from the fact that most dogs -- especially healthy mixed breed mutts -- tend to live longer than Enzo and hip dysplasia (while painful and terrible) is a disease of INBRED PURE-BREEDS and not mutts. And dogs do not, to my knowledge, have the power to \\"will themselves to death\\" conveniently when you want to take a job in Italy.    The book is loaded with gaffes like this, interspersed with Denny's simply awful tragedies (until suddenly at the end when his wildest dreams come true, interestly just like his tragedies they are solely the products of Deux Ex Machinas). Supporting characters like his too-cute daughter, rotten in-laws, dying wife and even the late arrivals of his estranged (and BLIND!) parents are cut straight from a big sheet of cardboard. Someone should tell Mr. Stein that weepers about young widowers with cute kids have been done and overdone as movies-of-the-week and add nothing here.    But the world can easily absorb yet another good dog story. So if you love dogs, slog through the trite parts for the doggy bits, and bring a big box of kleenex for the inevitable weepy heartstring-plucking ending.    In conclusion: coming to a theatre near you VERY SOON.
B00005AREQ|5.0|For years it seemed as though \\"Wired\\" was continually put forth as Beck's masterpiece when for me there was never any comparision with \\"Blow By Blow\\", not in terms of arrangements, the color in his playing or the overall production. I didn't think you could improve on the original LP's sound until I heard the 24-bit version through headphones. \\"Virtuoso\\" can be misleading when referring to Beck. For a lot of people, the term implies speed, complexity and perhaps an excess of notes. For myself though, Beck has always been about touch and tone and expressive playing. What's obvious to hear now that I didn't realize listening in the 70's was how much he picked with just his bare fingers. You'd have to go back to vintage Leslie West to find a guy who can say as much with a single note as Beck does here.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I've been an enormous fan of the Hulk ever since I was a child.  I was GASSED when I heard that they were making the Hulk into a major motion picture.  My enthusiasm died down a bit when I saw the trailer.  I saw the ridiculous CGI Hulk they created, and I certainly wasn't too thrilled about Eric Bana playing Bruce Banner.<br /><br />All of that aside, I went into the movie with a clear mind.  Well, let's just say I wasn't a happy camper.  During certain points of the movie, the Hulk was 20-30 feet tall.  He was as tall as 4th floor apartment buildings, for Goodness sake!  According to Marvel comics, the Hulk was 7 to 8' tall.  Not 20+ feet tall.  Ang Lee made him look like a green King Kong.  I've never seen anything so comical in my life.<br /><br />Besides the entire Hulk debacle, the movie was just terribly boring.  Too much needless dialogue, stories that went nowhere, and the casting was very poorly done.  I also didn't care for the little comic book pop ups throughout the movie.<br /><br />All in all, a complete and total disaster.  The 2008 Hulk on the other hand, which I just saw, rights the Hulk ship, much like Christian Bale did with Batman Begins.
1416955070|5.0|I was nervous about reading this based on these reviews but I really did enjoy this story and can't wait to see what happens next. Yes there were similarities to different sci/fantasy stories (Buffy, Star Wars, etc.) but the dialogue was fresh, the characters were interesting and the world that was created was intriguing. For those reasons, I believe this book deserves credit. I recommend giving this book a chance and come to your own conclusion....
B000ZLFALS|5.0|Across the Universe is a visual and musical delight. I watched the Blu-ray version last night and would recommend it without reservation.     I was eager to see the movie, but had my doubts. Taymor's \\"Titus\\" is one of my favorite Shakespeare films and I enjoyed \\"Frida\\", but adaptations of Beatles material, whether song covers or films based on Beatles tunes, usually come off as corny or flat. I thought the Beatles' music couldn't exist independent of the personalities of John, Paul, George and Ringo.     From the opening shot of Jude (played by McCartney-esque Jim Sturges)on a solitary beach crooning a soulful version of \\"Girl\\", you know you are in for something special.      The first third of \\"Across the Universe\\" is why we all go to the movies. For the chance to be taken out of our lives and lose ourselves in another world. I was enraptured. It was reminiscent of the joy of seeing \\"A Hard Days Night\\" for the first time.     Like any musical, there are numbers that fall flat or don't seem to work as well as others. The British actor, Joe Anderson as Max, is miscast. He can't quite pull of an American accent and his speaking parts are not wholly believable.     Look for cameos from Joe Cocker, Bono,  Salma Hyak and Eddie Izzard. There are inside jokes, too- arch references to \\"cranberry sauce\\" (what George Harrison claims was said instead of \\"I buried Paul\\" on \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\") at the dinner table.     All the 60's is packed in as well- Vietnam, the MLK assassination, Kent State, the SDS and even 2 characters playing parallel universe Janis Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix. And yes, even Cousin Brucie.     Across the Universe is a delight. There are a handful of films I would watch again. This is one that I know I'll be seeing several times.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This season was amazing, just like the first one. In each episode there is another incredible hunt and they just keep getting better!

0316067601|5.0|As a former military pilot of pointy nosed jets I am still in awe of the Navy SEALS and Delta guys.  While we zip around in our fancy jets and fly LGB's thru doors, I (speaking for myself instead of all fighter pilots) I am totally in awe of the professionalism, incredible bravery, dedication, athleticism, determination, and heroism of these \\"teams\\".  I had the privilege of working around some of these guys and they are truly the finest athletes and warriors on the planet.  I felt that I was in the presence of the Dallas Cowboy's or Greenbay Packers star running backs when I met these guys.  There was always four of them when I ran into them (they actually did stay in four packs when they trained) and always had the latest weps :)   From what I've seen, I believe the story told by Mr. Luttrell to be very factual.  This story sounds like exactly what it is like to be a SEAL and how they fight (as well as the stories I've heard about BUD/S).  I felt so sad when I read how the ROE of the battlefield was made a mess of by our current totally clueless political types.  The finest warriors are having their hands tied by nit wits....  So sad, I feel for you....    Who do fighter pilots envy??  For me, it is the Navy SEALS and Delta.... I don't hold a candle to these guys,  the finest warriors on the planet...

0517548232|1.0|If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.  If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.

0061474339|5.0|If LIRAEL lacked in action compared to its predecessor, SABRIEL, ABHORSEN makes up for that by functioning as an extended climax of events from the previous book, focused around the need to find and defeat the necromancer Hedge to stop him from reawakening an old and malevolent power known simply as the Destroyer. The story picks up directly after the end of the previous book, with Lirael, Sameth, Mogget, and the Disreputable Dog in a race against time to stop Sam's school friend, Nicholas Sayre, from going through with his plans to reconnect two large metal hemispheres, which when connected will release the Destroyer. This power, also known as Orannis, was first bound when the Charter was created and is inimical to all forms of life.<br /><br />ABHORSEN really feels like it ought to have been part of the end of LIRAEL, not only because the latter book is a continuation of the former in terms of plot. It might be possible for a reader to understand LIRAEL having not read SABRIEL, but ABHORSEN does not stand alone in this way. Rather, the characters, plot, and worldbuilding knowledge from the prior book is assumed by the author in this book. This isn't much of a problem, though, because Nix's writing still takes the reader on marvelous adventures. I just wouldn't advise trying to read this trilogy out of order. In fact, even reading this review without knowing the background of the series is probably difficult.<br /><br />I also felt that some portions of the story moved along too quickly; I would have liked to see a mix of action and introspection, with more character development. However, in comparison to LIRAEL, whose action took place over a period of four years, the major events in ABHORSEN take place over less than a month of time. I recommend reading ABHORSEN directly after finishing LIRAEL for maximum effectiveness.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book was that it ended! While the primary concerns of the trilogy were nicely concluded, there were many new storylines and new questions posed that might have been nonessential, but that I still wanted answered--mostly because I don't think Nix is done with these characters, and I want to see more of them! I've got my fingers crossed that Nix will decide to write more short stories in this universe (the short story collection ACROSS THE WALL contains one story set in Ancelstierre), if not more novels. I'd be willing to read anything he'll write!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Candace Cunardquestions posed that might have been nonessential, but that I still wanted answered--mostly because I don't think Nix is done with these characters, and I want to see more of them!

0061474355|5.0|The first thing that hit me when I finished reading this book was that I should have read it much sooner. I'd been meaning to read it for the past six or seven years but never quite getting around to it--and that was a mistake. In SABRIEL, Garth Nix introduces the reader to a compelling fantasy world that comes alive through the actions of the title character and others.<br /><br />The Old Kingdom is a place of magic, both Charter magic, wielded by those with some connection to the ancient Charter that bound magic to benevolent purposes, and Free Magic, the creatures that escaped the binding and defy the Charter. Free Magic is also used by necromancers desiring to defy the Charter by animating dead bodies. Only one person, the Abhorsen, combines use of Charter and Free Magic for the purpose of returning dead spirits to their final rest and dead bodies to their graves. As the Abhorsen's daughter, and herself Abhorsen-in-Waiting, Sabriel must learn how to use the Abhorsen's tools to venture into Death and bind destructive spirits so they cannot cause harm to others.<br /><br />However, things in the Old Kingdom are becoming more and more dangerous by the minute, and as a result Sabriel grows up in Ancelstierre, the Old Kingdom's southern neighbor, close enough to the border that she is able to learn and practice Charter Magic, but far enough removed that she is ignorant of the customs and traditions of her home country. The story begins when eighteen-year-old Sabriel, about to finish preparatory school in Ancelstierre, receives a messenger from her father, carrying the bells and sword of the Abhorsen, a signal that he is in danger and requires her help. Sabriel must cross over into the Old Kingdom, a place she knows little about, and somehow find a way to save her father from whatever fate has befallen him before his spirit is pulled too far into Death. Along the way, she meets a fickle magical spirit in the form of a talking cat named Mogget, the traditional helpmeet of a long line of Abhorsens, and a former Royal Guard called Touchstone who has been frozen in the form of a ship's figurehead for the past two hundred years. Together, Sabriel, Mogget, and Touchstone journey through the Old Kingdom as they learn more about the necromancer who has tried to kill Sabriel's father and who will wreak destruction upon the land on both sides of the border if they cannot stop him.<br /><br />Nix's writing is lean and easy to read, creating characters whose thoughts are clear and whose motives are intensely human. The relationship that develops between Sabriel and Touchstone is emotionally real and rich, and I enjoyed reading about all of their interactions. Even secondary characters are detailed and have personalities of their own. I was also impressed by Nix's concept of magic, which is deeper and more textured than the point-and-spell world of Harry Potter or countless other similar stories (although this book will certainly appeal to fans of the former class of fantasy). In the Old Kingdom, performing magic depends upon a deep knowledge of the required Charter marks, and in Sabriel's case, upon her mastery of the seven bells that assist the necromancer's trade by helping command the dead. This book is truly original--I have not seen anything like it before.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Candace Cunardof Abhorsens, and a former Royal Guard called Touchstone who has been frozen in the form of a ship's figurehead for the past two hundred years.

0061474347|5.0|The second book in Garth Nix's ABHORSEN trilogy picks up fourteen years after Sabriel leaves off, and begins to focus on a new generation of characters; for this reason, it's definitely best to read the trilogy in order. Part One is centered on Lirael, a member of a race known as the Clayr, renowned for their ability to See into the future. Unfortunately, Lirael at the age of fourteen still has not received the Sight, something nearly unheard-of in Clayr society. To make matters worse, her dark hair and pale skin mean that she doesn't even look like the other Clayr. Her mother, a Daughter of the Clayr, disappeared in Lirael's childhood, and she never knew the identity of her father. Eventually, Lirael begins to work in the Library in the Glacier where the Clayr live, but even the work she does there cannot distract her from her continued lack of the Sight.<br /><br />Meanwhile, problems are mounting both in the Old Kingdom and in Ancelstierre. The Abhorsen Sabriel and her husband, Touchstone, restored to his position as King, have been ruling the Old Kingdom and doing the best to keep the Dead from disrupting life, but after twenty years of their rule things are still chaotic. Prince Sameth, their youngest child and widely known as the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, encounters a necromancer while at school in Ancelstierre, there are wars in the far South, and unrest mounts within the Old Kingdom itself. A series of events lead Lirael to leave the Glacier in search of a boy the Clayr have Seen her with, since they have also Seen that this possible future is the only way to avoid the destruction of their world as they know it. Along the way she meets Sameth, with his own personal reason for finding the same young man as Lirael, and the two of them try to work out the secrets of their shared past and uncertain future.<br /><br />While at first I was disappointed that the story no longer focused on Sabriel, who I'd come to love in the previous book of the trilogy, Lirael quickly grew into a character in whom I was equally interested.

Her companion, a construct of Free and Charter Magic known only as the Disreputable Dog, was a satisfying enigma of a character.

It's not a book you want to finish if you don't have the following novel on hand! However, the book does come to an emotional climax and conclusion; although the external threat has not been dealt with, the characters are certainly in a different place at the end of the story than at the beginning, and the development of this book proves necessary for the actions that they undertake in the third and final book of the trilogy. If you're looking for lots of apocalyptic battle sequences, this is not quite the right book, but as a story of emotional and personal growth, the novel sparkles.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Candace Cunardacter in whom I was equally interested.

B0017KP93U|2.0|...I've been a large fan of radiohead for a long time...my Dad would play Ok Computer throughout my youth (well...ages 7-9) and sooner or later I had become addicted to the sound...nothing could compare to what Radiohead had done and even if a band had claimed to be better I was loyal to the sound that I heard (minus pablo honey which to be honest...I disliked alot...especially Creep)...    ...then Radiohead left EMI records and sold In Rainbows regardless of how much money that they would make out of it (they're all rich now anyway in case you weren't aware...sorry for pointing out the obvious) and although it wasn't the best it was still to Radiohead's standards and grew into a pleasant position in my collection...I have all the Radiohead albums...so why buy this? Why even make this?    ...EMI wanted money...they wanted to scrape the barrel of Radiohead as much as they could...one of their biggest bands had left them and they had to re-sell the remenants to the public so that they could create more artificial economic growth even though they didn't need it...I'm disappointed with EMI for being such scroungers...it's just selfish and unreasonable of them...    ...the tracks that were picked for the double album (if you haven't checked the listing yet) are all the obvious singles + random tracks...I don't see them picking many of the more abstract tracks off Kid A or Amnesiac (there was a rumour that after the head of EMI heard Kid A the whole company had lost their Christmas bonus...such a nice fellow) and is just an unexciting mix of songs...the reason the songs were in their well placed albums was because the songs flowed together...in this broken up structure everything just feels incorrect and jumpy...I could make this if I made a mix tape of all the radiohead songs I had...and it would cost much less...    ...I'd advise you not to buy it and buy these songs in the albums that they rightfully belong...as for Radiohead fanatics (the real true fans) who wish to look for another piece of Radiohead to buy for their collection...feel free...and watch EMI's money pile grow...    P.S: I know that EMI's money scheme has nothing to do with the content of the CD compilation but when such morality issues arise I am likely to point them out and rant about them and for that, I'm sorry but they have really exploited Radiohead way too much...

0525948023|1.0|I haven't read the book. From the show and the book summary, it's obvious that it's Buddhism repackaged with a price tag on it.     Simply disgusting.    I don't know what's worse, the creation of such a book, Oprah's endorsement of such a book, the admiration of thousands of people or the lack of questioning why you think you like the book.     Why does this book appeal to you; not why you find the book appealing.  When you figure that out, ask youself why Buddhism has never appealed to you in the same way. Ask yourself why you don't see the similarities? The differences?     Then, ask yourself why you've bought into this book and what it is you truly value.    I think people should be offended by the 'feeding' of garbage that I argue has been done and is usually done on the premise that people are generally stupid. People get away with what they know they can get away with and it's clear that Oprah's drank the coolaid and is serving up free glasses for all!    We live in a society where critical thinking is discouraged. Children aren't being raised to be critical. We tell them what to be critical about which can only translate into criticism. We grow up without the tools to be critical and the ones that understand this, will always benefit.

B000YABYLA|1.0|First of all, the plot of Juno getting pregnant by Paulie was never fully explained (someone ventured that they were bored or they've wanted to do it, but there is NO passion or anything between the teens), so it's just a convenient and easy-way out for the writers to begin this LAME film.  Juno's character was so annoyingly eyebrow-raising, an ungrateful and incomprehensibly stupid character.  Her \\"shizzle\\" and other atrocious teen language is so...urgh, no words to describe how off-putting Juno is!  I don't know how anybody can like this film enough to call it \\"Best Film of the Year\\" and keep the DVD rather than destroy it.  One major problem I had with this film: if Juno was SO smart, then how come she can't handle herself talking to adults (when she talked about Chinese babies being shot out of t-shirt guns referring to how numerous Chinese babies are).  Juno's character is underdeveloped, caustic (for no real reason), and all-around 1/2 star.  Blech.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|My boyfriend and I thought that nothing could top \\"songs for the deaf\\" (our first QOTSA album)...we were so wrong.  We've had this album a few months and have probably listened to it a hundred times by now.  Every time I hear \\"the blood is love\\" I go into fits of ecstasy.  Every time I hear Homme belt out the first few lines of \\"slow long goodbye\\" I get goosebumps.<br />Truth be told, there are a couple songs I'm not so fond of, but the rest of them are my favorites!  I might be in love...
B00003CX9E|4.0|I am not sure I want to jump on the bandwagon and claim that this is the greatest movie ever. However, I enjoyed it and highly recommend the dvd set. The dvd set has a documentary too. It seems that the life story of Orson Wells is as interesting as the movie and has certain resemblance to the character Kane in the movie.
0345501292|5.0|This is one of the best books on my bookcase.  It's just a great book.  I paid $35 for it, and at that it was a bargain.  It's even cheaper here, so absolutely no reason to buy it.    It begins with the origins of the Indiana Jones character recounted as the classic tale of what happens when Spielberg and Lucas joined forces.  But with more detail than what I had heard previously.  Then the process and making of each film is included with great pictures, storyboards and models of sets.      Then it ends with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  The interesting part is how it details the development process and I was astonished about how many times Indy IV was going to be made and then pushed back for some reason.      A great purchase.  Highly Recommended.

0452289963|4.0|My mother and sister recommended this book, so I thought I would give it a shot.  I'm not much of a self help fan, but I figure if you can take at least something away from a book like this, it served its purpose.<br /><br />I was very cynical about Awakening to Your Life's Purpose during the first 30 or so pages; in fact I almost put it down.  It sounded like a bunch of new age mumbo Jumbo you expect out of Boulder or Berkeley.  But after suspending my own opinions, I read on and the book really did start to feel like it was talking to me.  Tolle's spin on the ego is nothing new, but his analysis of how we deal with it is.  The book definitely helps you to stop sweating the small stuff, even if it is just for a while.  He helps to differentiate between thoughts and reality, and makes you take a hard look at what really matters.  The obssesive desire to accumulate material things to become happy, or to continue to look to some mythical time in the future as the place where you will be happy are two particular issues that struck a chord with me.  I can honestly say the book has stuck with me, for quite some time since reading it.  I also feel like it is a book I will re-read fairly soon.<br /><br />I did find Tolle to be a fairly arrogant writer; there are parts of the book where he just seems a little too proud of himself.  The fact he is churning out books, getting on Oprah and raking in millions makes him look like someone who has lost his personal battle with the ego; but it doesn't mean you won't get something out of the book.

1401300529|2.0|Having just finished reading 28 books on the Korean War I looked forward to this book. It was a major disappointment. I found nothing new in it. I also found very little information about the korean War period in the book. It seems that few sources were actually used. His major sourse seems to have been Colonel Paul Freeman. Freeman had a very mixed history in Korea. Faced with the possible loss of his regiment while the rear guard commander of the 2nd Infantry Division he found an alternative route to move his troops. He saved his troops but left three other army battalions that his troops were supposed to be protecting to be destroyed by the Chinese. To some he was a hero, to others a man who left other troops in the lurch. He seems to have used no sourses from the Marine Corps and few period.     For someone who covered the Vietnam war he seems unable to understand many of the military moves. He also doesn't seem to understand just how bad the US Army was during the early part of the Korean War. He makes statements that the 1st Cavalry Division and the 2nd Infantry Division were elite units when they had been badly beaten by the North Koreans and were only a shadow of the proud World War II diviisons of the same name.     The book is really about General MacArthur and the Right Wing Republicans. Halberstam does a good job telling about this but fails to mention the problems caused by the left wing and their failure to understand the danger of the communist. He also fails to even mention the British spy ring that gave near real time intellengence about all major American decisions during the Korean War. Halberstam also seems to come to some simplistic conclusions about Communist China and the USA. He actually seems to believe that the US-Chinese relationship could have been very different very quickly if MacArthur hadn't pushed the UN troops into North Korea. Sometimes it just takes time for things to work themselves out. This is another example of wishful thinking as if Mao Tse-tung hadn't been a hard core Communist for nearly 25 years. The same Mao who would play games for two years during the Korean peace discussions while hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers were being killed and would later murder between 50-75 million of his own people to further his own cult of personality.        The following is a list of books that should be read about the Korean War. This kind of War by T.R. Fehrenbach; South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu; Escaping the Trap; and East of Chosin by Roy E Appleman; Chosin by Eric Hammel; and Conflict by Robert Leckie.

0743277457|5.0|I am humbled by Josh Waitzkin's singlular vision, maturity, work ethic, and insight. At 29, he displays the analytical and self-reflective power of a person twice his age.  I took this book out of the library yesterday, and I finished it today. Along the way I was moved by his profound insights into how to analyze your own performance, how to turn defeat into a learning experience, how to avoid the \\"downward spiral,\\" and much more.   This book could have been a vapid exercise in Eastern mysticism devoid of any concrete connection to the world, but Waitzkin constanty grounds his observations in real world examples. In avoiding the downward spiral, for instance, he recounts a harrowing incident in which he witnessed a young woman, inattentive for an instant, step out into a Manhattan street and get clipped by a bicycle. Instead of taking this as a warning to pay attention and step back, she compounded her error by stepping farther into the street to curse at him, and she got hit by a taxi and flund into a lamp post. Waitzkin used this incident to teach his students about the danger of losing your cool at a small error and allowing it to suck you into disaster.  Having read this book, I immediately dusted off my chess computer, turned on my electric piano, and determined to put Josh's principles into practice in my own, heretofore lackluster, \\"mastery\\" of both arts.  Now, I am not going to kid myself; this young man, if not a genius, certainly gives a good impersonation of one. And his incredible ability to focus, for hundreds or thousands of hours, on the mastery of an art certainly makes him one in several million. But it's well within the grasp of each of us to take many of the practical steps he explains in order to reach our own potential, however lofty or humble that might be.
B00177Y9ZC|2.0|After reading Stephen King's thumbs-up review of this film, I thought I would take a chance--even though critics panned it. I really hope that King saw a different cut of the film than the one released in theaters, because \\"Jumper\\" is a mess. It feels like the set-up for a movie or television series, rather than an actual movie in its own right. It introduces ideas, characters, and its own mythology, and just when things are beginning to take off...it ends. It could be a cool pilot for a tv show, but that's not enough of a reason to recommend it as a feature film.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Let me get right to the point: anyone that gives this album four or five stars must be members of Madonna's fan club. Anyway, I originally thought Madonna's last album [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]] was a concept album, but now it appears that dance music is what she's truly going for now (for those that never figured this out, she stopped the blatant sexuality after she married Guy Ritchie). But she could have done a lot better than Hard Candy.<br /><br />You can especially tell this is a club-friendly album because production credits are pretty much split between the beat-makers of the day: of the twelve tracks offered here, seven are produced by Pharrell while five are produced by Timbaland. Speaking of Timbo, lead single \\"4 Minutes\\" is easily the best song, but the unfortunate thing is that there are only two more songs that stand out: the final two tracks (\\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Voices\\").<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, Madonna doesn't really shoot for sex-induced tunes much any more, but the few times she does on here, she fails, like on \\"Give It 2 Me\\"; and as for \\"Candy Shop\\", well, I didn't care for 50 Cent's version either, but even HE did it better than this (but don't get it twisted; it isn't a remake). \\"Incredible\\" is skippable while \\"She's Not Me\\" sounds like a song that Beyonc&eacute; rejected. And you would think that a song called \\"Dance 2night\\" would have a faster beat. \\"Miles Away\\" is okay, but \\"Spanish Lesson\\" neither helps nor hurts the album.<br /><br />Hard Candy is far from being a flop and it will probably continue to sell on Madonna's name alone, but I find it a little hard to swallow -- but then again, it fulfills her contract with Warner Brothers, so maybe she just phoned it in. Still, unless you want to complete your Madonna collection, you can do without it.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B00138J7AW|5.0|Every single song on this CD is an absolute masterpiece. Cake is a very atypical rock band, very difficult to compare to other.  They are in a class of their own.  Every time I listen to this (or Fashion Nugget, also by Cake), I find myself lost in some aspect of the music.  Whether it is the guitar work which is primarily standard tuning and traditional chords, the intricate baselines which can only be described as flawless or the sometimes bizarre, always thought provoking lyrics, I find myself transfixed by the music.
1577314808|1.0|I read Eckhart quite some time ago , and put the book away.Much time later I read another one, and put it away too.I wonder why people write so many long and so vehement reviews about how great he is or how silly he is.I have ordered two of his DVD´s in german, and they are a very good way of improving my skills in that language.I have also noticed that most of the one star reviews come from people who think some author should be read instead of him,be it the Buddha,Krishnamurti,Ramana , this great man or that great man.I am not saying they should not read what they find serious, nor am I saying they should read Tolle.I have nothing for or against this author.I even enjoyed some sentences in the book,but that was all,no matter from where he got those ideas.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Iron Man is without a doubt, Marvel's next hit franchise. You could say it's the new \\"Spider-Man\\" and boy, does this trilogy look promising with its first chapter.<br /><br />How great is Iron Man? Well consider that I was still able to see it over one month since it's release date and it's still showing with multiple show times. Famed film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four stars even. It could be this summer's top movie just as Transformers was 2007's.<br /><br />Iron Man reminds me a lot of the first Spider-Man film in how the story is not terribly complex but dynamic enough with everything else solid. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, a intelligent, B.A. businessman & engineer. Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Pepper Potts, Stark's secretary and love interest, is able to successfully act with Downey Jr. so that their two characters show authentic chemistry. Every character was perfectly cast in my opinion.<br /><br />Industrial Light & Magic delivers again this summer with their work in Iron Man. Although it didn't blow me away like Transformers visuals did, the movie's effects were top notch quality and made the experience all the more enjoyable.<br />It seemed like an interesting, maybe even risky choice to have the musical score consist mainly of guitar-heavy, rock-like tracks but it turned out completely fitting with Tony Stark's personality and the mechanical brawn of Iron Man.<br /><br />All I can say to finish this review is to go see Iron Man if you haven't. Do not miss out on one of the best summer blockbusters of 2008!
B0014XCMVM|4.0|I'll keep this short and simple. Alanis' last album, aside from a song or two, was horrendous. This album redeems her as almost every song is great. The songs also embrace a new face of Alanis being more electronic.     I thought that Supposed... and Under Rug Swept were her two best albums overall, so that gives you an idea of where this review is coming from.
B00164DWEA|4.0|First off, this is not a sequel to 2003's Hulk but rather a fresh take, a revamp to the series. And it looks to be a good start, too.<br /><br />Most of us already know the backstory: scientist Banner is exposed to gamma rays, becoming the Hulk, and escapes, etc. Luckily the film acknowledges that and only takes a short period to demonstrate the backstory with a montage during the opening credits. After those few minutes, we get to cut to the chase with Banner taking refuge in Brazil.<br /><br />Incredible Hulk's story has a better pacing and feel to it than the 2003 film. The pacing isn't great but it's not too fast or too slow. However, the storyline left a little bit more to be desired and the 2003's Hulk had more storywise in my opinion. Acting overall was solid - Edward Norton makes a good Bruce Banner and kudos to him for helping out with the screenplay as well! The rest of the cast like Liv Tyler (Betty Ross) & William Hurt (General Ross) delievered acceptable performances.<br /><br />One noticeable improvement which made this film more incredible than the last Hulk flick was the effects work. It's hard to get something as out there as a large green buff man to look photo-realistic but he looks as good as he's gonna get in \\"Incredible\\" by ditching the purple pants and cartoony green skin for a green-toned skin and normal jeans. The sound design and musical score are fitting and definitely compliment the experience.<br /><br />Yet when it comes down to it, The Incredible Hulk is the lesser of the two Marvel movies released this summer. Go see Iron Man ASAP if you haven't. If you have and are looking for something to go see, Incredible Hulk would do the trick.<br /><br />Oh yes, last but not least, cameos. Yup, Stan Lee's back with one that's alright. And Robert Downey Jr. makes an interesting return as Tony Stark which provides one of the movie's cliffhangers. (NOTE: Sadly, there is nothing more after the credits so don't bother sitting to when the film reel runs out)
0385341075|3.0|I bought this book when I was in New Zealand, and it was impossible not to do so when every bookshop had piles and piles of it, and everybody was grabbing a copy of it! So I didn't really read what this book was about beforehand.    So I loved it at the beginning, but then.... There is a really shocking and violent episode that ends with Matilda, the principal character, leaving the island..... and from there on, the book just let me down. And there are some parts of the novel that relied too much on re-telling Dickens Great Expectations, but not really building up on the story.    My last advice is: don't read this book if you haven't read Grat Expectations, or if you don't remember it well.
1594489505|5.0|I read the Kite Runner before reading this one, and wasn't warned about all the feelings and emotions that book could lead you into!  So I was afraid that A Thousand Splendid Suns would not have such an impact on me.... In a way, I was prepared to read an amazing, violent, terribly unjust but beautiful story (I was actually demanding it!), and I was not deceived!  It should be number ONE in every best-books of 2007.    The story of the two women and all the things they have to put up with (war, being born on an unfair situation, etc) is told in a beautiful and moving manner. Another interesting aspect of this book is that it tells you a bit of the story of Afghanistan on the past decades, related directly to the main characters, and so it's very easy to understand how all this historical facts affected the people, which gives the novel an even more humanitarian scope then the story per-se.    Both books by Khaled Hosseini are on the list of my favourites.... And I am looking forward to the next one :O) Thank you Khaled Hosseini again!!!

B0017I1FNK|5.0|I always looks forward to new releases of Emmylou Harris.  I wonder how she can possibly top the previous album. My favorite album of Ms. Harris is \\"Red Dirt Girl\\" with \\"Stumble Into Grace\\" a very close second.  To be honest, at first listen of \\"All I Intended to Be\\" I wasn't that impressed.  The music is slow, the lyrics are dark and somber.  But since this is Emmylou Harris, I gave it a second listen and found myself hitting the repeat button on several cuts because I found them that good.  My favorites off of this album include \\"Kern River\\", \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\". Although this album will probably not hit plantinum sales or have any singles released to radio, it is still a welcome escape from the everyday top 40 country teen scene and actually I think that's what Emmylou may have \\"Intended it to Be\\"
B00164KYS2|4.0|I can well imagine anyone with only a passing familiarity with the [[ASIN:B0011UBDTK 1998-2004 HBO series]] would be bored to tears by a big-screen adaptation that runs an epic-length 148 minutes. I suggest they trust their instincts and stay away, as this 2008 movie is for those of us who appreciated the zeitgeist the show so accurately captured during its run. Focusing on four tightly-knit female friends living the high life in Manhattan, the sitcom was often hilariously ribald. At the same time, the comedy was offset by surprising dramatic elements in tackling issues facing women at the turn of the millennium. Directed and written by Michael Patrick King, who wrote and directed several of the series' turning-point episodes, the movie picks up the quartet of women four years after the last show. Even though the time lapse had more to do with cast salary negotiations, the delay allows an enhancement to the dramatic resonance of the various storylines that a simple continuation could not.<br /><br />For those unaware, the focus is on Carrie Bradshaw, a Manhattan fashionista who has served as a beacon for single women as she moved from New York columnist to contributing Vogue editor. Her best friends are yearning romantic wife-and-mother Charlotte, uptight alpha-lawyer Miranda Hobbes, and lascivious talent manager Samantha Jones. Each character represents an archetype for the contemporary urban woman and has lives that tap into the psyche of its most devoted audience. The plot is expected but reassuring as all the key male characters return as well. Carrie is still seeing the elusive \\"Mr. Big\\" (whose name was revealed on the last show as John), and in matter-of-fact fashion, they decide to get married. Naturally, since Carrie is the defining icon of single life for her readers, her wedding explodes into a lavish affair complete with a Vivienne Westwood wedding gown. Uncertainty between the couple is the only certainty. Charlotte has already found upscale domestic bliss with her mensch of a divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt, and their adopted daughter Lily.<br /><br />On the left coast, Samantha has miraculously sustained a five-year relationship with much-younger Smith Jerrod, a TV actor whose career she has managed to catapult with her PR savvy. Miranda is still living in Brooklyn with her puppyish bartender husband Steve and their son Brady, but marital problems lurk. King's level-setting of the various situations is blessedly brief during the first part of the movie, and it doesn't take long for all the predicaments to unfold to our rapt attention. All the women are now in their forties (with Samantha verging on fifty) and naturally look fabulous, but they also show how their lives result from choices that they sometimes look back on with understandable doubt. The only one who really doesn't look back is Charlotte, but her much-planned and sought-after happiness becomes a source of guilt and neurosis due to their sisterly bond. There wouldn't seem to be much room for any new characters, but we are presented with Louise, a vivacious girl from St. Louis who gets hired as Carrie's personal assistant.<br /><br />If the film does disappoint, it's probably during the middle which sags a bit, probably because King's approach to the storylines still retains the episodic nature of the series. Moreover, it's a double-edged sword when you have the same cast repeat roles they played for so long on TV. The upside is the instant familiarity, but the downside can be a lack of surprise. Luckily, the actresses fare pretty well on the latter. It honestly feels that every role Sarah Jessica Parker has played in the last decade ([[ASIN:B000EMGJ7C The Family Stone]], [[ASIN:B0019XZDZO Smart People]]) comes back intractably to Carrie. There is no question that it's a great, multi-dimensional character that she explores with emotional fluency, and it's refreshing to see her lack of hesitancy in exposing Carrie's unadorned side as well. As Charlotte, Kristin Davis has some of the film's funniest lines, and her perky demeanor remains untarnished. She also has the film's defining sisterly moment when she protects Carrie at her most vulnerable. Cynthia Nixon has the most daunting task in showing the shards of insecurity within the often-embittered Miranda, and she responds with the film's sharpest performance.<br /><br />However, I have to say the scene-stealer remains Kim Cattrall, who has a grand time making Samantha the full embodiment of female empowerment. Samantha's valiant attempts at monogamy are hilarious, and at the same time, age has mellowed her unapologetic character. Unsurprisingly, the men are overshadowed and as characters, rather underdeveloped (by intention, I'm sure). Chris Noth somehow has to bring humanity to a mythic character with perennial cold feet, and David Eigenberg elicits true sympathy to Steve in a most affecting manner. At least Jennifer Hudson shows she has more than Effie ([[ASIN:B000O174CM Dreamgirls]]) in her, though her Louise feels somewhat studied and comes across as a bit more than idealized. A review wouldn't be complete without mention of the film's costume designer Patricia Field ([[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]]), who has really defined the look of this show with her audacious fashion sense. Between the clothes, the sharp one-liners, and a quartet of actresses who know their roles outside and in, this marathon candy box of a film won't disappoint fans of the series. Others should stay far, far away.e of the film's funniest lines, and her perky demeanor remains untarnished.

B00150GHGA|4.0|Peter Lynch discusses his successful 13 years of running Fidelity's Magellan mutual fund.  After a short professional autobiography, he explains his methodology for selecting stocks and explores a few dozen January 1992 stock picks in detail.  Lynch wrote this book in the last days before the ubiquity of personal computers and the Internet's copious and accessible financial information.  Still, Lynch offers pithy investment advice (each unfortunately titled with a boldface \\"Peter's Principle\\") that transcend the book's early-1990s setting.  His enthusiasm should inspire most beginning to intermediate investors for whom this material is recommended.  Due to its age, used copies of this book should be widely and cheaply available.

The usual action stuff is in this movie: shootouts, big explosions, karate action, people falling great distances and not breaking a bone, car chases.<br />That kid, Justin Long, breathes life into this film and Bruce is still cool as John McClane.<br />Live Free or Die Hard isn't as good as Die Hard parts 1 or 3, but if you have an afternoon to kill and want to watch an action film, this movie fits the bill.

B00164DWEA|5.0|I saw the previous (2003) version of the Hulk with Eric Bana.  I liked it, but it wasn't good enough to warrant a purchase of it on DVD for me.  This one is different.  Edward Norton is convincing as Dr. Bruce Banner, and Liv Tyler does a good job with her role too.  William Hurt looks the part as the General, and Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee make brief but satisfying cameo apperances.  I also liked the computer animation, which always seemed real.  This movie had more suspense than the last one, and a better storyline I think.  You get a good idea of Bruce's inner struggle and there are several places where it becomes apparent.  A good deal of the movie involves his laying low and trying to escape, but when he is the Hulk, he doesn't have to run anywhere.  There are many ultra cool moments in this film.  Any action movie lover or comic book hero aficionado should see it.  Without ruining the highlights of the film or saying too much, I will say that it is worth your time, and the ending leaves you thirsty for more.  And more will probably come.  What a good time to be a comic book hero movie fan.
0060578793|4.0|I've found this book to be incredibly throrough and well written. The illustrations were very helpful as well.  I wish I had had this book when I as teenager and had more time to put the knowledge into practice.<br /><br />I did find, however that the book is more geared toward people who could potentially get caught in a survival situation for several weeks or even months; for example soldiers in enemy territory.  Nowadays, an average outdoor enthusiast, if faced with a survival scenario, is probably going to be more concerned about signalling for help or getting out of there, than say, testing a plant for several days to find out whether it's edible or not; or setting up snare traps to catch animal food.<br /><br />However, these are skills that I'd like to have anyway, and are unvaluable for anyone who spends time in the outdoors.

B001AD3NIM|2.0|I'm a big fan of Alanis but I'm affraid this album isn't up to snuff. If one is going to make every song about \\"I\\" or \\"me\\", then the music really needs some hooks to impart some feeling that at least somewhere in there is a deal with the listener. I don't find any of the songs on this album as having much in the way of hooks to latch on to. It's all about her and doesn't make me want to care. Still, she's done great stuff in the past and I look forward to seeing her on tour even if it means waiting through these self-absorbed misses.

1416550518|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book. This particular time in our history was changing so fast socially and politically that those living it hardly realized the impact. The characters became almost \\"friends\\" and what an ending! I hated for it to end! I think the ladies who nibble at the \\"forbidden\\" make interesting reading and Emme was right there in the middle of it all!    I look forward to her next book but I'll miss the comings and goings at Riverton. It became a familiar and lovely place.
1416550518|5.0|The House at Riverton is set in an English country manor house and in London, circa 1914-1924.  It was meticulously researched by the first-time Australian author who was simply stellar at examining the \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" life and how the two intermingle.  The book is as beautifully written as it is readable. It would make a FANTASTIC movie!  In a way it reminded me of the superb writing we saw years ago from Belva Plain [EVERGREEN], Colleen McCullough [THE THORN BIRDS], and even Rosamunde Pilcher [THE SHELL SEEKERS].  These ladies went on to write many other novels but... their *first* novels were the ones that grabbed us and the ones we compared all the others to. In my opinion it seemed their later works never quite measured up.  I hope that won't be the case with this talented author! I'm hoping for more great reads from Ms. Morton!  If this era appeals to you, do read The House at Riverton!!!
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is simply a bad film, not because of historical inaccuracies (what historical drama DOESN'T play with the facts?) but because it suffers from a terrible script, some unfortunate casting and an assumption that every viewer is already a scholar who doesn't need further instruction on why what's happening on the screen is happening. It is also just not very entertaining.    The film is an adaptation of a Philippa Gregory bestseller of the same name that takes a look at the classic story of how King Henry VIII of England fell in love out of marriage with the notorious Anne Boleyn and began an affair that marked England's break from the Papal power that ruled Europe. But that film doesn't really look at that story, it is instead a retread into typical teenage melodrama, and a tame one at that with a PG-13 rating.     To be fair, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" boasts some excellent production values. The costumes are stunning and the cinematography is very lush and beautiful. But direcetor Justin Chadwick's finished product is a stale, boring take on a fascinating tale. Characters are never fully developed or explained, we never really get to know King Henry (Eric Bana) or understand the world he lives in. The plot revolving on why the Boleyn sisters (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson) are enticed to seduce the King is never fully explained, in fact, we don't ever truly understand what interests their male family masters have in injecting them into the King's court,all we hear is \\"it will be of great benefit to our family,\\" and that's it. The world of these people is never established. Consider the fact that Henry's marriage to Anne sparked a major uproar which resulted in the establishment of the Church Of England. This is completely skipped over, you never even know that the Catholic church had an iron grip on society before Henry meets Anne or afterwards. Instead the movie lingers on uninteresting, cliche scenes where characters hush adolescent passions to each-other in darkened halls, or shots of Portman and Johansson looking at each-other with girlish jealousy.     The casting is also a bit off. Bana is good as Henry, but he is never allowed to inhabit the screen or conquer a scene, instead he is reduced to short, soap operish dialogue. Portman is wrong as Boleyn, she plays what should be a dark, seductive character more as some sort of confused, innocent teenager. Her performances feels out of place with the role, but then again her character is never defined. The same goes for Johansson's Mary Boleyn who after the second half, is reduced to just a walk-in who is apparently just meant to stand there looking teary-eyed at the camera.    Some have complained about dramatic license the film takes with history, when it comes to film it's pointless, the best period films, from \\"A Man For All Seasons\\" to \\"Elizabeth\\" have taken liberties with history. If you want the hard facts go READ, the faults of this film all lie in the bad writing and the obvious fact that the film suffers from a marketing ploy: People were more concerned with having Bana, Portman and Johansson all on the same screen. Too bad nobody bothered to give them a decent movie to participate in.
1400049628|4.0|Max Brooks has some absolutely genius ideas about horror, comedy, sociology, and pop culture. He's just not, unfortunately, a great writer. The Zombie Survival Guide is more successful than his should-have-been-brilliant novel World War Z, due largely to it's being written in the style of a manual where Max's somewhat stiff style works more to his favor.<br /><br />Still worth having? Absolutely. Especially is you live in Pittsburgh.

B000TGJ80S|2.0|When Francis Ford Coppola is good, he's very very good. When he's bad... he turns out something like \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\" Whose title is also very inappropriate, since only a tattered, abused outline of Stoker's original novel is left.<br /><br />Instead, somebody (probably writer James V. Hart) decided to turn the story of Dracula aka Vlad the Impaler into a tragic star-crossed love story. But not only does this revamped \\"Dracula\\" not make much sense, but it rapidly degenerates into a feverishly baroque eruption of schlock, horribly wooden acting and endless drippy sympathy for an avowed brutal murderer.<br /><br />Prince Vlad the Impaler went off to war, and came back to find that his wife had high-dived into the river. Enraged, he renounced God (I'm not sure why) stabbed a cross (which started inexplicably bleeding), and became a vampire.<br /><br />Centuries later, Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) arrives in Transylvania to sell a house to Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) -- only to find that Dracula's castle is a depraved, bloody horror house. As he's tormented by Dracula's brides, Dracula travels to England and encounters Harker's fiancee Mina (Winona Ryder), who apparently is the reincarnation of his late wife. So he wines and dines her, while seducing her lusty pal Lucy (Sadie Frost).<br /><br />And as Lucy grows sickly, lustier and weirder, Doctor Seward (Richard E. Grant) calls his old mentor Dr. Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) to help cure Lucy. Of course, she's being turned into a vampire by Dracula, who is none too pleased that Mina is now rushing to marry Jonathan. Van Helsing's little group sets out to destroy Dracula once and for all -- but Mina is going to make things difficult.<br /><br />Despite including Bram Stoker's name in the title, it's pretty obvious that Coppola only sticks to the bare bones of Stoker's classic vampire novel. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself -- some changes to books are good things. Unfortunately \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is changed in mostly negative ways -- an illogical love story, absurd costumes and hair, schlocky special effects, and some really rotten acting.<br /><br />And sadly, turning the story into a soggy tragic romance causes a number of plot holes -- Renfield is superfluous, Harker mysteriously survives a fall that killed Elizabeta, and Mina goes on sexy dates while her best pal is dying (there's a friend for you!). And the appalling James V. Hart's attempts at romantic dialogue fall painfully flat, especially when they come from from the legendary Vlad the Impaler (\\"I have crossed oceans of time to find you!\\").<br /><br />Even worse, the beginning of the movie is soaked in schlock -- red satin, animal helmets, muscle armor, creeping shadows, and Dracula's hilarious \\"breasts\\" hairdo. Coppola thankfully tones down the schlock factor pretty quickly, although the hyperactive cameras never quite calm down. Many of the following scenes are genuinely lovely: bridal vampires, polished crypts, haunted forests and a gloriously ruinous Carfax Abbey bathed in flames.<br /><br />But while the story of \\"Dracula\\" has a fair dose of subliminal sex, someone apparently decided it isn't blatant enough. So we get random lesbian kisses, screamed orgasms, bare breasts, green mist sex, Mina snogging Van Helsing, and Lucy getting raped by a werewolfized Dracula on a bench.<br /><br />Gary Oldman makes a solid enough Dracula, although even his formidable talents can't make me sympathize with a brutal mass murderer just because he's an incurable romantic and has pretty hair. Hopkins makes an outstandingly quirky Van Helsing, and Cary Elwes makes a solidly stiff-upper-lipped Arthur Holmwood. Bill Campbell and Richard E. Grant also make solid contributions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, more spotlight time is given to the appallingly bad Ryder and Reeves. Ryder's acting is mostly confined to looking dewy-eyed all the time, and her outrage upon finding that \\"her prince\\" killed her best buddy is all too fleeting. Reeves devotes most of his questionable acting skill to wrestling with a splotchy British accent. Eventually this pivotal part is reduced to clumping around randomly, looking befuddled.<br /><br />This would be better called \\"Francis Ford Coppola and James V. Hart's Dracula,\\" soaked in superfluous sex, wooden acting, plot holes, and a feverish haunted-house ambience. Oldman and Hopkins are sublime, but not much else is.ng with a splotchy British accent.

B0016AJU2C|5.0|Along with everyone else I was a big fan of Alanis's major label debut album, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" back when it was released. However because a co-worker felt the need to play the album non-stop for about three months the album became annoying. I don't think I've listened to it since and haven't paid attention to any of Alanis's follow-up albums. Then last week I heard her perform one of her new songs on Howard Stern's radio show and decided to give the new album a shot. This is a great album from start to finish. She has grown a lot since \\"Pill\\" and the combination of her lyrics and Guy Sigsworth's production are a match made in heaven. There isn't a weak track on the disc but the piano ballad \\"Not As We\\" is a stand out track for me. \\"Straitjacket\\", \\"Underneath\\", \\"Moratorium\\" they're all great. The album is loaded with hooks and much like \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" this is a disc you will play over and over.

I have been buying lots of her songs and remix cd's cause what can you say. She is an icon!! I am not a fan of this new stuff she came out with Justin Timberlake. But I just got her Music cd & then the Ray of Light and there are just so many great songs on there that weren't even overplayed. She is an amazing song writer and has worked with some of the best producers in the biz. I luv the clubby feel of this cd. It is good for anyone who loves the disco kind of house sound that in my opinion, she is responsible for solely. Even her first albums in the 80's with Jellybean are to me still classics without a doubt. Anyways I strongly recommend this album if you are in the mood to groove or party. You have got to have this cd!!

006135323X|5.0|Some books are engaging, easy to read and understand; others contain solid and rigorous empirical thinking.  Often the most entertaining books contain dubious content and many with the best content can be deadly dense and boring.  But a few books are both engaging and enlightening and Predictably Irrational clearly falls into this category.  Ariely skillfully integrates the basics of experimental psychology with warm and personal accounts of the social context and significance of a series of systematic investigations of several intriguing questions.  What he finds are things social psychologists might have guessed but it is nice to have the evidence to support our theorizing and speculation.  I teach a Senior Research in Psychology at a small liberal arts college and will use many of the studies in the book in my class; I've already purchased a few extra copies and given them to students who will be taking the course next year.  This is a great book for those interested in psychology and human decision making.

0786948523|1.0|OK.......   I really REALLY REALLY wanted to love this game.  To be honest I've been a sucker for every incarnation of DnD that's come out.  I liked all of em in their own way.  I prebought this one and every 'pre-book' they've put out... We were all so eager for this new incarnation.  It read so well.  I can't believe this, but this game has actually managed to depress me!!  I HAVE played it.  Just spent three hours playing, in fact.      When we finished the party reported that they had the distinct feeling that we had just played a board game version of WOW.  Now we all LOVE WOW in our gaming group.. but that's NOT what we sat down to play around a table.  We saw nothing 'quick' or 'streamlined' about the gaming experience.  We moved pieces around a board adhereing to movement rules and 'squares' for this and that in a fashion that reminded me way too much of the old 'Heroes Quest', albeit a complicated version!  Were the game mechanics good?  Yes.  Why did I give it a 'one star'?  Because whilst the game is a good miniature warfare game it seemed to rob the flavor of DnD.  The character creation was extrememly confined and the selections were limited.  Gone was the ability to customize your character to the point that you actually felt like you had something unique.  You will feel as if WOC is controlling the direction your character takes.  The game DEMANDED a board and game pieces.. I've always felt that DnD's flavor relied on the 'minds eye', which is so much more colorful in my head than staring at plastic pieces on a piece of cardboard.  I do realize that the 'original' DnD was just that, a wargame with a fantasy element.  But I feel it evolved into so much more... I guess we've 'returned to our roots'... so why do I feel like we climbed back into the primordial ooze?!    A great deal of the time the magic users felt like they were 'hitting the hot button key'.  They had one or two actions that they relied on every round to cause the maximum amount of damage.  No inovation or imagination.  Everything was geared towards 'how does this directly effect combat'.      The DM's guide isn't that bad.  Reminds me a LOT of the first edition book.  Information on how to be an effective dm, traps, dungeons, and artifacts.  Not what 'thirders' would expect, but not bad.      The Monster Manual is awful.  A third of the pictures are just rehashed from all the previous Monster Manuals.  The book is concerned with stats so you can play your miniature game effectively.  Again.... great if your into miniature gaming.  The ecology and culture information is virtually non-existant.  Make all the arguments you want about this now being in the pervue of the DM.. the honest answer is that WOC is being lazy.  You have a vast variety of stats to place against your carefully created stats, but very little flavor to guide you in roleplaying the encounters.      I have read that the streamlined combat will enhance the rolplaying as you'll have more time available.... that was really exciting.. too bad this wasn't the case.  Going to miniatures and a combat board, whilst carefully figuring out where your party and the encounter is, everytime combat arose was time consuming.  You'll also notice that you'll have to change the map everytime, of course, which is also time consuming.      If you LOVE miniature wargaming.  If Warhammer is something you daydream about.... this is the game for you!  As a miniature game experience it ranks a three or four...     If you love games that take place in your head fired by limitless imagination then your probably going to be disappointed.      I really feel like power gamers are going to LOVE this game and probably flame me for my remarks.  The game is geared towards being 'godlike'.  I'm not knocking this.  If you love powergaming and twinking then this is DEFFINITLEY the game for you.  To each his or her own.  You should buy it immediately... and keep DnD fiscally sound enough to perhaps manage an inevitablerewrite that might restore my faith.      Ironically I'll be keeping my set... I think it'll make a great board game for those rare nights when I just wanna run through dungeons killings things and working off frustrations.  According to the DMG I don't even need a DM to do this.....  Sound like any RPG you ever heard of????  No story teller... no RPG.  Just another board wargame.. albeit a pretty good one.      Good day!
B000083C49|5.0|And that is the truth.  They shot scenes from this fine film in my high school's backyard (The Former Alameda Naval-Air Base).  And that was years and years before I ever met the likes of Blane, my production manager at the trophy shop, who laughs at me whenever I talk Trek with some of my customers.  Heck Blane, I know you own this title on DVD AND VHS!  Just like me.  Why don't you just admit it already.  It won't make you any less annoying to let the world see the fact that you are a nerd, like us (I mean you ex-wife and me).  Maybe one day, when you're really drunk on too much Bud, you'll throw your ball at the bowling alley, miss every single pin, and remark, \\"No, I'm from Iowa, I just work in outer space.\\"
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I absolutely loved the music from the film, and I hardly ever buy soundtracks, but I had to have this one. The music seems too short, not that they cut any of the songs, but they are so good you wish there was more of it. It would have been nice to have all the music of the film on the track - you are just getting the original music made specifically for this film. The authentic music of the time (such as Mr. Belvedere's Maggot), most of what they dance to in the movie, are not included.

0765348780|2.0|After finishing this book I was quite surprised to see that it is averaging four stars with amazon reviewers.  *Disclaimer - What follows is not meant to insult any fans of Erikson's work as I respect each readers unique tastes in books.    For me though, I found myself saying \\"this is horrible\\" out loud more than a few times as I read through it.  I really can't conceive of a mind that would find this work of fiction interesting or compelling.      One of the great things about fiction and storytelling is the ability of a writer to make you feel a wide range of emotions for their characters and provide a deep sense of atmosphere.  This pulls you into the fantasy world of the writer and makes you actually care about what happens there.  Erikson's world feels like traveling in the mind of a 15 year old with ADD.  Jumping around from one time to another and then jumping around from one underdeveloped character to another is fun for about 5 seconds until you realize how much of this Erikson does.  The world just never felt real, and there never seemed to be any reason to care about his characters.  You just knew that if harm were to befall them, they would just be replaced by the millions of other drab personalities that seem to spew from the author's mind.    I've heard fans of this series say that the casual reader might not like it because it's so complicated.  I completely disagree, as I find this work to be fairly easy to follow.   I think the reason that many readers might not like it is because it's completely void of any spirit whatsoever.  I guess if you're the type of person that likes to read about one dimensional characters who end up crossing paths with numerous other bit players, and events take place that are written as monumental but are not felt as monumental, then this book is for you.  I mean, that's great if an author attempts to weave a complex plot in an enormous universe, but we the reader better find that universe and its inhabitants interestingor it's just a collection of boring words.    This is exactly how I would describe this work.  A collection of boring words.    I would have rated it one star if it weren't for the redeeming qualities of a few of his characters, WhiskeyJack and Captain Paran for example seemed like living breathing people and not just word spewing mannequins like the rest of the lot.      Into the trash bin it goes!

B0014BQQYS|2.0|This disc ranks right up there with one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I own (along with the first Stargate release).  It is a shame, as this is a really great and fun movie.  It is one of the first westerns I recall that really interspersed humor with drama in an effective way.  I thought it tried to be a bit too much or to have something for everyone (the bicycle scene went on a little long for my taste, for example).  Audio is fine but the failure to produce a really outstanding video transfer (as was done with Patton recently) will disappoint the many fans of this movie who were eagerly awaiting this release.
B00000DCHD|5.0|This is the original urban sound of New York.     Billy Joel interjects Rock, Soul, Latin, Jazz, Italian pop and at the same time funking it to various rhythms in this wonderful album of the urban Latin-Italian experience in New York or any other major North American city.     52nd Street is conceptualized like a musical and Billy's vocals have the characterizations of a young urban Latino. The infectious melodic passages with their rhythmic variations and precise lyrics make you feel and live the life on 52nd street; visiting bars, hanging around rooftops, cruising waitresses, complaining about loudmouth girlfriends at fancy parties, claiming your independence, drinking with friends and falling in love.     The second to last song culminates in a big passionate number, like you would hear in a musical and the title song only comes in at the end after a long silent pause and is a short jazzy number like the closing credits of a show.    One of my favourite albums.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|I waited a while to rent this movie. After I saw it, I wished I had seen it in 3D on the big screen.<br /><br />This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis. I should have known it would be a great film. It was entertaining, extremely graphic, and eye candy that sets a new standard for CGI.<br /><br />I loved this movie. I can't say that about 99% of the films I've seen.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I had the good fortune to view John Adams the HBO miniseries as it played on HBO.  As an elementary school teacher and a long time lover of the story of our nation's birth, I have seen and read a number of fictionalized accounts of our 2nd President.  My favorite has always been the musical 1776 but this treatment may very well have surpassed even that.  It is so rich and many-layered.  It shows the grit and the difficulty of life for our founding fathers and mothers. It portrays characters we often think of as larger-than-life heroes as real, flawed men.     Paul Giamatti is John Adams.  He is the idealistic, bullish young man who defends a group of British soldiers because it is the right thing to do.  He is the husband and lover of Abigail (played enchantingly by Laura Linney).  He is the father, the statesman, the revolutionary, the world traveller, the dissilusioned Vice President and the hopeful but ultimately somewhat ineffective President.  He portrays all the facets of John Adams so that I forgot I was watching Paul Giamatti and saw only John Adams.    This is a carefully, lovingly crafted piece of filmmaking.  See it!
0446677450|4.0|Well, I have little to add to the comments, if any, but I feel as a mother and an entrepreneur the obligation to say what I think of this book. This is a good easy to read book for non-business people who never figure out what cash flows and balance sheets mean. It really makes these 2 most important financial statements convinient for many people. A good point.     The best thing about Kiyosaki is that he's talking from experience which makes it plausible. Although I was expecting to see more examples and \\"know-how\\"s. I personally found the approach very smart and easy to read. If the title was \\"Rich man and Poor man\\" I wouldn't have bought it, so basically I read it for my children and it truly inspired me on how I should raise them to think \\"BIG\\" rather than leave them dwelling on the rat race trap.

B00164DWEA|4.0|When a scientific experiment goes horribly wrong, Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), is forced to go into hiding in a Brazillian favela.  He's searching the rainforest for a flower that will help cure his condition.  A spike in his heartrate, even a drop of his blood being shed alarms him, it turns out, he has gamma poisoning.    When a drop of his blood accidentally contaminates a bottle of energy drink, Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) comes after Banner with his full force, including a special recruit, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).      When the military fails to capture Banner after he turns into the Hulk, Blonsky wants a piece of the action and General Roth gives it to him, thus creating another monster to fight the Hunk--the Abomination.     Banner returns to the US to find a cure for his condition and that's when the real fighting begins. The General's daughter, Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler) is an interesting love interest.    We've also got cameos by some former Hulk characters as well as a surprise hint for the future at the end.  I didn't see the regrettable 2003 \\"Hulk\\", but both the spouse and I enjoyed this version.      Rebecca Kyle, June 2008
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Somehow 'Shelter' expands the definition of sweetness: it adds strenght to it, inspiration, and makes it extraordinary lively and colourful. This is not a feel-good movie, it is a genuine journey into well-being.    And thus it ends much to soon. I know only one film that has even stronger moments between the two male leads -slightly more sensual too- that I immediately rewatched after 'Shelter' to fill the void: Juste Une Question d'Amour. And oh boy, these two films are a match made in heaven!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this workout DVD!!!  I highly recommend giving it a try!  My husband even does it with me, and he hates to exercise (so it's not too \\"girly\\").  It's great because there are 3 levels....you can do level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 day, & level 3 for 10 days to reach the goal of a 30 day workout.  There aren't many workout videos that I've done where I don't get bored by day 10 ~ so this is a great way to keep it fresh!  I think Jillian is a wonderful instructor...not annoying at all.  You will definitely be sweating at the end of the 20 minutes if you give it your all.  It's a complete body workout ~ it really makes you push your limits.  I enjoy the simplicity of it too...she sticks with the basics & doesn't make it too complicating or hard to follow.      Great for beginners or advanced....young or old....give it a try & you'll be glad you did!!!!

0786948523|1.0|Ok guys, I just got finished reading most of the reviews on the MM, and are you people who give it 5 stars serious.  Lets see what the left out of the first MM from 3.0:  Celestials, Metalic Dragons, and much more important creatures.  Oh, and did I mention the lazy photoshoped artwork.  Oh, and that angels are no longer alligned, that they can even serve evil gods, uh, hello, is anyone in there, that is what demons and devils are for guys, angels are the good guys, plus in this book did anyone else notice that they looked strangely like the comic book incarnation of ArchAngel after Apocolips got ahold of him in X-Men.  Metal Wings is what im talking about.  This book and this game is an afront to my sences, and if I could, I would give it a zero stars.  Thanks Hasbro, and P.S., please try and find some other way to syphon money out of me.
0743486285|5.0|I must say that this book was hard to put down. This book was so good that I finished it in 3 days. I liked the wasy Sixx put the book together. He had his diary entries and then had those involved elaborate  afterwards....it was a great idea. There was some pretty wicked pictures in the book too!!
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I am so happy to see that I am far from being the first to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Anne Elliot. It is not the actor's fault, for sure. As a matter of fact, I thought the physique of Sally Hawkins suited my imagination of Anne Elliot the best out of all 3 I have seen. Yet, the way she was directed was horrendous. She is constantly running after Captain Wentworth (and not only in the last ten minutes, what about the concert scene?). I also much preferred the older Captain Wentworth (played by Ciaran Hinds). He seemed to show a lot more emotion while still staying true to Wentworth's steely character. Finally, why on earth was this one cut so short? We hardly saw anything pass between the main 2 characters and the cousin Mr. Elliot character was just a silhouette in the background. Very odd and poorly done.
B000OONTFU|5.0|If you liked the Matrix trilogy and still have a HD dvd player then you will love the Ultimate Matrix Collection in high def.  The \\"bonus disc\\", the Animatrix is not in high def format which is very disappointing as it has spectacular visuals, especially Matriculated.  The price is also reasonable now.
159102594X|5.0|I hadn't read Abercrombie before and I only picked up this book because I heard very good things about it. All in all, I really liked Joe Abercrombie's style. The way that he distributes the story among different characters and places helped me in being immersed in the book. I also found that the characters were well created, they were easy to impersonate.<br />Furthermore, the way \\"The Blade Itself\\" ends suggests that the second book ([[ASIN:1591026415 Before They Are Hanged (The First Law: Book Two)]]) is going to be even better.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie was excellent from start to finish. To be so in love with someone and want them to realize that life goes on after you are gone is amazingly unselfish. Hilary Swank gives a truly heartwarming performance as a woman who loses the love of her life. Definitely a movie that I will add to my collection!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I have been waiting for so long to watch a movie like this...I was starting to wonder if one was ever going to be made.  As the movie was playing I could feel myself getting more and more involved and hooked in this story and these characters.      I found myself starting to relate to some of the parts of the story, like, when they're just laying in bed together talking and enjoying each other, my partner and I do that all the time.  When Zach was pacing back and forth deciding if he should go see Shaun, I have done that too.  Zach being \\"involved\\" with someone else when he has his first kiss with Shaun; this happened to me.  One other example is how Zach let himself fall for Shaun and let things happen and how this would be his first boyfriend.  My partner and I have been together since December 2002, he is my first, and we are now engaged.    Thank you to Jonah Markowitz for bringing us this movie and to Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe for making these characters so believable.  In my own opinion this movie just become the one to beat, I don't know if any other gay movie will ever come close.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|It's hard to invest six hours on a TV movie but I had no regrets after watching this accomplished story of a wayward British politician. As usual in a UK drama, people lacked the physical perfection (and general implausibility) of most American TV actors but more than made up for this with gritty, real-world characterizations. The dialogue is regional; American viewers may need captions to keep up with the dense plot, but please do that for full enjoyment. Bill Nighy ('NOTES ON A SCANDAL') gives an entertaining performance as a Ben Bradlee-type newspaper editor. David Morrissey (BASIC INSTINCT) is compelling as the tortured MP and John Simm is authentic as the world-weary journalist. Watch out for James McAvoy (ATONEMENT, KING OF SCOTLAND) in one of his early roles. Ask yourself: is this an emerging star, or what? I loved this show so much, I bought the two disc set for my mother-in-law! What more can I say?

Unlike other self-winding or kinetic watches, this one is compact. In the best tradition of Japanese product development they thought hard on how this watch should function and say about the wearer. The hands are easy to reading, even for those of use with failing eyesight. The second sweep hand has a read tip allowing easy setting of the time.<br /><br />Unlike some Japanese product, they provided a short, simple instruction on winding the watch. Here, I am comparing them to Citizen's ecco-drive watch, which I also own. Just gently work your arm back and forth for three minutes and the self-wind watch will charge; or, you could wear it for a day.<br /><br />Okay, now for the negatives. First, this is not your quartz watch. The original self-winding mechanism was invented, according to Wikipedia, by a Swiss watchmaker in 1770. Since then it has gone through several improvements but is not as accurate as the quartz mechanism popularized starting in the 1970's. Sieko warns that this watch could be off by as much as 10 seconds a day. One days use indicates that my watch runs about 10 seconds fast.<br /><br />The great watchmaker Harrison, who invented the first chronometer accurate enough to track longitude, said that consistency is more important than accuracy. (A poor copy of one of Harrison's chronometers was carried by Captain Cook on his circumnavigation of the globe. He had nothing but good things to say about it.) I have another self-winding watch, an Armitron, which runs consistently 15 seconds fast on days that I wear it.<br /><br />From my measurements of quartz watches, their accuracy, while dazzling when compared to old hand-wound watches, are less accurate than my old German pendulum clock. So I am told, the longer the arm, the more stable the swing and the more accurate the timepiece. I compare everything to atomic time. And, because the quartz mechanism is battery-driven, it seems to suffer from inconsistency. I carefully measured my collection of six quartz watches over a 2 year period. While the battery was new, the error was consistent. As the battery burned out, the error became difficult to predict. Sometimes a positive error (adding time) would become a negative error (losing time) as the battery died. This dying period was also hard to predict.<br /><br />The accuracy of the quartz mechanism is not as good as my pendulum clock. They all lost or gained approximately 2-3 seconds, on average, per month.<br /><br />Based on a week of measurements with the Armitron, I would say that it is shockingly inaccurate but consistently so. Assuming that the Sieko error continues to be consistently 10 seconds fast this will mean that I will have to reset it every week. This is a small price to pay for an otherwise beautifully crafted and honestly-priced handiwork.<br /><br />Setting time<br />The date and day are fairly easy. I suggest turning the watch arms until the click past a day so you won't be twelve hours off.<br /><br />Setting the time is another matter. What works best is to set the hour and minute hands, then gently hold the second hand. It should pulse a little as ittries to force itself forward. Once the seconds are accurate, release and the second hand should be accurate. It takes a little practice at first and don't set the time until you pump the watch 3 minutes to charge the spring.<br /><br />Time to unwind<br />It takes about 39 hours (1 test) to unwind.<br /><br />[...]time until you pump the watch 3 minutes to charge the spring.

B000LPLTX6|1.0|Where is the clever ending?  The entire movies builds to something you think you would never expect.  I never expected such a bad ending.  The ending is anticlimactic at best.
B00164DWEA|4.0|This new version of the Hulk has less talk and more action. It also scraps the idea from the 2003 film that Banner got powers due to his father experimenting on him. The opening credits \\"which is a lot like the ones to the 70's tv series\\" explains how he became the Hulk.<br /><br />  Norton's Banner goes into hiding right after getting his powers. In Brazil he tries to learn how to control his anger better. It's going ok until the military finds out where he is.<br /><br />  The Incredible Hulk is also a success for Marvel after Ironman. However it has less of a story than the 2003 film. It also feels like the same movie in some areas. You have Betty's father (this time played by William Hurt, not Sam Elliiot) after Bruce yet again. When we already know that weapons of the military are useless against the Hulk. We learned that bullets bounce off of him in the 2003 film already.<br /><br />  However they do learn that if they want to be a match for him they need someone as strong as him. Tim Roth's character is more than eager to be experimented on after seeing how unstoppable Banner is.<br /><br />  The movie has so much energy that I was yawning by the middle of the film. However it is well made and the action is very well done. It is the fun comic \\"Hulk Smash\\" film that people hoped the 2003 film to be. I do prefer some of the casting of the 2003 over the casting here though. I think Sam Elliot did better work in the same part than William Hurt does. Hurt hams it up and overacts a little too much, which is why I took Elliot more serious in the role since he didn't ham it up or overact. While I liked Jennifer Connely a little more as Betty than Liv Tyler. Although Tyler does some of her better work here I admit.<br /><br />  I didn't have a problem with the idea of Eric Bana coming back again either. With more to do he could have been a good Hulk. However Norton does shine here and gets to have more fun with the part with a lot less of an overly serious script.

B000F4LPJ6|4.0|While I wasn't bugged at all about this some may not like that its a subtitled movie.  With that said, this movie is a PURE BLOOD BATH!  If your against violent movies don't get this one!  I personally loved it!  It wasn't just about people killing people, it was about friends forced to kill each other or die anyways One of the issues of the movie is it shows that its a bit dated now.  The blood was fake looking, and some of the lines a bit funny (though that could be due to translation also).  Over all in a movie dealing with kids killing other kids (I never thought I'd say this) it made me laugh.  It made me laugh due to some of the corny lines and not the act itself.  Over all I'd say rent it first then decide if you like it enough to buy it.. we all have different thoughts and onions on movies, how ever it was worth it to add this to my collection.
0316143472|5.0|I first heard about this book on The Daily Show (love it) and heard him tell the story about how the book got to have its title. That was enough to propel me to look into the book. WHAT A FUNNY, ENTERTAINING and INSIGHTFUL book this is. I sat in my chair laughing out loud. His writing style is a bit reminiscent of how a comedian does his standup. With witty style, he describes the most hilarious moments that most might overlook and spins it in a way that can really make you think. He has a wonderful way of writing about our world and the quirkiness that might not be evident to all of us.

B000Q8QHK8|3.0|Amazon for whatever reason continues to post Standard DVD Reviews with Blu-Ray. Anyhow this is a so so Blu-Ray movie.
B0000041TD|5.0|In a recent BBC3 \\"CD Review\\" broadcast, Alexandra Wilson made a gallant attempt to achieve the impossible task of choosing amongst forty or so recordings of \\"La Boheme\\" - and while I agreed with her ultimate choice of the Beecham recording with Bjorling, Merrill and De Los Angeles, I have rather more regard for this discarded Karajan recording simply because Pavarotti's voice, in its prime, as she herself put it, \\"runs through the recording like a golden seam\\". The rest of the cast is wonderful, too, although Karajan's love for the score is manifested in a rather deliberately \\"beautiful\\" approach and thereby slightly undercuts the drama. I cannot be without either recording of this eternally youthful and moving opera, and although Freni was captured in slightly fresher, more limpid voice in the earlier Schippers set, for me Gedda is absolutely no substitute for Pavarotti at his best. Both Merrill and Panerai are infinitely touching in the great duet \\"O Mimi, tu piu non torni\\" and although Beecham's recording is a little rough around the edges, he conveys greater energy and fun in the slapstick scenes while, Karajan extracts slightly more pathos from the last act, in better sound. Acquire both sets for the complete experience.<br /><br />P.S. I have since had another careful listen to the Callas/Di Stefano/Votto account re-issued on Naxos (see my review) and must concede that it is up there with these two. So, my review header should read: \\"One of the three best recordings\\", perhaps?
B0014JOLI8|5.0|\\"The Amulet of Samarkland\\" is a outstanding beginning to The Bartimaeus Trilogy. Stroud combines a great story with original characters in this first book of the series. Bartimaeus' unique voice provides an creative twist that really makes the book.   I introduced this book to 6th grade students and they couldn't stop reading. Bartimaeus' asides can make reading a little difficult for kids who struggle with books but his conversational style is really accessible.   The nice thing about this book, and the others in the series is that each has its own ending instead of an obvious cliff hanger to be resolved in the next of the series.  This is a great book and the beginning of a wonderful series.
0060922583|4.0|Did you know that if a person with multiple<br />personality disorder gets drunk and switches to another personality unaware of the drinking, then the current personality will no longer be drunk? If you've ever wondered what the limits to the mind and our interconnectedness are, then this book will help you set your sights more accurately.<br /><br />More specifically, through its true stories and cited studies, it demonstrates that the world is not as we see it. This book clearly shows us that there is a richness and depth that go to such far reaches of our mind that we can't even comprehend it.<br /><br />This book has the potential to radically alter your world view forever... that is, if you can get past the first half of this book which is a bit content-dense and, in my opinion, not all that interesting.
0786838655|5.0|\\"The Lightning Thief\\" is a creative book that introduces the elements of Greek mythology in an exciting modern story. Percy is a great hero who struggles to figure out who he is and how he fits into the world around him. It is a little more complicated for him than most kids, being the son of greek god and all.  This is a great book to introduce to kids, especially in the classroom. The classic mythological themes and characters that are the basis of the book provide a great launching pad to study the really Greek myths. The kids couldn't stop reading and asked to read the second of the series as soon as they finished \\"The Lighting Thief\\"  This is a fun book that is the beginning of a really enjoyable series.
B00023B1LC|5.0|The story, in brief, is a man is rescued by a fishing boat, with amnesia and bullet holes. In his quest to discover his identity, people try to kill him, and he reacts with professional swiftness. He teams up with a young woman, and together they elude the killers while searching for answers and falling in love.    This was obviously written with me in mind. I mean, come on--it's got almost every one of my favorite things: a spy story, action/adventure, amnesia, a romance--heck, the romantic interest is even German. What baffles me is that I'd never read Ludlum's book even though it came out at a time when I was reading a lot of spy novels. I've ordered it.    At any rate, I can't say yet how the movie compares to the book, but the movie is excellent. Matt Damon plays a man who doesn't realize he's a professional assassin perfectly--the combination of good-intentioned searching for his identity with the growing realization that he's not just some nice guy who works in an office is very convincing.    Franka Potente, too, is very realistic as an adventurous young woman who ends up in over her head, but is reluctant to leave because of her growing feelings for him.    The action is nonstop and exciting, and the mystery of who he is and why people are trying to kill him is compelling.    This is one of those rare movies I can watch over and over again. One of my favorites.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Brilliant animation, humorous characters and an upbeat, funny storyline make this a standout movie for kids of all ages, including my old self.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield's got a lot of heat from viewers because they said the camera made them dizzy. Some also said a lot of things were not explained. Here's my 2+2 cents on Cloverfield. Well, I just finished watching the dvd and I must say I'm amazed. For the idea of Cloverfield alone, the film should get a lot of recognition. I liked this more than I liked 28 Days later and the sequel. This is modern cinema at it's best. I loved the characters esp the person who's taking the video. He stayed true to his character and not so much the drama element involved in tragedies. (\\"no camcorder advertising\\" was done)<br /><br />Cloverfield a huge risk taken by the film-makers and I must say naysayers can whine for all their mouth but Cloverfield shuts everyone up and delivers. Another thing I loved about the film is that it's barely 80 minutes you know. I read so many negative reviews of this film but I must say the film is truly one of the better films I've seen in 2008. In 2010, when I'm watching 2008 films, I will still look back at this film and say Wow.<br /><br />If you liked War of the Worlds, there is no way you can dislike this. It doesn't even have that irritating little girl screaming her mouth off. It has rats running for shelter, it has bridges collapsing, it has fire, it has sky, F16s, honest believable humor and flirting skills, it has 6.42 AM and mineral water.<br /><br />I doubt I'll want to watch the ever so cheesy Transformer films again.
B0013FXWX8|5.0|Po, the roly poly clumsy panda, loves kung fu, but he needs energy, courage, and technique. His father, a goose, who makes and sells fabulous noodle soup, wants Po to continue in the family business, become a noodle nabob. By accident Po is named the Dragon Warrior. Kung fu master Shifu has to train Po to fight the evil leopard.<br />One of the most exciting and elaborate scenes in the movie is the one where the evil snow leopard, Tai Lung, escapes from a prison where he is the only prisoner held captive by hundreds of guards. Later he defeats the Famous Five Kung Fu Warriors.<br />The art work with its insistence upon authentic detail and beauty is particularly noteworthy. Many moments on screen feel as if you are viewing exquisite and stunning paintings of old China. The animation is outstanding.<br />Some of the scenes are ripped right from the old short cartoon repertoire: someone is hurled a great distance into the sky. Seconds pass. No sign of the person. An apprehensive look into the sky. Then a double take as suddenly the person comes hurtling at great speed to a death-defying crash.<br />There are elaborate kung fu fight scenes. The training scenes are great. At one point a low blow causes Po to be hit in \\"his tenders.\\"<br />Po, a loser, learns that the secret ingredient in life is motivation, will power, and belief in oneself. The journey Po takes from laughing stock to super hero, is a frequent passage taken by anti-heroes in kids' movies.<br />The movie has an excellent website. It will tell you about all the famous actors whose voices and kung fu techniques were used.
0307387178|5.0|I anctually watched the movie prior to reading it. I would suggest reading the book first, then watching the movie. It goes into further depth and explains a lot of obscure parts of the movie in more detail. A lot of people have said some harsh things about Chris Mccandles in their reviews. I can relate to his story. In each generation, there are always a group of individuals who feel disenfranchised from our society.  Our culture has become morally corrupt, and that is why Chris did what he did. It's about true freedom, and separating ourselves from the socialistic aristocracy that our country is on it's way to becomming.  Without getting into a huge heated political debate, this is truly an American classic in nonfiction. Chris was a modern day Thorreau/Kerouac, it's a must read.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|This is definitely another masterpiece from Alanis. Very tasty and rich in sound exploration and beauty of words. For even non Alanis fans, you will love this album for the following stunning tracks: Giggling Again For No Reason, Straitjacket, Citizen of The Planet, Version of Violence. And from the bonus deluxe version: Orchid, Limbo No More, Madness, 20/20. I bet if all the Grammy's jury still have a normal brain and musical taste, this album definitely must be the 2009 Grammy Winner for Album of The Year. And this wide range of musical sound of this album should soar this album even more than one genre of music. \\"Citizen of The Planet\\" or \\"Version of Violence\\" could win in Rock category. \\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\" or \\"Not As We\\" could win in Pop category. And even \\"Straitjacket\\" could win in Electronic/Dance category. Wow!! Could be another great year for Alanis. Must a have album for sure!!!
B000B894AI|4.0|Solid read.....not an absolute page turner....but close.  More importantly if I had to put it down, it was easy to come back to.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|Great movie. This is an honest take on the innocence of our children and how it can be used against them. This happenes every day in every place in the world.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Harrison Fords does an outstanding job in this fourth (final?) episode of the series. This is a captivating film from start to finish. It won this viewer immediately with the breath-taking cinematography of the Nevada desert landscape. Also highly appealing were the teenagers driving down a lonely Nevada road, with the radio on full blast playing an Elvis tune. They challenged the lead car of an Army convoy to a race, little did anyone realize what was soon to transpire. At the checkpoint, the convoy soldiers murder the guards. Russian soldiers and their leader infiltrated a secret storage facility hidden in the Nevada desert. There, Indiana Jones and a former British MI6 agent were prisoners, forced to locate a treasure they had discovered about 15 years ago ... It turns out, the Russian leader Dr. Irina Spalko (played exquisitely by Cate Blanchett) was a scientist who was involved in mind research and needed the Crystal Skull which was purported to have secret powers. I loved the ingenious technique by which Indy found the chest which contained a mummy from Peru with a disfigured skull. It verified something of great importance to the Russian scientist ...<br /><br />Next, Indy is interrogated by the CIA for his association with the British Agent who turns out to be a spy working for the Soviets. The CIA pressures Marshall College to fire Indy who instead is given a leave of absence based on a deal made by the President of the college with the Board. On leave, Dr. Henry Jones Jr (Indiana Jones) plans to teach in the UK where he has connections. On his way out of town, he is tracked down by a rebellious teenager named Mutt who has a personal letter from someone very well known to Indy, a UK archeaolgist who disappeared on an excavation in Peru. I loved the fight scene in the cafe which was deviously initiated by Mutt to allude the Soviet Agents. Mutt needs Indy's help to locate the missing professor and Mutt's mother, both of whom disappeared while on search of the Crystal Skull ...<br /><br />Indiana Jones and Mutt fly to Peru where they dig through the tombs of Spanish Conquistadors to locate clues. The Soviet soldiers and Dr. Irina Spalko are hot on their tails. Naturally, Indy and Mutt free the professor and Mutt's mother from their captors. The jungle chase scenes and the Amazon River escape with the two falls, were particularly enjoyable. High accolades and loud praise to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who outdid themselves with a spectacular ending. The special effects and cinematography associated with the temple at Akator were inspirational. The ending was dynamic and jaw-dropping. This entire sequel was filled with superb creativity and amazing craftsmanship ...Erika Borsos [pepper flower]Crystal Skull ...<br /><br />Indiana Jones and Mutt fly to Peru where they dig through the tombs of Spanish Conquistadors to locate clues.

B00164DWEA|4.0|I went to see 'The Incredible Hulk' on opening day with high hopes! While I was not completely disappointed, I wasn't completely satisfied either. The story blows through the origin while the opening credits are on screen. I guess this was a good idea, as it will allow some of us not to completely write off the first Hulk film! I liked the first film to a point, but it was very far from the perfect incarnation I hoped for! The only problem with not spending more time with the origin is the filmmakers lose the opportunity to show the drama of the creature being born!....This was handled well in the first movie and it was one of it's strongest scenes.<br /><br />So, blowing past the origin we find Dr. Banner discovering ways not get excited or \\"Hulk Out\\"!. With on screen data of the last time he had a \\"Hulk' incident, Banner is far from home and the many people who want his power for evil. Ed Norton does a fine job as Banner and this is so important to these films! The need for a gifted captivating star to fill the screen when there is no action! Toby Maguire, Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr. have proven this!....along with great scripts and direction! Ed Norton and Liv Tyler have good chemistry and the tragic predicament they're in is heartfelt.<br /><br />The Hulk action looks awesome and the CGI works well. Although I didn't have a problem with the CGI in the first film except for the Hulk growing to ridiculous proportions! The Hulk doesn't do any 3 mile jumps in this film, but we do see some new signature moves missed in the last installment....I won't spoil them for any of you!......they are cool as........... H E L L !<br /><br />Over all this film is better than the first film, but I will consider this 'The Hulk 2' in my book. You would think not having the origin to take up screen time, they would be able to tell a thorough story, but the film seems to have a lot going on and time seems to be running out! I don't think the franchise has peaked yet and there is 'still' a great Hulk film to be made... now that they have started to repair the series, I hope they make a third installment, that can take the time to have a little fun with the character. Instead of the third film in a series being the worst all the time, it might be the best for a change! I rate this film 3 3/4 stars! ;-blk film to be made... now that they have started to repair the series, I hope they make a third installment, that can take the time to have a little fun with the character. Instead of the third film in a series being the worst all the time, it might be the best for a change! I rate this film 3 3/4 stars! ;-b
B0017APPSE|5.0|[[ASIN:B0017APPSE The Other Boleyn Girl [Blu-ray]]]    when i saw this in theaters a second time i knew this one would be great on blu-ray and i was right!!!!!! the picture is great the sound is great and the picture in picture exclusive is great. the graphics on the picture  in picture are outstanding, albeit its historical information but its awesome presentation and the info is really fascinating and the presentation of how the screen is shrunk on the left and info is displayed on the right
B00012FXB8|4.0|They just couldn't let there be a somewhat happy ending to Aliens! The third installment in the Alien series isn't as bad as some have said. This film starts out where 'Aliens' left off. The ship and crew are discovered and of course there is an unwelcomed visitor on board! Going back to a similar style of the first film where the action is sparse, but tension is high. I don't like to give too much away in my reviews, but if you have the patience to watch this film through, it's worth your time.<br /><br />Everyone has their opinions of sequels and the series could have stopped with the first film. It's pretty good as third installments go and could have been a fitting end to the series, but it's hard to keep a good monster down! The premise is interesting and the FX are good, but it does take some time to get going!.....when it does it's very good and the film has a very memorable ending!
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|It's taken me several months to get around to writing a review on this album b/c quite frankly it leaves me speechless.  Tracks 4 and 9 alone are worth the purchase price.  In some ways I wish this band would catch on and become a huge phenom b/c they deserve it, but in other, selfish ways I'd prefer they remain underground, as success often ruins bands like this with promises of mainstream acceptance.  Epica are a band of true integrity, both in their music and image.  I strongly recommend those new to Epica to seek out their limited DVD, We Will Take You With Us.  You will fall in love with the band instantly.  Back to The Divine Conspiracy:  this record is somewhat heavier and darker than previous outings, and slightly more progressive.  A little less classical influence, with more tinges of symphonic style black metal than before.  Just gorgeous music.  One can envision Simone Simons in full medieval gothic attire standing atop some misty Carpathian mountain belting her heart out w/ Mark and company positioned behind her snarling viciously as they feed a whirlwind of metal fervor swirling into the twilight sky.
B00007LTIC|5.0|well there are two things to be commenting on  the Album itself and the quality of the re-master  firstly whatever people say about what is \\"Progressive\\" or \\"art rock\\" or whatever any of that means(if anyone ever knew)  this is simply a Musical masterpiece  if you've never heard the album(which i doubt) there is one simple reason to go NOW and get it  \\"AWAKEN\\" the absolute Finest moment in recorded musical history  there's anpother great reason to get it  the rest of the songs.  Atlantic has re-mastered the yes collection and Going for the One   But the rhino version actually does it properly  the seperation of the instruments is back the depth of the recording is back  its as good as your going to get    ok the extra tracks  a mix of the \\"Paris sessions\\" and some studio run throughs  Ehh... nice to hear  but mostly forgetable  those that dont want to hear them can allways press stop at track 6 and for the rest of us it's a pleasant walk through some halfway decent Yes material  either way your not going to get sound reproduction of the original work done this well anywhere else  this may be Yes at their finest(and that is saying a mouthfull)  I love the fact that it came out during a time when most(if not all) popular music(not unlike today) was pretty much   Crap.Yes as allways waves the middle finger at mediocrity  and Yesfans forever love them for it.    Steve Howe might actually be God  well, at least Lord
0375842209|5.0|Personally, I thought the book was amazing.I finished it in about 4 days and I could never put it down until I fell asleep. I think this is one of his best books so far.... My grandma got me started in this book and i found the friendship of two people was amazing and how the girls story started it could be difficult at times and sometimes the narrator would reveal parts of the endings. The book also showed parts of the holocaust and how it all worked out in its own way... The ending was definitely sad... All I can really say is prepare for a lot of deaths in Germany... I highly recommend you to read this book besides young children because of the swearing I did not find one disappointing moment in this book and the way Mark wrote it made you feel like you where in Germany during the WWII and the characters are almost right there with you telling there story.
0452289963|4.0|well the fact that it's Eckhart Tolle  makes it automaticly of interest.  but the Fact that it's on Oprah's list of things to buy  negates that a bit .  somehow the two just don't fit for me  lol
0452289963|5.0|This book will open your eyes, help you to relax, and awaken your consciousness!  I will read it many times!
B0000264WB|5.0|there are several versions  Re-mixes/Re-masters out there  this is the best version  if you want LA Woman on Cd get this one!!!
B0015UXNIU|5.0|I'll make it very short and sweet.      This is his best book so far.  If you never read his work start with this one (Although 'santaland diaries' from Barrel Fever is one of the funniest thing I've read).
B0016AJU2C|5.0|After 4 years of absence, Alanis returns with a surprisingly good album.  I have been waiting for this album to come out since last September.  I have to say that i'm impressed with 'Flavors'.  Alanis tackles a new sound with the help of Guy Sigsworth (responsible for Madonna's 'What it feels like for a Girl').  Despite the new sound like in 'Straitjacket', Alanis still retains her classic style such as on 'Not as We'.  These songs are filled with raw emotion and personal lyrics that makes it easy to relate to them.  There are also some songs that may relate to her breakup from Ryan Reynolds.  For example, Moratorium tells of Alanis' desire to take a break from relationships (\\"I've never known freedom from intertwining\\").  Songs such as Citizen of the Planet and Versions of Violence show a darkish sound similar to tracks on 'Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'.  There are also tracks that lean a little more towards the pop/dance genre (Giggling).  Alanis & Guy really experiment with different 'Flavors' to create this album and the songs really show this.  What's also great about this album is that there are bonus tracks which are just as good as the songs that made the final cut.  'Limbo No More' is very emotional while 'On The Tequila' is a fun catchy song.  Also check out '20/20', another bonus found on the 'Underneath' cd-single.  It has a similar message as 'Moratorium'.  Overall, this album is great.  I can't stop listening to it.  I highly recommend this to fans and new listeners.  'Flavors' has a fresh sound and much different from the last two albums.  Her past albums still influence this album which makes it even better.  Good job Alanis!    Key Tracks: Citizen of the Planet, Underneath, Straitjacket, Not As We, Moratorium, Giggling, Tapes, Incomplete, Limbo No More, Orchid
0743486285|5.0|Like many others who read this book (I think), I read and enjoyed the Dirt very much.  But first I have to say that I'm a bass player who is a Crue fan, so maybe I am bias.         This book reveals the life of Nikki's worst year (which ironically was also his most musically successful time) during which he literally killed himself with Heroin.  This book told many things that I never know before.  It is different from the Dirt that it's so depressive I can't stop reading it.    PS:  This one and the Dirt get 5 stars from me but Tommyland is kinda lame really(The Dirt told Tommy's story better that Tommyland did for me).
B000YAA68C|5.0|I simply ADORE this movie!  The fight that begins the film is what I label the perfect fight.  Holly is upset, Gerry doesn't know why, they get into an argument where both sides are coming from completely different directions with Gerry attempting to subvert Holly's anger with humor.  Which, of course as most women know, only makes her more upset.  They end up slamming doors then re-emerging to affirm how much they love each other and acknowledge the problems they have.  The most shocking part of the movie is in the next scene where Holly, her mother, sister, and friends are all at Gerry's wake.<br /><br />3 of my friends went with me to see this movie on New Year's Day and we all cried through the whole film.  When we walked out of the theatre, we had plans to immediately drive to the airport and book tickets for Ireland.<br /><br />First of all, being the red-blooded female that I am, Gerard Butler's character Gerry and his charming Irish accent and wonderful, sexy, sweet personality is enough to keep me interested for the 2 hours this film takes.  Second, being a fan of Grey's Anatomy, I couldn't help loving the naked rear view of Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his own charming Irish character.<br /><br />But mostly what is to be loved about this film is the love Gerry had for Holly, so strong and so pure that, knowing he would die, he crafted a plan to keep Holly's life going for a year until she was able to move on on her own.  Unselfish, everlasting love.  Every couple fights, and none of them are perfect, every relationship has stresses and issues.  But, as the movie reveals, they were in love from the moment they set eyes on each other.  A love that never ended after they found the kiss that would \\"end the world as they knew it forever.\\"  A love that wanted her to find love again and tried to make her view herself through his eyes - not seeing her flaws but the reasons for his devotion and why he wanted her life to be full for as long as she continued to be alive.<br /><br />And, it's a comfort to know we don't lose Gerard Butler but continue to see clips of him throughout the film - Holly's memories played across the screen as she tries to move on with a life she felt hadn't started yet and now no longer includes the man she kept trying to start it with.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting as well.  I think Hilary Swank was very believable and her supporting cast of characters were dynamic enough to give the film the impression of a real life and what happens as lives move on and tragedies happen.  The plot was engaging throughout - I found myself anticipating Gerry's letters just as much as Holly and grieving along with her just as though I had lost my perfect, caring, charismatic soulmate too.<br /><br />And I felt hope.  So many movies come along telling us stories of soulmates and second chances and following our hearts.  Some may call it clich&eacute;d and overdone to the point of exhaustion.  But I say there are real-life examples of these fairytale movies, and exemplary examples such as P.S. I Love You need to be made to remind us of the hopes and emotions we experience in our everyday lives - hopes that shouldn't be abandoned because we are told to be \\"realistic\\" and settle for something less than we deserve.  True happiness is to be achieved by continuing our dreams, there is a reason why different people are drawn to different things.  These types of movies - disgustingly called \\"Chick flicks\\" - don't bring false hope, they bring out what we already feel inside and keep us motivated for the time it takes for us to figure out and pursue what we need in our lives.<br /><br />This movie is sad, heartbreaking at points, but also humerous, engaging, sexy, romantic, hopeful, and realistic!  Holly can be stubborn, awkward, shy, dorky - and she's all the more human for the range of emotions and setbacks she goes through.  It's a movie of growth not just for Holly but for her family and friends as well.  People would do well towatch not for a gush of sentimentality and cathartic tears, but as a reminder of our flaws, our feelings and our dreams.<br /><br />Oh, and the music is GREAT!  I bought the soundtrack just for \\"Love You Till the End\\" by the Pogues and ended up loving several other songs.  The Irish \\"If I Leave this World Alive\\" and the first track \\"Everything We Had\\" AND the last track \\"My Sweet Song\\" are lovely!  I have some new favorite music to compliment my classic 60's and 70's songs, alternative, Indie, rock, selective pop, etc.but as a reminder of our flaws, our feelings and our dreams.

B00005JO20|3.0|I won't rehash territory discussed by others.  The film is visually exciting, well-orchestrated, and worth watching--a good action-adventure.  The good points are otherwise well-covered in other reviews here.  The main point that really detracts from the film overall is the lack of coherency on the famed mysterious island.  Apparently one of those territories that breed oversized and/or mutated animals, such as the radioactive waters from which the Japanese Godzilla emerged, director Jackson has no issues with mixing species and time periods on his dark island, where he has oversized centipedes cohabiting the island alongside Jurassic Park veterans (T-Rexes and so forth), while Kong of course is just a giant modern day gorilla.  Why are there no other giant gorillas on the island (where's mom and dad, brother and sister?), why, for that matter, are there no other giant JUNGLE creatures, of any form, and instead, why is the island pretty well populated with all kinds of familiar DINOSAURS?!  And, of all the choices of animals to bring back to \\"civilization\\", where choices include a host of these millions of years long dead dinosaurs, giant insects, never-before-seen fish, etc.--why did they choose to bring back a rather mundane, albeit giant, gorilla, of all choices?  If Jackson had established some sort of believability of his island inhabitants, we would not have had these problems.  He could have had one really big gorilla, amongst maybe some others of large but not gigantic stature, and thus, we could have seen why the island natives worshipped/feared Kong and none of the other animals (such as the equally fearful T-Rexes).  By succumbing to big scene excitement (eye-candy--hold the sensibility), while ignoring any kind of believability issues, he reduced his chances at creating a truly magnificent movie, and ended up creating just one more in a long line of action adventures, where you are forced to leave your brains at home, and as a result, ends up not being high on the list of movies to see again.  It didn't have to be this way--King Kong \\"coulda, shoulda\\" been better--why not an exciting movie that actually makes sense as well?
B0010358D0|5.0|Appleseed Ex-Machina is certainly a step up from the first Appleseed. The visual effects are superb and the action sequences are terrific. However, the story line is a little weak and the love triangle was not resolved satisfactorily. All in all, Ex Machina is as solid as any live action movie.
B000W4KT6E|4.0|It is good to remember the Band Stand days...<br />It isn't a [[ASIN:B0000AM6IY West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)]]!<br />We were young and so was the new music.<br />This movie like [[ASIN:B00006B1HH Grease]] talks to the 60's<br />when rock and roll was the swing.<br />Some people have tried to roll back the clock<br />and turn back time, but these songs and<br />performances show that isn't really possible.<br />A happy, funny and human movie that is right on time.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|I bought this video sight-unseen, based solely on its producers but I discovered it to be extremely well written on its own account. The acting is at times brilliant. The production values are moderate but overall this is a very excellent series.
B000AXWV40|5.0|Funkadelic-Maggot Brain *****<br /><br />Funkadelic's Maggot Brain is one of the most rewarding albums in my entire musical library, and I have a very big and vast library. Rewarding in the since that I have taken more away from this album than just about any other. As a musician any Parliament or Funkadelic, or any funk album in general is going to test your skill and this is no exception. Being a guitar player, hearing Eddie Hazel play is a lesson every time, and upon each listen my mind is blown. The title track, 'Wars Of Armageddon' and 'Super Stupid' are among some of the very best guitar playing I have ever heard. The rest of the group as well from the signature bass to the great percussion this great.<br /><br />As a musical fan this is a rewarding album on that front as well. Songs like the elegant title track still give me chills. And what is great about anything with George Clinton is that like his hero Sly Stone all his funk is fun but contains and important social message. 'Can You Get To That' is loose and a great comment of the economy. But aside from the funk 'Super Stupid' is just one example of how Funkadelic was versatile, this is one of the very first heavy metal tracks recorded. With one listen to that track and you'll be able to see where Lenny Kravitz got his funk.<br /><br />For me Funkadelic was always a favorite over it's counter part Parliament, while I love them both, Funkadelic always was more free with their musical endeavors, where Parliament was pigeon holed with one genre, and Maggot Brain is the best example of this, even more so than [[ASIN:B000069CLB One Nation Under a Groove]].  Maggot Brain is a rewarding album on so many levels that I feel no musical collection is complete without it, which I feel okay saying because this has something that would fill a whole in any genre's collection.
B00004VVND|5.0|Yul Brynner is relentless as the western gunshooter robot gone out of control.  Great sci-fi type movie for all ages.
B00164DWEA|4.0|It's a nice tradeoff. While Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" was more character-driven, Louis Leterrier's \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is an action spectacle, taken straight from the pages of a Marvel comic book. What fun, a movie so free with its implausible material yet not so over-the-top as to seem ridiculous. The entire concept is essentially a reworked version of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" with mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner transforming into a monstrous green giant every time he gets angry. We pity him more than we fear him, even when he tosses cars through the air and punches out entire walls and aims deafening screams to the sky; his rage is not only uncontrollable, it's literally devastating. The Hulk may not be the most substantive character, and Banner is certainly not original as far as comic book scientists go, but they work nicely nonetheless, especially in a story this entertaining.    Taking the reigns from Eric Bana is Edward Norton, who convincingly plays Banner as a driven man with many regrets in life, most of which stem from his altered genetic structure and his failure to control them. He's introduced in the Brazilian City of God, by day working in a soda-bottling factory, by night secretly communicating with an American scientist via e-mail. Known only as Mr. Blue, he sends Banner a number of things to help him find a cure for his rage. All appear to have failed, which is why he's being taught to manage his anger with deep-breathing exercises, the kind that push all your strong emotions into your stomach. He's always mindful of his pulse, because if it gets too high, he can no longer control himself. It isn't long before the American government finally locates him; they send a military team led by General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), now obsessed with extracting Banner's rage and creating an invincible super army.    Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler), eventually reunites with Banner, who had made his way from Guatemala to the state of Virginia in just seventeen days. Betty hasn't spoken to her father in a couple of years, which is understandable given his plan to use Banner's curse as a military weapon. We want to believe that there's some ounce of humanity left in this man, some remnant of awareness that what he's doing is wrong. Maybe there is, although his cold expression and distant voice make it difficult to say for sure; he may look as sinister as a classic power-hungry comic book villain, but I suspect that there's a decent person lurking somewhere underneath. It's possible that Betty suspects this too, because for better or worse, he will always be her father.    It doesn't seem as if anything good can be found in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), assigned to Ross' team for his military expertise. After encountering the Hulk in Brazil, Blonsky subjects himself to genetic experimentation, which is designed to increase strength and agility. Of course, it also amplifies aggression, and this is bad because he was a hothead to begin with. He and Ross track Banner to New York City, where genetic scientist Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) may be able to cure Banner's rage. Unfortunately, Sterns is a little too ambitious for his own good, and much like Ross, he too is seduced by the idea of creating unstoppable super humans. He gives Blonsky a dose of Banner's special gene, which essentially unleashes a creature even more dangerous than the dreaded Hulk. A monstrous confrontation is imminent at this point, one that invariably sees the stylistic destruction of roads, cars, and buildings.    And why not? I expect nothing less in a film about the Incredible Hulk, a character that functions purely on instinct, not on logic or reason. He doesn't want to save the day--he just wants to smash things. Only in a comic book adaptation would the American government want to harness and duplicate this destructive power, especially if it will earn them some respect. Does this mean that \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is a social commentary? Probably not, although I did consider the idea that breeding an army of Hulks and using them as protection is akin to slavery. In all likelihood, this movie exists purely as escapist entertainment.    You know this is true when you reach the ending, which cleverly combines \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" with another comic book franchise. You'll have to see for yourself which one it is; I suspect this merging will please a lot of movie audiences, mostly because two strong storylines will soon be working together. Be that as it may, there are plenty of other reasons to see \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" not the least of which is Edward Norton's fine performance as the determined yet vulnerable Bruce Banner. You can't really say much about his angry alter ego, considering he's a nothing but a computer-generated green behemoth that destroys things (while managing to keep his pants on). We obviously feel very sorry for him, a man who can't be with the woman he loves, can't go anywhere without being chased, and can't escape his own anger. The movie doesn't explore this too deeply, but the special effects and fight sequences more than make up for it.
B000OV170W|5.0|This was a wonderful book about a 13 year old girl who who wants to become an emancipated minor because she does not want to be a donor for her dying sister anymore. It gives you the perspective of all members of this family and the lawyers involved.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|What can I say about this? I had a copy of this and it became damaged. I had to replace it because I loved it so much. Ray Charles was one of the greatest of all times, and these duets are priceless. Love it!!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield was brilliant from its first untitled trailer to its theatrical release. I might have written the end somewhat different but overall, this was a very exceptional effort. J.J. Abrams did a remarkable job.
0385339682|4.0|I thought this story of the little Southern town; its small town newspaper owner and its citizens was just a super read. I enjoyed the world of Willie as he became more known by the folks of this Mississippi hamlet. Mr. Crisham did an excellent jobe of developing his character in such a way that I couldn't help but read page after page wondering what adventure he would stumble into. Without hesitation I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B00003CXRM|5.0|A good comidy movie. Setting is during the depression days and more than enough miss haps occur to this prisoner escape-es. Good bluegrass style music completes this enjoyable story as they escape one problem just to land into another.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This has got to be one of the most boring movies ever made. It took WAY too long to get to the point. The only reason I'm posting this now is just to make sure people do not base the 2nd movie off of thier opinions of the first. The new Hulk is 1000 times better. Go see it! I have had to tell at least a dozen people that it was actually good and not half as sucky as the first. My advice: Skip this one, and go staight to the movies and watch the second.
1582701903|1.0|There have been huge licenses taken with the original book. Laying the two side by side, you can see that very little of the original has been retained. While the message is similar, it is really a rip-off of the original.
B000ESST6U|2.0|Giulio Cesare is not these days all that much of a rarity.  So let's start by passing over in silence those noble early productions with bass and baritone Caesars who, however talented, were pitch inappropriate, and rarely capable of the florid work.  The Caesar question then reduces to mezzo or countertenor.  I greatly prefer the latter and since there are today many countertenors who perform the role, I am always saddened when conductors cast women.  Even among female Caesars, Connolly is not really first-rate.  If you require a woman, Janet Baker's magisterial performance is still available. The real problem with any production, however, is rarely the Caesar.  The opera, after all, belongs to Cleopatra, and this is where the Glyndebourne production sinks to the bottom of the heap.  Daniele de Niese is extraordinarily attractive, and her passage work is adequate.  But Cleopatra is not primarily a sex kitten; if she were we would have not respect for Caesar's infatuation.  She is a woman of real depth, and here the test is her seduction scene with its ravishing (and fantastically difficult) \\"V'adora pupille.\\"  De Niese here embarrasses.  She cannot begin to negotiate the leaps in the vocal line, and as a result loses any hint of legato, let alone sensuality.  I still await the perfect performance of this aria, while maintaining an idiosyncratic fondness for Valerie Masterson, Baker's Cleopatra, whose G&S origins may have helped her to be alluring even while singing softly.  In any case De Niese's version is one of the worse, and she wisely does not include it on her recent Handel disk.  Do not get me wrong.  I adore Christie, and he works his orchestral magic here as fully as elsewhere.  But we all know that the Brits love their Glyndebourne.  Beware then: this is a dreary performance, the kind that makes people hate Handel.  Those who need a performance in modern sound should go to the Minkowski cds or one of the (less luminously recorded) DVDs.  The rest of us will have to cobble together our perfect performance from bits and pieces of the many great recordings that already exist.
B0012Q732O|5.0|My eight year old twins loved this movie and so did I. It had a complicated plot, interesting characters, and exciting special effects. The person who thought the cave men should communicate in grunts knows nothing about history or language. How many movies are filmed in Colonial English, Southern English, Olde Englishe, Celtic, Irish, Latin or any of the languages actually used by historic peoples? If they didn't speak American no one could understand the movie. That would make it French and no one would have gone to it. This wasn't the History Channel: it was fiction! It was fun and entertaining and I'm buying the DVD.  My kids can't wait to watch it again.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|It's Gilmore Girls which means it's intelligently written, quick witted, and a test to your pop culture knowledge.  A study of mother/daughter relationships and a great one at that.  I would recommend all Gilmore Girls DVD's.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This film takes the boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and lives happily ever after and sets it all on its ear. The formula here is girl lives happily with boy until he's taken from her by brain cancer, whereupon she loses herself. The satisfying ending comes only when his letters, written before his death to guide her recovery, help her wade her way through their past to find her future. It's clever, funny and fresh (if you can take the leap of faith and go with it), and the cast is excellent.    Unfortunately, the extras are lacking. The most interesting to me is the deleted scene at the travel agency, the only time we see the hero while he's dying, but with his sense of humor still very much alive.    If you're in the mood to laugh a lot through a few tears, this movie is perfect for you.
055358202X|1.0|The George RR Martin Books have been great so far.  Each book is close to 1000 pages.  They're medieval fantasy, but there are no elves, dwarves, healing spells... etc.  If someone dies, they're dead.  Characters even die from infections in these books.    The Chapters in the books are all named after Characters.  Each Chapter is written in the Point of View of the named character.  So, you'll see that there are two sides to every conflict.  You also get to see what motivates the characters and why they behave the way that they do.  The books are full of political intrigue and action.  They're unique in their own way and usually pretty exciting.    With that said, this book stays consistent with the story.  The previous book, A Storm of Swords, ends with a lot of cliffhangers.  This book answers none of the major cliffhangers and talks about the minor characters.  It's 1000 pages devoted to the characters that aren't involved in the cliffhangers.  It drags on and on and the whole time you're waiting to hear about the exciting stuff from the previous book.    This book is like a Star Wars Movie about Greedo, Admiral Akbar, Sandperson #42, and that Blue Jedi Chick that got punked in the last movie.  You'd be asking yourself where are Luke, Leia, Darth Anybody?!  You'd even settle for some C3-PO.  But you don't get any of that.      At the end of the book, George RR Martin apologizes and says that he wrote too much.  He says that the next book will deal with the cliffhangers.  If the next book doesn't answer these, I'm done with the series.    In 'A Storm of Swords', the major cliffhangers dealt with Jon Snow, Arya, Dani, and Tyrion.  Jon, Tyrion, and Dani aren't even in this book and Arya makes a cameo appearance.  Instead this book is about Jamie, Cersi, Brienne, Sansa, and George RR Martin introduces a bunch of new characters when it feels like he already has way too many.    You can skim this book, or skip it if you want.  I'd recommend waiting for the next book, ADance with Dragons, to come out and see if the series is still worth reading.
1582701709|5.0|I found this book to be life-changing.  I so wish I had read it when I was in high school.  What a different world this would be if we started teaching this to our youth!  It has become my favorite gift to give to others.  What a fast read, too.
B001AYENBM|5.0|I saw the theatre version when it came out, and since I have a thing for end-of-the-world type movies I loved \\"I Am Legend\\" until the end. If you haven't seen it yet I won't say, except I hated the ending.    This version is exactly the same as the theatre version except with a different, more hopeful ending to it.     This alternate version has a totally different ending to the movie and it is stars above the theatre version. The ending was perfect and left a good feeling after the movie. The theatre version left a bad taste, the ending really sucked for a movie that had been good up until the ending.     I recommend this version of movie. If you haven't seen it yet, try this version first, leave the theatre version alone.       [[ASIN:B001AYENBM I Am Legend (Alternate Version)]]
0316067601|5.0|This was wonderful read i would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good war book.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|This movie shows the \\"corporate\\" depravity that exist in so many people.  Putting money over all other things never leads to a good end.  Overall, I admit that I liked the film.  It should have ended about 15 minutes sooner and it would have been EXCELLENT.  However, due to that final 15 minute RANT, I can only give the film 3 stars.  The ending was unneeded in an otherwise fine film.  Lewis does an extraordinary job in his performance, but we even tire of watching his lunacy by the end.  Just a RENTAL...nothing more.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|We bought this because we have the first two movies, but they were much better movies than this third one. Not sure I'd buy a fourth if/when they make it.
1416914293|5.0|This book is an incredibly good sequel. It's a total page turner. I couldn't put it down. I read it in a day and a half. VERY good book. I can hardly wait for book three. A total must read. Go out and get it!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Pros:  All ten seasons with unedited episodes.    Cons:  The discs contain different artwork on the front of each DVD and DO NOT say what season they are.  A permanent marker can fix this though.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Sorry, my fault. i cracked the dvd trying to get it out of the case!
B0013V33DG|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful productions of \\"La Fille\\" that I have seen.  The 5.1 or DTS sound is fantastic.  A must have for any opera lover and if you have never heard \\"La Fille\\", you will be amazed at the beauty of this comic opera.  Light hearted and whimiscal, yet the music is stunning.      Dussay and Flores deliver flawless performances.  No that Pavarotti is gone, Flores may be the new \\"king of the high C\\".  His performance of the aria \\"Ah Mes Amis\\" is one of the best I've ever heard.  You will want to stand up and cheer after hearing it.      Buy it.
1430300612|5.0|This book has been an amazing gift for me. I am an RN and I care for my Mother,who has had some left-sided brain damage. Each day some little tidbit from this book helps me to not only understand her but also myself. Thank you Dr. Jill .
0618918248|5.0|Hey whats up folks? This book is for me one of the most well thought arguments on behalf of atheism that I have come across. His argumants are sharply laid out, I kept getting the feeling that as an agnostic that I was a perfect target for his words. Meaning that he would present an argument as if he were leading me down a winding path with the only route of escape being the shedding of my belief in either god and/or organized religion. There was one problem and that is that after all is said and done no scientific theory is permanent, scientific knowledge is tentative meaning that as a rational minded person I could agree with him on the organized religion part but was not in any way able to follow him on the ultimate argument of god's non-existence. That being said do please pick up this book, whether you are a theist,an agnostic, or an atheist it will only make you a better person for hearing this brilliant man out.
B000002NJS|5.0|i didnt really think that i would enjoy this cd even though i really enjoyed \\"Ray of Light\\" as a song.  But i was seriously wrong and minus maybe one misstep on the cd the rest of \\"Ray of Light\\" is one of my favorite Madonna cds (at least of the 3 that i have so far).  Madonna really does her thing on this cd both writing and singing as well which in my opinion hasn't always been one of her strong suits.  Nothing against it though just something i've noticed before.<br /><br />But none of that is a problem this time around and its no wonder the cd has done so well.  It has a diverse, unique yet familiar sound that will draw folks to it and keep them there throughout.  So forget what you've though about her music in the past with Ray of Light, Madonna is making a statement with this one and its one that should be heard by any and everyone that enjoys music, period.  Its pop, electronica and a few other things mixed in creating one of my favorite albums of that time and now.
0786948523|1.0|Just a flat book of stats for the new board game they've created.  No ecology, no culture, no real details except how they fight.  Nothing that really helps with ROLE PLAYING.  ANNNNNNND...... my FAVORITE part....  they rehashed art from all the previous editions for at least 40% of the book!!  How dog gone lazy is that?  The emperor has no clothes folks!!!!  OPEN YOUR EYES!!!
0452289963|5.0|Well, I liked this book and think it could be helpful to a lot of people. To others, probably not.  I just don't believe there is one single path to finding/living a better life, whatever that means to an individual.   As for me, this way works and, what can I say? Tolle's writing rings true to me.    His take on how one can eventually release oneself from the egoic state of mind was nothing new for me, only because I had learned the same method in psychotherapy.  However, my therapist did not call it a means to enlghtenment, but a way to deal with problems by developing a heightened sense of self-awareness. And, for me, this works.    I'm much happier and don't get hung up on stressful issues as much. My relationships are healthier, and life is so much more than issues immediate to me.  The full realization of the latter has opened up a different path in life from whatever it was I was doing before.  I'll stop there because I sense some eyes rolling at this point.  Well, the point is, I feel good. And that can't be wrong, can it?  Try it. If it works for you, awesome, if not, keep trekkin until you find your truth.
630025075X|5.0|WHY is Amazon linking these reviews to something COMPLETELY different?!?!!?<br /><br />All of the reviews (That I've seen so far, I'm not looking at all 173) are NOT about the VHS \\"About Face\\" they are about his MUCH more recent acoustic performance DVD!!!<br /><br />Again...WHY? Are they that brain dead?!?! The About Face VHS is hands down THE #1 WHERE IS THE DVD candidate (see my list posted here on Amazon) there is!!!<br /><br />Originally filmed at The Hammersmith Odeon in 1985 on David's solo About Face tour I personally think it is superior to some Floyd!! He has an all-star band (Bad Company's Mick Ralphs on guitar and The Firm - AC/DC drummer Chris Slade) and Roy Harper and Nick Mason join him for one song each.<br /><br />With the exception of Run like Hell and Comfortably Numb this is all solo material and, sorry Waters fans, his 1st 2 solo albums BLOW AWAY Floyd's The Final Cut and ANY Waters solo release. And I would put \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\", \\"Short and Sweet\\" (the Roy Harper song) and \\"Murder\\" up against all but the absolute cream of Floyd material.<br /><br />I like it so much I bought the PAL import DVD but would LOVE a re-mastered and re-mixed domestic release!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|i love this one from Radiohead.  Its been awhile since this was released but i've only got into Radiohead after i purchased their latest \\"In Rainbows\\" and decided to check this out.  It's everything that's in their current release and then some.  It goes without saying that its one of the few cds that i can listen to from beginning to end without skipping over a song or losing interest in the cd midway through.<br /><br />They have a way of bringing out the music without all the unnecessary distractions and things that doom other cds while in production.  It's subtle yet forceful and energy filled as well.  I could go on and on about \\"OK Computer\\" but most of it has already been said by other folks many times over.  So i'll just end this by saying that Radiohead has a new fan in me..all because of this cd.
B00005JPLW|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I actually watched it two times in a row...back to back.  The effects in it make it like a live action comic book.  The fight sequences are fun and the dudes are all diesel.  It makes me want to work out and get ripped up.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I was first a little skeptical of this movie before watching it because it only had 2 stars. However, this is a great feel good movie! I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see it! Not only does it have great romance it also has a wonderful element of friendship which I admire.<br />I highly recommend this movie!
