B007FJFDXS|1.0|Even when I stop 2 spots away and remove my finger, the block still rolls off the edge. Not worth the download, even free!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Very unique game concept....enjoyed it. Didnt much care for the music but oh well....worth the money. Would like more to play.
0307352145|5.0|Such an empowering book. I know the introverts of the world would be encouraged by her stories and research, told in an engaging way. But more importantly, my sanguine and extroverted friends might give the other half of the population more credence if they too would read it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Phenomenal book!! The characters are great and the heated passion is awesome. Definitely on the top ten list. I recommend this book to everyone who likes mystery, lust, and allure.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Yes, there are a lot of pages.  Yes, you know the ending.  But the process is fascinating, the new information is done superbly, and the pace never falters.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a compelling series. Great watching experience. Watched the entire season in 3 days. I look forward to season 2.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've bought this game on the Wii, the Google App Store and I grabbed it on Christmas day when Amazon was giving it away for free (I guess you can't have too many copies!)<br /><br />This game is fun for all ages. It's a great puzzle game that you can play time and time again because 2D Boy developer's have implemented what they call OCD, Obsessive Completion Disorder, as a way to get you to play the levels again and try to do them perfectly (fewest goo balls used, quickest completion time, etc).<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that 2D Boy has said they aren't going to make a sequel.... booooooo :(
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Just as wonderful as I thought it would be. Saw many movies but never read the book. So glad I did.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|I watched this first episode out of curiosity because everyone is raving about Homeland and it won all the awards at the Emmy's. However, I wasn't that impressed and don't care to find out what happens next.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I for one thoroughly enjoyed Paranorman! It was a beautifully, animated movie from the minds of people who are gifted in their craft to bring us this spooky (kind of), funny, heart-warming comedy of the 2012 year. I loved Paranorman because it had a lot of good morals in it.<br /><br />1. Mob Mentality- We see this in every society, a group of people who have stopped actually \\"thinking\\" and decided to just play \\"follow the leader\\" when throughout history it has always lead to heartbreak, destruction, mayhem, violence, and other ignorant and primitive behavior.<br /><br />2. Killing of the Innocence- To not go into too much detail so that I do not spoil the movie, this movie showed the importance of thinking before one acts. As many spiritual ethics like Buddhism,teaches, to not act or speak when your heart is tainted or bitter. Also, to not judge so quickly with what you are afraid of. Many human beings unfortunately suffer from being afraid of \\"The Unknown\\" which gets them into a lot of trouble for their actions. Karma is real! The Golden Rule(s) apply to all! Just because you are afraid of something does not mean that you have to act violently, or primitively upon that situation. \\"One must think first before they act or speak\\"<br /><br />3. [[ASIN:B00AE2IJIE ParaNorman]]  I love this movie for all of its moral issues. I will not go into detail! I would rather have many more people watch this movie and enjoy it as I did and come away from it thinking for themselves more, because they have seen how horrid, and primitive their actions can become when one thinks that using fire against fire will work... it does not and it never will!<br /><br />A BIG AND HUGE THANK YOU!!!!! To everyone in the making of this film! I'm so happy you made this film and tackled some moral, and social issues that many people struggle to understand and are not exposed to all that often! Well done! I'm a huge fan of this movie! :D
B003QS9SGA|5.0|so funny with quick wit.Heath Ledger is great in this role and isn't acknowledged for it as much. I love this movie. And you won't regret seeing it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game for kids. My son loves it. I don't think he knows it, but it is a learning game. It make you think, and stratigize.
B0086700CM|5.0|I first tried this on my sisters phone and rushed to see if it was for the kindle. There it was. Temple run uses all of the functions of the kindle. Really addicting. Every kindle should have temple run pre loaded into it.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I ENJOYED THE  BOOK AS I AM A LAWYER AND IT WAS HARD TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN.  IT WAS MY FIRST KINDLE READING EXPERIENCE.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|The Dark Knight is a very good action movie with an great acting job by all the actors lead and support, but mind blowing scenes were all the stunts and things being blown up.  One scene actually got me to jump on it and takes lot for me to jump when comes to loudness of a movie or suspense triller so forth.  But almost everyone I do believe  has seen this movie and if you have yet to watch it you really owe it to yourself to watch this movie least once during your lifetime if you enjoy your action movies.  The movie itself seems a little long but well worth the money to watch it, roughly 2 hours and 30 minutes long.  Also all the great one liners from the Joker Character.  I am not much for super hero movies but this one is one of my favorite's because it has a great plotline and doesn't just focus on Batman the director gives film time to mutiple other characters to add to the storyline.  I have yet to watch The Dark Knight Rises but I will soon enough, then review that one also.  So basically if you love your super hero movies, lots of fight scenes and things blowing up so forth then pick this movie up sit back on a night off from work then watch it or with some pals.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This is definitely a downgrade from the last version for the Kindle Fire.  It takes much longer to get messages than before.  I hope the next version is better than this one.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|the cartoon illustrations and handwritten font are cute but i can't read this to my kid. i have to stop at every page and explain what a wimp is, why we would read about a wimp, why the wimp would get punched in the face, why the wimp would tell lies to other children in his class, etc. my kid is 4 and though i can appreciate the concept of reading about things that really could happen in real life, such as bullying, and general disappointment, i can't endorse the main character's somewhat dark humor and negative outlook on life.<br /><br />the book would be just as good if you changed the title to &#34;diary of a pre-school kid&#34; and gave the character a spine and some moral values in dealing with his daily disappointments. not every outcome has to be a positive or ideal one, but if at least 75% of them were, that would be a book i could read to my kid comfortably.
B000FC1GJW|4.0|But a bit lackluster with the ending like Is that all there is? Killing off of a lot of people and releasing the atoms of the dead to the world?
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Bought this movie for my 11 year old for Christmas.  I haven't seen it yet, but I will soon.  Thanks!

1846467640|4.0|as others have said these books are tiny--about the size of your palm--but not unlike other books for small children. it's a cute little set and my 3-yr old nephew loves them, has me read all six to him over and over and over....
B0056CUZRA|4.0|I like this novel for its historical detail. Recounting history through the eyes of individuals is very effective, but there's a bit too much bodice-ripping for my taste.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|The Muse boys are at this stage of their career where they can slap together anything and see them go up to the top of the charts and their world wide tours fully booked in minutes.  Unfortunately, this was exactly what they did on the 2nd Law.  It is a lazy effort by a phenomenal band.  There are two major weaknesses in it, as I see it.<br /><br />1. I can always find a few songs from each of Muse's previous albums that I can not help hitting \\"repeat\\" buttons.  The 2nd Law does not have such awe inspiring songs like \\"Hysteria,\\" \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" \\"Exogenesis\\" and etc.  Don't get me wrong.  The new album has some good tracks, but nothing in the caliber of those aforementioned.  I suspect that the boys will not be playing much from this album when touring in, say, 5 years and 2 more albums later.<br /><br />2. The last four tracks are really B-side materials at best.  The lead singer hands over his job to the bassist on two of them.  The final 2 are instrumental.  Again, they are hardly \\"Exogenesis\\" quality.<br /><br />I hope the boys regroup soon, rid themselves of Queen and put in more Muse in their next effort.  After all, going back 30 years plus to borrow from rock legends is hardly progress.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Loved the first season. Definitely not for kids, but well worth watching if you enjoy horror/suspense genre. Grabs you right away-there is no need to have to watch 2-3 episodes to get into it.
1609611543|5.0|I'm a guy. Typical American guy. 44 years old. 5'6\\" 245lbs. Always hungry. Always. I spent the last 25+ years eating fast food, processed frozen food, processed lunch meat, sandwiches, breaded everything, chips, and lots and lots of soda. The end result was not surprising, Diabetes. Pancreatitis that turned into Chronic Pancreatitis and has bothered me for 8 years. I've been hospitalized 4 times in the last 8 years for Pancreatitis, the first time for 9 days, 7 days not being allowed to eat or drink anything, including water. The flare ups became so painful that the only thing I could do was stop eating at home and take lots of painkillers while doing virtually nothing. I found that Soy Lecithin granules helped lower my triglycerides, and allowed me to \\"get by.\\" But I was miserable and always in pain.<br /><br />A friend suggested I look into the Wheat Belly book. I have tried several different \\"diets\\" in the last few years. But none of them worked for several reasons. I was always hungry, which would prompt me to go off the diet quickly, and they all wanted me to give up most of the \\"comfort foods\\" I was used to. Cut to the Wheat Belly book. I decided to try it and see what would happen. I skipped to the back of the book first and read what foods were recommended and what to avoid. There is a long list of specific foods, which makes following the plan much easier than other diet books I've read. Then as I started to feel better on the first day, I read the entire book. That first day I noticed an immediate change. I felt better, wasn't hungry in between meals, and had no cravings. I started the Wheat Belly plan on September 4th and as of late December, 2012 I have lost 31 lbs. More importantly than the weight loss is that I feel so much better. I've cut my insulin intake in half. My skin, which has had dermatitis for years, has started to clear up. I no longer have the \\"brain fog\\" in the middle of the afternoon that I thought was common, now I know what causes it, wheat. My joints feel better, I have far fewer headaches and less pain overall. My pancreas has finally started to calm down, with less and less pain as it heals. In short, if it works this well for me, a 44 year old single guy who never gave a second thought about what he ate and could never stick on a diet, it can work wonders for anyone.<br /><br />I use the word \\"plan\\" instead of \\"diet\\" because it's not really a diet. I can still make gluten-free versions of all the food I like if I want. Gluten-free pizza, sandwiches, etc. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything by going wheat-free. The other amazing thing is I have no cravings for food. I suddenly have willpower, but that's not accurate, it's that I can see a commercial or smell McDonald's or other foods I used to go crazy for and have no desire at all to eat them. Now I think of how miserable those foods used to make me and instead pass. My friends couldn't believe it the first few weeks. Again, just try it. And be aware that besides reading labels to look for wheat, gluten, other grains and foods that can be contaminated by wheat - like oats, for example (they grow next to wheat in many fields and are processed on the same machinery as wheat, so they are contaminated unless they specifically say Gluten Free), I also avoid dextrose and maltodextrin. Both are starches added to foods. Dextrose is normally made from corn, but can be made from wheat and it's not required to disclose which source they use on a label. If a label has dextrose on it and it says Gluten Free, then it's safe to eat because the dextrose is made from corn. If it doesn't say Gluten Free, I skip it. Not worth the risk. Maltodextrin can be made from corn, wheat, or rice, and again, the labels do not state which source they used, so just avoid it.<br /><br />It may seem like there are very few foods at first you can eat when you're used to buying anything in a grocery store, but there are still so many foods that are gluten-free.<br /><br/>A few typical meals/foods I make to give you an idea:<br /><br />Chicken (or beef, pork, etc.)<br />veggie<br />small salad or piece of fruit<br /><br />Sometimes instead of a veggie I will have some beans, and usually add one spoonful of salsa to the beans for flavor.<br /><br />Eggs, either scrambled or an omelet<br /><br />A sandwich on gluten-free bread (I prefer Udi's, but any gluten-free bread or dough, etc. should not be eaten all day long because it still can spike your blood sugar)<br />small serving of Lays potato chips<br /><br />Gluten-free pancakes or waffles<br /><br />Hard boiled eggs<br /><br />Peanut Butter - either on gluten-free bread or in a bowl with veggies to dip<br /><br />A spoonful of PB is a nice brain food snack if my energy is dropping<br /><br />Raw almonds<br /><br />High cacao chocolate (85% or more cacao) - sometimes I dip in in PB for a sort of homemade PB cup<br /><br />Gluten-free homemade pizza (I love Udi's frozen pizza crusts) - tip - grate your own cheese, it has so much more flavor than bagged, shredded cheese<br /><br />Fruit/Veggies at will (I generally limit to 1 piece of fruit per day because of my diabetes)<br /><br />Homemade chili with ground beef, beans, onions, spices, and some freshly grated cheese on top.<br /><br />Salad, sometimes as a main meal with some grilled chicken or beans as additional protein<br /><br />Homemade chicken noodle soup. I use a quinoa noodle, it's delicious.<br /><br />And many more items. Make your own burgers, or have the occasional hot dog or sausage on a gluten-free bun.<br /><br />I love to take a few small gold yukon potatoes, cut them into chunks, microwave them for about 4 minutes and then put them in a skillet with a little extra light olive oil, turning them for about 10 minutes until golden brown, a great side dish for anything (microwaving them for a few minutes speeds up the skillet time by a lot)<br /><br />There really isn't anything I've given up. I do not feel like I am on a diet at all. I feel better and am losing weight, and my blood sugar is doing much better as well. I'm down to 214 lbs and continue to lose 1-3 lbs a week. Most weeks are 1-2 lbs. Occasionally I'll get a week where I do not lose any weight, but the next week I usually lose 2-3 lbs. But even if you do not need to lose weight, or only want to shed a few pounds, the benefits of going wheat-free far outweigh simply losing weight. The weight loss is a plus. It's how much better you'll feel (and look) that is most important.<br /><br />Update: February, 2014. Still going strong. This is a simple plan to follow. Just avoid all of the packaged gluten free junk food that has come out in the last year or two. It might be gluten free but that doesn't mean it's healthy./>A few typical meals/foods I make to give you an idea:<br /><br />Chicken (or beef, pork, etc.)<br />veggie<br />small salad or piece of fruit<br /><br />Sometimes instead of a veggie I will have some beans, and usually add one spoonful of salsa to the beans for flavor.<br /><br />Eggs, either scrambled or an omelet<br /><br />A sandwich on gluten-free bread (I prefer Udi's, but any gluten-free bread or dough, etc. should not be eaten all day long because it still can spike your blood sugar)<br />small serving of Lays potato chips<br /><br />Gluten-free pancakes or waffles<br /><br />Hard boiled eggs<br /><br />Peanut Butter - either on gluten-free bread or in a bowl with veggies to dip<br /><br />A spoonful of PB is a nice brain food snack if my energy is dropping<br /><br />Raw almonds<br /><br />High cacao chocolate (85% or more cacao) - sometimes I dip in in PB for a sort of homemade PB cup<br /><br />Gluten-free homemade pizza (I love Udi's frozen pizza crusts) - tip - grate your own cheese, it has so much more flavor than bagged, shredded cheese<br /><br />Fruit/Veggies at will (I generally limit to 1 piece of fruit per day because of my diabetes)<br /><br />Homemade chili with ground beef, beans, onions, spices, and some freshly grated cheese on top.<br /><br />Salad, sometimes as a main meal with some grilled chicken or beans as additional protein<br /><br />Homemade chicken noodle soup.

B00361CAEE|4.0|In Grace Coddington's autobiography Grace: A Memoir, Grace indicates that Anna Wintour was not wholly amused by the movie The Devil Wears Prada (Full Screen Edition) and how it portrayed her. Although Grace tells us that Anna Wintour and her daughter did have the sense of humor to wear Prada when they went to see the movie.<br /><br />In this documentary THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE, we see Wintour as how she wants us to view her and her team at VOGUE magazine producing their largest and most important issue. We also see Wintour at home with her daughter, riding to work, attending fetes, traveling to Paris and visiting designers. We see her interacting with top designers and photographers. It is a delightful look at that world.<br /><br />However, you may come away with the sense that VOGUE is not a very joyous place to work. One would hope in such a creative field as fashion and publishing, there would be the joy of creating something beautiful, original and fresh. Everyone seems somewhat unhappy, including Wintour, except when they are away from the office and at the fashion shows or at a shoot. That's where the fun seems to be.<br /><br />It would seem that one could have more joy in their work, meet deadlines and produce beautiful pages. These aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, the best business minds say creativity flourishes in a positive, supportive culture.<br /><br />Wintour says in this film she will probably quit when she gets too angry, quoting her father's reason for leaving his publishing work. You sense Wintour isn't warm partly because she is in a culture where it is seen as a weakness and you can be taken down for it. Who can find fault with a perfect mask?<br /><br />That's what came across to me in this film--you'll enjoy coming to your own conclusions. Bravo to Wintour, her team and Vogue for allowing us to look at their world. It seemed everyone was told to be themselves and show the good, the bad and the beautiful. The film did make me want to peruse the magazine more. I wanted to understand what makes for a great fashion photo or spread? What are the principles for putting an issue together? While you will have some insights into this, the film didn't directly teach that. That would be enticing content for another documentary.he magazine more.

1400067820|3.0|His theory of the value of antifragility is important. Unfortunately, this book mixes that theory with so many digressions and off the cuff opinions that reading it becomes laborious. Taleb has not gotten to the essence of his own theory, so his presentation of it is convoluted and anecdotal. He needs to understand how his insight relates to  human nature in itself. Only then will he be able to propose a comprehensive and coherent theory, which would be of real value to society.

But now the money has run out, and she has to either get a job for the first time in her life, or find a way to raise more money. She is contacted by the leader of a group who spends its time investigating famous murders, and he offers her money for coming to speak to the group. During the course of this first meeting she discovers that there are many people who believe her brother was falsely convicted of the crime.<br /><br />The story unfolds as Libby is forced to confront what really happened that day her family was murdered, and forces her to face her memories...did her mind play tricks on her, did social workers feed her false memories, did her brother really murder her mother and sisters?  Or was someone else in her home that day?  You will not be able to put this book down once you start.<br /><br />I love how Flynn doesn't sugar coat her characters, and even shows the many faults of her protagonists. Even though you don't like many characteristics of the protagonist, you still root for them to discover the truth.  Great book.
1863514201|5.0|I have yet to actually sew any of the projects in this book, but already so many of my questions about embroidery, particularly the long and short stitch, have been answered! I would not recommend this as someone's first embroidery book, as it does make a few assumptions on basic sewing skills, but this is a must for anyone who wants to embroider, even if all you ever do is embroidery kits from the craft store.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|You'll be happy to know there are some families more dysfunctional than your own, and this novel proves it. Thanks to Gillian Flynn she's created a family that would give Dr. Phil nightmares. The one thought that kept going through my mind while reading this book was how this main character could still be alive. She's recovering from self mutilation, she's a raging alcoholic, and she does drugs with her thirteen year old half sister....while she's drunk. Yikes. But if you had a family like hers, you'd probably be dead, and she's not. So what you get is a suburban Chicago reporter sent back to her hometown to report a story about who's killing little girls and pulling their teeth out. What she discovers in the process is the reason she was never truly loved by her mother, and how her beloved sister ended up dead many years before.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is because the conclusion is just too quickly told with not enough development. I find this to be true of all of Flynn's novels, having read them all in the past two weeks while on vacation. The stories are fascinating, but the conclusions get short shrift compared to the plot lines.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|Being an Architect I am partial to this movie and of coarse Gary Cooper was a perfect fit for his role. The amazing part is how true the movie was for it's time and even more so in today's day. Condemned by so many conformist and liberal press, it is amazing how true many of her theories have come true. Her popularity has sored more than ever. Personally I think her work should be a part of college or even high school curriculum and maybe the future of tomorrow may have a better chance. It far exceeds some of the garbage taught in universities today. Highly recommended movie for you old classic movie enthusist and for all people who believe in individualism and independent capitalism growth.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I guess you could say I like the unexpected, and this novel definitely delivered that for me. The story is told from several different characters' viewpoints so you get the experience you would get if you were watching a movie. I liked the style of this novel, and the theme of revenge was deliciously told. If you've ever been wronged and only dream of revenge, you can live vicariously through these characters' lives and relish how they achieved their own justice.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Love this lil guy! Sturdy as hell and well built. It's a bit difficult to use with an otter box on my iPad but it will get'er done for taking notes in class. Use it with the Notetaker HD app. Check it.
B009B0L324|4.0|I'll start right off the bat and say AC/DC Live Special Edition released in 1991 is my all time favorite AC/DC album, live or recorded, so of coarse this one here was not going to stand a chance of being the perfect 5 star album from AC/DC, but I still give it a 4 star rating. Like many AC/DC fans who collect bootlegs from the band, or have rare live tracks in our collections, it's going to be hard for AC/DC to top a lot of the #1 fav live versions between 1974 and present. But this album is still great for us collectors, even those who have heard these same set-lists a million times before, with a few of the new songs thrown in the mix, but this album has a lively crowed that may not speak English too well, but they do know how to scream and humm along to the tunes, making them unique crowed interaction versions of AC/DC's classics preformed at River Plate in 2009/10?<br /><br />I wont bore you and compare things like \\"TNT\\" just doesn't sound as good as the live version from 198somethign that was eventually included on \\"Backtracks\\" etc.. but I will say AC/DC have still got what it takes to rock your socks off as much as they did a 100 years ago. Kicking off with a great live recording of the new track \\"Rock N Roll Train\\" and into a classic blazing version of \\"Hell aint a bad place to be\\" and then onto what is possibly there biggest hit to date, \\"Back In Black\\" and so forth.<br /><br />Some reviewers here said if you have heard AC/DC's previous set lists before, then you have heard it all and they are boring. Well, you will miss out on great new live tracks such as \\"Rock N Roll Train\\", \\"Big Jack\\", \\"War Machine\\" and \\"Black Ice\\", even tho most of us fans really wished they had preformed other tracks from the Black Ice album like 'spoilin' for a fight' and \\"she likes rock n roll\\"... and then there is the typical songs of coarse... but what those guys saying it's all been the same, it surprises me AC/DC didn't take the chance to finally get an official live album version of \\"Rock N Roll aint Noise Pollution\\" down. What really would have been nice would have been a bonus track of \\"High Voltage\\" included that AC/DC subbed in during the Australian and New Zealand tour by popular demand. Just like they included \\"Hell aint a bad place to be\\" only on the Japan special edition of Live (1991). Oh well, what can you do?<br /><br />Something else that makes this album different to other ones is that this whole tour, AC/DC tuned the guitars downwards a step, giving the songs a new spark of life in a same old song, but with a slightly different sound to what you have always heard. It also seems like Brian Johnson speaks his words more clearly, not sure what, maybe he was schooled on it or the effect of living in American now has rubbed off, but you can clearly understand every word he says and is singing, and there is no question by anyone like \\"WTF is he saying?\\" not that I ever had trouble understanding him. A few songs spark a little new life to by the way Johnsons sings them, it seems he speaks the words clear and propperlly, and doesn't sing them in a slang term cutting off the g from 'ing' words etc.. I dunno if you care about this or not, but I found it pretty interesting to compare what Brian is doing with the songs now compared to 20-30 years ago. Never diss the man, he is the silent rock n roll god at the top that some people slam as not being Bon Scott, but get over it guys, Bon is gone, and Brian has done a great job keeping AC/DC at #1 for all these years... compare him to Bon if you want, but Brian had been in the band longer, has not disgraced himself, kept Bons memory alive, and despite what you say, he's a rock n roll god who even on those so called \\"bad ac/dc albums\\" (not that I think theyre bad at all) those songs are still better than most other groups greatest hits, so lay off Brian, understand he is the singer now, and STOP comparing him to Bon Scott. Bon was great, sure, Brian is different, but he is too great in otherways and deserves more respect then people always showing up on AC/DC's latest releases and saying \\"Bon this, Bon that, Bon would've\\"... don't you think Bon is looking down on Brian and smiling at what a fantastic job Brian has done since Bon passed away? If there is an afterlife, both Bon and Brian will remain with the band, because I am convinced Bon would not say \\"thanks for takin over, but i'll take it from here\\" no, you would have two legends in the drivers seats!<br /><br />Keep on rockin' \../,

B000JML7YC|5.0|No one seems to think very much of Northanger Abbey, but I really liked it! I've read most of the other major Jane Austen novels (except for Mansfield Park) and I enjoyed this one just as much as some of the others. It's not as complex as some of the more famous works, but it's still very fun to read because of the social commentary.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Usually, I'm not a sci-fi fan but this was one movie is watch over and over again.  Unlike most sci-fi movies, this one has you questioning everything you know.  It's not a cheesy movie, it's very detailed and makes sense as you begin to understand the concepts they talk about.  Excellent movie, one of my favorites!

6305132984|5.0|What can you say about West Side Story that hasn't already been said? I remember when the book came out; Doug Wright and I were walking through Peoples Drug Store and passed the paperback book rack. There was this massive blaze of red books; I asked Doug what is West Side Story? The greatest musical of all time. That sums it up. Today, when I see and hear all this mindless rap crap, I know Bernstein must be rolling in his grave.
0345803485|4.0|Still reading the book...on my second book...books of entertainment. I'll keep the trilogy as part of my collection.  It's enjoyable...

B000FC0OOU|2.0|The book is very wordy with lengthy sentences that are are unnecessary for continuity of the plot.  Even taking exception for the fact that it is taking place during war, I find that it is quite brutal.  I do not find it enjoyable.

038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle was one of the first novels I read of Kurt Vonnegut, back in an era where his books were sold as paperbacks with distinctly bright colored covers and a signature logo of title and author, when the author still tacked on `Jr.' to his name. Vonnegut was adopted by a generation of people his children's age and always seemed hipper and cooler than most others of his generation. He was one of the generation that lived through the Great Depression to fight in World War II and lived to tell the tale, only his tale was not full of gratitude and patriotism. He was one of the `greatest generation' to actually have the audacity to question whether they really were the greatest generation.<br /><br />That skeptic questioning of authority made him ripe fodder for admiration from the counterculture of the sixties and seventies. Even at the age of nineteen I felt ambivalent about jumping on the bandwagon to read and `follow' him. Nevertheless, after seeing the bizarre and impressive movie of Slaughterhouse-Five I read that and, at the urging of my best friend, followed it up with Cat's Cradle. In short, it was unlike anything I'd ever read and I wasn't sure how to react to it.<br /><br />After two subsequent readings and at least one reading of all of his other novels and almost forty more years of living under my belt I can more fully appreciate the artistry of this wild novel. In a sense, it is the book that established the template upon which the typical `Kurt Vonnegut' novel was based. It contains almost all of the standard elements of his fiction. From the opening line `Call me Jonah' to the final cosmic nose-thumbing it is what they called in the sixties a `put on.' It takes disaster for its subject matter, in this case the dropping of the atom bomb and the echoes of all potential future doomsday scenarios and laughs at it with a wry, fatalistic serenity. The narrator could have just as easily have concluded with the repeated refrain from Slaughterhouse-Five, `and so it goes.'<br /><br />Not only does the novel offer a convoluted convergence of fates and paths leading to a doomsday scenario, he filters it through a fictional religious philosophy, Bokononism. The novel introduces us to an entire collection of terms and concepts such as foma, wampeters, granfalloons, karasses and many others. A karass, for example, is a group of people who, often unknowingly, are working together to do God's will. A wampeter is the central theme or purpose of a karass.<br /><br />The novel also includes the fascinating concept of ice-nine. Vonnegut heard about it while working at General Electric. Irving Langmuir, at one time a public relations officer for GE, entertaining visiting author H.G. Wells, told him about the idea. Wells was not impressed enough to include it in a story or a novel so what Wells neglected to use, Vonnegut considered fair game and it becomes the wampeter of Jonah's karass and, by extension, the enforcer of the zah-mah-ki-bo, or inevitable destiny, of mankind, an element that trumps the atom bomb for destruction.<br /><br />A summary of the plot of the novel would be pointless and almost nonsensical without explanations of at least some of these concepts. Suffice it to say, it is a doomsday tale in which a group of individuals, some involved in the same karass and some adhering to one of many granfalloons, are intertwined by various wampeters into a common zah-mah-ki-bo. If that last sentence struck you as gibberish Bokonon would agree and concede that it was one of many foma, harmless untruths.<br /><br />The geographical destination is the island of San Lorenzo, a small island nation located in the Caribbean, on which a structure of `dynamic tension' was imposed between a fictional religion and a fictional dictatorship by two survivors of a sunken ship, a Marine deserter and an African rover. Lionel Johnson, the African, becomes Bokonon and founds a religion outlawed by the dictatorship by his fellow survivor, EarlMcCabe, by mutual agreement. Religions and nations are granfalloons that are dispensers of foma.<br /><br />This novel even includes a practice similar to Heinlein's grokking from Stranger in a Strange Land, published a couple of years earlier--boko-maru, the Bokononist ritual for a merging of souls, enacted by two participants pressing the soles of their feet together and kneading them. Practices such as this may strike modern readers as elements from a quaint artifact of an earlier, more naïve time. One must remember, however, that this was an era in which science fiction writers really did create their own religions i.e. L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. Novelists such as Heinlein and Vonnegut were quoted as modern prophets by people young enough to be their children. Vonnegut possesses the talent of the entertaining satirist and dilutes his sobering revelations with large doses of sardonic humor. Cat's Cradle, like many of his best novels, is not only deceptively easy to read but possesses prescience that casts a shadow on a contemporary society that many in the sixties would have viewed with skepticism and horror. For that, along with many other reasons, it transcends its status as `relic of the sixties.'

B006YC74E8|4.0|Unless I'm missing something, this program is one of the best I've used for this device... more tool than toy & free! Feature-rich, it has some of the functionality of the very expensive \\"Adobe PhotoShop\\" suite, a program I find to be the alpha-omega of the image-processing scene. I am very pleased with this app & long-term, hope it's more than a lucky find.
B0037W68F4|5.0|MGMT made a fantastic album here.  It's definitely one you should listed to all the way through.  The sound is great.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|The free version seems to be no more than an electronic version of paper maps. It's also a huge resource hog. The first and starting download was 40 megabytes. That gave me the world map. A second 35 megabyte download was needed for Ohio. It seems a download will be necessary for any additional states I'll want to add.<br />Pro: It's stand-alone. No internet connection required on the move. Stable.<br />Con: Featureless - not even a quick zoom to a location. Needs lots of memory, presumably for map data. You best know where you are before using.
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|Flowers' solo work is pretty enjoyable.  It's a solid album, but it took me a few listens all the way through to start to really love it.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Clean, easy, direct, free. I can't think of a better compliment for any app. Just one thing... I'm really beginning to hate ads. I understand someone has to pay for the &quot;free&quot; stuff but it doesn't make me dislike them any less.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|My first impression upon watching the final installment of Nolan's Batman Trilogy was that the pacing was little slow and the story a bit bloated.  I really wanted to love this movie, since I greatly enjoyed the first 2, but either I wasn't in the mood or it just didn't click with me.  A couple months down the road I will give it another shot, maybe via priming it with the first 2 movies again.<br /><br />Cheers!

B0067TQQI8|4.0|Good power, compact, well designed.  One flaw is the accessory connector for the micro-USB, which may not fit completely into your device receptacle if it's in a case for example.  The Anker connector has a fairly large plastic surround that prevents the USB connector from inserting all the way into my Otterbox-cased EVO, so you would have to remove the case to recharge (unlike my Gomadic unit [[ASIN:B009NWFKVA High Capacity Rechargeable External Battery Pocket Charger for the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - uses Gomadic TipExchange Technology]]).  Battery also doesn't seem to recharge my bluetooth Plantronics headset, reason unknown.  Other than that, seems to work as advertised.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|An album any fan will enjoy.  Combines the greatness of both HF and ST; solid from fast tempo songs to the ballads.  The bonus songs should have been on the album (but that's always my opinion when it comes to them).
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have heard many of the horror stories of recent Clancy? written books but this one is definitely an exception to that premise.  This is a great novel with a lot of suspense and action.  The plot is extremely scary and makes one wonder what the chances of this happening really are.  In any event, it's believable and Junior now is the key figure delivering the goods.  I highly recommend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy was exciting,surprising,and breathtaking.wonderful. this trilogy is for people to see that we live in a world where we can't just keep running away from our fears but to face them.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|This was a good rom-com...I just expected so much more after all the hype surrounding it.  I did love the two main characters and of course, the amazing Betty White.  I prefer Sandra's [[ASIN:6304765266 While You Were Sleeping]] over this one.  Now THAT is one of the best rom-coms around.
0307960471|4.0|Nesbo is a writer of dark characters, serial murderers.  Even his hero is dark, but he mitigates those aspects of his character with crystal clear precision, as he relentlessly pursues the killer.
B00338QENI|4.0|I'm not finished reading the book but it is interesting how science works-I haven't reached the family's problem with their mom's cells being reproduced indefinately in the name of humanity-there is a gruesome aspect to it and the family should be compensated, I believe, but I don't know what papers she signed to recieve her treatment and I haven't had the time to finish the book because of the holidays.<br /><br />Actually, I had major surgery and was asked to participate in a trial for a drug -this request was done just prior to surgery. I did ask if the drug was used before and was told, the dogs did well on the drug but people had not. Why on earth I consented after hearing that, is beyond me except that I saw a made for HBO movie about a black surgeon and his pioneering work on heart patients where they used dogs ,initially.When  the dogs didn't do well, then the people didn't do well but that was a surgical procedure-drugs are different. Why we think what drugs works for dogs,cats, rats,or mice also work for people-I don't know but I like animals.<br /><br />In addition, it takes a lot of courage to say &#34;no&#34; to a request to participate in a drug trial right before one undergoes surgery- I will never do it again and would not allow my mother to participate in any experiment before she had her surgery a year later.<br />The surgeon was terrific but the hospital stay was a nightmare-I felt lucky to have escaped alive but I would most certainly be dead without the surgery.I had also signed a paper that I would be an organ donor,if I died- I had two more surgeries since and never signed that paper,again-I was pretty sure that they wanted to kill me in the hospital for my organs, that other time.<br /><br />As one can surmise, I am not a model patient- I complain.
1451695195|4.0|The book was recommended by a friend who said it was really good.  I agree.  For those who doubt the existence of an afterlife, the account by Eben Alexander of his experience is riveting.  He is a scientist, dedicated to the scientific method, and he doubted spirituality and what it means.  His illness and subsequent experience transformed him.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a wonderful book with a bittersweet ending. A tale of the horrors of war and human frailty. Don't expect the good guys and bad guys to be differentiated by black and white hats. They are wearing gray hats in this story. There are no perfect heroes because there are no perfect people. Don't expect a perfect \\"happily ever after\\" but a realistic ending which makes you cry but leaves you with hope. An excellent book. I'm glad the author didn't go with a perfect Hollywood ending as it would have cheapened all she built in the story and detracted from any lessons to be learned from it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the best out of all 3 books! I'm obsessed with the series and this was by far, the best out of all of them!!!!!!

B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This movie is just straight up fun. And funny. Only complaint I had was that the romance between the lead male and female felt forced and kinda boring, but it's such a minor part of the movie that it doesn't even matter. If you love good humor, good music, and a lot of good singing, rent/buy this. There's some questionable stuff for little ones, but the stuff I thought might be too much they didn't even understand. They just loved the music, and the sing-fighting etc. Great movie for movie night at my home. By far my favorite people in the movie are Elizabeth Banks and her male announcing partner. Absolutely hilarious.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is way better than temple run more graphics and a lot more options..... best game ever....doe load this game defitnitly reccommend this game download it way better than temple run..
B0052GACNM|5.0|I think this &#34;sir&#34;special - for sure! The voice, the lyrics, arrangements all without exception was perfect in this CD. I love the singers tighter too!! Lady Gaga was a very nice surprise to me! John Meyer as a shy ( and nervous ) boy was perfect too. I love it!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was entertained and this book kept my attention which can be hard at times. I would recommend this for a weekend read.
B00914JWSW|5.0|The best surprise in 2012 in my opinion. This CD is wonderful, very beautiful voice. Love it! I recomend for all!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love LOVED this story! I was on an emotional rollercoaster, had me laughing one minute & crying the next. This is a definite READ for anyone who's a sucker for a good romance!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hanging on every word! It was a great read, well written, and all around enjoyable! I cannot wait to start the next book!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Very unexpected, but so funny in inventive! All those poor red shirts dying at the hands of sci-fi writers. Makes you take another look at Star Trek.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|It is some of the most dramatic, beautiful, emotional music I have ever heard.  I would recomend it to everyone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A sad but inspiring story which will make you reevaluate what you say in front of your dog. Tear jerker, but a beautiful book.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This is one of a very few albums that I can listen to for weeks, nonstop, without ever skipping a track. It's that good. Most of the tracks are outstanding, and the rest of them are absolutely stunning.  I honestly didn't think I could be any more in love with Ellie, but I was proven wrong when I got this album for Christmas.<br /><br />The music is very creative and unique with several different tempos and moods throughout the album, and Ellie's voice is purely angelic, as always. Combine the two, and you get one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Ellie's music, there is absolutely no excuse for NOT having this album.<br />If you are not a fan of Ellie's music, buy this album, and she will change your mind.<br /><br />I would call this album awe-inspiring. Honestly, cannot say enough about how good it is.<br /><br />Would recommend, would buy again, would buy a third time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While this wraps up the series... it's very depressing. I say just leave off after Catching Fire. Or wait for the movie.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This is a wonderful movie - the plot is well thought out, but not too much so that you still have a feelng of spontaneity when watching this film. The chemistry between the lead actors is great, and the emotions feel real.  The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is also excellent (as his stuff always is!). All around well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting story, I read this because I wanted to know what it was all about before the movie came out. So if you live under a rock or something I say just go ahead and read it.
B007MDB548|2.0|I got this for my daughter for Christmas and we were so disappointed. The 3D won't play. I have not had problems with any other 3D Blu-Ray. The movie itself was cute and my 7 year old daughter loved it, but I paid to get 3D and it doesn't work.
B003O86FMW|4.0|And surviving a death match won't even keep you safe in this horrible world. Good follow up to the Hunger Games.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|I would prefer Kevin Conroy as Batman/Bruce Wayne, although the voice animator of Batman/Bruce Wayne in this film was pretty damn good(don't make no more of these mistakes Andrea Romano! I don't know if you're voice scouting and why?). If Kevin Conroy wants more money, Warner Brothers better start paying up. Now back to the film, excellent introduction to begin the film. Kevin's voice would've sealed the deal for me as BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE. I wish the script was a little more longer because it is very, very good. But overall I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.<br />You will not be disappointed as it is another classic dc Batman film.
1609611543|5.0|Product was well wrapped and it was in an excellent condition! Loved it very much. Highly recommended to everyone who are interested! :)
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Not the least bit funny. Turned it off about 1/3 way through. Pointless and crass. This was a complete waste of time. I'm so glad I didn't pay money to see this in the theater.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game! I'm having so much playing this game! cant put it down! I love playing eye spy a d this I kinda like that!:)
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great book. Leaves you thinking how important time is and that you should use it wisely because you can't get it back.
B004HAEGP4|4.0|A little slow to get started.  Not a lot of explaination on some new things. The last movie mad a big deal about her coming after the Umbrella corp executives with all those Alices, but sure was a bit of a let down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard this book was good but the ending was terrible.  I agree the ending was terrible, but the book itself was average at best.  The diary entries for Amy were boring and I couldn't wait to get through them and on to a chapter about Nick and the real plot.  But, this book dissolves with predictability - the young girlfriend, framing multiple people, etc.  I only finished to see if the ending was as bad as advertised.  I'd say skip it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Brilliant movie! I love Moonrise Kingdom for the droll humor and the stellar performances of the cast. Like all Wes Anderson movies, this one leaves you feeling creative and inspired and satisfied.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Wow! Amazing series and well worth the cost. Was in excellent shape for a used item. I'll definitely purchase from here again.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|This movie is pure cornball charm. It is my annual Christmas tradition to wrap presents while watching this movie and each year I find new things to enjoy about it. By the time it is over, presents are wrapped and I am filled with Christmas spirit. What more could you ask of a holiday movie?
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wonderful characters and excellent story with a good lessons for communication, listening and mutual understanding and respect between teens and parents.  Very entertaining.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Quick downloadand install to my kindle fire. Good graphics. Hard to play. Got tired of crashing every time I flew. Never was able to land on carrier or base. Uninstalled
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Action packed & quick easy read. My 13 year old son got me hooked & now we are both reading the entire trilogy.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I was a bit skeptical on whether or not I would enjoy this movie a whole lot but found myself sucked into the plot. There are a couple plot holes here and there but, overall, I really loved the concept of living day-by-day. Puts things in a nice perspective.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|One of the few games i have paid to play.  It is well worth the .99 cents.  Try the free version first, you will find it addicting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is a very realistic story about Katniss  Everdeen, a teenage girl, that is sent back into a practical bloodbath contest called \\"The Hunger Games\\". As I said she was sent back so it was her second time in the arena. It is a very thrilling story, full of excitement and danger. Personally I loved it.
B0033807E0|5.0|I love this story. I love the whole series. It introduces you into greek mythology in a today also accepted way.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Exactly as advertized. It's a nice and very easy way to read the life of the battery and looks cool.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This was a great movie, with very great quality. I would reccommend this to anyone who enjoys comedies. Also, the characters made it very enjoyable.
0385504225|4.0|I have read Dan Brown and like his style of writing, although I was not impressed with the contents of this one.  Okay.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|This app made the camaraderie upside down. It is horable. Don't get this app. It will waist the space of your memory.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use it to pass the time while waiting for my wife. She is always late, when I come to pick her up.
B004UID2LC|5.0|that is great because it lets you download multiple YouTube videos and songs. just yesterday I rip a 2  hour long movie off YouTube and yes I know this probably violates some crazy Terms of Service bullspit but the fact remains people love YouTube videos videos occasionally get pulled off of  YouTube and then you want to see it again...but now its gone...oh no  way thanks to this app i have it  saved ...forever, forever,forever
0143116738|5.0|It was really interesting to read. I recommend reading this book. I really just wanted to leave five stars but it keeps telling me I have to write something here. I'm a reader, not a writer.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What can you say bad about The Weather Channel?  They are always accurate, up to date and on point. : )
B000FC1HBY|4.0|It was a little slow but still good. Some parts were very different from the HBO series.  Now for the next book.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|I did a search for calendars and this popped up.  It was not what I expected.  Should not be listed under calendars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Movie was good, book was even better! Excited to read the next two books in this series and see what happens!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you are a lover of Facebook than you can't complain.  Gives you access to everything to keep you in the know.
B003UD7JEE|4.0|We missed most of the 1st season, Got this as a Christmas Gift for my G/F  she liked it almost better then the $300 bracelet that I got her.  I watched the old La Fem Nikita, took me a bit to warm up to the new actors - But I DO enjoy this virson just as much.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you love to organize your life then this is the app for you.  Download it and start pinning! : )
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't think I've ever related to a character as much as I did Charlie. From the writing style to the worrying and the way he just watches.... it's all very easily relatable and I would recommend to any wallflower. Great book.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Works just as stated in description. Would recommend to others.  Definitely worth buying in order to protect your new toy.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I thought Connelly's recent novels had gone downhill a bit, but the Black Box was great.  Cost me some sleep staying up to read.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|The plot behind the story was great; definitely leaving a desire to know what happens. But the delivery was not the best. I understand the importance of Diana's active life style and the connections of the numerous poetic references from history, but they got a bit overwhelming at times and left me scanning for the next pick up in the story. The romantic elements were the real deal breaker though, as far as being overwhelmed goes. When there are multiple times throughout the book that 4 plus bottles of wine are present and 10 pages of detail are used to describe the smell of them as well as a historical background that rarely pertained to the story it gets a bit ridiculous. If you combine that with the number of times that you hear how she is kissed and how it gives a cold contrast against her warm skin you have a whole lot of book that is unnecessary. To someone who really takes in the deep romantic stereotypes this book could really connect; so I'm not saying this doesn't have an audience. But that's also another problem; it's the typical vampire meets a fragile mate stereotype. There's nothing new there. My final issue is with the climax. I feel that even in a trilogy each book should have a strong stand alone element leading into the next story. The climactic action scene brought in a character we hadn't even seen to that point. My 2 stars are for good ideas and solid writing elements that made the book look like a solid finished product. Again; as with all reviews you have to take this with a grain of salt. There  are plenty of readers who enjoy the time tested elements and enjoy picturing the well detailed scenes of a romance blooming. While it may be over done to me it's a good enough read that I would urge you to make your own opinions if the described genre fits you.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|There won't be any surprises, but the acting is top notch.  Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me, even if he does play the same quirky romantic type.  Same goes for the performances from Adams and Eastwood.  The plot is predictable, but in the end, you can't help but feel that it was well worth it.  Maybe we need to revisit the classic genres with some fresh faces like Timberlake and Adams.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is probably the most addicting and fun game I've ever played! I love temple run! It is so awesome!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED this book! It is my favorite in the series! I am SO sad that it's over! I look forward to more from EL James!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book this is my second time reading it and I'm still shocked by the events in this book.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I'm disappointed with this app.  I cannot play farmtown on my kindle fire.  I can play other farming games except farmtown.  I just would like to know why?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Have four more to do - get back to me later - but wow play till my finger hurts and my mind in numb!

B0095R76EW|5.0|Great casting, no dead air, good solid funny movie from start to finish, a good guy and chick flick ..
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just like I said, it's facebook, what can I say.  It works great on my Kindle Fire, so far.  Great app to stay in touch with friends and family near and far.
B003TT2X72|1.0|This product is not actually the extended edition as Amazon lists it as in its own review of the product...the information in the \\"WHAT YOU GET..\\" section of the review is not correct, this is a 1 sided blu ray of the THEATRICAL cut of the film.  This is still an excellent film...just not the product advertised.  I'm having to return all 3 of these movies now for the correct products...FIX THIS AMAZON!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book was not at all on how you thought it would have ended or even the story would have gone based on books 1 & 2. However the ending  was predictable by the way story was flowing.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Nice movie.  Good healthy comedy.  I would recommend it to everyone that has not seen it yet, either child or adult.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Excellent song. Love It much!!  Would recommend it to R&B lovers everywhere.  Really good price for for one great song.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This movie was OK.  I like Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams from other movies they have made, but was not impressed with this one with both of them in it.  I felt Clint Eastwood was replaying his role in Million Dollar Baby and Grand Torino, but not as well.  While I will applaud Amy Adams for her effort I found it difficult to believe her as tough and as a true baseball fan.  I am glad I did not spend $15 or $20 to see this movie in a theater.
B006O6F932|4.0|There is a hand that holds up the second floor. The hand is the key. It is tiny and could be more substantial. But, I agree with other 5 star results! Great play set. Easy breakdown. Lots of accessories!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another strong and convincing Grisham page turner. Beautifully crafted story about one man's long planned journey to fool federal agents
B009LDMJGA|5.0|Una de las bandas emblemáticas del sonido de los noventas que hacía falta desde hace mucho tiempo vuelve con algo nuevo que con el paso de los años, como un bien vino, se siente con más calidad y con la potencia salvaje y los sonidos melódicos que los definen como son. Bienvenidos de vuelta y quédense todo el tiempo que sea posible.
B005LAII12|4.0|'Ted' is a movie was very interested in seeing during its theatrical release. As a fan of Seth Macfarlane I was eager to see what he would bring his fan base. He gave his fans exactly what they expected. 'Ted' is film filled with belly laughs and fun to be had. The cast does their jobs at being rude crude and totally inappropriate and at the same time gives the viewer a heartfelt story about friendship. Although being the perfectionist that Seth Macfarlane is I feel that there were certain points of the movie that looked like they went the extra mile when they really didn't have to. I don't want to spoil it so you will have to see it for yourself. This may not be a film that people will want to watch over and over, but those who love this kind of humor and love the artist that began his career in 1999 to purposely break all possible barriers will definitely enjoy 'Ted'
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this app because it lets us download out preferred version so we can read it offline. Not to mention it has a variety if versions to choose from.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I am so glad to know that after all these years of reviewing that I am still in with today's trends, especially music. A few months back I found out that most of the new bands that I enjoyed are no longer new and that I knew nothing about the new music scene. Well after browsing through a few of the new bands that are apparently topping the charts, Imagine Dragons has definitely grabbed me.<br /><br />The best way to put this sound is a mix of neo-new wave & the current inde sound (It's Time.) Picture the concept that Coldplay & The Killers got married and had a child. 'Night Visions' is a very good listen the sound is fresh and the songs really stant out on each of their own. The better tracks include Top Toe, On Top of the World & Bleeding Out, personally Radioactive doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />This album is by no means perfect, but as every band that has stood the test of time it is a first step unto something great. I am looking forward to Imagine Dragons' sophomore release.

0307387178|5.0|I heard about this young man when I was in Alaska earlier this year and the book added to my knowledge.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As a long time sci-fi fan I can definitely recommend this book. Plausible, well written, and well paced. The author keeps the interest up, without going too far. The writing is reasonably &#34;tight&#34;, and the premise is good. The main character is believable, and the moments of dry humour break up the narrative nicely. Definitely 5 stars.
B00846TTDG|5.0|It is great movie. It supports our special forces. It is a great movie for everybody who likes action movies.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|You can conjure anything based on belief, especially gods and monsters. The central conceit of American Gods by Neil Gaiman is that because humans believe in the gods, the gods exist. Fairies, kobolds, immortal queens and kings, and so forth are real simply because humans sought explanations for their world. It is an excellent idea to base a novel around and Gaiman takes readers on a tour of the spiritual landscape of the world and the backroads and quiet centers of the American continent.<br /><br />  Setting the story in America is an excellent storytelling move on the part of Gaiman because America is a pluralistic society. Many cultures and religious ideas have either been brought to this country by immigrants or were grown here by its residents. This allows Gaiman dramatic license to reconfigure some deities and characters from mythology to fit American norms, for example turning the avatar of Odin into Mr. Wednesday, a con artist, or the Queen of Sheba as a prostitute who literally devours men with her genitalia. I found myself having to refer to online reference guides due to the sheer volume of deities and mythic figures that Gaiman managed to throw into the story. America as a melting pot country allows the author to bring in characters that would not normally be found on the American landscape, such as versions of Anubis and Bast.<br /><br />To read the rest of this review and others, please visit my blog The King's Crier: Book Reviews.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Love it. Very good headset. No windows 8 software yet, but I love it very much. I use it with Skype and it is the best thing I ever got. Calls are very clear and it is a pleasure using it.<br /><br />Here is update of the review I have previously posted:<br />I had this G930 headset for 5 months and it was working great for the past 5 months, few weeks ago it started to having issues the receiver will disconnect every 5 to 7 minutes for 8 to 10 seconds, it is very annoying and makes to headset useless, so I contacted the Logitech customer Service/TechSupport and after few days of exchanging e-mails back and forth they have issued RMA and emailed me the prepaid postage to return the defective headset and get the replacement. Week later I got the new/replacement headset and I was very happy, I tested. The new headset that I received after 15 minutes of use had the exact same issue as the one that I sent in receiver will disconnect every 5 to 7 minutes for 8 to 10 seconds. Few days ago I contacted LogiTech TechSupport again and explained that the replacement G930 headset has the same issue as the one I sent in. I got RMA yesterday and I will send in the defective headset tomorrow. for some reason I do not have any faith in this product it appears not to be ready for prime-time, I just wonder now how is even possible this product to be on the market. Maybe if you lucky you may get one that works for few months, if you are not so lucky you will end up printing UPS labels and running to the UPS store to return your useless G930 headset. If I knew what I know now I would never buy this product unfortunately, ones you bought it you will not be able to get your money back and you have to play the return game probably every two weeks.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Yesterday I did received the second replacement G 930 Headset and it did work for less than 15 minutes and started having the same issue, disconnects every 7 to 10 minutes for about 10 seconds and connects again. Itis so hard to believe, so I called support again they promised to issue RMA and they will send another one. I am not having much hope that the new G930 they are going to send will be anything better than the previous 2 headsets, but I will give it try one more time. I deeply regret purchasing this headset, but nothing I can do.<br />More updates will be posted in later time.<br /><br />Last Update for the G930<br />I have received the third replacement G930 Headset and it has the same problem it worked for 15 minutes without disconnecting.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The G930 appears to be one of the most unsuccessful Logitech products. The most unfortunate part of your buyer experience is the waste of your hundred and some dollars you paid for the product. You will not be able to recover your money if the product is out of the 30 Days money back, Logitech will be happy to replace your bad G930 with another bad G930 until you so sick and tired fighting the problem and give it up.<br />This is my experience, hopefully, you will not have the same experience if you have read this review.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app works wonderful, I literally used it everyday.Thanks for keeping it up to date and on point.<br />Very Satisfied!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|My only complaint is I have to swipe to open my kindle fire hd in order to get to the screen to say snooze or dismiss. Really makes me wake up by that point, though!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is SO FUN! I love playing with my best friend. Its cool because you can chat and draw. The words are hard most of the time, and its great to be able to choose what to draw. I really like this game so far- and I just got this game! The free version of Draw Something works really good on the Kindle Fire. I suggest it. All ages can play, and if your friends have it you can exchange usernames and you can also meet new friends! Enjoy!
B00555X8OA|5.0|I would recommed this product to anyone in leadership. A must read. It reprogrammes the Alpha male's methodology towards a better end which is what we all seek.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|I hesitate to rate this product, as this isn't my taste in music.  My 24 year old granddaughter, however, loves anything byt Fiona Apple and would probably not hesitate to rate this CD as 4 or 5 stars.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Such a fun game. However, very addictive; can't put it down. Once I pick it up the only time I get a break is when the battery runs down. Can't get enough of it.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|This CD was another request from our Granddaughter (24 yrs old.)  She has loved any music by Glen Hansard since the first song she ever heard by him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome story... the film doesn't even compare. Suzanne is a great writer, who leaves me wanting more. Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie.  Rarely do I watch movies again but this one I love to watch at least 6 times a year.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This rating was chosen because any age can watch this program. It is very dramatic and climatic. There are so many twists it keeps you guessing all the time. Enjoy
0131103628|5.0|I decided that I wanted to get more into computers & bought this book to help me do that. K&R walked me through C in a very concise but thorough way. When I get stuck there's plenty of help to be found online. I can strongly recommend this book for someone with a similar story to mine.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|As a therapist I found this very funny and several laugh out loud.  All great actors at their best.  Wnjoy
B007ZYABW6|5.0|This book has been passed to friends and around our family, all of us varying ages, and everyone loved it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Five star  this book was amazing and it really spoke to me. It also had many important quotes that made me rethink my perspective on my life, and the life of others surrounding me.
B009MF56GC|4.0|It's got the basic special features with director commentary if you into that and digital copy is readily accessible online but for those who may not be based in the US ... you CANNOT access nor download your digital copy though you have paid for it.<br /><br />As for the movie, if you liked The Expendables then you're in for a treat because part 2 is all that and more! I hate selling out a movie ... like those trailers that after watching it you feel as if you just watched the entire movie in 5 minutes ... but there are some good surprises in this film. The story line is definitely stronger and more in depth than the first (good improvement) but they also cut the story for the sake of senseless action. Not a bad trade off in my opinion.<br /><br />Of course with an all action star line up you may be wondering about the quality of acting but it's all good, no disappointments at all but then most of my favorite 80s and 90s stars are in there so possible biased and boy do they all look old!<br /><br />So if you don't like movie spoilers, don't read on ...<br /><br />Stallone and Statham have a real good connection and make a good team, though I think there is less emphasis on Statham's character and more on Stallone. Jet Li got more a guest appearance at the start but hopefully he'll be back if there's another installment because he was missed.<br /><br />Finally a real movie that starred Willis, Arnold (don't pretend to spell his surname) and Stallone with a compliment of other good action stars. Yes there are a few tacky statements about each other that could have been left out but there's also some good humor in it. Van Damme played a fantastic bad guy; I mean have you seen his productions in the last 10 years? Less than entertaining but he really did a good job here. But the best and most ridiculous thing is Chuck Norris who mysteriously appears in the middle of the movie whne you need him most ... the true Lone Wolf.<br /><br />Hats off to a great sequel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the first book but this one I couldn't put down and leads you right into the next.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|Really enjoyed seeing this video after so many years from its original release. Good story and Jeff Bridges looks good at the beginning of his long career.
B005898DDO|5.0|,The historical documentation of the musical timeline is well done<br />with remarkable film footage of musicians of long ago.  The<br />sound is very clear, and was happy to see that only Bob Dylans'<br />answers were filmed. They did not waste footage on the questions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Slow for me at first, but then this third book takes off and is great finish.  Enjoyed it very much
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Beautiful arrangements and accompanied artist on ths CD  A ...beautiful voice so enjoyful...so clear and choice of music very exceptional
B000068FXR|5.0|Crises?  What  crisis?  and  Breakfast  in  america  are  2  of  the  best  Super Tramp  album  that  are  worth  the  money. About  the  Crisis?  What  crisis?  album. About  14  years  ago  I  bought  this  album  at  a  record  store  at  the  Sandusky  OH  mall  which  is  out  of  bussiness  right  now  and  it  was  on  sale for  $8.00  and  it  was  the  only  Super  tramp  that  I  have  on  CD. All  the  songs  are  great  except  for  track  2  which was  ok. But  all  the  other  songs  are  great. I  spectialy  like  songs  poor  with  that  clarnet  sound.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app on both my kindle fire and andriod phone and love it! I am a teacher and a mommy to three boys and I have gotten soooooo many ideas for both wonderful areas of my life! My family friends and co-workers call me the pinterest queen! I cannot count how many hours over the last year I have spent on here! Beware it is very addicting!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beautifully written and let me be honest, I cried. I recommend this book to everyone (teens, adults, etc) but okay if you want a book that involves a happy ending, this is not the book for you my friend.
B009738XXM|5.0|Got it for my daughter, she loves it !!! She has it downloaded to her i pod nano. Cant keep her off it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|started out good even tough it was for young readers.  story line kept me interested until half way through. sky and holder acted and said things you would never hear 18yr olds say, much less 80yr olds. ending was sad and stupid
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Three story lines developing simultaneously.  Very intricate and made me want to keep reading.  Some details too revealing, but nonetheless a very interesting book. I enjoyed it very much.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Nicely done. After reading the book and seeing another earlier version, I found this one a rather excellent bit of storytelling in a subtle manner that takes a second viewing to really appreciate, as it gives the viewer a rather good feel for the people presented and the times they live, in the class they are a part of. The longer running time from a 'film' is important in this respect, as otherwise, a lot of the subtle feel of the walking from one room to the next would need to be edited. It could be done, but this is a nice example of 'getting it right'. It's all about choices and the choices made by the production team served them well here.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I loved the way I needed to keep up with the plot which kept me guessing until the end.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves a mystery.
B0000640VO|5.0|Definitely liked it, but love it??? Not sure, but it is definitely different and that is good for me, as long as it 'works' and this one works in a weird, off-beat sort of way. It's a 'one-of-a-kind' and the casting really works. That look of the main actress on the cover pretty much says it all.<br /><br />Me likey.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When I started playing, I only got 2 pages, but then I heard super scary music so I quit the game
B00005JKNF|5.0|For the time period of the society that is portrayed in this film, the British upper classes at the end of that certain era, it seems perfect, done in 'Hollywood' style that took the British themselves some time to utilize well. Blame that on lack of funding and market preparation to support such works in the arts. The storyline and 'who dunnit' aspects are perfect as is all the acting, which usually means the script was excellent to begin with, which, given the director, seems another job well done.
B001BR7CU2|5.0|Damn good movie! So good they made a TV show.... Just plane fun and good times. Being a geek rules!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I've said this before, the production team of director/writer/producer has not done JKRowling's work a good job, and they've proven it time and again. If they would have stayed with the book's outline they would have been better off, but alas, they stray like cats in heat and looking for ego satisfaction, or so it seems, for why else extract so much material and insert meaningless nonsense? From the start, the acting was natural, if not the best, due to lack of experience and these kids not being born in the business, but instead of using that to the production teams advantage, most of the directors only tried to ignore it or work around it, including the first director.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the cometary distruction et al set to arrive again in '14, I would say the book series could do well with a tv series, as another film series would need a few more years before attempting a restart. The production team really shows their misguided folly in this last film set, but this is how the rest of us acquire examples not to follow. The film is alright to watch, but doesn't make you want to see it again. Just read the book, it is so much better and you get the chance to see the potential of 'what could have been'.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|The movie was okay. I think it could have been better. The villain wasn't that interesting. Predictable ending. Not a favorite Will Smith movie.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|It's okay, but the adaptation didn't work out too well from the books, which I would recommend for the early 'fool' on their journey. The lessons are presented in the books much better than this film, which seems to gloss over them too fast. That's part of the problem in putting such subject matter to visual form.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|The movie was not bad. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters. The story seemed interesting. They could have been bloodier.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The film, after watching this entire series, was excellent as a compact version of the entire story the creator of the series wanted to present. You really get a feel for that larger storyline when watching this series. Too bad it didn't continue for another season or two. The best storylines are usually best presented to the public when limited in duration, instead of having no end in sight, as the 'excess' or dross gets cut rather immediately as an impediment to the movement of the storytelling.<br /><br />If you liked the film, you will like the series, and if you like the series, you will love the film, as it completes the story, one that repeats in our world, one civilization after the next. The hidden truth doesn't get revealed until the 'fat lady' begins to sing her song and the lyrics are always those of lament. History, when finally revealed is never pretty, but it is accurate and the creator of this series had a good idea with this storyline. Too bad he didn't find an audience fast enough, but then I don't know that part of the production story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book so much probably one of my all time favorite books and if you like these books you'll probably love the lux series
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I'm not into Dickens, but this is one of his best in my opinion, especially most current audiences, and audiences without understanding of the times. The storyline is very well presented and the acting by all excellent as well. I am glad it wasn't any longer, as there is a negativity of despair that lingers and is a bit depressing as it was originally meant to be by Dickens, writing to change his times.<br /><br />Yes, some changes to the original story are made as is usual, but mostly to minor characters, and since I didn't know that much about it beforehand, it didn't bother me before nor after. You can see the pattern of our society repeating back to this situation of social control once more, and that is sad.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was recommended to me by my 10yo daughter who found out about it from one of her teachers... I put it on my new Kindle and then, loaded it on her new Kindle immediately- we have not put it down.  The Kindles also went to our family's house over the holidays and people were fighting over the Kindles to play the game.  At one point, people loaded the game on their smartphones and multiple people were playing it on various electronics all evening.  This game is outstanding, simple for all to play but frustrating and challenging at times as all.... writing this review while awaiting my Kindle to charge so I can play again!
B000RJO578|4.0|Funny, well made and acted. It's a nice spoof on the action buddy films from Hollywood, with many twists and turns done in classic farcical joy.
0061900656|5.0|My son read this twice and asked to use the potty and did! This is written in a language a toddler can understand and relate to...making potty time fun.
B000244FDW|3.0|It's okay, but I didn't like many of the actors in their parts. The two main sisters should've switched parts and the series editted to pick up the pace. The book isn't boring, but I found this series to be so quite often. Yes, it stayed true to the book for the most part, but that isn't always a good thing, as this production shows.<br /><br />Not worth buying, see if your library has it. Mine does now, as I gave my copy to them. I was curious about previous versions until I watched them.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My husband is enjoying playing this game on his Kindle. So far he thinks it is good and cna be challenging.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Yes, loved it, as I didn't really know it and only read the book and watched other earlier versions as a result. Knightley is perfect in the part, and the rest are well placed as well, though the girls should've looked a little different in age to be precise. The only problem, once you know the book and Austin's life/material is that the director, which did such an excellent job in the first half, only did an average job in the second. That mirror scene failed, and should have been cut in the editting room if not later before release. The feel of the book was changed too much in the second half from the man's sister to the lack of walking scenes, so that the sense of history is lost in an attempt to 'modernize' the storyline, forgetting that the essence can be lost in the same process.<br /><br />All that said, I feel it is the best version I've seen. Others have had a better sense of historical accuracy but the female leads just weren't 'right' for the part in my opinion. Knightley seemed to be made up as Austin at times and the feel of the characters seemed more true, even if so many changes were made by the end. She is the only actress that 'was' the character in all the version's I've seen, the others either didn't have the look or the feel or age to play the part... again, in my opinion, as today's 'taste' has changed over the past few decades. I just wish the second half of the script could've been rewritten and reshot, a couple of great 'walking' scenes would have made better adaptations to film drama/comedy than what the director/writer choose for whatever reason they had at the time, but again, if I had to point to one, I'd take this shortened version over the other longer ones, that seemed so dull by comparison, some of which is a statement of British tv production values or lack of, at the time. The quality has improved to 'Hollywood' standards of production and presentation, for better and for worse, that's life here in Purgatory.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cannot wait for the other movies to come out. These books are great. I  am rereading this book for the second time now and I still get emotional.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I just couldn't get enough! Watched it over and over again. Time to stop renting and go out and buy it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked the up and down feelings this book takes you through, and the ending left me wanting more! Good reading, finished it in 2 days :)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|GOT THIS FOR MY MOM, SHE LOVED IT!  SHE SAID IT'S AGE APPROPRIATE FOR HER UNLIKE YA BOOKS THAT ARE PARANORMAL BASED
B009LXEBD4|5.0|EVERY SINGLE SONG IS AMAZING!! Price was fabulous and Kelly Clarkson does not disappoint. Worth every penny! I highly recommend!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! Always keeps you guessing. Really enjoyed it and could hardly put it down. Loved the twists and turns of each character.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I love this movie. It is one of the best in its class. Meditative, serene. thought provoking. Distinction between two worlds.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I thought the first book was better as the action in this book seemed repetitive. It did get better as time went on and  the story expanded. It generally held my interest but not as much as the first.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|great quality! i like all of her music. she is a great musician. this album really captures her talent! woo!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Brought me to tears<br />The chemistry was amazing. Couldn't put it down. IT'S A MUST READ. You are going to love it
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story line is mediocre, but I was entertained enough to read it all the way through. Rowling has always been good at developing strong characters, but that may be the only aspect of this book I really thought was above average.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book is a really interesting and should be shared with the whole family because of its educational purpose of it bearing so much stuff for the mind
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Arrived exactly as promised. Love this movie, so pleased to be able to introduce it to my 3 year old (and she loves it too).
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|predictable in a lot of ways.  It seems to say that the government is a controlling manipulative bunch of 1%'ers who take advantage of everyone else.  like I said, predictable.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was really good. It centered around love and family. I could read this book over and over again.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint back in action. Excellent movie about a baseball scout. Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake also had good parts. Would recommend to baseball fans and anyone else wanting an interesting story line.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written and informative. I admit I don't read a lot of military books but this kept my attention throughout. Have read a lot of Tom Clancy (some may cringe) and found this more satisfying - because of the factual outcome. Looking forward to comparing portions of it to the Zero Dark Thirty interpretation...
B005723JSQ|5.0|Like REbecca Bloomberg's Shopaholic, here is another gal who will take your breath away with her nerve, being in the wrong place at the right time, going with the flow, letting nature take it's course, occasionally,  You will love her, want to strangle her, wonder how she gets away with it all, and while we know how ti has to end - how will Sophie get us there.  i Loved it!
B0084IG7KC|3.0|If you hav a lot of money and time, this is a good way to spend those. Not bad, but didn't get me off. I was drinking while I was watching this, so may have been an actually worse experience if I was sober. It's from a series of books, so if you're a fan of those, maybe you'll like this. On the pluse side, the lead actress is real cute.
1451613512|5.0|No one can remain innocent and naïve after learning facts contained in this volume even when its many truths sicken and disturb.  As one is stripped of comfortable illusions and has one's suspicions confirmed the bitter pill of truth has to be swallowed and assimilated. This is where I am reminded of Nietzsche: \\"The charm of knowledge would be small were it not so much shame has to be overcome on the way to it.\\" The US's leadership as an honest broker with its past cloak of acceptability has been stripped from her by the insights offered in this book which easily could have been called \\"A glasnost rendition of the history of America in need of perestroika\\".<br />This book is neither judgemental nor draws overextended conclusions. It merely dumps a load of historical excrement on the reader's head leaving them todraw their own conclusion.<br />Negative conclusions would be:<br />Helplessness; anger; angst; joining Al-Qaeda; acceptance (do nothing); violent uprisings; provocative vigilante actions.<br />Positive conclusions:<br />Write books; Blog; push for constitutional changes; peaceful public uprisings; push to bring transgressors to justice (Bush, Cheney etc); formation of a new political centrist party; use public media.<br />What the book fails to clarify, but should, is that financial deregulations started by Reagan, continued by Clinton and completed by Bush resulted in giving financial managers `carte blanche' to do what they pleased with impunity. Therefore the financial managers excesses were not illegal (thus no prosecution) only morally reprehensible. The true fault lies with the politicians who will never indict themselves. That responsibility lies with the people. Failure to do so will perpetuate this wounded American empire and drag it to its final predictable end where all empires end regrettably.<br />Finally, an important issue like Global Warming gets three sentences and a symptomatic movement of our times such as `Occupy Wall Street' earns onlyfive sentences. Having been a recipient of the Marshall Plan (the US spend $13 billion on Europen recovery between 1948 and 1952, with Britain, France, and Germany as its largest recipients)I feel particularly sad about what I envisioned America to be - an agent for peace and a benign hegemon.<br />THIS BOOK IS URGENT AND STANDS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS ESSENTIAL!
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Sam Rockwell is great in this, what else do you need me say? Well, okay, it's cheap too, buy it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Zep fan?  Get it!  Page is on fire. Plant's vocals are better than ever.  Jonesy and Bonham Jr do not dissapoint. Love it!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Very Indie feeling movie. Very low-budget. But it has a story that I liked. Good pacing, well edited movie. Any more added scenes would have made this drag.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the third in a series of seven...so far.  No. 8 coming sometime in coming year.  This my THIRD time around for this series.  Absolutely love it.  Diana Gabaldon takes forever to come out with a new segment but, let me tell you, it's so well worth it.  Her storytelling is wonderful.  Real page-turning.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Okay, this is a flawed movie, but I feel it's even better than Alien and Aliens. It's truly sci-fi, perhaps flawed by fan servicing and studio pressures. Critics argue against plot points in this film that they don't mind in John Carpenter's The Thing. Also suffers perhaps, from a more film savvy audience. It's in 3D too! Badass!
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|There is absolutely no payoff in this movie. Some very fine performances, but the movie itself leads to nothing rewarding. Any start of a buildup gets cut short and the fumbled to conclusion. Hoo ha. But there are some fine performances, yup.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I liked this movie, if you like lighthearted movies go buy this. But why do you want my opinion? Go read the other reviews.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome book...it made me laugh and it made me cry!  Couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend this one! Very unexpected turn of events.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|A strange coming of age fairy tale. It seems low budget, and sometimes it shows. I like movies of little girls murdering people, so if you don't like that theme, you can skip this. If you don't mind that, enjoy.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. Even tho it was a sad book, I thought it was very well written.
B008RYN44U|2.0|So disappointed! I waited a very long time, like everyone else for this &#34;Comeback&#34; album. I feel it's just more of the same from all of those years ago, and truthfully , Gwen shines better on her own!
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|Still Life has great melodies and is a fusion of lots of different influences, including jazz, folk, and rock. It is also heavily influenced by Brazilian music. There is a Brazilian groove throughout the whole album. The Group plays sophisticated fusion and this was a similar path taken by Weather Report and the Mahavishnu Orchestra in the 1970s. This is still a beautiful album and probably after Secret Story my favorite Metheny album.<br /><br />I bought this album in 1987 and it came as a pleasant surprise. The use of wordless vocals and electronic keyboards was a revelation. For a while it was never off my turntable. I had been collecting Pat Metheny's albums since the release of Watercolors in 1977 and while they were all very enjoyable, he seemed to take his music to a new level on this album. Metheny's playing is, as ever, fluid and melodic.<br /><br />ECM is a label which has always preferred a bare, minimalistic sound. The albums produced by Manfred Eicher are usually recorded quickly with little over-dubbing. Typical ECM albums of the period were recorded live in the studio, over a two day period, there was a further day taken for mixing. The group's last album for ECM, First Circle, followed this template. Still Life was recorded for the Geffen label and the band was given a large budget so they spent a couple of months in the studio. Still Life has a big, multi-layered sound making it sound more like a rock album of the time. In my opinion the extra time spent in the studio paid off and the album reached #50 in the Billboard charts.<br /><br />Metheny and Lyle Mays wrote all the music. The band plays remarkably well: Pat Metheny - guitar; Lyle Mays - keyboards; Steve Rodby - bass; Paul Wertico - drums; Armando Marçal - percussion; Mark Ledford and David Blamires -vocals. Lyle Mays gets some grief from critics, but his use of keyboards and synthesizers played a major role in creating the sound on this record.
B0090X4GJE|4.0|Unusual, but I like her style! &#34;Lights&#34;, is unlike a lot of the songs on this album, and I like the surprise of her interesting style
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I was looking for a simple calculator app for my Kindle Fire, It had to be fairly basic, but include a few more advanced features....and I was looking for something free!<br /> This little app fit the bill nicely!  It does everything I need, looks good, and It's FREE!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|One of the best singers to ever come out of American Idol! Good song selections, and LOVE 'Catch My Breathe'
0060578793|4.0|This is a great book for beginners and pros alike. It gives you the very basics to save you time in emergencies or just surviving the outdoors. Will keep this book handy for years to come.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Well, It may have done her some good to just stay out of the game for a minute to recover from Bionic, but I was surprised to find that she tries something different with success in my opinion. I'm always appreciative when artists step out their comfort zones. Not her best album, but filled with variety, I hope she still goes on tour to support it!
B001MUSQ80|5.0|What a wonderful book! I love this story from front to back. Beautifully written and put together. I have read it at least five times.
B004SIP7AS|3.0|As part of the contemporary rash of dramatic remakes of Jane Austen, this isn't a bad one. (Damned by faint praise, I know...) On the positive side, Ewan McGregor makes a delightful Mr. Knightley and Gwyneth a picturesque Emma. However, while it catches the essential plot of Emma, it fails to catch the flavor and the nuances of the story and is a trifle disappointing. The A&E production, starring Kate Beckinsale, was a more even, complete, and faithful representation of one of Jane Austen's best works. Those not satisfied by Gwyneth Paltrow's interpretation might be made more so by seeing the A&E version.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book keeps you in suspense. I was hoping to read a little more about Gale, but overall a good book to read!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Put this movie on the list of \\"Movies I Wish I'd Never Seen So That I Could See Them For the First Time All Over Again.\\" The acting was on the mark and captured the Gaskell's characters as she had envisioned them. The accents were authentic and never hit a false chord. The costuming and photography were flawless. The musical score was quite moving. I enjoyed the production so well that I went out and bought the dvds in a collection that also included Wives and Daughters (equally excellent production, another for my list of \\"Movies I Wish I'd Never Seen...\\") and Cranford, which I've not seen yet and sits on my bedside table while I savor the anticipation and wait for the appropo moment. Don't miss these excellent productions of these excellent classics!
034580404X|5.0|Loved that I could get all three books together. Great value and service. Books themselves are a great read for the women!
B0045ZAQSM|3.0|Soul Kitchen, along with Fatih Akin's only other comedy film (as far as I know) is once again an intelligent, light hearted affair filled with themes of romance, class, quirky characters and most of all good but simple comedy.  It tells the story of a Greek/German man trying to juggle a realtionship with a girlfriend who's relocated to China and a restuarant that is barely making a profit. You throw in a caring but irresponsible brother who's has repeated day release permission from prision, an ex classmate who's a real estate dealer that tries everything to get our main charcacter to sell the restaurant in order to sell it to a wealthy investor, an eccentric and volatile chef, an old time sailor that lives on the premises (for free as he can never pay the rent) and some of the brothers' criminal friends, you get a good set of varied enough characters that help create the comedy and drama.  In my opinion it's the least best of the 5 Fatih Akin movies I've seen (having also seen edge of heaven, short sharp shock, head on and in july) but nevertheless it's definitely enjoyable to watch and like all his films (although i can't remember how head on finishes) it ends on a positive note that provides the charcater with renewed hope for the future and puts a smile on the film watchers face. Overall, don't expect the heavy, powerful impact of head on or edge of heaven (which i prefer) as this is obviously a comedy, unlike those two. Just sit back and enjoy the dialogue, comedy and drama that is derived from this fast paced and upbeat movie. Romantics will defintely enjoy it too.
0375854819|5.0|This series in general is amazing and the book was low priced. The shipping wasn't too bad, and now I have a gift for my friend!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks has yet again written a great book.  It's the love story you always end up falling for and can't put the book down once you start it. I will defiantly watch the movie when it comes out.
B004I744AS|5.0|If you love to expand your brian pan, then this for you.  great app, love the word games. wonderful learning tool!
1612130283|2.0|Really don't like the message for women. It is repedative and boring. There is no substance to either character. I would not recommend it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very artistic, stylish and generally cool level-by-level physics based app.  Great story, music and look and somewhat addictive.  I don't generally rate apps, but felt this one warranted a 5-star.  Worth 5 bucks really for the entertainment value.
0743297334|4.0|Hemingway's simplistic  style is surprizingly hypnotic. It's subtle ride, gives way for the reader to use their own imagination into the heart and soul of the story.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic movie that we watch every year during the holidays.  We can quote lots of the classic lines. The whole family loves it. It's a must watch!
B00138GY5I|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this album and I love it. I had never heard about this band but I really like it now. Amazing songs, my personal favourites are Frank Sinatra, The Distance and Stickshifts and Safetybelts.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Great CD with some great songs! Have enjoyed listening to Barbra for many years. This CD is no exception... will listen to it for many years to come!
B008RZF1OU|5.0|Good album! At times you might not notice that Kahn is not the lead vocals. Torn is a ripping song. The vinyl sound still beats(in my opinion) CD or MP3 sound quality. If you have not invested in the record player with a quality sounding system. You are missing some great music. I have the CD as well as the vinyl copy, and the vinyl has better sound tones than the CD. There are just some sounds that come through on vinyl that you don't get in the CD. Also it seems that some CD recording is getting sloppy in quality. As for MP3 downloads. The end up being lower in volume of the recording. Pick up this record , and hear the difference!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Viewing this movie has been a family tradition for years. Now our little granddaughter watches the Muppet gang and Michael Caine bring this classic to life in a sweet and funny rendition. Highly recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Straight forward application that performs calculations used for many everyday math needs. The number pad and function pad are large enough for fat fingers.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Very clever blending of history, characters and vampire, witch, daemon and human world. Not Buffy, Twilight or Dracula or any of the other creature books/movies. Enjoyed.
B004DNWPY4|3.0|I found this book interesting. It gives you an ample view of the behaviors that US millionaires have, however, most of this characteristics applies to other cultures.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Abridged version I didn't read the product info well enough before I downloaded it. It's probably not actually bad....just not what I wanted
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I was not anticipating the length of the show, four hours for a documentary seemed a bit too much. I watched it due to the subject, and wished that it was longer. Engrossing documentary, Mr. Scorsese should be proud.
B0038AL7M4|5.0|Pure beauty, mystery and poetry. True artistry of filmmaking. Inspiring and hypnotizing. If you love great movie making, fantasy, beauty it's a must see.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|The forgotten Beatle? No way. These selections by George show just how truely gifted he was as a musician. Enjoy this the old fashioned way, headphones on, kick back in the lazyboy, close your eyes and just listen. George will do the rest.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I think it's perfect for anyone who enjoys this game! Fun to use and easy to move the stacks. I'm addicted!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great plot, and I can't wait to see what's to come ok in catching fire, book two! I hope Peeta and Katniss make it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's fun but it is not worth 6$. I would say about 2$ it should cost. The problem is that you can't go to nether. Also there is no Redstone or enderman or Holmes or buckets of lava or water. Not even piston. But still fun
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a very good book and it shows what goes throw a middle schoolers head and how they live life
B0084HJE0S|2.0|Has basic information about HTML5, but no examples. It is really overview. Fine since it is free wouldn't pay for this book. Don't get if you are wanting how to.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Exactly what I expect and enjoy about a Wes Anderson flick. It was shot beautifully and I loved the quirkiness of the characters.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is the first Carrie disc that I have ever purchased, although I love her, and her<br />work.  I'm also not a huge country fan, but I'm getting there.  I'm liking this disc more<br />and more every time I listen to it.  Bought it on a whim, and am glad I did.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|TL;DR: These work in Linux and are backward compatible with USB 2. The drivers are easy to obtain (links below) and install. I tried bonding two of these on an old netbook without success. I eventually decided that the netbook didn't appreciate having two of these adapters plugged in at one time. I didn't get around to testing transmission speeds.  I'm sad because I apparently don't know enough about 802.3ad and/or my netbook didn't like having two of these plugged in at one time.    ----------    I bought two of these with plans to turn my old EeePC 701 into a router for my home network. The 701 only has 1 built-in 10/100 Ethernet port, so I needed at least one of these. I bought an additional one to play around with bonding/link aggregation (802.3ad). I should also note that I realize the 701 only has USB 2 support, but I bought the USB 3 variety of these adapters for future endeavors.    The Linux drivers for these adapters are very easy to install. I use Arch Linux, so the drivers were even easier to manage since there is a PKGBUILD in the AUR ([...]) for the drivers. Once I had installed the kernel module (on Linux Kernel 3.6.10), all I needed to do was \\"modprobe usbnet\\". Both USB adapters were immediately recognized. I could then receive an IP address from my DHCP server. Very simple installation. If you're not using Arch, the Linux drivers are available at [...]1 (Linux drivers were not available on the mini CD that came with the adapters).    Unfortunately, bonding the interfaces on my 701 was not as fruitful as I had hoped. When attempting to use the built-in facilities for bringing up both interfaces and turning them into slaves of a bond interface, the timing was off somewhere in the process (or so it seemed). When I would attempt to bring the bonded interface online, I could see the blue LED illuminate on both USB adapters for a second or two. Then it just turned off without any reason that I've been able to find. All I saw in the system journal was something about the link not being online.    The same sort of thing happened when I tried to bond the interfaces manually, removing the timeouts that I thought were causing problems with the automatic configuration. Everything seemed hunky dory until the ifenslave step. That's when the blue LEDs on the USB adapters simply turned off. I have yet to find any indication of the error or mis-configuration to resolve this problem.    As such, I decided to abandon my plans to bond the interfaces and just use one as the interface for the internal network and one for the \\"external\\" network. This appeared to work fine, but not for long periods of time. Also, there was still some manual intervention required to bring up the \\"external\\" interface at boot time. The internal interface came online without a fuss on each reboot (it had a static IP address), but the external interface appeared to timeout while requesting an IP address.    Once I got both interfaces online, the 701 eventually stopped giving my internal network access to the Internet. When I went downstairs to investigate, I noticed that the external interface had gone offline for one reason or another. I know it couldn't have gone into standby mode due to inactivity--I was using the Internet the whole time. I brought the external interface back online, but the same thing happened a couple more times.    Eventually I decided that my 701 didn't like having two of these plugged in at the same time. I turned the built-in 10/100 Ethernet port into the external interface and things went along fairly well for a while.    I can't really comment on speed just yet. I've spent most of my time trying to figure out the bonding and such. They handle my 40Mbps/20Mbps Internet connection just fine, though.    All in all, I'd recommend these to anyone who wants another NIC. I imagine they work just fine in Windows and OSX as well.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I am a huge Gwen Stephani fan.  So now that she is no longer pursuing a solo career, I have<br />to go back to No Doubt.  Not their best effort, but if you love Gwen, you will just be thrilled that<br />she is back with new music.  The more I listen to this disc, the more I am starting to really like it.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|This is definitely a different kind of movie. The main character, who is never named, is a strong silent type. Friends I have watched this with were turned off by the relative lack of dialogue, but I still found Ryan Gosling's performance to be compelling.<br /><br />With a quiet badass for a main character and a few impressive car chases, this movie reminded me a lot of the classic film Bullitt. It is also noteworthy that this film is pretty graphically violent.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I bought this for my 160GB iPod Classic. The data rate and range are all well within stated parameters, and it works very well with my Creative D-100 wireless speakers. Something I didn't bother to study that slapped me in the face was how quickly it uses the iPod's battery while transmitting. I clocked it from a full charge and really only got through an hour and a half of continuous play before the iPod ran out of juice. This wouldn't be so bad if you could have it plugged in at the same time it was transmitting, but alas, the adapter occupies the charging socket.<br /><br />One other thing I noticed is that after use of this transmitter, I had to hard reset my iPod to be able to work with my current (and a workhorse of a product) iHome clock/stereo. Eventually, I wound up getting a message my iPod had been corrupted and had to reformat. Despite these drawbacks, I still think this device is a great idea and I will still continue to use it, but just not as much as I had originally planned.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was a page turner , I had butterflies reading it the whole time . Can't wait to read the next installment
B00932AA5G|5.0|Loved the movie from beginning to end. Great script (subtitles) with a killer plot and twists. In the vein of Girl with Dragon Tattoo, it's powerful stuff, well written and delivered to perfection. Definitely 5 stars among all the junk out there.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really like this one. It was full a danger, and it made you really want to feel sad for every character, even Valentine. I mean he makes you want to hug him. If he wasn't a crazy lunatic and who would kill his own kids cause they didn't do what he though was the right thing. But he did make some good points though. Anyway if you like the first one ‘City of Bones‘ you will love this one.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Entertaining hidden picture find that gives you an explanation for why you're doing all this finding via a fantasy storyline.  Some items become hard to find in later levels with a smaller phone, but the hint button is usually there to assist.  Various spins on the hidden picture formula keep the levels from getting monotonous.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My 5 year likes this...It was listed as free...why the purchase status? Just received  Kindle as a Christmas gift...need to learn about it
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie is super cool.  It makes me wonder what it would have been like for people in the wild west to see aliens and spaceships.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I find this game very entertaining.  Each time I play I find the interest to continue.  It never seems to repeat itself. There is always a challenge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The title says it all! It is by far one of my all time favorites! Anyone who enjoyed Harry Potter, Twilight, Lord of the Rings or the Eragon Series (Inheritance Cycle), will adore these books!
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This read was just as good as it was years ago when I first heard of Ludlum. An excellent read  that no movie could do justice to...
0786955570|5.0|I thought that I would not enjoy this board game. I have played the original RPGS, and was very doughtful with the board game. I enjoyed the game a lot and play it often with my son.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I read this book when I was a teenager in school, even saw the picture, but now after fifty years I think  I enjoyed  it much more.I highly recommend this book to those with a youthful spirit.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|My son liked this show so he wanted it for Christmas last year a little late on the reviews sorry! It was as described and he loved it arrived on time!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent work up to John Grisham's standards. The plot and the suspense permeate it throughout the book. Compelling reading.I would recommend this book to all Grisham's fans.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|It arrived earlier than said and very happy with the show everyone loved it! Thinking back probablly should have bought it in 3D still might!
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Captain America set in Lego! Great combination. Kids love building with Lego and kids love superheroes. It's a great gift!
B005FISC52|5.0|Well two of my kids collect this series, they grew up watching this show and they love it! So I had to get the rest of the ones they didn't have to finish there series collections!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not typically a science fiction reader but the sample got my interest. Literally was difficult to put this book down. I loved it and I lent it to my sister and she loved it too. Can't wait for the next in the series!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I bought this for my son and he just loves it, it arrived earlier than I thought which was I very happy!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I happen to watch the ordeal about the authors Estate dilemma and thought maybe I should read the books so have read about 1/4 of first book, in the beginning it was a bit slow but now I am getting so I have a hard time putting it down. Good pick!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I bought this game for Christmas for my daughter in law and we all played it the same day.  She loves it. she is a teacher and a board gamer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was very good, i wasn't going to read it but at the insistence of my sister I did and am glad I did. I especially liked the unique way she ended the story.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The Piano Guys are just spectacular. We went to an out door concert and even through the rain we were so entertained that we stayed and enjoyed it. Their music is so great and inspiring and fun. Would recommend it to all.
B00867GHS8|4.0|In my list of Disney/Pixar films I put Nemo near the middle of the lists at number 6.<br /><br />The last of the Pixar films to come to blu ray.  Let us wait & see how many times in the next few years they re-release it.<br /><br />Good film, funny with a heart.  I just do NOT like one of the major characters, Dory.  Just do NOT like the character.  Nor am I a fan of the voice talent of this character.<br /><br />Film looks good on the blu ray.  I really see no difference from the DVD version of this film.  Looks good on both.<br /><br />I always like extras.  Some good extras here, some are repeats from the original DVD version.  Being a fan of the theme parks the extra on the making of the redone submarines at Disneyland is good & interesting to watch.<br /><br />Anyone of any age will enjoy this 5 disc set.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Caught myself reading this book every free moment I had.  I just could not put it down, my wife is reading it now.  8-)
B005LAIISA|2.0|I like the Ice Age films.  NOT love them, like them.  Between the first and third films I can not say a favorite out of them, I like them equally.<br /><br />But, I have no problem as saying this 4th film was my least favorite of them.<br /><br />Why was this film necessary?  Reused story lines.<br /><br />Disappointing.<br /><br />OK, we see the Peaches character introduced in the 3rd film as a teenager here.  Gee, my parents embarrass  me, they do not understand me.  Can we count how many times in TV shows & movies this storyline has been used?<br /><br />A boring villain.  Making 2 groups to follow did NOT help, Manny, Diego & Sid together with Elle, Crash, Eddie & Peaches.<br /><br />What was the storyline about from out of no where we have Sid's family?  Where did they come from, a storyline please film makers.<br /><br />There is no need for any more Ice Age films, pretty soon they will be in 1969 with the cast of Men in Black
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|My dad loves this time period and he loved this film.  He could not stop talking about it after he watched it the first time.
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|I remember going to see the original film when released July 1997.  I was first in the door.  Theater in my home where it open closed years ago.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first film.  Original, funny with good action/adventure.<br /><br />Then we get to the second film.  I was disappointed .  Director Barry Sonnenfeld  basically just used Will doing this part he can do in his sleep-the smart mouth.  Tommy wasted in the role since it took long enough to bring K back into the film.<br /><br />Now, we get to this film.<br /><br />What a major disappointment.  After film 2 I was NOT looking forward to this & after seeing it.  Just a BIG disappointment..  The chemistry between Tommy & Will in the first film was gone.  Could you tell they had been partners for 14 years?  NO.<br /><br />The story line.  Hey, have we movie goers NOT seen before characters going back to 1969?  NOT ORIGINAL  A salute to Austin Powers I guess.<br /><br />Emma Thompson was wasted here-saw here in only part of the film replacing Rip Torn.  They could have done so much more with the character.<br /><br />I will not spoil end of film here.  BUT, I guessed the end a mile before we got to it.  Then, it hit a wall & did not give follow up to the story line with K & O.<br /><br />The main villain-a loud mouth & killer darts from another alien?  Please, that was the best they could do?<br /><br />Then, we go to 1969 & show old technology BUT then bring out those cycles?  Excuse me, they also stole from Return of the Jedi?<br /><br />A bad job all the way around.  2012 the year Tommy had-this was a hit BUT the least successful of the films, Hope Springs & then Lincoln.<br /><br />Oh, one of thing the film makers/company did.  We know DVD's & blu rays are normally released on Tuesdays right?  Then, every once in a while a more successful film they do not release until Friday so not to lose money for release week discounts.  So, WHY WAS THIS FILM RELEASED TO DVD & BLU RAY ON A FRIDAY?  The LEAST SUCCESSFUL OF THE 3 FILMS, FORGOTTEN A WEEK AFTER IT'S RELEASE.  That was why I bought it used.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The characters felt so real. I felt like I was going through this with them. One of my favorite Jodi Picoult books.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Cute story with funny not-so-cute humor mixed in. I am a fan of Mila Kunis and she was adorable as usual. I like her better in her sweet girl roles!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Loved the CD,  can't wait to buy more Mumford......lots of music here.<br />Just makes you feel good all over and then some.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|If you like wes Anderson films you will love this movie. If not i think you may still like this movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|okay you guys I know that a lot of you are having trouble with the app on your devices but all you need to do is get the update on the app and everything will be a whole lot faster. I myself think that this app is amazing.  if you really love getting on pinterest then give it one more chance!!!
0060899220|5.0|He may be a half rude Yankee, with a dirty mouth, but he tells some interesting stuff in this book
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|This is a good offbeat thriller. McConaughey is very effective as the rogue sheriff with his side business. The movie is a little bit uneven at times, otherwise I would have given it 4 stars, but all in all, it's good fun to watch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book! Such a good read!! It's a great love story for people of all kinds and is a feel good book!!
0425263908|3.0|These books were not very well written, but they were entertaining and eventful at times. It is an easy read and served it's purpose.
B005OV0PS2|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent actors, looks amazing on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Sparse packaging and not much in the way of extras, but if all you want is a copy of the movie to drink white Russians to, this is your best bet.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it. It was a good action movie that kept you on your toes.
B00129H7VS|4.0|$35 for the complete series in HD, I can't complain much. I'm already a fan and I've been looking for a good deal on the series for a long time.<br /><br />The picture isn't amazing, presumably because of how the show was filmed. It still looks pretty good, though.<br /><br />If you're a series fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're not, I recommend the series for fans of historical dramas. The series is as much about the soldiers and their time spent outside of the fighting as it is about the battles on the frontlines.
1842437240|5.0|This book was similar to the movie. The book was much shorter than I thought, but it was still a good easy read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This isn't a review of the content of the movie, so if you're looking for that you should head elsewhere.<br /><br />Bought this as a Christmas present for my dad and he is extremely satisfied. The movie looks absolutely amazing on his TV, a 55-inch, 120Hz Sony Bravia.<br /><br />I myself enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater, and I think it looks better on Blu-ray. It's the first movie I've watched on that screen of his that actually made me say &#34;wow,&#34; it looks so good.<br /><br />It's a pretty no-frills package, so it really comes down to whether or not you enjoy the movie. If you did, I highly recommend this for home theater watching. It will knock your socks off.
0425263916|3.0|This book was an average book. Not very well written but an easy and entertaining read. I wouldn't buy the third book in the series.
B003Y5H556|1.0|This was slow,boring and as I stated above. I was really looking forward to this but ugh I couldn't wait for it to be done
B00785P2QC|5.0|I personally think that this app is great. But I also think it is an addicting<br />And fun to play.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|Aside from the fact I just became a t.A.T.u fan this year then I am in love with any music they have and this is my favorite album beside their \\"The best\\". The reason I am putting 3 stars is because both of the albums I ordered one has none sense this in it like paper clippings that mean nothing. I ordered this new and it had the closed seal taped in the inside. The second one I got I also ordered (new) once again I was let down when I saw it was open and this one was a copy with the print . \\"Made in Germany\\" and \\"M+L\\" so I doubt the company would put that on their cd.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This is a great action packed movie. Keeps your interest high constantly and Robert Downey Jr is extremely entertaining. Fun movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very easy to use and very handy having the app on ky Kindle.  I always have it by my side and I don't have to look in my purse for my cell phone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game! It passes the time. I recommend this game for anyone who likes a challenge. It's a must try at least once.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|like this app a lot.  it gives reminders for daily bible study and is constantly improving itself.  although it is at times difficult to navigate all in all it's pretty good for a free app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's been a long time since a book made me cry.  Very emotional.  I like that it poses the question:  What happens to a reluctant heroine who outlived her heroics?
B000IZA9PI|5.0|This was (IMO) the best Star Trek Next Generation movie ever. I don't understand the bad reviews from all the Star Trek dorks. I guess that's why I am not one.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My baby enjoys this Mobile, keeps him quiet at day, and at night with the noise maker option, was sure worth the $40.00<br /><br />ah, my wife enjoys it too, so she can do some house work while the baby is quiet...
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|I found Uno to be wildly uneven (hit: Nuclear Family, hit-self-in-face: Kill the DJ) and Dos really did nothing for me, so I almost didn't pick up Tre (given track titles of \\"Sex Drugs & Violence\\" and \\"Dirty Rotten Bastards\\"), but I'm glad I did.  It isn't as hard or cutting or raw as Green Day's best work, but it's good throughout.  While tracks 1, 5, and 9-12 are the strongest (X-Kid and Walk Away probably being my favorites of the bunch), the entire album feels like an album and doesn't have anything that is track-skippingly wretched on it.  The lyrics are more mature and interesting, as are the musical arrangements.  Also, have to point out that Dirty Rotten Bastards is written in the multi-part style of Jesus of Suburbia or Homecoming from American Idiot -- so if you're particularly keen on that style, there's one of them here.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite pleased that the skills, quality, and taste that Green Day cultivated over the past decade haven't been lost in the creative chaos -- and this album shows it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful movi, expertly acted by a terrific cast of predominately British actors - with special kudos to the always lovely Maggie Smith and Dame judi Dench, as well as Tom Wilkinson and Racv Paetl (from &#34;slumdog millionaire&#34; as the owner of a decrepit, yet magical hotel at which all assemble to reorder their lives, fall in love and generally blossom. I loved it when i saw it at the movies and had to add it to my collection. If you've already seen it - relive it again. If not - you have a treat in store.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its epic but the only thing is the gems are hard to get :( but still i love it !the dragons are adorable. The quest are fun .and i love the dragon races !Its just the gems r so hard to obtain so people have been hacking them.some of my friends hacked The gems cuz its hard to get them.I hope they make a way to get gems without buying them so much.or lower the gem prices a lot.but still great game! ;D

B0076DELIG|4.0|I really enjoyed this Harry Bosch novel. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Good entertaining reading for those who like police type suspense novels.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|It's a terrible movie for sure, Channing Tatum does ok, he looks AMAZING, but the movie is totally taken down by the lack of acting talent in Cody HOrn, who happens to be the DAUGHTER of WB chairman Alan Horn, talk about nepotism at it's worst, this girl couldn't get a walk on in a church play on her own, she sucks and takes the whole film down with her. WASTE OF TIME>
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I, personally, consider &#34;West Wing&#34; to be the best television series to ever come down the &#34;pike&#34;. The dialogue was superbly written, the direction brilliant,the deep character development and interaction was done at the highest level.The plot lines were entertaining as well as informative and often dealt with current situations. A &#34;fictional&#34; depiction of what Jeffersonian democracy is. I like to think that if Thomas Jefferson had seen the series he would have applauded it. Again,in my opinion, this is the best work Aaron Sorkin has ever done, and that is saying a lot.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|this is one of those movies that's so special and so unusual that you have to see it just to be able to say you've seen it.  the first time i saw it I thought to myself....this is my new Star Wars.  let me explain - i love Sy Fy and whenever I get blue, I watch the original Star Wars series.....because i love them so much.  Now that Avatar is here I can move my Star Wars DVDs over and make room for Avatar on the shelf as well.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the vivid imagery and academically advanced words involved, and the cliff hanger at the end. I ask for more information on Taylor and ana‘s ex boss.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|...and this one is good so YES, i recommend this application. I think it's safe to say that now that we live in the era of &#34;MS Word&#34; where we don't have to think any more when it comes to spelling....that we need to carry a dictionary with us even more urgently than ever.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Considered on it's own I found this to be a very enjoyable sci-fi romp.  The filmmakers definitely made it their own film.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I like the answer hitting you in the face that<br /> seems so easy to understand after all that time puzzling.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Typical Harry Bosch book. Well paced, interesting plot all brought together in typical Harry Bosch way of handling an investigation. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery. It definitely held my interest.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reading this book felt like walking in a minefield.    My God, so many twists. Just when you feel you are about to get some answers, author drops another bomb. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I have to say it was very cleverly written. You think you know what is going on, but you have no idea.    Usually, when I read these types of books, I start to look for the clues from the get go. The book had smart book description, which made everyone look suspicious from the first page.    I liked Nick right away. Even though I didn't know what his role in all of this was yet, there was something about him that made it hard for me to hate him. Maybe because of his relationship with his sister, or because of what Amy wrote about him, I just liked him. As you read further, you see him tripping over his own words, struggling to come up with a decent explanation, I thought \\"Pleas don't turn out to be a Hannibal Lecter, I already like you too much.\\". When he said \\"I'm going to tell you something and you won't like me very much, if you liked me to begin with.\\", I thought uh-oh, here we go and then had to put the book down to think about how much would I let him to get away with :). One moment I thought he was a poor guy that found himself in a very crapy situation and the next, I thought he was full of s***. I wanted to shove him hard agains the wall and scream \\"What did you do?! What the hell did you do?!\\". Some parts were told from his point of view, where he was telling his side of the story. I have to say that they were brilliantly written, because he was talking directly to the readers. Even though he is not telling much, you feel a little special and think that he might let you in on a little secret. I got this feeling that he was withholding the information, which made me very frustrated, it made it hard to figure him out. I loved it :).    Amy was interesting character. When she first met Nick I thought they were a cute couple. She had this sweet, sexy and quirky personality, and they clicked right away. The only disturbing thing was that her parts of the story were told not by her directly, but by her diary, that was found after she went missing. That gave me the feeling that something, somewhere along the way, went horribly wrong. But she doesn't write a single bad word about him. So what went wrong? What happened to her?    It was so confusing, I didn't know who to believe. Then, you reach the middle of the story and it takes a total 180 degree turn. Right after I passed 50% a chapter starts with a words that catapults me out of my seat. It comes out of the blue and I feel dumbfounded. What?! And then the real \\"fun\\" starts :).    I was loving the book up until I reached about 90%. At that point I was hoping for the author to start wrapping things up, but she was still walking me trough the minefield. She wasn't done with trowing of the surprises at me. Then, she trows one at the very end, the size of the Godzilla, with only few pages left. What in a hell was that? I can imagine author sitting, writing that very last chapter, laughing with that evil laugh, thinking \\"Try to crack this, Da Vinci! Muahaha!\\". I thought it was sloppy and not very well though trough. The ending was disappointing. For that alone I'm giving this book only 4 stars. It's sad really, because other than that, the story was truly well written. I'm sure author could have done it better than that.

B005LAII1C|5.0|I laughed through out the whole movie. Great comedy. This and 21 Jumpstreet were my fav 2 comedies of 2012. If you love Family Guy and grew up with 80's movies, shows, and cartoons, you should like this movie. If not, maybe not for you. People's opinion of humor can differ. I hated Hangover and Hangover 2 cause they were so boring I never smiled or laughed out loud even once.  You may find it dragging on just a bit as Family Guy episodes are only 20 minutes long and this is almost 2 hours. Kind of the same thing if you loved Simpsons and Beavis and Butthead episodes back in the 90's but their movies were a maybe too long and felt like overkill.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Best show on TV. A must see. If you aren't.watching, you need to start.  Superb cast and writing. Buy it, rent it, get Showtime. Don't miss it.

0425252868|5.0|Excellent book. Once I started reading I could not put the thing down. Wanting to know what happens next kept me drawn into the book. Learning so much about the background of each aviator makes you want to figure out what happens next. Great story.

B002RI90WM|1.0|Disappointed with this after lots of positive reviews from friends. I found the dog amusing but never got to know ant other character. The storyline was uninteresting and I struggled through waiting for something to happen...
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|I've never reviewed a book, before, and I don't intend to say much. I will say that I enjoy this type of book, but I have noticed that I enjoy most any genre if the book is written well enough.<br /><br />To me, this is one of those books.<br /><br />The story takes place both in 1976 in England and also just before and during World War II in Europe and the US. Ruth is a single mom raising her young son and living close to her mother in England, and she begins to notice that her mother, who has always seemed a bit odd and distant, is behaving more strangely than usual. Is her mother showing signs of elderly senility, or is there another explanation for her increasing paranoia? As her mother's story unfolds, Ruth has to decide how to help her mother come to terms with the past so they may all continue to have a life--and perhaps even survive--in the present.<br /><br />The only real fault about the book for me is that it wasn't immediately clear to me that the \\"present\\" took place in 1976. That fault may actually lie with me and not the author, I admit; sometimes I get interrupted or distracted while reading and I know I can miss things. (Three youngish kids and bright, shiny objects affect me that way.)<br /><br />The most of the story is less about events and more about how key people reacted to events--at least, to me. Which means that those who are intrigued more by the \\"hard\\" espionage book who like a lot of history and facts will possibly like it less than I did.<br /><br />I liked it a great deal, though. And the way it was written makes it a good candidate for a re-read sometime, because knowing the outcome of this book doesn't spoil the story.<br /><br />Happy reading! I hope I was able to help you make up your mind about whether this book would be a good fit for you. As for me, I enjoyed it enough that I am willing to try another book by William Boyd.<br /><br />I found out about this book through Pixel of Ink. They are a website that lets you know about free and discounted book offers. I was able to purchase this book at a good discount, and I am quite happy I did.
141694737X|5.0|My 1yo loves this book.  She liked making the sounds of the animal hiding under the flap.  She enjoyed reading this book and has requested to read it several times since. I would definitely recommend this book to the toddler-2yo set.
B001QJUX24|1.0|I haven't written a review in years, but after watching this movie, I just couldn't help myself. If you don't much enjoy your life, and want to kill two hours you will never get back, then I recommend this movie. If this is John Wayne's greatest film, as some reviewers have said (and I do not doubt that they're right), you couldn't pay me enough to watch his worse. Besides the distinctive cadence of his voice, everything about this so-called \\"actor's\\" acting was laughable ... any random high school drama student would have done better. Fortunately for Wayne, the script was equally bad, and the producer surrounded him with enough other \\"actors\\" worse than himself, which helped mask the stench of his performance. The only \\"redeeming\\" qualities of the poor acting and poor script were the laughs my wife and I had during some particularly poorly-delivered lines (usually during the more \\"serious\\" parts of the movie). The plot was not bad, but the actors, and the script they had to work with, simply could not do enough to redeem it. If this film came out today, assuming a studio would take a chance on it, that is, and assuming the same actors were working from the same script, it would be buried by the critics, and slammed by the movie-going public. Which is why I am truly confuzzled as to the positive reviews on this site. And this is from someone who likes westerns! If you want to see a good western, there are plenty of others to choose from. Lonesome Dove. Unforgiven. Deadwood. Tombstone. Whatever. Just skip this one - unless you despise your time, and your life.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great game.  Lot's of problem solving, great puzzles.  My 8 year old budding little engineer learned about the beauty of triangles in structures very quickly.  I find it challenging, too!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Dr. Panda's Hospital is a really cute game.  My three-year-old and six-year-old both love exploring what is wrong with the animals and making them better.  We recently discovered that Dr. Panda has a series of games and purchased Teach Me also.

B004LWZW4C|3.0|I actually found the first two X-Men movies to be surprisingly enjoyable. Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Ian McKellan brought a real emotional energy to those movies. They had short, action-packed stories that weren't suffocated with fight scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, X-Men: First Class is underwhelming when compared to its predecessors. Aside from Professor Xavier and Magneto and Mystique, all of the characters are eminently forgettable. I know the film is about the beginning of the X-Men, but the younger mutants act like a bunch of rambunctious teenagers. Each student learns a \\"lesson\\" in growing and using his/her powers, but it way too much of a Hollywood cliche. None of the younger characters ever really sticks out or learns any lesson more valuable than \\"trust in yourself.\\" At other times, I thought the sexual tension was amped way too much up without any sexual chemistry, particularly Mystique's throwing herself on every available guy.<br /><br />The plot centers around the X-Men trying to save the world during the Cuban Missile Crisis. At times, this went a bit too far and required too much suspension of disbelief. The movie makes it appear everything during the crisis was orchestrated by mutants. On an emotional level, none of the characters were ever truly threatened or put through emotional duress (with the exception of Xavier and Magneto, although during events not related to the Missile Crisis plot).<br /><br />One final complaint I had about the movie was the special effects. They were surprisingly boring. Nothing visually interesting. Even worse, Beast looked CGI and unconvincing. I really liked how they did Beast in X-Men 3, using makeup and real people. The CG Beast looks cartoonish by contrast.<br /><br />The one saving grace of the film is the dynamic between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Professor X and Magneto, respectively. Alone, neither actor shines in this film (although I love other work they've done), but together they work magic. Their relationship creates real depth to the characters and sheds new light on the earlier films.<br /><br />Overall, this is X-Men geared towards the modern teen audience. If you didn't like the previous X-Men movies, there's even less to like here. If you want to learn more about the X-Men characters, there's not much except for Magneto and Xavier - although those two have some admittedly great moments.<br /><br />Overall, 2.5 stars - worth watching as an action flick, but also a sign that the X-Men franchise might need to take a break.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. I like to use this game about once a day and use all the coins that ive recieved. theres stategy involved in placing the coins to make others move where you want them to fall.
0375869026|5.0|Being a mother, I had a hard time picking up this book, as I was worried it would be too difficult to read emotionally. The opposite was true. I have never been so inspired by a book. I am conscientiously a kinder, more sympathetic person now.  I cried, laughed, and cheered my way through this brilliant novel.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I just unistalled this app after a year of heavy use. As others have stated, MobilityWare has gotten too aggressive with them. Hey, it's free so I should expect some ads. I get that. But this is too much.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Average book. Very slow read and doesn't get exciting at any point. The essence of the entire story boils down to 5 minutes - rest is all filler material.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. While you can buy coins you really don't need to. You can get everything and continue to advance. Great graphics.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I received this in my Christmas stocking and I am very much enjoying having it play in the background while I continue to march through the novel. The selection does not include every song from the movie, but is is a \\"highlights\\" selection and it's completely worth purchasing if only for Annie's \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\" I recommend listening to this only after viewing the movie because I've found that already knowing the characters portrayed by this casts adds quite a lot to the listening experience as far as identifying with the vocalists and appreciating the nuances in each song. I hope a full selection will soon be released.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Hopeless, Colleen Hoover's latest masterpiece, the story stayed with me long after the last page was read. I found myself scrubbing shampoo in the shower, shaking my head in disbelief at how she interweaves plot twists into her amazingingly creative stories, and finds a way for it to all come full circle by the time the last paragraph is read. This is a book you will have to go back and read a second time after you know everything that happens in it, just to see how she did it...<br /><br />Hopeless is a much hotter (and darker) read than Slammed was, and it's absolutely essential. Everything fits. No words are wasted. In fact, every chapter in this book deserved to be savored as carefully as the chapters were constructed - with meticulously thought-out pacing, brilliant character development, sneaky symbolism, Colleen Hoover-esque word play and multi-layered plot twists you won't see coming.<br /><br />In an effort to gain valuable life experience before going to college, 17-year-old Sky decides to attend public school for the first time her senior year, having lead a sheltered, home-schooled, technology-exempt life up until that point. Sky's social repertoire consists of her one best friend and next-door neighbor, Six, who shamelessly sneak boys into their bedroom windows at night.<br /><br />Sky goes against the grain. She is both wise beyond her years and naively innocent. She is brave, witty, hilarious and the exact kind of girl anyone would want as their best friend. The fact that she embraces the mean spirited notes on her locker by embellishing them, as opposed to running away in tears, is testament enough to Colleen Hoover's remarkable ability to build characters whose actions in the story stay with you long after you're done reading.<br /><br />Six goes overseas for school abroad after warning Sky that she's been labeled 'slut by association' before she even steps foot in a High School classroom, thanks in part to the loose-lipped and bitterpretty boys she made out with but wouldn't put out for.  Making out with boys is a numb escape for Sky, who has never felt strongly for someone....until Dean Holder comes along.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover builds up the sexual tension between Sky and Holder masterfully, with perfectly-balanced moments of passion-fueled angst and endearing sweetness...<br /><br />\\"He could kiss me for the first time, or the twentieth time, or the millionth time and I wouldn't care if it was a first or not, because I'm pretty sure we just broke the record for the best first kiss in the history of first kisses-- without even kissing.\\"<br /><br />Sky and Holder are the perfect complement to one another. Where Sky is emotionally unaffected, Holder is passionate. I've never read a book where I felt like the sexual aspect of it was as necessary as it is in this book. I've also never came across an author who makes seemingly innocent scenes infinitely more intimate than any raunchy erotica could muster. It was heartwrenching and bittersweet, but all the highs wouldn't be as poignant and well-deserved if the lows weren't as painful to endure.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is truly brilliant and it's no surprise this is already a best-selling book in the short amount of time it's been published. She truly stands alone among the cliche, mindless reads out there. Any book read immediately after Hopeless will inevitably fall flat in comparison.

0307887898|1.0|Very vague in its concept and idea, specifically for those who are getting into the entrepreneur world.  The author took the topic of prototyping and streched-it through out the book.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This production is brilliantly done.  It is far from easy to watch because it is so graphic, but few things that I have seen (companion mini-series &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; comes close) make the experience of war as palpable.  Especially powerful are the portrayals of the differences among men in how they cope with the horrors they encounter.  It discourages the kind of glib generalizations that are all too common in other accounts of these battles.  It is well worth ordering Leckie's &#34;Helmet for my Pillow,&#34; and Sledge's &#34;With the Old Breed...&#34; to read in parallel.  These books provide the bulk of the material on which the stories are based.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a classic, but one that never goes out of style.  I enjoyed every minute of re-reading a loved tale from childhood.  It was nice to have it in digital format.  It is well-written and lighthearted.
0670023329|4.0|This book is both disturbing and compelling. It is disturbing because the story is as horrible as any holocaust narrative but perhaps more so because it is still happening. Thus, rather than being just history, or a lesson of history, Camp 14 represents an ongoing human tragedy. In this regard, this is a compelling page turner.<br /><br />To be hypercritical, the book is best in describing the plight of north Korea and the drama of the escape. The latter part of the book following the boy's post Korean experience is a bit long and perhaps was necessary in order to add length rather than substance to the book.<br /><br />The one question that I was left with was how it could be the case that a country that can't even provide consistent electrical service to the capital is able to provide continuous power to an electrified fence surrounding camp 14. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but perhaps there is a good explanation. I presume that some of this boy's story is missing or has been affected by the trauma. Memory is obviously selective and subjective, however this type of experience must be particularly powerful in affecting the content of the narrative.<br /><br />Along with the Aquariums of Pyungyang, this story reveals some of the most horrible crimes being committed in our time.  It is our obligation not to ignore this crime.
B00005R8GU|5.0|This recording is essential to any electric blues collection-it's that good. It's obvious that all the musicians were having a great time on the live recording-and the studio tracks were masterfully played as well. Ironically, I picked a my original vinyl copy of this shortly after it was released in a \\"cut-out\\" bin. This is very odd, in that a few years before, I picked up another essential electric blues recording(B.B. King - Live at the Regal) from a \\"cut-out\\" bin-that one was a 4-track tape.  Looking back-and considering all the great electric blues recordings that have been released since-if I were to pick only two of them to listen to-it would be this one and the \\"B.B. King Live at the Regal\\" recording. The honest emotion brought out by these two live recordings is incomparable.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Amusing catapult style assaults help birds to root out pigs who are supposedly out to eat their eggs etc.  It is a fun and colorful little activity about as harmless as tic tac toe.  It could amuse kids or adults stuck on an airplane etc. Worth examing, says I.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|Does a great job managing my battery life.  I also like the helpful hints it gives and the logs it keeps.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by the Lincoln Lawyer.  On the whole, I'm not a fan of Mathew McConnahey, but he was great in this movie! The story is very compelling, the characters are very savvy and not at all formuaic.Great performances by Marisa Tomei, Ryan Phillipe, and the great, great character actor William H. Macy.  Mathew McConnahey was solid as a lawyer who is a shark with an ethical streak. The story builds in tension and the bad guy is refreshingly original.<br /><br />It's a shame this movie did not get more acclaim. Smart story, great writing, terrific performances!
B0086700CM|5.0|if you don't want to get anything done in your real life. this is the game to play. warning very addictive!
1439196834|5.0|Fast shipping & book in great condition.  We have gotten a lot of laughs reading this book & recalling the episodes the plays came from.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is fun. It will get boring after a few days of playing it, but it is something that is fun to play when you have a little time to waste.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Emotional, insightfull and powerful. A shocking look into what an eating disorder feels like. I love this book and would recomend it to anyone.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|We bought the Blu-Ray set as a Christmas gift, but had to return it.<br /><br />The first disc had subtitles, even though we have subtitles disabled on our DVD player.  We had to wait for the DVD to play for awhile and then use the remote to manually turn the subtitles off.  This happened each and every time we tried to play the first disc.  None of the other discs had this particular issue, so it wasn't the DVD player.<br /><br />The fourth and sixth discs didn't play right away.  I could hear the DVD player almost struggling to try to play the discs (which sounds weird, but I don't know how else to put it).  The player would stuggle for a minute, show an error-type screen I've never seen before, and then give up.  I had to push stop, eject the disc, reinsert it, and push play again before the discs would work.  None of the other discs had this problem, so again I know it's not my DVD player.<br /><br />Of the 8 discs in the set, 3 didn't work correctly so I returned it and will buy a different set.  Amazon, as always, provided excellent customer service.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game.It is similar to temple run.I have this game on my kindle fire and it has great graphics.Do not listen to the bad reviews.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|A beautiful re-imagining of a classic tale. It's well directed, the soundtrack is one of my favorites of all time, the actors were chosen well and the whole movie is incredibly enjoyable. As an update of Cinderella, it's wonderful. It's feminist without being annoying or preachy. It keeps you interested and you don't constantly find yourself thinking: 'Oh, I knew that was going to happen.' Sticking to the original story while still keeping it fresh is often difficult, but not so in this movie. It also perfectly blends historical with fantasy, never straying to far into one or the other, but keeping at a happy medium.<br /><br />Very recommended.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Nothing more to say that would explain it any further. I really could not believe how poorly acted all of the characters were.  Stunning, in that respect, at least.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There are only so many times you can describe sex, got old after a while although the storyline was good.
0452287588|5.0|It sounds pretty strange to say a book changed my life....but this is one of those. I highly recommend this book and using this seller.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Despite what other reviewers say here, this app does work on the kindle fire HD. I downloaded it in late Nov 2012, so maybe it had bugs before then. It is a free app (at least at this time) with no hidden scams to pay anything. I sometimes forget that it didn't come with the Kindle, it is so helpful. It makes it so much easier to quickly see the battery status. Love it.
B008518MOW|4.0|I like this one the best out of all three.  I like them all but this one gives a lot more of their story line.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I have used Wi-Fi analyzer to measure the signal level at various places in my home. It works very well at doing this. This was the main reason for getting this app.  It also shows the other wifi signals near my house. I think this would be a great app for someone traveling to locate open wifi good signals to connet too,
1423140605|4.0|I'm 62 years old and I enjoy reading this author.  Easy reading and entertaining.  I hope it is correct as to who the gods are and what they do.
B009439HEY|5.0|I was in line for the pre-order of this superlative CD set.  My vinyl copies of most of the originals that were culled for this song roster have suffered a strange fate that I can only account for by vaguely remembering that I had my records stacked on the floor and leaning against a heat-radiator which (while a student in Buffalo NY), was hot for endless winters...  Stunned to find them warped beyond playability I have lived without this music for a long time. I find much of digital (CD) music generally sonically disappointing these days and was hesitant to replace my now-useless LP's with dubious digital versions.<br /><br />But still I could not resist the compulsion to go after this set and I will testify that I am not disappointed.  This is a highly recommended re-creation of much of the classic-period (as I would define it) Genesis repertoire.<br /><br />These kinds of musical exercises can pretty much go in one of two basic directions, a faithful recreation, maybe with a few of the original cast being one;  I was pleased to see that Mr. Hackett and company took the other fork - avoiding the county-fair 'oldies-show' pitfall while re-imagining the music from a modern point of view and taking advantage of the bias of your particular instrument/s while opening the process up to folks who are equally enthusiastic about the journey.<br /><br />I can see that a fair amount of time has gone into the track sequence and the various ways these songs were re-conceived and performed.  The engineering of the material (primarily Roger King) is wonderful in it's innovation, punch and clarity and the reclamation of Steve Hackett's guitar authority within these songs, for my ears, reinvigorates and expands the originals.  That hanging guitar sustain at the commencement of 'The Chamber of 32 Doors' will tell you all you need to know about Mr. Hackett's approach to this music and his role in it's original conception.<br /><br />I confess that I went out and bought a sub-woofer,to upgrade the near-antique conglomeration of Hi-Fi (see how old I am?) components I cling to, essentially at the time of committing to this music purchase.  I was stunned at the contribution to the output of my almost silly-looking paired Tandberg Fasett speakers those new-found lower bass notes made and this recording has plenty of those, even at the more subtle, low bass setting I prefer to maintain.<br /><br />There are so many exemplary performances and vocal treatments here that both pay homage to and build upon the originals.  I was afraid I would miss Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins' voices but after a couple of playings and the expected getting-used-to period, I came to realize that it was the music that held steadfast and the new players brought something to the endeavor.<br /><br />I have read through the various reviews here and agree with many of the comments; I also disagree with a few perspectives.  So, I think that Gary O'Toole hit his marks on all his vocalizations; these never sounded better. Contrary to some opinions here, I greatly enjoy Amanda Lehmann's handling of 'Ripples' and found that it opened up a new way of hearing that song, so-far \\"owned\\" by Phil Collins. Forget about who she is or is not sounding sort-of like; just listen to the intent of the music. I hit the repeat button a few times here (I had a similar reaction to hearing Shelby Lynne sing 'Surfer Girl' on Brian Wilson's Musicares tribute video; I think some of this may involve getting over the gender bias of an original music and see what new may come of it).  Rob Townsend's wind contributions really do nudge a lot of this music into the improvisational jazz arena that it often tends toward.  I have greatly enjoyed Mr. Hackett's association and projects involving Steven Wilson and have yet to be disappointed with those outcomes;  in so doing, I have become a huge fan of Mr. Wilson's work with Porcupine Tree and on his own - this originating with these more recent collaborations of two creative thinkers.  The participation of the Hungarian jazz ensemble Djabe in support of this music (and vice-versa) seems like a natural collaborative extension of their combined musical capabilities and interests.<br /><br />Without pursuing the 'favorites' quagmire (okay, I'll allow Musical Box...), I highly recommend this music purchase: obviously to Genesis freaks but also to younger listeners possibly new to what we still call 'progressive rock' - those who may find something missing or redundant in much of the musical out-pour these days.  The long form, epic, 'tone poem-ish' nature of Mr. Hackett's recent original works and now this particular 'musical rehash' - which may suffer under the \\"progressive\\" moniker - lends itself to introspection, absorption and a degree of musical feeling that remains with you after the demands of the day inevitably take you back over. The original or traditional classical and other musical references (the music-box intro; Greensleeves) which 'set up' or embellish certain selections help to redefine, enrich those pieces and bridge the chasm to other music forms and your own music memory.<br /><br />Get it, queue it up, crank it up (I definitely agree with that fellow!) and sit down and listen.  It's quite excellent.
B002KMR022|1.0|I was notified that this DVD was on backorder about 4 weeks ago so it is hard for me to rate the product. This was to be a Christmas gift but it is after Christmas now. I look forward to hopefully receiving it some time.
B002SRQ214|4.0|This CPU is great for gaming and that's a no-brainer specially when you want to build a budget gaming PC, however the stock cooler that came with it is really loud and not just annoying loud but disturbing loud and i am not exaggerating however it does a nice job of cooling as the CPU's temperature rarely goes above 40c , to make this short get the CPU but buy a third party heat sink but if you're not bothered by loud noises then just use this because it does a nice job.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|I bought this book for my sister's kindle 2 days ago. She received it with no problems. She lives in Adelaide Australia. Today I purchased the same book for my daughter who lives in Sydney Australia. She was informed she had received the gift and directed to download it to her ipad, only to then be told it was not available in Australia! What sort of delivery service is this? More money for nothing.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I had this game on my I pod, but my I pod won't turn on,when I try to charge it,that never worked about has a crack on the screen. So I thought about getting it on my  kindle it said, &quot; error try again later.&quot; I tried it again a hour later,still did not work. I can recommend it,just don't buy I  on a kindle. . It is a good game but I am angry that I could not get it on my kindle and my I pod I broken.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|It was not that good. I don't really understand the point of it if the other books are different. I still like it but I don't get it
B007HACDLK|1.0|I have bought and read every book by Vince Flynn starting from the very beginning.  After ten straight home run books I have to say his last three we're duds.  Gone are the suspenseful and crisp action scenes that he would conjure up in his writing style.  The writing now feels tedious and uninspired.  His writing feels like he is just going through the motions now and collecting his check.  I was very disappointed with the previous two books after being a die hard fan of his writing.  I have bought every book as soon as it comes out.  I have to say after reading this book  Along with the last two I won't  be in a hurry to get the next one.  If you want to read books by Vince Flynn get the early ones and don't waste your time or money on this one.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|If you're look for a review of the movie itself: if you like buff men dancing around, and a story with no real plot, then this is the movie for you! But I'm pretty sure its not making any &#34;best of...&#34; lists.<br /><br />I however, bought this as a gag gift for my girlfriends since we all went to see it in theaters as a joke. So in terms of a great joke - I'd give it an A+ !
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I am a huge Dean Koontz fan. I have read and reread his books. I never thought I would find someone who comes close to his style of writing. The type of stories that twist and turn and really make you think about humanity while simultaneously scaring the the pants off you. I have found that in Blake Crouch. Worth the read and looking forward to reading many more of his books to come.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very good app. Works well and easy to see. Easy to use and friendly. I'm new to apps so this  has been a positive experience..
B005XBKXV2|5.0|This is a great tool to teach Hamlet as the Lion King has identical parallels to Shakespear's masterpiece. Students were able to make character comparisons and understood Hamlet much better.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|At the beginning all the girls were very selfish. There mother and sister Beth teaches them to feel better and content. By the end they become good women.
006123205X|3.0|Great gift for male students who perceive themselves as &#34;players&#34; . A great resource to teach young men how to treat women, a skill many lack.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun game to play when you just want to relax and not think about anything.  It also doesn't take a lot of skill.
B009G78EE2|4.0|It seems silly to rate things that are so obviously based on personal preference.  I bought this album because apparently this guy is from where I live (Seattle) and some of my friends were talking about him.  I bought the album and have listened to it multiple times since.
B0015AARJI|1.0|This was advertised as a genuine Sony product and the box even states that it is such but the analog sticks have to be moved almost half way through their motion range before they register which makes playing games almost impossible. The quality is very Chinese and cheap feeling. I'll never buy a controller online again. I want to be able to see that it is of the same quality that my original controller is.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I feel very confidant that my Kindle is protected.  What a great product!  I love it!  I recommend Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover to everyone who owns a Kindle.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|The kill order was a very good book and is an excellent prequel to the maze runner trilogy by James Dashner.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My son has been trying to watch this series on TV forever!  He keeps getting interrupted.  At the last minute, I remembered his complaining about the frustration of trying to complete the series.  The seller was so prompt in filling out the order, we had it in plenty of time for Christmas giving.  The price was a bargain, the shipping fast and we'll all enjoy watching the series without interruption.
B000PVAFT0|1.0|This could have been a lot better... after all, they did have an four oceans' worth of animals to work with. My kids were bored by it.<br /><br />I didn't watch it in 3D, but the camera work was actually quite good. However, the fishes' movements seemed somehow scripted. Would sharks really just swim right in front of the camera, and then swim away right on cue? I'm no expert, but it seemed contrived.<br /><br />There was absolutely no continuity; the movie jumped from one subject to the next in no order. Each scene was anticlimactic, never really ending but just jump-cutting without providing closure. Some dragged on for way too long and others were repetitive. For example, there are three different scenes in which *SPOILER ALERT* fish clean each other. Meanwhile, the narrators proudly display their vocabulary, using big, fancy words like 'Symbiosis' and 'Relationship,' sure to wow the kiddies.<br /><br />What really killed it, though, was the narration. It was a really, really cheesy script. I agree with the others who said it was 'Preachy Propaganda.' Johnny Depp halfheartedly mumbled his lines, while Kate Winslet sounded perky but strained. The obligatory preachy, Greenpeace ending was the nail in the coffin. They gave some made-up figures about how many fish we've killed and seemed eager to be done. I know I was.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch [[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]] , which my kids loved. It's sad to see that some children are entertained by this movie.
B00000J7JO|5.0|this is one of my favorite albums of theirs,its great just like everything else they put out,but this one in particular has always just being one i like to listen to when im inflective or dealing with things,it makes me less stressed
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I enjoy this reader a ton.  It's enough to make me lay my Kindle aside.  I love the easy font scaling.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|this is such a great movie. i remember when i was a kid and saw it for the first time,think this is gonna soon become our new fmaily christmas movie
B004GYY714|4.0|A fairly decent solution for listening to Internet Radio.  My only problem with it was that it seems not to display all options for radio stations within a particular category.  One of my favorites (LiveIreland 1) was not displayed in any lists (that I could find) nor did it show up until specifically searched for.<br /><br />Overall, a good Internet radio app, and most will probably not have my own problem.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|love,love,love this movie. was very cute and original . i loved the storyline and the spookiness of it .when the kids join together as this kind of band of misfits,it put me in mind of the goonies,but with zombies
B009329Y30|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks and love this film!  So well done!  Can not wait to watch it over and over again!
B009LHWEKW|5.0|love this show so much, i can watch it over and over again. seasons 1-3 were their best and there were a few lulls in 6 and 7 but 8 seems to be coming back around to the type of episodes i personally loved and was used to.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This if fun to put into use when I am trying to work on the computer and my 3 year old granddaughter is looking for something to do. I give her some earphones and she sits next to me while listening to the different sounds.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|one of amc's best shows that ive ever seen. got addicted to it last spring when i saw it on netflix. i stayed up on my vacation day and night catching up on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a favorite amongst my husband and 12 year old nephew. They play this one together whenever possible. I enjoy this one while watching tv.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|this was an ok movie in general,the singing is pretty good and the cast is awesome,i guess i just thought itd have a little more to the storyline,seemed like it was kinda choppy and ended abruptly
B004V5A7K8|5.0|fun to play but don't play this if you think it will be relaxing. I am on the edge of my seat when playing this. you have to move quickly.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|i dont know why i dont actually own this movie because its classic and something i think most people can relate to when it comes to the craziness part of a family christmas. hilarious and heartwarming
B000EWBKM6|5.0|This was just fine and worked perfectly. Glad I didn't buy a new one. A penny saved is a penny earned.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|this movie was pretty funny,kind of reminded me of a live action version of family guy when it came to its storyline .being one of those kids who loved their stuffed animal just as dearly when i was a kid i loved it that much more
B009UX2YAC|3.0|ok so I thought this app was amazing and awesome I had a really high score and everything and I went on today and it reset!!!! that's the 2nd time that has happened!!!! that is why it only gets 3 stars.
B009FXIICK|4.0|It just doesn't work as well on a phone as it does on the computer as a flash game or on the ds port. Nevertheless, I like the game itself and Amazon's app store was easy to use to get it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Star Wars and the Angry Birds. Kits can't stop playing Star Wars and the Angry Birds, they love it. I have to lock it up, when they eat or wash.
0896898288|4.0|Beautiful and interesting book,but the templates are not always accurate and it is set up so you can only print 1 per page,so it is wasteful of paper
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great show! I am looking forward to season 3. I really am praying that Bates will be freed and that whole issue will be resolved.
B007MJKOY4|4.0|The story takes a bit of time to unfold, and Gary is just frustratingly good at playing a tight lipped spy.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was so happy that I found this one after searching many hours, the story is good and the acting is amazing, it is one of my favorite now. I love those happy endings :)
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Absolutely love this movie. The price was excellent so was the movie. Totally get the concept and the special effects was remarkable.
B004I744AS|5.0|functional to the max. i didnt expect daily info, interesting. word games are the cherry atop the  cake!!<br /><br />will use it often.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This app is pretty fun, even for me and my sister, who are 10 and 12 years old, and littlest pet shop kind of is for younger kids. But I think the little animals are soooo cute! This app is good for when you are totally bored and want something fun to do. I think you really should get this app.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie is a great movie. I am a hopeless romantic and this movie touch that side of me. It was also a real life event story line.  If you have someone that is envolved in a relationship problem with infidelity, this is a perfect movie for them. It is worth the purchase or rental, which ever one you are doing. I highly recommend it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|A great movie.  My son loves this movie.  I got him the book too.  The story is good for all ages.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This was the first book I got for my Kendell.  I really enjoyed this story.  It was on the free list and I think young and old would really enjoy this story.  I remember it from when I was little and my mother read it to me.  It is even better when you can read it again.  Just love it!!
1423136802|5.0|My son loves this series.  Now he has the set and read all five of the books.  It's a great collection.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I couldn't get enough of the first book!  Oh, my!  It was lustful and made me feel young again!  However, the second and third books were just a little too much.  I wish I had stopped with #1.  Still, no regrets..
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use this mail program all the time. It is one of the easiest ones to use and does a great job
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Amazing movie! My 13 year old son wanted to watch this so that he would &#34;Know how to be a dad when he got married&#34;. Love my boys so much. I'm a single mom, but I took this movie to heart as well. Every moment and every word that we have with our children are so precious and important!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great way to keep in touch with relatives and friends who are not close to you. Excellent for uploading pictures.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I was unsure about this series when I read the books. I couldn't imagine what the movie would be like. They seemed to be targeting a younger audience than I thought would be appropriate. I feel that they amazing with the movie. Althought it is a very serious subject, they downgraded the violence some for the movie. The movie gives a message of hope. In a place where the governement controls everything and tears everything away from so many people, this young girl, Katniss, refuses to give in. She brings hope to bad circumstances and goes on to change things for everyone. It is a reflection of so much past and present in this world. Great movie. I love watching a movie with &#34;HOPE&#34; as the dominant factor.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Years ago I bought diner dash for my daughter and I ended up becoming addicted to it, and now cooking dash! I don't typically play any games....these are the only ones! love them!!
B003YUC9JI|5.0|I grew up with the old Karate Kids and I loved Karate Kid 1 and 2. I wondered about this remake, but it is an incredible movie. Family friendly with Comedy, Drama, and Adventure. Great Movie! We all 3 love it and now we own it ;-) All includes a 9 year old boy and a 13 year old boy and myself, the mom!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Very slow and depressing.  I expected some humor considering the cast.  Not much was solved and then all of a sudden at the end they were okay.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|We love super hero movies. We've seen them all. I have two boys, so that is what I have watched as my boys have grown up (now 9 and 13)  instead of Princess movies. I am disgusted with the language at the beginning of this movie and I don't think this movie is near as well made as the other movies. My boys didn't even ask for us to buy it. I bought it on Lightning deals because it was 1.97 and My older son may watch it with me one more time, but for the most part it won't get watched very much. I was disgusted with the language in X-men first class sprayed unneccessarily throughout as well.
B005LAII12|5.0|Saw it in the theater and had to have it at home. The behind the scenes stuff was just  great
B000LPS4BQ|5.0|We've owned the DVD since it came out and it is completely worn out from watching, so we have been working on getting blu-rays. My son was thrilled that I put this in his stocking for Christmas. I was skeptical and aggravated about Blu-rays coming out, but I am in love with the quality and will continue to collect. Anyhow.. Who doesn't love SCOOBY DOO?!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love it...... can't wait to see the movie.... such a great author.  Really knows how to pull the reader in.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|&#34;IT's so fluffy I could die&#34; has got to be one of my favorite kid movie lines ever. We say it so much around our house. One of my boys even has it as his ipod ring tone lol. This movie is too much fun! WE LOVE IT!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Reacts well to motion, quite realistic.  Enjoy the choice of tracks at the &#34;Y&#34;s - it makes for more interesting play.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I could not put this book down until I was finished! I didn't want the book to end at all!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Every time I'd have to stop reading, I'd spend the time until I had the chance to read again thinking about what was going to happen next.  My time not reading The Hunger Games was spent thinking about The Hunger Games. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson does it again. Great story and perfect casting!<br /><br />I loved the characters and the not so \\"normal\\" (though very \\"normal\\" to some) relationships and interactions.<br /><br />Finding ones true self and that anyone can have a change of heart for the better is, in my humble opinion, what life is all about. That's just the way it is and I like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a decent book. At some points I became bored because of all the crying but it always seemed to pick right back up.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I'm so glad I didn't go to the theater to see this movie but am a bit miffed I wasted $1.99 on the rental. The only thing that would make it worth that is if Wahlberg took off his shirt but it was so bad I couldn't take any longer.<br /><br />You need to be under 25 years old and completely stoned to find this movie remotely amusing.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book  was very relatable,and it brought a whole new perspective on things. I would recommend this book to others.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Love this band, and the songs really do make you want to roll your windows down and cruise! Great CD to drive to.
B008N1V11U|4.0|the game looks really awesome and I bought it but it wont download it keeps restarting over and over but I want this game to work because reviews look good.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun, challenging, and i love that you can unlock the expansion through hard work, instead of having to pay for it.
0385535147|2.0|I honestly don't know where to begin.  I have always loved John Grisham's book, but it seems like he is on a downward spiral.  I enjoyed the first part of the book, and then it took off on a tangent that I had no idea where it was leading.  The second half of the book was unbelievably bad and convoluted.  I had sympathy for the protaganist in the beginning of the book, but later grew to dislike him--and felt he had no right to the rewards that he was reaping.  I will check the next Grisham book out of the library.  It's just too expensive to keep buying books that disappoint.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It had a lot of twists and turns, which keep you going.  The ending was a little disappointing, but still worth reading.
0446554995|2.0|I must be having a bad hair day or month. I found this book plodding. It seems to have written by a committee. Lots of filler and a plot that dragged. Others have reviewed the story so I won't bore you with it. Get it from the library and save a few bucks. You can return it partially read and not feel guilty about having wasted the purchase price.
B002APU580|5.0|Loved it because it was updated and not stuffy! Actors did a great job and the scenery was beautiful. Fun entertainment.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Watched it with my wife and it was great.... the action is great and eventhough I knew the ending, it is still exciting.
0394417887|5.0|Probably the single best book about the Vietnam experience. Astute, sensory, as true a depiction of the political insanity as opposed to what the combat soldier experienced on the ground. The definitive discourse of my generation
1451629184|5.0|This is a good book when needing to read about someone who has been through tough times.  Recommend it for adult readers.
0446615641|5.0|this was a well written novel, a page turner, and the characters were all fascinating.  The book series was recommended by a friend, and I was not all disappointed.  Great read!
1451629192|2.0|This book is about a horrific experience.  Unfortunately being a victim of kidnap, imprisonment, rape, etc. does not make one a writer.  If an agent or publisher would have done their job appropriately this book would have been so much better.  As it turns out, it is a weak product that is a painstaking read.  I give two stars, one for the book, and one in sympathy for what Ms. Dugard endured.  Not recommended.
0446615625|5.0|I'm so grateful to my friend for recommending this series.  I compare his writing to James Patterson - not a lot of drag, and always keeping my interest.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|great price on an amazing format of an incredible show. I bought a copy for myself and gifted one to my sister.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Just like the others it was great.<br />They can never go wrong with these movies, fun for young and old.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It had a lot of twists and turns but was reasonably easy to follow for the number of characters in it. I plan on eventually reading them all.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|love the dr. who series, love all the twisted and turns through out the season, and easy to see on my kindle
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is ok. I am still reading it. This story is like making a snowball, it starts out very slow and it is starting to get bigger. I don't know if it is going to turn into a giant snowball or 3 smaller balls for a snowman.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love a good romance story which is why I love all of sparks novels, they are real page turners and you always become emotionally invested in his characters. Best of me is no different. While I do believe in true love  and love a good fairytale romance, my only complaint about sparks is that his books r always so completely unrealistic and almost have too perfect endings. They kind of make u feel like  gimme a break..... this would never happen. But maybe we all need a little bit of that in our lives. Wonderful story definitely worth reading!!!!!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|nice loved it story line was great but kind of fast but no matter did the job for me for a syfi.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Oh my gosh...i love this game!! Its like jewel quest but so much better. :) it is a must have.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|was not to bad was hoping for it to be more funnyer but wont see it again if i had to needed a better story line.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Difficult to understand the storyline and for some reason the only thing I can do right now is look at the file in the safe over and over nothing else will happen
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This was an easy game for my grandson to play.  Unfortunately, I don't get to play it until he goes home!  His scores are much higher than mine because his reactions are faster.
B003K16P3M|2.0|Had an interesting concept, and finally got interesting about 300 pages in but didn't really go anywhere. I never really got pulled into the story or felt a connection to the characters.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|As a fan of the original Total Recall:<br /><br />Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin<br />Directed by: Paul Verhoven<br />Runtime: 1 hour 54 minutes<br />Release Date: 06/01/1990<br /><br />I was dubious of any attempt to remake the old classic.  It's hard to top Schwarzenegger in an action role, after all.  But this one did it well.  They updated the story line and actually made it a little less far-fetched which makes the plot more accessible.  I was relieved that the modern, computer graphics did not become the star of the movie which all too often happens today.  Not that it isn't entertaining but this story had some human soul to it and that would have been lost.<br /><br />All in all it's a grand attempt and well done.  I enjoyed it although I still love the original, utterly far-fetched story line of the original.  By the way, if you have seen the original, watch for scenes that are an homage to that flick.  This is well worth watching.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|It is a great game and has great graphics ans awesome weapons which you can switch and Change character ease game :))
B000063UR2|5.0|I have one of my favorite movies in my collection.  So glad to have found this and am glad to be able to watch it over and over.
034553154X|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a very nice calender and I have been waiting to get the  version of the game of thrones calender or any game of thrones calender I love that it i9s the art version and I would recomend it to any GOT fan
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Spoiler at the bottom, you've been warned.<br /><br />So this book is, yet again, full of murmuring and muttering, whispering and cocked eyebrows. And sex, of course. But, at least this one had a more plot to it, it had obstacles for the characters to overcome, and better character definition than the first two.<br /><br />That said, the end was lame-duck. Happily ever after, and all the jumping around at the end was slightly annoying. And to end the book the way she did, with no real closure, I wasn't a fan. The way the books were written though, the overall maturity of the series, I didn't expect much more. I liked the final book, much more than the first one, slightly better than the second... it's an easy read, though at times obvious it's not written by an American (glad i had a kindle, there were a couple words not used here that I had to look up), which isn't a bad thing except that it's set in Washington, so you expect American language. I gave it four stars because, well, I like happy endings. What can I say?
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is wicked cool. You'll be cuttin fruit like a pro in no time, and this is free so get it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The novel is superb. A great story and very well told. I could read it over and over again for my whole life.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie is just plain fun.  It's exciting, has awesome effects, a powerful military, courage, and just generally makes me happy.  Also, Colonel Gadson is one of my heros in real life, and it was amazing to see him in his onscreen role.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|My two granddaughters had a wonderful time playing in the castle.  My 6 ft son even crawled inside to play with them.
0060775858|5.0|Good Night Moon almost never fails to lull your child, grandchild or baby sittee to sleep.  The pictures are wonderful.  There always seems to be a new detail in the illustrations that I have never seen before.  I have not tried the audible book as I love turning the pages as I read it to my various little ones.  I have given this book as a shower gift at least 15 times and it has always (eventually) been appreciated.
030759565X|5.0|From the first recipe we tried it was clear this collection is a winner. We look forward to many more scrumptious repasts.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Really fun and addicting! A must have! It is one of those apps that is great for a long commute on the bus or a long flight.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|sound so sweet. been a fan of hers forever. i would recommend this album of hers to all my friends.
0374214913|5.0|Even if you don't love books and bookstores, you'll find this fast-paced mystery irresistible. It has young Googlers in San Francisco frantically trying to figure out an ancient code that promises immortality, and it's told in a fun and optimistic tone. I couldn't put it down!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is fun and has its challenging moments. it helps my little girl with her counting as well as her shapes
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Loved this fun but meaningful movie. It is original with a great cast. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys something a bit different.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Always enjoyed this game for whiling away a wintry day. If you can do more than the basic and win then you are much more patient than I!
B001609SQA|1.0|Movie = Great,<br />digital copy = terrible<br /><br />I've purchased the digital copy of this movie and it has horrible \\"streaming\\" capabilities.  I've tried to watch it 4x now and each time (over the course of 2 weeks) has always lead to pauses every 15 seconds or less.  I've purchased many digital copies of movies (with great sucess) and rented quite a few but this is the only one to give me real trouble. I paused it for about 5 minutes and that kinda helped but not completely, this 'pausing' problem still plagues me.<br /><br />I'm quite upset as this is such a great film.<br />Amazon? wtf?
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|More romance for me than mystery but I still enjoyed the book. I just would most likely not read any more of her books.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Purchased as a gift for an adult.  Fun movie.  Shipped fast.  Arrived in perfect condition.  Great price.  Didn't have to fight the crowds in the stores.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great love story for all you hopeless romanticism out there! I could hardly put it down!!! Can't wait to start book two.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great little, very lightweight set of headphones for the price! Sound quality is surprisingly good and they really do stay on if you're a runner too!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great little game! Much better than cut the rope in my opinion. Harder to figure out the puzzles in my opinion. On the free version the ads are annoying but other than that its great! Worth removing the ads I guess. If you liked cut the rope, then get this one! I can't put it down! LOL
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Excellent action movie in the &#34;Bourne&#34; tradition.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the rooftop/building chase scene at the end.  I've seen that so many times.  The motorcycle chase was exceptionally well done.  The sound was a bit spotty too.  When I would get the sound loud enough to hear the characters talking, suddenly a bomb or gunshot would blast through the room at an unbearable level.  My dog jumped off the ottoman the first time this happened.  I rented it for 48 hours and have already watched it 3 times.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read this and all the fifty shades books twice. I can't get enough of them. I love Ana and Christian and I have a soft spot for Taylor.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I probably highlighted 15 sentences and 5 paragraphs and like 50 word this is so funny I got the first book for X-Mas and I was hooked ever since if you had to choose who your favorite character was I would pick Manny then Greg then Roderick my least favorite person is rowley he annoys me I don't know anyway I'm excited for book 8 if there is a book 8 coming sometime in the future well I give this book a 5 star rating good job  Jeff Kinney

B009IJJ712|5.0|Sherlock's accent is great. I wonder if it's native. Anyway, the plot is pretty good. It's not as good, of course, as the movie, but it's better than the reality shows and the other dectective shows out right now.  Lucy is a little disappointing; I wanted her to be Sherlock. But, oh well. I like the show so far and I have watched 5 episodes. I wish they made a few more episodes, but I will have to wait until February for season 2.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This was a great game on ps2 and this portable version has improved upon that formula with added content and slight social components. The one thing that some purists who played the original might dislike is that chie has a different voice actor and you aren't able to switch to the jp language dub with english subs.<br /><br />The game doesnt require any prerequisite knowledge of previous person or smt games and can be enjoyed by people who love rpgs and people don't so much but like a great story and building up relationships with the other characters for a deep experience.<br /><br />tldr; 95/100 for rpg fans, 75/100 for people who dont like rpgd battles but want a nice story (you can choose very easy without interfering with your story and social experiece.) For those in it entirely for an amazing story you will probably derive more enjoyment from Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward or the prequel 999 (which unfortunately is only on ds.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I'm not particularly a Johnny Depp fan, but I enjoyed him in this movie.<br /><br />It's funny.  it's bizzarre.  It's entertaining.  The plot is not exactly complex, but what do you expect from a movie of this genre?<br /><br />We watched this form Amazon Instant Video.  No problems with the streaming, no problem with the download.  Much, much better than driving to the video store!!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I have read other books by this author and really have to enjoy his style of writing.  The story lines are always entertaining, the characters are equally developed, and the action is not predictable.  This book is another one that is worth reading.  Fast-paced, will not bore you!  Will have you looking for time to make sure you can read it!  Good book!
B00866JL96|4.0|Before I watched this movie, I, of course, had read the Nicholas Sparks books.  It is actually one of my favorite novels because unlike most of Sparks' stories, it doesn't end by ripping out your heart...<br /><br />The movie does a good job of telling the story as Sparks intended.  True, a lot of the book was left out, but if it wasn't, the movie would be about 6 hours long.  If you can accept that you aren't going to see every single page brought to life, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />My only &#34;weird moment&#34; of this movie is accepting Zac Efron as grown up enough to be in his rather well-fitting undies on film, kissing a woman on screen.  Part of me was screaming inside &#34;That's Troy Bolton!  This is just wrong!!!&#34;  But, he really does a good job in this film.  I guess he's more than a Disney actor after all.<br /><br />Enjoyable movie.  Only a two-tissue one, unlike most of Sparks' stories.  Safe to watch in public without danger of being reduced to a bucket of tears.

A great way to observe Christmas  Completists should definitely add this one!  The band is one of my favorites from a time when talent trumps technology and sampling covered sins.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not going to read this book... the hype was too much and I just didn't want to read it. I thought that it couldn't really be that good, as good as everyone is saying....<br /><br />Then, once the movie came out, I secretly downloaded the book and began reading it. I think I read this book faster than any other book I have ever picked up. Wow! This was awesome. Seeing the growth and depth in the characters, the action and adventure... this book had it all. Thank you Ms. Collins for bringing this amazing book to us!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Singing scenes were good fun but the rest of the movie fell pretty flat, if not downright confusing or illogical at times.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is my new favorite Disney movie. My wife and I first saw it in the theater and fell in love with it. Now, having it in our home, we enjoy watching it whenever we get a chance. Merida is our new, favorite Disney Princess. The story is very well done and it's look on family dynamics is really strong. Some of the scenes may be a little scary for the little ones, but overall, this is a great, feel good movie for everyone!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Intricately well crafted, exciting, intelligent (as always).  I found myself reading slowly because I didn't want it to end.  Once again, Pendergast is undeniably the quintessential detective and hero<br /><br />read it, but you'll be sad when its over because you''l want more
B003O86FMW|4.0|Once finishing the first book in this series, I wondered where the author would go for this second book. Like the first, this book pulled me in and didn't let me go till the end. The writing is very detailed and imaginative. I read through this quicker than the first and have to say that I enjoed it very much. A really great read!

B0084IG7KC|5.0|Yeah, there are always &#34;the book is better&#34; comments, and you know what, the book was better. But, in light of taking a 350+ page book and make a movie, the crew did a FANTASTIC job with this one! The main themes and heart of the story are still there in the movie. Some parts are as haunting as the book. So, read the book and get all that it has to offer then watch the movie and see a great adaptation of the written work.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got mine for free with my T3i during the Black Friday deals so it is difficult to be disappointed with it at all. It really is a great camera bag for what I need. The main compartment uses a velcro system for organization and it makes the way that things fit very convenient and flexible. The other compartments are useful as well. Since mine came for free I don't really know how this bag stands up to others as far as price, but I can tell you that its design is very practical easy to use.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it's very plain and I am into things with a little more art and style. My friend got a dslr bag for his 60D and I don't remember the brand but it looks very cool. However, the compartments and the way his bag is built is much less convenient for storing and accessing your camera and accessories.<br /><br />All in all this is a great bag with a very practical and very flexible build. It won't impress with looks but it certainly will do what it needs to do.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Well, after reading the first two books in this series, I had high hopes for a strong ending and I honestly didn't get it.... Too many times, the author took the easy way out in this book by the main character always being hurt and missing some big points of action. Then the ending, really? Can Collins be ok with ending the series this way. Now, maybe my feelings were made to be this way by Collins on purpose, and that's cool...but, compared to the first two, this book just let me know in more ways than one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was an amazing out turn. Love this book! Cannot wait to read the next to see what happens.

B000I9YLUI|4.0|I love Pride and Prejudice the book. I've read it a dozen times, so like most true fans, I would like movies about to stick true to the real story. But I appreciate this movie a lot. I've seen four different Pride and Prejudice movies and in all of them, I think Keira Knightley is just the perfect Elizabeth. She's the right age, the right look and seems to have the right spunk. I enjoyed the unraveling of Matthew MacFadyen's Darcy. I felt he did all he could with the character, given the time constraints. I did like Colin Firth's version but I felt Jennifer Ehle was way too old to be Elizabeth. Did I love Colin Firth's Darcy? Sure but he had the luxury of a mini-series to make women understand him better.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is a quick P&P fix, using some creative liberties to meet the challenge of a movie. But the cinematography is breathtaking, the music excellent and the cast is brilliant. I loved it.

0316044695|5.0|Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and co-author Patrick Robinson have penned the true story of what may come to be regarded as the quintessential combat book taken from the fields of valor in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Told in first person narrative by Luttrell, the book begins with his life-long desire to be a Navy SEAL while growing up on a ranch in the plains of Texas.  I have read several books that deal with SEAL qualification training - BUD/S and beyond.  However, none that I have encountered as of the writing of this review has captured the grueling nature of the ordeal in the way it's presented in `Lone Survivor'.<br /><br />Once fully qualified Luttrell is then dispatched overseas where he is part of a six-man SEAL team, which itself is part of a larger Special Warfare Command unit.  The topography, culture and rhythm of a foreign land and deployment are well-defined as Luttrell allows the reader `into his head'.  His powers of observation are keen.  Of course, this is a reflection of his training.<br /><br />There exists a brotherhood of sorts in the uniformed services.  I felt it when I was in the USAF.  Among the SEAL community this bond runs extraordinarily deep.  Its foundation likely rests in the hazards associated with the tasks at hand and the truism that your life literally depends on the person next to you.<br /><br />When things went to hell in the USAF we referred to it as a `cluster f***'.  Luttrell and his SEAL team members had a sense that things would not go well on their last mission before they were `inserted'.  Sadly, their premonition proved correct.  It was the SEAL version of a `CF'.<br /><br />The story that unfolds is one that will be retold countless times by those in and out of uniform.  In book form it is the contemporary equivalent of `The 13th Valley' by John Del Vecchio.  The latter captured the essence of a patrol gone very badly in Viet Nam.<br /><br />Simply, I could not put this book down.  As a reader I felt incredibly close to Luttrell and the members of his team, who, one by one, died valiantly defending themselves and each other under the withering fire of Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorists.  The author is the Lone Survivor.  At the time I recall hearing the news report of a Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan downed by enemy fire.  We learned later it was full of SEALs on their way to rescue Luttrell and his team.<br /><br />To say that the hand of the Lord guided Luttrell seems to this reviewer an accurate characterization.  That he lived to recount an engaging and compelling story of bravery, devotion to duty and the SEAL brotherhood is simply remarkable.ell and the members of his team, who, one by one, died valiantly defending themselves and each other under the withering fire of Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorists.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a very interesting telling of what it takes to be a SEAL and what SEALs do. My concerns are that their job is killing. I am grateful that they brought justice to Bin Laden, but the price was too high to pay. We should have placed our resources into getting Bin Laden in the first place and not invading two countries. My other concern is that war should never be glamorized. There is nothing noble in taking the life of another person's life. Killing should never be characterized as another day at the office.

Why pay $30 for expensive Apple thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter for your macbook pro retina, which will only work for mac.  Instead get this Anker USB 3.0 adapter, which will work on your Macbook and Windows platform.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*  Works with Mac & Windows Platform.<br />*  Great tool for IT professionals, very handy as a secondary nic.<br />*  A great substitute for the thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter from Apple.<br />*  Unlike the Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, the Anker adapter has a slightly longer cord so you can move it out of the way.<br />*  Windows 7 did not need drivers; the adapter was simply plug & play.<br />*  Great NIC replacement for laptops with bad network cards.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*  Gigabit only over USB 3.0, however all future laptops have USB 3.0 so not a big deal.<br />*  The driver comes on a mini-cd.  Had to insert the CD in windows, and then copy the macbook driver to a USB drive in order to get the driver to work on a macbook.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: If you are not getting a gigabit connection even after connecting to a USB 3.0 port, make sure your network cable is CAT 5E/6 or above.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My kids love this movie, it arrived on time which mattered most for me. I've been collecting all Tink movies.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hardy is a power house and FINE babe!<br />I highly recommend this movie. I plan on watching it again because I want to watch my man Forrest (Tom Hardy)<br />brass knuckle punch someone in the face again.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its a fun game you don't have to pay money or wait days to play. I enjoy this as a time killer.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Watching this movie will put you to sleep within 5 minutes of playing.<br />Dont waste your money, time or brain cells. Major disappointment!
B007SGM084|5.0|this is the best books i have ever read i hope more come out cause i know that i'll by them so me n my friends can read them!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I've only read one other book by Mr. McEwan..Amsterdam.. but may have to go back and read all the others.  This was so good, the writing was such that I found myself rereading passages just for the beauty of the writing!  When I finished reading I clutched the book/kindle to my chest (haven't ever done that before)..just loved it.  Hated for it to end..
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This is the best Patricia Cornwell in quite awhile. Kay Scarpetta has always been one of my favorite characters. This was action packed and I couldn't pinpoint the bad guy until almost the end. Well done!
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|My kids and I had been watching a lot of zombie films lately just to sample the variety available. Of course we hit some stinkers and low budget wastes of time, but that's part of the fun. I fired this one up, expecting the worst from an old-West zombie film. What I got instead was a gripping storyline well-told, with a surpisingly good musical score. This film had an epic, almost emotional quality to it, and even my normally cynical 17-year-old admitted that he really enjoyed it. The zombies were almost secondary to the story, which foscuses on the characters. This film is head and shoulders above most of the zombie films offered recently, and well worth your time to see.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|We don't have HBO, so we buy or rent on demand, interesting series we would like to watch. Only on season one of this series, love the characters, the storyline & the nudity...Meo
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It is a wonderful movie and I wanted it on dvd with the original actors. Item was just as described.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Disappointed that the directions for use were so poor.  Wanted to play other types of solitare with it but cannot figure out how to do so.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|It doesn't work period. Also the format is horrible. Why isn't it just like it is for apple products? Fix now please.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is our favorite family Christmas comedy. We have played it many times and BluRay is even better. Love it.
B000002LND|4.0|I love Madonna's music. This particular collection is my favorite.I listen to it alot. It brings back great times from that musics era.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I knew this movie has not gotten not-so-good reviews but still wanted to watch another Bourne film. Seems there is a lack of character development of the new main character. Also as a viewer, I felt as if I was just watching a series of events that seem very disconnected from one another. The new agent (main character) seems to have no color of his own, and this makes me not interested in getting to know the character.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a Great series. My daughter really liked it and it was age appropriate. Would recommend this to anyone I know.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I chose this rating because the movie was funny. I did not like all of the fowl language. It was very hard to enjoy the movie with the &#34;F&#34; bomb being dropped with every other word!
B007N8RULO|5.0|good app just wish no ads between games. oh well it won't keep me from playing the game. A plus app!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie made for a great family movie night. I was worried that the mean bear might scare my four year old, but she loved the movie.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|very good movie. very funny. kept me entertained the whole time. always a plus.  was a little slow in some areas, but not too bad.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My four year old loves this movie! She watches it over and over again. I enjoyed watching it with her the first time. I though that it was pretty cute.
B005P58PIO|5.0|AMAZING show! .. great series.  Loved the whole thing.  Very action packed and entertaining the whole time. Never a slow episode. Always keeps you entertained.
B00A0L7PE8|5.0|Since Musicology Prince has been trying to remind everyone of what was great about Old School. Not just old school Prince but old school soul/funk and rock and roll. This song is kind of a back to basics but not in a boring way. I've heard a few people say it was bland, it's probably because they didn't really listen to the words or they do not care for the toned down Prince. Everyone in the know knows he is now a Jehovah's Witness so there is no profanity or overtly sexual lyrics (well not like anything he's done in the past). But to dismiss new music because it doesn't sound like the old stuff is silly and really is a way to miss out on great music. While he has definitely reminded us of the old MLPS sound, he isn't trying to just bring back the glory days he's just trying to make sure there is great music out there. In an era of computer generated musical performers who's whole repetoire is more or less just point and click, it's great to hear real music being played by one of Rocks's great masters. It's a definite Rock/Soul vibe with a small bit of late 70s thrown in. I just hope this is a tease of what is to come, if so the next album should be great. A definitely must have even though the remixes are a bit bland and something that Madonna would probably approve of/like (but I wouldn't) this is still worth the purchase for the original single version and slightly extended version. I miss singles:) Nice to see people are still interested in buying them. This is definitely worth the price....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Got seriously hooked on Hunger Games and I found myself not being able to put Catching Fire down. It was such a fast read!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My wife and daughters really like Tink.  I really enjoyed this movie too, it is fun and very cute. Stunning graphics.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. There really are no words to express the AMAZING ways this book made me feel. But I think the word hopeful sums it up nicely. Sky and holder share an amazing relationship that spans their entire lives. It truly is amazing how they connect and how holder is so perfect for sky. Collene Hoover, all I can say is wow!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for nieces and nephews. An inspiring story and great for a movie night. Great for teens.
B0020M99LC|5.0|I really liked it - I'm not a huge James Bond fan but this was great!  I would recommend it!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I couldn't find this item in stores at a decent price so went on here and bought it at a great price.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Good time killer. Bonus is that its free. Great way to keep the kids busy. happy day ever1
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is so fun and entertaining! It's hard to go back to just regular solitaire after trying  Spider. It has become my nightly game.
075669812X|5.0|I have never been disappointed with any book I have purchased and given as a gift if it is by DK Publishing.  This book is no exception !  Our grandsons who are in kindergarten immediately opened the books and began exploring :)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Stupid yet addictive! I wish I would have thought of it! Since it was free, how can you go wrong?
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|fun game.  the mini games are challenging and offer a skip which is nice.  after playing a few days it asked for money to finish.  is listed as free.  the description doesn't say free trial, pay for full version.  the same with the other 3 G5 games i downloaded.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|This would be an awesome game if it worked as it implies. CHAT works occassionally. That is my biggest complaint and I reported it numerous times to no avail.
0792839749|5.0|A great family movie, something you do not see much of anymore that has no violence not to mention starring the great Dick Van Dyke!
B005TZFZMO|4.0|Love this CD for its variety of emotions.  Can dance to most of the tracks.  My favorite tracks are 2, 3, 4, and 8.  Vocal range is a little limited, but still love Rihanna's rawness and honest sounding voice.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app. I hate being without my kindle... But when I am, I can easily whip out my android and read anytime!
B006O3MU96|5.0|Enjoy just sitting there jumping and not falling off the lines. Its mindless fun, Would love to see another season.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun and a time passer. It can be challenging at times but fun to finally win the puzzle!! Great game!
B009LY72LQ|4.0|It is a great alternative to just dolls, my girls love getting a little more creative, building there own doll each time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The book, like all Tom Clancy books is a spell binder that you can not put down. He has a fantastic ability to introduce all the characters and then bring them together in time for a spellbinding story. I have read almost all of his books and this one is another hit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a basic calculator this is awesome. I love the large screen and easy type format. Obviously not an office calculator but perfect for home use!
B000W07EKW|4.0|Very entertaining and action inspiring. Never able to anticipate the outcome which I enjoy. Most movies nowdays are either stupid,annoying or so predictial that they insult your intelligence
B004OR199G|5.0|Kris Carr has a no nonsense style of writing. She states facts and is quite truthful about our food sources and she doesn't care about the politics of the food and drug administration. This book will change your view on what you put in your body! It will surely make you think before you eat! I have never eaten so much and lost so much weight!! I feel like a new person and I am no longer contributing to the cruelty of animals!!  If you think our food  source is being protected - think again!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked this book a lot it was really good and a touching story. I would recommend it to all of my friends
051755075X|4.0|David Ogilvy is one of the titans of advertising, and this book provides timeless insights into the business and psychology of the advertising business.  Covering print, TV, radio and direct marketing - as well as career advice for the aspiring advertising professional, the book - though now 30 years old, still resonates.  The element emphasized by Ogilvy that allows it to maintain his relevance was a quote he took from Bill Bernbach - human nature hasn't changed over the years, and won't.  Advertising appeals to our fundamental nature, and Ogilvy captures it in a way that is both informative and entertaining.  Full of color and black & white ads and examples, the book also gives the 21st century reader a nostalgic look at 20th century advertising.  Interesting and worth reading.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This apps deliver on its promise. Simple to operate and give you a quality product with various choices.I am really very satisfied
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book for middle and high school and even college readers. Suzanne Collins really captivate  you in this story , when I stop reading it feels like if I don't hurry and go back too might miss something.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This was a page turner didn't want to put it down when it seemed to be near conclusion the story had more to tell and delightfully kept going
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is by far my favorite movie of the year 2012. Incredible acting, visually wonderful, great music ...  Just magic.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was just AMAZING!! Not surprised that it would be coming from Rick Riordan. If you like Greek/Roman legends, I suggest this book to you. It adds a modern twist which makes it really cool.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is beyond amazing! The story line will keep  you captivated. From start to finish each episode really stands on it own.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game works very well and is easy to load.  It would have been better to have the &#34;deck&#34; at the bottom rather than next to the Aces piles which makes it a little confusing but all in all the game works well and is relaxing.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I got this DVD within 2 days of ordering it! I couldn't be happier with the service and obviously I love this movie or I wouldn't have ordered it. But I'm mostly stoked about how fast I got it and what great tracking and packaging was applied to my order.
B000FC10WU|4.0|You have to be a Miss Marple fan but i am and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Such a great price too!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|low quality and must make purchases to play. I didn't want to have to track kids spending so I removed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book, makes you think outside the box. Definitely have to read the second book NOW! I'm left hanging!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great short story, as always, by Stephen King! Like to be able to purchase just one at a time! Looking forward to more...Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful! So glad I read it, finally! Watching the movie first I was worried, but I'm glad I saw it first.. it made me appreciate the book more.
0307387178|4.0|The premise itself is fascinating- putting together the pieces of a man who disappeared from his upper-middle class home and moved out West with the goal of living off the land in Alaska. McCandless hitchhiked and \\"tramped\\" around Arizona and Southern California and slowly worked his way North. He picked up odd jobs and made friends with his honest, kind personality. People appreciated his intelligence (he was college graduate) and determination to be independent. McCandless represents what we all wish we could do (at some point in our lives)- the ability to take off and just go. He gives away the $25,000 he had saved, burns his money, abandons his car, and carries minimal material goods. McCandless eventually finds his way to Alaska and dies (this is no spoiler, folks) alone in a bus, cause of death likely from starvation (or from consuming moldy seeds). Krakauer uses his journals, pictures and interviews with those he touched along the way to piece together his story.<br /><br />It's not all a romantic story that Walden, Thoreau, London or whoever would be proud of, though. McCandless makes a lot of stupid mistakes that cost him his life. First of all, he doesn't carry maps with him, nor does he make any sort of effort to carry any sort of gear besides a few guns. This part really frustrates me; I understand not wanting to form attachment to material goods and to truly get in touch with the land, but unless you're a trained naturalist or a super hardcore Boy Scout it's a mistake. He leaves a family behind that is desperate with worry, including a sister he is especially close to (I found myself getting really angry and upset picturing my younger brother doing something like this). I had to remember that this wasn't fiction; Krakauer didn't create him, he was just reporting on what had happened.<br /><br />Speaking of Krakauer, I felt a few parts of the text were unnecessary. A whole section is devoted to Krakauer's experience in Alaska when he was younger- I wanted to read about McCandless' life, not his. I know he viewed his research as cathartic, given the parallels he drew between his life and the wandering Alex/Chris, but they were just plopped in at the end in a self-centered insertion. He also includes background on other Alaskan adventurers that I thought were not needed- at 203 pages it seemed that perhaps he was just trying to stretch his word count a tad.<br /><br />All in all, this was a really interesting, quick read. It wasn't quite what I expected, but I still definitely recommend this (although if you haven't read Into Thin Air read that instead).d to read about McCandless' life, not his.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|Great book!!!!! Couldn't put it down read it all in less then 8 hours and I am a mom of 3 kids!!!
B005ETANC2|1.0|Did not receive DVD ordered. Received correct DVD box as titled, but received a completely different DVD, (a nature DVD was inside box), not the featured movie.  However, Amazon was very helpful with return/refund.  .
0060763280|5.0|Thanks for the book. we got it in time for our X-mas white elephant party. the book is in very good shape.
B007SSDS24|3.0|The movie sure made you wish you didn't want to encounter these energy consuming creatures. You didn't stand a chance. A new type of evil but the story line seemed old.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It is refreshing to finally read a *real* science fiction story. The Martian follows the classic motif of the marooned explorer/traveler. Mark Watney, thought to have died when a horrific dust storms puts a premature end to his crew's mission on Mars, chronicles his striving to survive the almost non-existent atmosphere and deadly cold temperatures.<br />Mark Watney's logs show us a man who is resilient and resourceful. The humor and self-deprecations that surely mask fear, makes us smile and even chuckle as he works to survive and plan for his eventual (hopefully) rescue.<br />*The Martian* is a page turner that keeps us holding our breath hoping that the author doesn't crush our hopes as we root for Watney, the crew of the Hermes, and. . . yes. . . NASA.<br /><br />I have slogged through many science fiction tomes thinking there just *had* to be a jewel out there (oh, yes, I have read many a good story, too). *The Martian* is that jewel.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As much as I loved the movie, the book was so much better. It was so much more in depth than the movie. I know you can't have everything in the movie but I wish there was more to make it longer. I saw the movie three times before I read the book. I really wish I would've read the book first so I could've imagined everything like I love to do. But I really recommend everyone to read this book.  I am truly inspired.
B000EUDAWG|3.0|I bought this remote controlled tarantula for my grandson as a joke for a Christmas present.  He enjoys playing with it
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I just got the app and I worked with it. It played one of my songs that was already downloaded the other songs would not work!! In my opinion this app sucks ! I just wanted a music player on my kindle fire !
B003TSEEDY|5.0|To put it simply, I selected this book as it was said to be good by a friend of mine. As I am still a teenager, the characters are seriously relatable, and I appreciate how alike they are to me and my peers although they are works of fiction, and even from a different time.
1603429999|5.0|I wasn't taught circular knitting as a kid, so this workshop really helps lead the beginner (or advanced knitter) through the process clearly.  Demonstrates common problems, and how to fix them.  Good book for someone taking up circular knitting for the first time.  Not intimidating at all, and nicely organized.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book! Very riveting. I can't wait to start in on the next one. Very entertaining!
1603427244|4.0|I grabbed this because I know exactly ONE way to cast on and ONE way to bind off.  Clear and concise, a great reference to have on hand!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Do not buy this book and how d poo b Yuri o uhh delete movies from the cloud please help
B0092QITO2|2.0|This was a total copy cat of the original movie. They made added so much fighting to the movie that made it irritating to watch. The added parts made the plot all over the place and if you didn't see the original you would never know what was going on. They should have left this one alone.<br />Totally enjoy the original movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br />only gave it two stars because of the video  background.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|A great way of understanding our language cc stiffness rd tree add to your website and e-commerce store based upon the first time required to your computer and e-commerce site is a great deal
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I love the book as it was my baby. There is nothing I disagree on. I recommend this book to everyone.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it's the best game I've ever played and nothing beats it<br /><br />I couldn't ask for a better game it's awesomeness
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Would like to be able to use at least one custom song with free app but otherwise it is nice.
B009FZFONO|5.0|As the story continues, the characters adapt to their new world and now they must fight other humans.  It will be interesting to see the black and white marathon - that will take out a lot of the gore.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My fiance and I love watching this show!!! We have seen allof the seasons and love watching the new ones on Amazon Prime when they are made available!  Keep the seasons coming!!!!
159420411X|5.0|The whole country needs to read this book. Probability and statistics should inform all of our comlex problem solving and our collective grasp is a D--maybe an F.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I always enjoy reading Danielle Steele novels.  I couldn't put it down.  Enjoyed reading about Heloise growing up and her relationship with her father.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The premise sounded and look great on the previews but that was all there was with just more of the same. Disappointing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it was a true love story with a twist that not all couples endure. The fact that both teens had their own cancer and Augustus seemed stronger at the beginning made it that more shocking when he passed. I recommend this book to anyone and it's a good book for either males or females which is usually hard to find.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|OoJust a good read. Well crafted but on to the next product. Just wasn't as engrossing as some of the others
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and easy to use. I enjoy playing solitaire and this game is a nice distraction during an otherwise ho-hum day.
B009M7G1PU|3.0|My book group chose to read Lady Chatterley's Lover rather than the 50 Shades book. One wonders how LCL could ever have been banned as it's love scenes are tame by today's standards--or lack of.  I am glad to have read this in the context of watching Downton Abbey on television.  One can imagine the Chatterley family as neighbors to the Grantham family, experiencing and resisting the same social changes.  So much attention has been paid to the erotic aspects of the novel over the years, I had no idea D.H. Lawrence was such a Luddite yearning for a pre-industrial age.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, reading LCL provides additional insights into the era.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It was a good movie, the actors are what made it good.  Without the main star actors, not sure would have been as good.  I like Amy Adams and she did the best job in this movie.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|difficult navigate even the simple tutorials . a sound cup size is it sounds like it's giving directions but it is iindiscernible
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game because it comes with free puzzles. If you get those done and get bored buy 18 more for 99 CENTS! You can have 35 puzzle pieces or 215. It's up to you. And! The pictures are so beautiful.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Very interesting and fun, but sometimes it's hard to remember who's who because there are so many characters with competing interests.  I really enjoy watching this series!
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She opened the DVD and found what looked like a bootlegged DVD. The DVD was packaged as though it was new, but the folded case that the DVD was held in appeared to be slightly worn. I have decided to return the DVD.
1608871517|5.0|Michael  Jackson was an  incredible musical  Genius  and touched  so  many lives with his great god giving talent,  the other side of the machine that took  MJ to another level  was of course his  style and the way he wore his threads. nobody else dressed like  MJ and made the kind of statement as he did. from head to toe  Michael  Joe Jackson had his own Swag  and made  you look.  this book covers the many looks over the years and the themes  used and what it represented.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I shop on Amazon all of the time, but I never write reviews. It just seems as though the quality of the products I have bought recently (DVD's and CD's) have not been good. My daughter opened The Hunger Games DVD that I purchased for her on Christmas day, and we decided to watch the movie about two days ago. We were able to watch the movie up until the part where Cinna was preparing Katniss to enter the games, and the DVD just began to skip. My daughter took the DVD out to see if there was any dust in the DVD player, but there was not. Thereafter, she wiped off the DVD and tried to play it again, but it continued to skip at scene 13. Afterwards, we tried to play the DVD on the three other DVD players in our house, but the DVD would not play passed scene 13. I am very disappointed with this purchase, and will be returning the DVD.

B00AHQNHSY|2.0|Kept closing a minute or two into the video.  Maybe it just is not ready for  the HD version yet.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Pro: Awesome Alberta posing as Alaska winter scenery.<br />Con: Everything else about this derivative, pointless rip-off.<br />The only thing &#34;Bourne&#34; about this movie is the promoter's desire to ride Ludlum's coat tails.  Yes, I know, the Bourne movie trilogy wasn't true to the original novels, but at least it had some resemblance to the story line.  The 4th &#34;reboot&#34; is something else, and that something is no part of Ludlum's Legacy.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Best free app ever!  Go get this game....what are you waiting for? It's completely awesome. Hurry get it now! I love it!!!!
B005K2YRVG|4.0|This case is a great case, I got the one that is \\"Black PU/Black Perf/Black Perf\\" and advertised as fitting a Kindle Fire but I actually got it for my Nexus 7. The device fits snugly into the case and it looks cool.<br /><br />Everything is fine except for a nice puncture mark on the back of the case. The item arrived like this and I noticed it after 5 mins of unwrapping it. I hate that merchants think they can send out messed up merchandise and \\"roll the dice\\" on whether the customer will send it back for being damaged. This is my second Timbuk2 case and I will continue to buy them but perhaps next time I will get it straight from the Timkbuk2 website. Since this item was a relatively cheap I don't think i'll be returning it for an exchange. This is the second \\"worn\\" item received from Amazon this holiday season so my faith is certainly reduced.
147015658X|1.0|This is a horrible excuse for a printed book. It was evidently downloaded from a site featuring public domain books, and printed with an on-demand printing service, with absolutely no formatting or other work done to the book- as evidenced by the fact that the header at the top of each page ACTUALLY SAYS &#34;Mansfield Park.txt&#34;. The font is an unreadable san-serif font. This is an unbelievable rip-off, pure and simple. AVOID!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game is interesting, keeps my attention. Good graphics and story line. I'm stuck right now though. Hope to figure it out soon.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm not typically a fan of movie franchises but Marvel's Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man & Thor got me hooked.  I love how the stories from the movies have led up to The Avengers.  Each of the main characters were given their fair share of lines & focused upon, which is kind of hard with a smart alec like Tony Stark.  The showdown in NY with the alien army is a bit cliche; thank goodness for Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki.  Joss Whedon has made a great and fun movie for all to see.  Whedon, JJ Abrams & Christopher Nolan seem to be the current & future kings of blockbuster movies.  I'm looking forward to Avengers 2, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, Captain America 2......
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use my Kindle daily, and this app allows me to keep track of daily activities or just lists of chores or for shopping. Love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I get so caught up in the book it's hard to put down.  The best way to explain it is awesome!!!!!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Many local papers only cover local events or very brief national news. This allows worldwide news coverage. Very interesting and informative.
B009B8YZKS|1.0|The movie is one and a half hour long.  You have 55 minutes of a cheap and slow paced teenager drama that is worse than a fan made movie. Then, suddenly the movie starts and it becomes the usual alien-chasing-humans action sequence until it ends. The credits come, and after that you have the bloopers that kills all the mood.<br /><br />When you meet real young war vets who have scars from war, you understand that the screenplay was made by someone who does not know any war vet.<br /><br />The music is awesome and it has very good landscapes from time to time.  So you may like to buy the soundtrack instead of the movie.<br /><br />If you are a fan of good scifi movies, I do not recommend this movie at all.  It is boredom in 2/3 of the movie and some 1/3 of movie with some forgettable action sequences.  \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is far better as it has a similar teenager style, but it was better made in terms of drama, action and pace.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The movie, Lion King is clear and the sound is very good.  I did not regret purchasing this movie.  The price is reasonsble.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Grueling,  sensual, panting for more..wish it didn't end so sudden. Can't wait to read the next book. To bad I'll have to wait.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|The contents was repetive and lots of the same situations, I did like to read the mental story of the characters
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Clear and defined pictures with up-to-date forecasts.  Why I like this app is because it allows for storage of several different cities.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I like it, but the movies were better for this story because they provided visuals of the scenes.  Hard to imagine the spirits without the visuals.
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|Loved Aerosmith since I was a very little girl.  This is a great album.  Kind of reminds you of the early years.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|The story was great...but I had a difficult time going off on the tangents with Oscar Wilde.  This was written for a time when people had only books for entertainment.  Too many words these days are too &#34;binding.&#34;
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I beat it in just a few hours. Not too bad though. I wouldn't buy it though. It was free when I used it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This account was really what battles are like and shows how close knit group the Seals are.  It also points out how our liberal press really does not report the facts.  They are probably one of our military's worst enemy.  When we go to battle and have to worry about tip toeing around about where and when we are allowed TO fight it is a LOOSING battle.  VIET Nam is a good example.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|PIANO IS FUN TO PLAY.IT HAS A FULL KEYBOARD AND A VARIETY OF SOUNDS YOU CAN MAKE THAT DO SOUND LIKE THE ACTUAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VOLUME IS NOT VERY LOUD WHICH WAS A MINUS FOR ME BUT I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THE APP.
B0086700CM|5.0|cool game lots of things to do would really get it and very addicting i could never get off it on it 24 7 lol  ut GET IT!!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|VERY FUN AND EASY TO PLAY. GAME REALLY MAKES YOU THINK AND HELPS YOU TO RECOGNIZE PATTERENS. THERE ARE MANY VERSIONS WITHIN THE GAME WHICH MAKES I REALLY FUN TO PLAY.VERY ADDICTIVE AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Captivating easy read! Once you get sucked in you can't put it down. Can't wait to read the next one.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|What a fun CD, bring back memories of the songs from the 80's what a good time that was. Just buy it you will not be disappointed.
B00881VLCE|4.0|many free ones to get and will keep you busy for hours on the harder levels. i like the puzzle choices too.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these as a gift. My son said that they are awesome. He said that not only is the sound superior, but that these headphones are extremely comfortable. The first night using them, he didn't realize that it was 6:00am before he took a break.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love this game. I played the free one first and than decided to buy it. I am a grandma and my lttle granddaughters love it as well.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I love these movies, and this was a great purchase. Less than half off new, but still picture perfect condition. Great buy.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I gave the book 5 stars. Childs did a great job introducing the character, but leaving little unknown qualities out until they were needed.  Jack Reacher is tough and always is thinking before he takes action....and action is aplenty!  I look forward to reading the additional Reacher novels.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Purchased as a gift and was a big hit!  Easy to put together and fun.  My son has worn it everyday since getting it.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|It was not as good as the other Bourne movies but they really tried to incorporated with the rest of the series.  I think that it could of had a better storyline  to explain the new program instead of the sexual chemistry build up like the first Bourne movie. On the plus side it is a action packed and explosive movie. If it was a stand alone move it would have been a 5 star movie!
B00687XO1G|5.0|Simply put, Criterion did a superb job on this transfer of a pretty old movie.  In fact, my spouse and myself would rate the end product as fantastic!  The movie contains a stellar cast, which contributes to the absolute enjoyability of the movie.  Keep it up Criterion.
B007MDB548|4.0|I have Six girls and the younger four watched 4 times in 2 Days. Disney is doing a good job of breaking Tinker Bell out from the Peter Pan series.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|12-29-2012:  This isn't a review, so no need to click if it's NOT helpful!  But I think most fans of the series would like to know that it was announced this week that actor Dan Stevens, who certainly plays one of the central characters in the storyline, has chosen to leave the series after the current 3rd season. Will they recast it or kill off Matthew Crawley after he produces a male heir with Lady Mary?  Stay tuned!
B0092QITO2|3.0|Great movie that just didn't live up to the first but better acting than the first.  Great special effects and better acting need to watch it but DON'T compare.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I have always wanted to get this MP3 album but did not wanted to pay the full price. But when I saw it for the price of $5.99 I could not resist. It is a terrific album. I totally love this album. I have listened to it several times since I bought it and I still love lintening to it. It is simply a great album. My only regret is that I bought it too soon. A couple of days after I bought it, the price came down to the rediculas price of $1.99 or 99 cents. Something like that. Finally. great album. Buy it now.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|It was a great movie that I can wait to the second one to come out. Nice graphics and drawing that renewed the fascination in the dark knight!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am absolutely loving this game!  It is such a friggin blast!!!  So much fun!  Love it in person...this is the next best thing!!!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I gave it as a Christmas gift and they couldn't wait to open it and watch it. Already were quoting lines from it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its ok. Some of the games are borring. some of them are fun. nothing to get addicted to. but it is something to do.
1476715904|5.0|This is possibly the best romance/life novel I've read. Also the most I've ever cried reading a book. Of course I never expected more and more bad things to happen but they did and it made me sad. But that shows you how good of a story it is because youre so involved while reading. Overall fantastic, can't wait for the third.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm just in awe of this woman and everything she has accomplished.  She has changed the gravitational pull of the planets. Thank you Tina Fey.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who can read.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Gripping action, some interesting mythologizing of a few of the characters that gave it a literary feel. Some have criticized the very last scenes, saying the movie should have ended with Tom Hardy's &#34;Searchers&#34;-like scene where he's posed in the doorway, but I think the next scene is valuable in that it then plays with and maybe even deconstructs the earlier mythologizing. Leaves you with something to think about.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|This disc could use more special features. The HD aspect though is awesome. I would definitely reccommend this to a friend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app for keeping me organized! No matter which device I've got in my hand, it uses one acct and  syncs with all of them.  I use it for home, work, volunteer stuff. I like the intuitive organization of my notebooks, nice search functions most notably text within pictures! So can snap a pic of a recipe I like in a magazine, then later find it by searching for a keyword in the  recipe pic. Perfect.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I began this series when the 1st two books were automatically on the kindle I was given by my mother-in-law. I would never have purchased these books on my own as I thought they were only for adolescents. Boy was I wrong. Great quick reads and real &#34;page-turners.&#34; Love this series and was so taken with Suzanne Collins that I bought the Gregor Overlander #1 for my Kindle and am reading that now as well. Can't recommend this series enough!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|ilIt is not bring be up to the loving page number 1.Number2 newsfeed doesn't work at all the people who made this app should test it out first.I rather use the Internet on my kindle fire this app doesn't work at all.

B002HFP0QU|5.0|The Bee Gees always entertain, and this CD is no exception.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It will always be popular music.
B0051CSIL0|4.0|Stakeland is a grim low budget indie horror flick that manages to do the impossible. It actually makes vampires scary again. From the very first time you see one of the beasts on screen you know that these aren't the \\"sexy, sparkly, elegant, or misunderstood\\" vampires from most recent movies. These things are MONSTERS. Plain and simple. They have no super powers other than keen predatory senses and good old fashioned viciousness.They're ugly, deadly, and the scariest part is that they seem to be evolving.<br />The story follows a small band of travelers led by the Charles Bronson-esque \\"Mister\\". Mister is a seasoned vampire killer and is in the process of training a young orphaned boy in the deadly art of dispatching the vile bloodsuckers. Along the way the two hunters and their traveling companions begin to realize that in this post apocalyptic world full of real life monsters, it may be the remaining human beings that are  the real danger. Bandits, cannibals, and violent religious cults also stand in the way of their goal of traveling to the vampire free zone known as \\"New Eden\\". As the brave travelers get picked off one by one the tension builds to a final bloody showdown with a frighteningly intelligent new breed of vampire that Mister has never seen before.<br />This movie isn't going to be for everybody. It is very dark and very grim. If you are a true horror movie fan such as myself,however, it is a rare hidden gem. My one criticism with Stakeland is that pacing is a little uneven and the movie feels like it leaves you hanging a little at the end. Also, if you are looking to buy a copy of the film, save yourself a little money and just pick up the single disc version. The second disc doesn't really offer much other than some random behind the scenes footage and a few mini films about the characters that doesn't really reveal anything that you couldn't figure out from watching the movie itself.<br />Overall, this is a pretty solid indie horror flick that gives you some new ideas about vampires and what it might be like to live in a world overrun by them. I recommend giving it a view if only for the fact that it actually dares to break away from the trend of making vampires sexy and brooding and allows them to be legitimately scary again.you some new ideas about vampires and what it might be like to live in a world overrun by them.

1423136802|5.0|My 12 year old son is having a great time with this series.  He's reluctant to put the book down.
B00005N5RM|4.0|This movie really shocked me by how good it was. I recently re-watched the original Blob movie starring Steve McQueen and was surprised by how hokey it was. Sure it was made on a shoestring budget back in the 50's, but I remembered seeing it as a kid and thinking it was amazing. I then re-watched the remake and was pleasantly surprised by how well it held up. The effects are a little dated and some of the plot points are sort of goofy, but it's still a solid flick. I can name maybe a handful of remake/reboots that manage to even be on the same level let alone surpass the original. This movie is up near the top of that list.<br />The story is almost the same as the original. Meteorite lands in small town, man eating alien goo oozes out of said meteorite, several people wind up being devoured by rampaging goo, band of teenagers try to organize townsfolk to fight back against alien menace. There is one notable exception though. There is an explanation about what the Blob really is. Sometimes over explaining a monster takes away from the scare factor, but this time it worked well in the context of the story. It opened a new avenue for the story to go in and essentially created way more hapless victims for the ravenous slime to consume.<br />The 1988 version of the Blob also breaks several horror movie rules. Little kids get eaten, priests get their faces melted, and it's not the wholesome all American high school quarterback who saves the day but the dirtbag juvenile delinquent that nobody even likes . One other thing that really makes the new Blob a great horror movie is that you actually get to see the Blob kill people, and it is a messy thing to behold. The special effects are still amazingly good for an 80's era movie. Some of the green screen shots are a little goofy looking, but you'll barely notice. Along with the impressive effects are some solid performances by the lovely Shawnee Smith who later went on to star in the Saw movies and Kevin Dillon who went on to become Johnny Drama on Entourage. Both lend believability to their roles and have strong character arcs throughout the film.<br />If you're curious about the Blob movies and haven't seen them yet, I'd suggest seeing the remake first and if you like it check out the 50's classic to see where it all started.become Johnny Drama on Entourage.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. Can not wait to read book number two and number three. Now to see the movie...
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|These advent calendars are kind of pricey, so I was reluctant to buy one. This one was around $35 or $40 and was well worth the price. The figures are not elaborate but, stll fun to put together, and at around $1.50 per figure, not a bad price.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Bought this for the wife.  She loves Susan Boyle s music.  This one is great as is usual for her.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It was just awesome. Very different in a good way. Some parts were a little odd but it was overall great. I would definitely read it. I sort of recommended it to myself because I saw the movie coming out and saw it was a book so I read it.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|IT was a hilarious read. Great for a nice get away from the day. I would recommend and reread, also.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|A virtual Christmas experience.<br />I have always loved this story and there have been many great adaptions made through the years.<br />Disney created a version that I could only have dreamed of when I was a kid.<br />Now, with modern technology, that dream is a reality.
B00003CX8N|2.0|Not a very good production, I just watch part of the movie. It story was not of interest to me.
034580404X|5.0|I gave this a five star rating because it takes a good book to keep me interested and I must say I stayed intrigued enough to read each book within 16 hours each.<br /><br />Sometimes things felt 'repeated' but I still read them all in record time.  Good books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|no harm in downloading it to pass the time. you can pick and choose which games you actually want to unlock and play before unlocking them.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Another gripping and monumental gem!  I will never tire of Grisham's mastery!  A must read for the Grisham fan!  SUPERB!

B006LS7DQE|2.0|I would really love this game if it didn't crash every other fight and lose any progress. It only auto saves so if you crash midfight get ready for long walls over and over. Please fix the constant crashing during puzzles.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Loved all of them. Wished they hadn't ended. Kept me on my toes the entire time. I could not stop reading.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was a different story than what I have watched on a movie.. it was good though.  Nice read for anyone.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I'll keep this brief and simple....one of my favorite books ever!  Kept me reading all night.  Love this author, it's my favorite book of his.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Breaking Dawn 2 soundtrack is AWESOME!!!  It delivers excellent music just like the last four Twilight Saga Original Motion Picture Soundtracks DID!!!  The selection of songs are \\"UNIQUE\\" and each artist or group brings \\"THEIR OWN CREATIVE SOUND\\" to this soundtrack which I deeply appreciate!!! It would be nice to hear a variety of music like this on the radio again.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a huge John Corey fan...loved The Gold Coast one of my favorite DeMille books and the one that got me hooked on this author.  This book, however, was a real disappointment.  Took me three weeks to read the first third of the book, which is very unlike me and this author.  I heard from a friend it was great so I picked it back up on week four and it just never got great for me.  Love the character, typically love the author...to me this was just not a well crafted story, action-less til the end and even then it was not typical DeMille suspense.  It was predictable and slow paced.  I hope for a much better next attempt.
B004EPZ00M|5.0|If you are at home, bored and gloomy, this movie would be the only medicine. Hilarious yet action-packed, this movie is just right for everyone to share a laugh. If you are hesitating , hesitate no more! I guarantee that this movie would make you laugh till your sides ache. An international funny man, Rowan Akinson, also known as Mr Bean, appears in this movie as an accidental spy, working on a case of assasins trying to eliminate a world leader. Withone shot at redemtion, he will use or misuse high-tech gadgets and every trick of his to protect us all!

B00006YXE4|4.0|The line up is no doubt execllent but somehow age is catching up with his voice. Nonetheless, the rusty and husky voice is still sensational. I do hope there'll be a blu-ray version.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charlie is just a normal teenage boy. Most of the time he is quiet but is emotional. His honesty really completes the book. He knew when to talk and when to keep things to himself. It was just amazing and I really want to see the movie now!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Very entertaining, good Mahjong puzzles to solve.  No time limit at all, which other games use quite frequently, making it hard to complete.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|It's a fine film. The transfer is mostly crystal clear, being a newly restored version, replacing a 2008 release. I recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved this book. I really appreciated the fact that it was letters and not chapters. I feel connected to Charlie..not because I've had the same experiences, but I understood his thoughts and vulnerabilities. This was a sad and beautiful book that touched my heart and inspired me. This is a book I'll definitely be referring back to for guidance. I'll probably read and listen to all the music and books used in the novel.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I'm really happy with my purchase of this Marware case for my Kindle Fire HD.  It is well made and really protects the unit.  I like the elastic strap to keep it closed.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a very good CD.  My first purchase from this artist.  Of course I have a favorite song, but I am enjoying the rest of the album as well.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At first the game was great. After I reached some of the higher levels, there were some glitches. First, when I opened the game, the Kindle keyboard would show and I couldn't close it without opening the Kindle menu and going to gamecircle. Second, at one point the screen shrunk to one quarter of the screen. When I started the game, it was normal, but couldn't drag the flow over the small section of the screen. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game and that lost my progress. Not sure if just a glitch. Still a really fun game.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|She is just amazing, have always enjoyed her music.  Have several of her CD's and am very happy to add this to my collection.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|following matt damon as the lead in a Bourne movie is a tough act to follow but Jeremy Renner does a great job in Bourne Legacy. Intense action film, good fight and chase scenes. If you like action films you will enjoy.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Was not sure about this purchase, having only heard her a few times.  But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this CD.  She has a great quality to her voice which I really enjoy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm always a bit uncomfortable reading about disfunctional families, so I guess the book hit its mark with me.  It left me feeling creepy about the characters.
B00979CS50|5.0|What's not to like about this CD, it's Neil Young.  We really like this latest CD, as much as we have liked his previous works.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Absolutely loved watching this movie.  Can't wait to watch number 2.  I only wish they would make these movies without the cussing.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Provides excellent way of monitoring/tracking battery health on Kindle for just a small (initial) cost.  Yes, there's a free version (which is also good!), but you don't get the full calibration program with that version.  I learned of this app through a reviewer's comments on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and am glad I opted to purchase it.
B001BKV9TE|4.0|Daughter watched this in school and kept talking about it so we watched it together.  We had a good time watching it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Thinking girl movie because its a girl's cast? Think again. This movie is hilarious and witty. I'd watch this again and again!

B008CP6RWU|2.0|So you play this girl wearing some sort of Arabic frock running about in the bland desert.<br /><br />They call it a game. And has rave reviews.<br /><br />I don't get it. Where's the challenge? The graphics are so simplistic like its from the 16 bit era.<br /><br />You run about trying to make your turban cloth longer and it has no story. I dont' even know who the person is, why she is running in the desert, and what nationality she is, and what the heck she is wearing, and why is it so important to lengthen her scarf?<br /><br />All in all, why even re-release this in Bluray format?<br /><br />Save your money for Battlefield 3. Please.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|as a kindle fire owner, I am always looking for a good app. I have cut the rope, which works great, so when I saw this app by the same developers (for FREE) I thought I could try it.<br /><br />the gameplay is simple. you slide these pudding (but it look like cherry jello) across a surface joining it with the other jellos. this is, in my opinion,  a lot easier than cut the rope. I found myself wizzing through the first chapter in about five minutes.<br /><br />the graphics and music fit the mood of the game: cute and somewhat out of this world. even the little sounds the little pudding/jello guys make add to the atmosphere.<br /><br />overall, pudding monsters is a great, fun little game. the levels are simple enough that it can be for all ages. and, since it's free, why not get it?

He is remissnessing to a priest and a thief about what he had witnessed and what happened at the Trial for the bandit who killed the Samurai.<br /><br />This movie is very well put together and has a few unique twists that makes it very interesting to watch. If you love Samurai movies like I do then this is a movie to look into.<br /><br />Akira Kurosawa was ahead of his time and his movies are some of the best films ever made. This movie may not be as good as Yojimbo or Seven Samurai, but it's a great movie none the less. It's got a solid story with interesting characters in an awesome feudal Japanese backdrop.<br /><br />If you're a Chanbara film fan this movie is a must see.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|i have been reading this story every christmas since i was a little girl. it is always an inspiration. it never fails to bring me back to center..
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie is one of those movies that you'll ether love or hate. I personally am a huge Ridley Scott fan and this movie lived up to every expectation I had for it. It was a well made movie with interesting characters and an interesting story based in the Alien universe. The 3D isn't used poorly and over all it was everything I wanted it to be. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the Alien franchise of films or is just into Science fiction in general.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|this story started out well, but some parts were drawn out and some not quite believable.i would try another one though ,i liked the main character.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I am an absolute fan of \\"Dexter\\".  Personally, Season 7 has been my favorite season so far.  There were so many incredible moments on this year's shows that I can't hardly wait for Season 8 to begin. Besides, you get to see two of the most beautiful women on television (Carpenter and Strahovski).  I am still reeling by the season finale. It was unexpected, suspenseful and extremely well written. For me it was so haunting that it left a lingering feeling inside me for a few days after I watched it. Great show. Such a shame it is ending next season.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Beautiful collection of songs by the pianist/chanteuse. Highly recommended, especially for the backup band, including John Clayton on bass (my personal favorite).
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I found the concept of the book interesting but the story was just too weak to hold my attention. This definitely cannot compare to any of his other novels-disappointing.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|George C. Scott's finest role.  Wonderful classic movie.  Good biography.  Captures the feeling and attitude of the time.  Great for 16+ audience.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|Graphic mediocre, game play inconsistent.sometime doesn't respond to touch, other times continues after removal of touch.<br />Played on Galaxy Note so not the worst for processer.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of it from the beginning to the end.  Great for the imagination of all ages.  Highly recommend it to whole family.
1451695195|5.0|For a brand new book he made it affordable for the masses. This is a must read for anyone and especially someone like me who works in the hospice field. I long suspected this truth, and I feel justified in what I have witnessed at the time of death/birth, I can not really call it death anymore, for it is only a change.
B00470TOV0|3.0|My husband really likes this movie.  I like the story line quite well, but I find it a bit too gory.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Five year engagement? Seemed more like the five year movie. I like Blunt and Segal but it wasn't their best. My expectations weren't super high to begin with.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This book veered away from Grisam's usual courttoom draa and litigatin ad was rally rfreshing although I DO enjoy his more litigeous novels.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I had a bunch of fun playing this retro game.  I started poorly on normal and went to beginner and beat the game... then I went to expert and beat the game.  Well designed (though it is a ripoff of Outrun) and a good interface.<br /><br />I'd personally like a boost or guns or the ability to run people off the road... but it is good for what it is.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is a great story : all three movies ! Very entertaining and powerful ! Loved it and would recommend to anyone !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for an easy good calculator...I found it!!!!!! I would recommend this to anyone needing a good calculator. plus it is FREE. We use it in our homeschooling math class when a calculator Is needed....thanks :)
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Resident Evil: Retribution brings in a Resident Evil dream cast. Most of the previous cast has been brought back... through cloning. Which is perfectly plausible, it just didn't feel like the story I wanted to see after the last movie ended at such a peak. The story is that the main heroine Alice wakes up in an underground testing facility where the evil Umbrella corporation puts together simulated scenarios of what would happen if zombies were to overrun specific areas of the world. So its like a fantasy chamber where anything can happen including the resurrection of previous cast members and thrown into different roles. Why are they in different roles? Because they are clones. Don't think that I ruined anything for you, because it is explained after the first five minutes.<br /><br />For those that care about the story, there are plenty of plot twists, but so many that it doesn't seem to have any emphasis or punch to it. Kind of like there was no time taken to let you breathe in what the twists meant.<br /><br />There is a lot of fluff in this movie to pad out the 90 minutes. Fluff like dream sequences, finishing off the final moments of the previous movie and setting up the next movie. The last movie ended at an awesome peak and after a quick action sequence it was as if I was tricked into buying a DVD. In fact I have a feeling the next movie will make me feel that way.<br /><br />The core of this movie is action. Plenty of action, almost too much of it to the point that its boring. In fact there was so much action that the deleted scenes are extended action sequences. That means the director realized it was too much so he took it out. I love action movies, but there is something to be said about pacing, highs and lows, cranking up the tension and sequences, but this movie fails to make the sequences stand out.<br /><br />Take a pass on seeing this movie. The only thing worth seeing is the last 2 minute pull away which they already showed in the trailer. The movie is a big piece of fluff... but perhaps if you just need nonstop wall to wall action and slow motion latex scenes, this is your movie and by all means give it a try.
B008KGPEQG|5.0|winter journal by paul auster is a moving review of the author's life, he remembers all the places he lived in, the friendship, the love and so on.<br />Also the english language he uses is wonderful, utterly understandable even by non native english speakers like myself.<br />absolutely a commendable novel<br />giovanni
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I was surprised how lame this movie was. I suppose I should have guessed it would be a dismal movie, with the premise of a plane crash and group of people trying to survive in the wild and fight off wolf packs. I guess I was just expecting some super hero powers in Liam (think: &#34;Taken&#34;) - but in the end, he's a mere mortal like the rest of us, and the wolves get them all.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Being young of heart but with an artistic mindset, this was the perfect toy! Not only is it crazy fun to play, but its a work of art in itself. I use the stand it came with to put on display even. Totally worth it!
B006ZEDZNY|4.0|This was a really interesting movie - and I was completely sober when I watched it! Johnny Depp is always amazing. But I really liked the plot of this movie too, I had no idea the history behind some of Puerto Rico's development (though I'm sure this is loosely based on fact). Very entertaining, funny, and interesting.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|What can I say? Jack Ryan JR. and the campus  another 10 about what &#34;oga&#34; might be able to do
B009NQKPUW|1.0|In an attempt to answer the major pressing questions all of us had about Alien- all none of them- we have this movie, which answered those poorly and raised many more than we can continue not to care about. By this I don't mean that the answers are unenlightening, uninspired, and boring- which they are- but rather that the entire story is just unnecessary and poorly written and delivered. In a spirited repudiation of the feminist themes of the original Alien, we have the opposite of Ridley in a number of women characters with personalities as complex as table salt and the strength of a thousand tissues. We have scientists who make the cast of Ancient Aliens seem skeptical, family dynamics that fail to stretch belief mostly because they are barely shown and can hardly keep our attention on screen while they are played out. What's more, in a fitting end to any reason to enjoy Alien, we get to have the utter foreignness to the human experience that is the creature in the original film utterly destroyed, ruining not just our experience with this movie but in fact with all of the Alien series.<br /><br />As a plus, the movie is only unbearably long so that by the time the credits roll you or your conscious mind will be safely asleep.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|First I did not like it because I dont like video games however, this game does not put preassure on you. It is not a game where your heart speed up at lot. if you did not pass a level you just do it again until you pass. It is a very nice family game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is hands down one of the best hidden object games I have ever played. Very interactive and love how the hints are not limited. The map was very helpful also. Cant wait to play the second one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put it down until I knew. Kept me guessing until the very end and left me wanting more. Captivating characters.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Story of Light. Steve Vai is another of my all time favorite guitarists. Although I liked his previous band better, this still shows off his creative guitar playing.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I honestly couldn't put the book down. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. I recommend this book to anyone who loves romance, and a little of fantasy mixed with real life stations. Trust me you won't be disappointed!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This novel is truly romantic,yet it is one that will tug at your heartstrings. This is now one of my favorite books of all time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. I literally got it today and just finished it. One of the best books I red. Really appealed to me through the hunting and gathering during and before the arena. Really hope the next book includes those elements but I doubt it but honestly the story has pulled me in so I will be reading it as soon as I can.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was fine.  There wasn't much to it.  I like the stories a little bit long.  Would hate to spend much money on it.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a good book. I finished it in two days. I gave it 4 stars because I felt unlike fifty shades the storyline could have  been a little better. I am excited to read the remaining books of the series. I would recommend this series to any of my fellow fifty shades lovers that are having withdrawal.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Loved the first Sherlock Holmes and this one did not disappoint.  I thought I had things figured out and then they tricked me some more.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|If you're browsing John Grisham, I'm guessing you're looking for an enjoyable and entertaining read over a great piece of American literature. \\"The Racketeer\\" delivers (on the former).<br /><br />The plot was fairly predictable and the writing and character development were average at best but neither prevents \\"The Racketeer\\" from being a pretty fun read. Grab this one for the beach or for a snow day and I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|love sex and the city! such a cool movie and I love the characters from the show! Very happy :
0374214913|4.0|Clay Jannon is an unemployed web designer; his only job experience to date was a spell doing web designs for a Bay Area bagel company. As he wanders the streets of San Francisco (safely distancing himself from the distractions of the Internet), he happens upon a small bookshop in a less than salubrious street, and notices a card in the window advertising a vacant position. The proprietor of the bookshop is one Mr Penumbra who asks him, somewhat portentously, \\"What do you seek on these shelves?\\"<br /><br />Indeed, this turns out to be a very unusual bookshop, and Clay wonders how it manages to stay in business at all. Apart from some shelves near the front of the store which hold more conventional stock, most of the store consists of thousands of leather-bound volumes, stacked so high that Clay must shin up perilously tall ladders to retrieve them.<br /><br />Clay works the graveyard shift. There are almost no real customers as such, but a succession of elderly folk who come at night to borrow books from what is known as \\"the waybacklist\\". They never browse the shelves, but seem to know exactly what title they are looking for. Clay is charged with writing down in a log book the details of who came, what they borrowed, and how they looked.<br /><br />But Clay has been forbidden by Penumbra to look inside the books himself. He manages to hold out for a month before curiosity gets the better of him when his roommate comes to visit the store. They discover, to their amazement, that the volumes are written in some kind of code.<br /><br />There's clearly a puzzle to be solved and Clay sets out to crack it in ways the computer nerd knows best, drawing into the quest his friends. There's Kat Potente the ultimate geek girl and Google employee who wanders into the bookstore in response to a targeted ad Clay has placed to draw in customers; and Neel, Clays former online role play partner who has become a start up entrepreneur. Neel shares Clay's love for the Dragon Song Chronicles, a fantasy trilogy, which has a part to play in the unfolding mystery.<br /><br />The action shifts to New York and the headquarters of a mysterious society which the friends must infiltrate to find answers. Sloan keeps things moving admirably, and even though the plot is a little thin in places when you hold it up to light, it's an enjoyable read which includes many elements that are bound to appeal to a younger generation of readers who have grown up with fantasy fiction and computers.<br /><br />Sloan's tale very cleverly combines the analogue and ancient with references to online culture and high-tech fantasy. He is spot-on in his observations about our relationship with the digital world. But in the end, it is not the high-tech skills, impressive as they are (especially the Hadoop application that solves a complex problems by sending the data to thousands of computers for processing) that win the day. Instead, it is close attention to detail, and the ability to read between the lines of a favourite novel that solve the riddle. This is a rather comforting conclusion.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about the book was its wry humour. You sense Sloan laughing at himself as much as at his characters, and there are some great throw-away lines. One that made me chuckle: \\"Kat bought a New York Times but couldn't figure out how to operate it, so now she's fiddling with her phone.\\"<br /><br />It's fitting that Sloan's first novel was inspired by a tweet from a friend who mistook a sign for a 24-hour bookdrop (presumably outside a library) for a 24-hour bookshop. Intrigued by the concept of a bookstore that's open round the clock, Sloan wrote a short story that he self-published with Amazon Kindle (it is still up on Sloan's website, robinsloan.com) and the novel grew from that.<br /><br />While the novel could be easily read on the digital device of your choice, the publishers have struck a blow for the book as artifact: the attractive cover only reveals its secret when you view it in the dark!
B001HMSFFC|5.0|WOnderful movie absolutely adored it and i cant wait to watch the next one! Charlotte York and Carried Bradshaw are genius
B0018QQQK8|2.0|I guess I didn't get what all the hoopla was about with this book and the movie. Yes, the guy is hot to look @ but seeing the movie is not how I imagined him in the book and that was a let down.
B009369Z8A|5.0|Great movie and great story. Actor selection could not have been better. Seeing the attitudes and personalities in this movie reminded me of back home.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|All I can say is &#34;excellent&#34;....everything about it is pure delight. Now I need Season 3 to complete the whole set.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is my first Steven King novel and I was amazed at his writing.  It got a little long towards the middle, some of it could have been edited down but overall a great read and a very interesting premise.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this is a really good app. I don't know what all the fuss is about... its facebook.....what's wrong with that?
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|That was genuinely one of the dumbest movies we've ever seen.  My wife's first comment when it was over was, \\"Can we please watch a good movie now to make up for that?\\"  I agree with her wholeheartedly.  We both laughed (like a real laugh, not the kind where you laugh because you're supposed to) 3 times.  Can we please stop with the never-ending 80s references in movies?  It was a forgettable decade, so let's forget it.  We think Family Guy is dumb too, so that probably explains why we feel the same about \\"Ted\\".
B009MCRHH6|5.0|As a mom I didn't understand the game, so I asked my son how..that was the end of that..they have had my kindle since. they Love it and play it as often as they can.
B0035WTJFW|5.0|In 2054, the Precrime department, led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is able to predict murder before it occurs using three psychics called \\"precogs\\" with superb results. Eventually, Anderton is suspected of future murder and he races to clear his name and find the person he believes set him up; but, what if the precogs were correct?. Minority Report is a brilliant and exhilarating SciFi film.<br /><br />Minority Report has an amazing concept and engaging storytelling; it balances the science, the mystery, and the action almost flawlessly. The story moves at a great pace, which kept me glued to my seat. The chase scenes in this film are also great, especially the jetpack scene. The futuristic setting is also immersive and often stunning. Most of the special effects still hold up today, despite being 10 years old. The acting was also amazing; I enjoyed watching Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell. The music in this film matched the atmosphere and I loved it; it had a \\"Star Wars\\"/SciFi vibe and positively added to the film.<br /><br />I own the two disc blu-ray. The first disc of this blu-ray only has the film. The second disc holds all of the special features. This does not come with a DVD or a digital copy. The quality of this film is amazing; the picture quality is a stunning update from the DVD and allows it to compete with recent films; the sound quality is also crisp. Definitely a film worth owning in HD.<br /><br />Overall, Minority Report is an immersive, exhilarating, and ultimately brilliant film; despite it's 2 hr 20 min runtime, this film rarely has a dull moment. I highly recommend a purchase, especially the high quality Blu-ray version.<br /><br /> Minority Report has violence and blood. No sex or nudity.
B000VUCIZO|4.0|This book was written by an engineer, to an audience of engineers.  I loved that.  The prose was straightforward, clear, and told a fascinating story without any fluff.  Lots of humor, as Woz is known for.  The book presents several pieces of advice for engineers, and I was pleased to see that these were neither trivial nor impossible to follow.  It makes a good case for all the wonderful things that can come out of spending time alone at your desk, studying, thinking, and designing.<br /><br />Incidentally, I read this at the same time as Kevin Mitnick's autobiography (did you think I was going to say Steve Jobs?).  It was interesting how both Wozniak and Mitnick spent time manipulating the phone company, purportedly from a love of technology, and then Woz  moved on and became famous while Mitnick stayed with it and became infamous.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I have bought this & the standard version. I must admit this is a lot better quality although originally I thought only the extra padding was the difference, however the frame quality is slightly different too. So definitely worth the extra $20 or so. I am buying another one of these.  Also if you have kids whom are slightly of a bigger build this is probably not big enough.  I have two daughters & both are of a thinner build so this suits perfectly. Very happy shopper!

B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This movie is one of the worst I've seen this past year. It is nearly 100% lifeless special effects to the point I could not believe anything I was seeing as real. The story, characters, scenes and acting were about as boring as can be. To enjoy Total Recall, use your total recall to remember the original.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|came with all the pieces.  Kids just love it.  lots of detail, snow, baked goods, ice skaters, tree farm.  Perfect
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I can tell from the first page that this is going to be tedious reading, translations always are.  I will read it as it is a classic, good for the winter doldrums?
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Awful writing, no story, each book got worse and worse. I wanted to stop after the first book, but decided to give the second one a shot.....I am embarrassed to have fallen for peer pressure......
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This movie was not at all what I expected but I enjoyed it none the less. The storyline was interesting and very true to life. It was sad but I have seen this happen to couples who have been married a long time. The problems they discussed are probably the top 2 in most marriages. The acting was terrific and there were some very funny parts.<br /><br />I don't suggest you watch it with anyone younger than 18 though. The subject line was for a mature audience and it is not as funny as the trailer leads you to believe.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very exciting, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Makes you want to keep reading to see what happens.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best book I ever read! The entire book was amazing good action awesome story and great surprises.
B000T433CO|3.0|This is a good choice if you don't want to think about what you are watching at all. Beautiful locations, charming and very attractive talent and happy accidents make this easy to watch and enjoy.

B004EPZ070|5.0|The always-charming, Ginnifer Goodwin, and always-spunky, Kate Hudson, succinctly &#34;borrows&#34; from other successful iconic couplings. A great supporting talented-cast genuinely enhances the storyline .. plus, there is a 30-second &#34;dance&#34; scene (don't blink, you might miss it) between novice Goodwin and professionally-trained Hudson that charmingly entertains.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|I'm giving it a 4 though based on the fact that in one of the episodes the picture froze and hung up on my Blu-ray player.  Had to skip forward a bit to view further.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I downloaded this game a week ago and can't stop playing. Its my favorite game at the state fair so a kindle version is awesome. If you run out of coins you can either buy more, or if you're poor like me you can leave the game and the coins regenerate themselves.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I tried to like this and be open to J.K. Rowling writing something other than Harry Potter, but this story was so slow, depressing and heavy, I honestly could not finish it.  I want to say it was too many characters, but I was able to read Game of Thrones with it's huge cast with no problems. I just can't say for sure what the problem was other than it was almost as if she set out to prove she could write adult fiction but tried too hard.
1439181780|5.0|Got this for my granddaughter as a gift and some of my relatives. Nice to share this book by Rhonda Byrne.
0765356147|5.0|This third  book is the best in the Mistborn trilogy. Hero of Ages has so many twists and turns and a magic system that is brilliant, inventive and extraordinary. I just adore the young heroine, Vin. I found her to be one of the best female fantasy character along the lines of Daenarys Targaryen and Kahlen Amnell.<br /><br />I cannot adequately express my complete enjoyment of this series, Sanderson's world-building and characters took me to another world. The Hero of Ages is definitely a fitting and poignant ending to an outstanding series.

B005LAIGF0|5.0|Disclaimer: This is a review of the extended version which I recommend. Many negative reviews seem to relate to the theatrical version which was shortened making the relevance of some of the material difficult to ascertain. This review is my opinion and may in no way relate to situations or events real or imagined.<br /><br />In Margaret, Keith Lonegran has produced a masterpiece. I was captivated by this film from start to finish. Lonegran's film is nothing less than symphonic in its harmonization of the milieu, the story, the cast, the score, operatic scenes, poetic and literary references, brilliant cinematography, and random bits of overheard conversations into what almost amounts to a musical arrangement.  Margaret is a complicated rendering of a seemingly simple story line into a timeless tale of humanity's foibles. Cut in the mold of a Shakespearean tragedy but much more accessible in the vernacular, Lonegran's tale turns on the drama following a heady self absorbed 17 year old, Lisa (Anna Paquin) who is dealing with her complicity in a horrific, graphically detailed accident that took a woman's life all the while attending private school and trying to deal with her parents divorce post 9-11 on New York's upper west side. The tidal wave of emotion unleashed builds with intensity until a literal crescendo set to the barcarolle opera number \\"Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour\\" that almost magically binds the viewer to the characters, the audience at the Met, and the opera cast themselves.<br /><br />Some might wrongly conclude that the ball got rolling on the action in the film when the accident happened, but that would be a superficial examination, for as in Shakespeare a tragedy early in a drama often serves only to ignite a fuse that burns slowly and tortuously to a powder keg of misery implanted in the center of the characters lives years prior. This is a story whose seeds were sown in the persona's and affectatious universe of Lisa's now divorced parents and therepressed turmoil of the fractured lives left in the wake of their separation.<br /><br />Naturally some will not have the patience for it and some will not see the point. Some will love it and some will be downright outraged. When you read the reviews you will see this to be true. The irony of the reviews for the film are that they serve as proofs of the things the film is trying to get at: people are different, they like different things, they can go berserk on trivialities, they can be quite strident when expressing their own views and they often view their interpretation to be the correct one, and they don't mind telling you, oh and they make mistakes and don't pay attention, a lot.<br /><br />Margaret is unlike most films in that it really makes the viewer work to get a handle on what it's all about. It hides it light under a bushel so to speak. Firstly, the title Margaret comes from a poem by Gerald Manly Hopkins which is read in a classroom scene and whose theme is the hinge on which the action swings, that being misperceived sorrow. Secondly, there's an excerpt from King Lear that is brilliantly placed in another classroom sequence which bears a direct relation to the work's central thematic elements; that of humankind's almost unfailing inability to accept responsibility for its own actions and to chalk up consequences to fate, and deeds to having no other options. Thirdly, there are two operas, Bellini's Norma and Offenbach's The Tale of Hoffman, which should be watched before viewing. And lastly, you really can't take your eyes off the screen for most of the production because every angle and perspective of the camera bolsters and almost every snippet of dialogue underscores the main themes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" \\"Speed\\" or \\"Laura Croft Tomb Raider\\" you might be disappointed as it's not that kind of film. Not that it isn't riveting, it is. And not that it doesn't have a lot of action, it does. It's just an unconventional kind of riveting action, definitely not the typical Hollywood script. In the end we see the characters laid bare and their schemes and manipulations exposed. That's the ending. In that respect Margaret plays more like a European film than an American one. And that's fine with me. I loved it.

B00A757EFW|3.0|Just was not what I thought not real clear and difficult for me too play. Possible I did not give it a chance.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These are short but very powerful stories.  Would make an excellent movie I think.  This author is definitely of my watch list...I will read anything he writes.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Decided to use this app for checking my Hotmail account instead of the email program on my Android 4.  I like the screen on this app better and its easier to use, although the functionality on the home screen is very limited.  But, its great for checking, reading and deleting email.
0756404738|5.0|Oh how I waited...checking constantly and hoping that PR was joking about the delayed release.  But the wait was so worth it.  Like Christmas morning when you were a kid and you got exactly what you wished for.  Well written, engrossing...ah welll...now it's on to waiting for the 3 rd book.  And I will wait as long as it takes.  Well, hopefully it won't be GRRM long :)
