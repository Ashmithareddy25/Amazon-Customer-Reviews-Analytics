B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great! Hard to believe it's free. I love games that are a challenge. This game really makes you think..
B004S49YEM|3.0|But lacked the ability to capture me to continue to turn each page with excitement.  Good story, solid entertainment for light reading period.  Felt it could have been a more indepth development of some of the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was casually searching the app store for a new game to play and came across this one. And I really enjoy playing it. It really gets your brain working. I would recommend the game to anyone.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Very entertaining series. Historically fairly accurate You get to know a little about the great Romans that ruled Rome at its most turbulent period.
B00005JL96|4.0|This movie is different it is about a alien thing that ends up being the pet to a child a dog, I think, but the kid who needs it shows him love and the whole thing is rather cute. It is in Hawaii and it is a good movie that is enjoyable for the family to watch.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Nicholas Sparks at his finest. I found it to be a little more &#34;exciting&#34; than his other books in that it has a good thriller element to it.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This movie is a must have! The story is original and the movie is funny. I actually quote some lines here and there with my kids. Johnny Depp is the lizard and he does a good job. The characters are related to life and is funny!
B003U4UNPK|4.0|I'm not entirely finished with season 3, but I'm well over half way. I like it, I think I enjoyed the first two seasons more. Sometimes Lost gets a little out there, but from what I've heard from others, it's supposed to all make sense by season 6. Trying to hang in there until then!
B003Y5H5AG|2.0|I was not thrilled with the movie it was strange in fact. It has smurfs but it takes place in the real world with a strange plot I'm not sure why they did that. The bad guy is gross and really just stupid if it was not the Smurfs this movie would not have went anywhere! I cannot believe they are making a second one but let us hope it is better.
B002HP269O|1.0|One of the many truths in conceptual art is that it gets to introduce peoples to ideas most have never heard of, let alone thought of. When \\"The L Word\\" first came out, there were so many of us who were excited! Finally, a television show that spoke and showed how we lived! Yes, *we*. Unfortunately, like most mainstream art, this television series recycled many stereotypes while still tackling deeper issues in the Queer community (Max, as a transman would've had a deeper voice by the time his facial hair grew in as a beard though). This series finale was horrible. Too often there are deep fissures created between communities, and the LGBTQI aka Queer community has a great deal in common with the DisAbled community - including how both are identified as unnatural. The Jenny character had some type of emotional capacity which forced institutionalization, and in the end - that this character continued the widespread damaging beliefs of intentionally harming others as well as being a facade ... that was just bad. Really bad writing.<br /><br />The very end ... left me shaking my head and wondering - what? Wow. Just sad. Glad got to watch this for free - yay for Amazon Prime!
B004GJYROG|5.0|If it has this guy in it it is good. Plus Bill Murry and some other pro athletes offer their talents. I loved this as a kid and my kids like it too. Half animation and half unanimated but worth having and watching.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|All of us at Datical are fanatically passionate about solving the single most overlooked issue that causes failed application releases, so I was naturally drawn to this book.  I was not disappointed.  At one point in the novel the protagonists are faced with a database schema change that slipped through the cracks.  As the characters find the problem they also recognize that the fix will not be easy.  Chris Allers, the VP of Application Developments in the novel says, \\"This is going to be tricky.  We're going to have to rename a bunch of database columns, which will affect, who knows, maybe hundreds of files.  And all the support scripts.  This is going to be manual work and very error-prone.\\"  Eliminating this very problem is what we do at Datical but I admit that it was somewhat strange to read about an issue that we discuss here on a daily basis.<br /><br />Beyond this schema management issue that resonates with us, the novel addresses a host of issues confronted by IT and development teams.  Those who have read The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt will recognize the narrative form and will get a refresh on the theory of constraints but the authors have tweaked the narrative and the business cases to illuminate the challenges faced by contemporary businesses.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone that has either a passing or vested interest in how to manage IT for business success.
6304698623|5.0|Must have for little girls it shows good and bad in the world and offers hope! This movie is different and has some sad parts but it teaches as well.
B006SVHOL8|5.0|I love Zombie movies so I thought I check this one out - I was pleasantly surprised. THE best movie I've seen in years. It's scary, super realistic, and I like the scientific approach to an outbreak. Two thumbs up.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Cheap so I bought it and we liked it. My son is four and he likes it a lot. However there are few characters, little talking, and the people in the movie are all a result of what happens when technology takes over. Worth seeing that's for sure.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game has great graphics, a 3D look and is fun and challenging to play.  Somewhat confusing to use in the beginning.
B000EYK4GW|4.0|A must have for any Disney collection. Dumbo is a cute movie but it is kind of sad to me. My kids do not want to watch it ever and it is kind of trippy. Elephants on parade???Plus being old it is not the best to look at.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I grew up as a child playing solitaire with my dad, so this is one of my oldtime favorites.  However, I mainly play the Random Deal, which is much too easy.  I win more than I lose (or at least I think so ... LOL).  The Random Deals should have levels, or am I overlooking something?  Easy or not, it is relaxing to me, and I enjoy it.  Will always be one of my favorites.
B000B8QG4A|3.0|I have never actually saw this movie. I know that my kids do not really watch it. Their are alot of Disney movies and we had to get this for our collection it is up their with Bambi. Maybe in time they will grow to like it
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!!! Must watch... I didnt think I would like it as much as I did!!!! If youre looking for something different to watch this is the one!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This movie is animated but they look like real people! It is crazy how realistic they look. The movie is good it is for somewhat older children in regards to following but it is a detective story and is fun to watch together as a family.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I wanted a Chrome browser on the Kindle 8.9 to overcome some issues with the supplied browser on the unit. Having downloaded the Android version of Chrome, I wasn't certain how to activate it. The ES File Explorer came to the rescue. Open this up, navigate to the folder with the new .apk file (in this case &#34;Downloads&#34;) and click on it to install. I was surprised how easy the process went. Note: &#34;In order to install apps from outside the Amazon appstore... you need to turn on 'Allow Installation of Applications from Unknown sources' located in Settings &#62; Device.&#34;
B000H5U832|5.0|A must have for little boys. We have watched this so much it is starting to scratch up. Lightning McQueen is one of the best creations ever! The characters are fun and the voices and graphics are good. A must have.
0920668372|1.0|Even though the other one-stars on this book have said it all, I had to add my two cents to the chorus in an attempt to balance out the inexplicable  five-starers out there.  Besides being generally creepy as all-git-out, this book also, in no particular order: Celebrates co-dependence and possibly some other serious underlying mental disorders; Is poorly illustrated (a la community college art class project bad, also see creepy, above); Somehow calls to mind freeze-frame horror movie scenes (ancient mother crawling in the dark across her grown son's bedroom floor - queue weird lullaby music...this has just GOT to be a B movie slasher film scene out there somewhere...);  AND on top of all that horses*^%t the dang thing made me CRY.  Am I reading this to my kid?  Hells no.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a must have movie. The kids love it and so do I. I enjoy the movie it has good voices and good characters. No other movie out there like it which is why they are making another now. Worth buying and watching again and again.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|A movie about such wonderful characters as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera must only be so good.  The dramatic and exciting lives of these two artists, please forgive me, is beautifully painted by the picture.  The music is fantastic.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|Not a favorite of mine or the kids. The story is interesting but I do not enjoy the voices of the characters maybe that is why they are rats! The kids prefer to watch something else and so do I.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. What a nice way to escape during lunch break. A chance to break out from the confines of the work chubby.
B007QJ8VBI|5.0|Cary Grant is the successful businessman that also happens to be a bachelor that travels to exotic places.  Doris Day is the unemployed woman on her way to an interview.  As Grants limo passes Day on a corner the car goes through a puddle that splashes Day.  Day is left angered and frustrated sine the car didn't stop.  Grant feels bad as he has no choice but to continue on to his office.  Grant spots her going into a Automat and sends Gig Young to apologize and offer her money to replace/clean her clothes.  Audrey Meadows is her best friend/roommate that works at the Automat.  Gig Young takes the furious Doris Day up to tell off Grant for driving away and being so rude.  When they meet the sparks fly in all directions in this classic funny movie.<br /><br />This is a movie that will brighten the dullest of days.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book gives a look at our flawed justice system. The author takes full responsibility for what she did to end up in prison (which is big of her IMHO). It shows how one action can affect your entire life, and the lives of those around you. I loved how the author related to her fellow inmates. I'd recommend this book to everyone.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have studied social styles for years and have found them to be effective in my marriage and family life; but nothing like 5 love languages!  I was very perplexed as I was reading the book as to what my love language is.  The more I read, the more evident it became to me what my own love language is.  Things got very clear to me once I realized what I really need.<br /><br />AWESOME BOOK!
B00C2VGAW2|2.0|I'm sure the young people like the music, and the movie, but I listen to it only when I am with my grand-daughter. Sorry
B0041D843M|5.0|For years I have been frustrated at all of the organizations and millions and millions of dollars spent looking for the cure for our diseases.  I have said that it has to be in the prevention...and this book brings proof and answers to my suspicions.  This book is not for the faint of heart.  If you believe all the propaganda in our media and government today, you will not like this book.  It lays out the truth!  That's what I love about it.  I have changed my complete approach to living/eating/life!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002KLOPF8|1.0|This was raunchy and we ended up turning it off. I have no idea who might want to watch such a movie.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris never disappoints me when it comes to Sookie. This whole series has kept me wanting more. It seems Sookie may have finally found her happy ending but not without some life threatening adventures first.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is always a good read.  The story is excellent and the characters are all quite enjoyable.  Lawyer books are all fun reads and one can only hope that there are some lawyers with the fortitude to work so hard for their clients.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. I have enjoyed it very much. It gets frustrating when you can't figure it out but then you get it and your like awww I knew that
0440422965|5.0|It's fun!<br />It's light reading<br />AND there are actually several thought provoking questions.<br />PERFECT read for December.<br />Add some levity to those stress-filled holiday days!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love The Good Wife but Unfortunately only started to watch it regularly in season 3. Now I'm all caught up with how everything started and I love the show even more.
B0048WQDIE|1.0|When this book was originally written, the concept of Catc-22 had never been defined.  Today we get it, so after multiple examples, I found it somewhat tedious and couldn't continue reading and didn't complete.  I know it's a classic and I'm sure many will love it, but not me!
B00AR83PN4|1.0|While I love games of this type, this game isn't at all responsive on my Galaxy Note 2. The resolution is grainy, trying to turn the image so that one can place the cube stack properly doesn't respond adequately. It's a very poorly designed game for a HD device.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. so much fun playing with and grooming your horse.  so many different games and tasks to complete.
0345529057|5.0|Exciting series...only into book 1, but looking forward devouring the entire series! I have enjoyed the tv show and want more - hoping this collection adds more details.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love the Big Bang Theory and season 4 gets even better.Great program, and a great price.  Business was a pleasure to do business with.
0062082353|4.0|Good read, keeps your attention. It's a shame we lost Chris in such a tragic way after he beat the odds so many times. RIP Chris Kyle
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love the Big Bang Theory and season 3 continues the excellence.  Great program, and a great price.  Business was a pleasure to do business with.
B0091REZMW|5.0|All my kids and husband loves it! It's similar to Peril at End House and that is a family favorite as well.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|It's the Matt and Amy season with a sprinkling or Rory. Although not every episode was incredible, I enjoyed all of them thoroughly. I especially loved Matt's introductory episode and the season finale 2-parter.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|Finally a different puzzle game. No stars to earn to drive you crazy and thus far no in app purchasing for gems or whatever to make the game frustrating.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|More heroes than the first version. I love it it is the best game I have ever played.<br />So get it.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I'm still not 100% sure if this is the official camera dongle or not. With the very curved bottom edge of the iPad 3 where the 30pin connector lives this was a bit tricky to plug in and fully seat. And even when it was connected it was a bit intermittent when reading the SD card; had to remove/insert a couple times to get it to read. Read/transfer speeds are decent but I wasn't shooting in RAW or anything so files were 1-5MB. Quality feels a bit cheap and I am constantly afraid of snapping the dongle off when it's connected to the iPad.
1402210086|5.0|Yet another cherished &#34;friend&#34; of a novel.  I just love the elegant interspersed with comic twists that G. H. worked into her books.
B002VWNID6|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time, everyone can enjoy this one, it's so good i have to keep replacing it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Difficult enough To Keep You Interested.  Kept Me Busy On And Off For A Few Days.  Can't Wait For More Levels.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|Ordered a movie for my birthday, got the wrong movie( did not send what I paid for, sent different movie)now upset for my birthday and cannot see what I bought. Very disappointed in gohastings as I always buy from them and never had a problem, now I am leery of buying from them again. However, the customer service lady is refunding my money( 7-10 days) so I have to buy another one( bought from someone else as I do not trust them now)very upset even though the rep was very nice about it and told me to keep the wrong item, does not make up for not getting what I ordered.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie was awesome. I learned to love the characters and wish there was more. Even though Megan Fox gets all the &#34;sexy&#34; attention, I'd take Leslie Mann anyday!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|this is a great movie in a series of sequels, looking forward to the next  part. Not a dull moment in it and Robert Downey jr, out does himself in each and every one of these. Keeps your interest all the way through it
B0092S4WLY|5.0|My family loved 100 floors and have enjoyed all of the Escape apps as well. It is tun for us to all work together to escape.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|got this by request of my husband, did not really like it but he wanted it so we now have it in our dvd collection.Arrived earlier than due date and was very pleased with the service
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app for adults and kids to work together. A little simpler than 100 Floors because you know when you are looking at a clue (it is zoomed in).
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|I love Nicholas Hoult!  Really enjoyed this movie! May be a little graphic for young children, the giants do eat some people. Although you don't really see it, it is clearly implied.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|I loved it.  I felt more in touch with the characters then when I watched the movie.  Great story and so looking forward to the next book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It would be so much better if there were not so many ads that keep popping up.I'm not really interested.
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|This is easily the most confusing game I have played. It has no story to direct your actions. You can only determine your next move by referring to the hints. I'm terribly disappointed in this purchase and wish I could get back my money. Very sad for my predicament.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed this series! It was light and funny but lots of great personality. I loved \\"Mr. Foo\\" lol. Kind of kept wishing her and Alexis would get together for some fun hehe. I didn't want it to end! Almost sounds like there could be more books but following different characters? One can only hope. Well worth buying the boxed set!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Easy and fun to play. Nice graphics. Getting harder as you progress through the levels. Will have to see how hard it gets.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is actually a really fun and great game but I wish I could have more energy for my horse because I have to wait. Also change some of the treats cost by changing it to coins instead of jems. Thanks &gt;&middot;&lt;
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The book is very good. I would recommend this to anybody who likes myths and certain Greek mythology fantasies. Very good
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Couldn't stop playing very addicting, stayed up till 2 in morning back up at 6 to finish, yeah I was a little obsessed once I started playing this game... highly recommended
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love these type of games and this one doesn't disappoint. ready for more levels. not too difficult but not so easy either.

B00821OX98|5.0|I love Noah Wiley in this role and enjoying watching character develop.  When I found the show, in its 3rd season, I went back and watched seasons one and two (for free) on Amazon.Keep the episodes coming!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love Phineas and Ferb and this game is great.  I've only played the Perry levels but I'm planning on playing the others as well.  The puzzles are great and some are challenging to get all three gnomes.  I especially love the extra levels you get from finding the secret files.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Alternately fantasy,sci-fi, adventure and kids' story, this tale works on several levels. The tone changes from contemporary dialogue to formal and from comic to scary. The bizarre photos add to the 'peculiar' ambiance.
B000002B1M|5.0|In my opinion this album was better than the classic illmatic all I have to say that it was written was a good follow up and very successful
B000W04S6U|4.0|This is a mix, but there are some great tracks that make it worthwhile. Shows how game music has really progressed from the early days!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I love this show. The earlier seasons were better but it was a great show. Wish it would've had more seasons.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|After viewing Gasland I was angry at how corrupt our government has become.  There is a water shortage for farmers in drought areas and to see MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS of gallons of water being trucked in and used for hydrofracking when instead they could be HELPING farmers is astounding. I know there are some who say natural gas is worth drilling.  But with 50% of all drilled wells failing how safe is it when the aquifers systems are compromised. There is NO WHERE ELSE TO GET WATER BUT HERE.  It is the life blood of our planet and it is being POISONED.  How (if you are Christian) do you explain to GOD in your hour of JUDGEMENT what you did to PROTECT what GOD himself has created?  When he asks, &#34;What did you do to protect MY INVESTMENT?&#34;  How can you look him in the face with a clean conscious and say you did when you sat on the sidelines and watched as greed tore apart HIS planet.  This is our HOME and the only one of it's kind in the GALAXY.  Think about that for a second and then ask yourself CAN AND SHOULDN'T WE BE DOING BETTER.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Good action with twist and turns to keep the action going.  .Typical Die Hard style which I always enjoy for entertainment
B00CF34B2I|4.0|this app is awesome even with the steep price<br />I was wondering if it was possible to play multiplayer bluetooth between a kindle and ipad?...<br />let me know
B004TI5N38|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this first of the John Puller books. I hope there are more and the character continues to to be fleshed as we learn more about him, his family and the next exciting adventure he is thrust into.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse specifically for playing video games with. It is a very good mouse, especially for the price. The three thumb buttons are especially useful to me during the thick of melee combat. At first I wasn't sure about the fact that these buttons aren't recognized as mouse buttons automatically, but most be configured via the Anker software. The configuration that worked for me was to map each of them to an unused keyboard key, and then map that keyboard key to the appropriate binding in-game. This was a bit clunky, but it is notionally simple, and once configured presents no issue. I put all the provided weights into the mouse immediately, as I have large hands and I like the heft of it better with the weights inserted. The color changing lights are functionally useless, but a nice perk - you can match the color of the thing to your computer LED lighting, and the breathing effect is actually rather awesome. The build quality is fine. Good enough to not lose any stars, especially once the price is factored in. But I've seen better build quality in premium mice. I win a lot of battles with this one, no complaints at all.
B005LLX582|5.0|Don't bother with this movie if you're a big fan of linear story lines. If you're a &#34;go-with-the-flow&#34; kind of person, someone who appreciates visual beauty and a story with spiritual depth, then this is one of the best movies ever made.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Helen Mirren holding a gun! Need I say more? Great cast, entertaining,charming. I can't wait for the sequel this summer.
B005DJREJS|1.0|awful..degrading to women and pathetic attempt at humor...don't recommend. Avoid. skip. say No, to this show. No No No no
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great thriller with many unsuspecting twists and turns. Once I started I reading it, couldn't put it down. Great book!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Considering the large scope of the movie and the short time to tell the story, I guess they accomplished this objective.  I enjoyed the movie but would not recommend it to children at all due to the scope of the violence.
0307001466|5.0|My two year old can now recite this book from memory. It is darling, the illustrations are so cute, and the little words rhyme and are easy for young ones to say. Love it!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I have never read much Grisham; this is the second, but I am now convinced that he is a genius.  I'm going to spend the next few months buying and reading every single one of his novels; that's how good he is!
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|It has been awhile since I played angry birds. Coming back I've noticed that the app is much more intrusive, annoying, and tons of pop up ads and videos. Devs are certainly milking this as much as possible. I was more than happy to deal with the ads in the first few apps. Now it's annoying. And I'm over angry birds anyway. Moving on.
B005MLP8E0|4.0|A must see for movie buffs. Orson Welles at his finest.  Who will ever forget the identity of the mysterious \\"Rosebud?\\"
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Great vocalist great. Great great.this artists music inspires my soul and my heart. I would recomend this to everyone. Awesome.
B00499NHLC|4.0|The acting is first rate and the homages to the original stories in updated settings are awesome. The pacing is frenetic and it's easy to get lost if you're not paying attention or don't have your finger on the rewind button.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|I cannot think of a Follett book that I have not enjoyed thoroughly.  In this one he taps into the nightmare of nuclear proliferation.  Good read!
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Paid for 24 hours. But the movie had to reboot several times so we did not have time to finish.<br />And the 24 hrs had expired by the time we could try again.<br />Amazon should extend the time when the system has to reboot that many times.
B001HBWY8M|4.0|Funny, campy,movie! Amanda Byrnes is cute and funny. Actress that plays her mother needs some singing lessons. LoveColin Firth! Mindless entertainment!
B001KZG99A|4.0|Great action and story line, now I have my kids acting like Ironman. Excellent acting as well by Robert Downey
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed both the main characters, as well as learning about the Orphan Trains. It really held my attention. Good ending.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Bingo blitz is a fun game, but some of the new changes they have made are not for the better. They need to change some of them back such as the power ups. They should go back to 9 or 10 power ups for the 1000 coins. I really like the new scatters in the slots.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Build cities on mysterious islands. This is a time management game...keeps you hopping. Some of the levels are very hard to get stars on because you don't have much time. Other levels are very repetitive, but it's still a fun game that I would play again.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Well acted, stylish, creepy horror flick with some nice scares and a few plot twists to keep you guessing.  I am a fan of the director and if you are not you may not react to it as favorably as I did.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sylvia Day writes reasonably well for the genre, but this third book of the trilogy failed to end.  It was as if she ran out of time with the deadline looming.  The story line was okay, characters fairly well developed, but come on, Sylvia, you didn't tie up a single loose end.  So now we are awaiting the fourth book of the trilogy?  Ummm...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love all the characters and am transported back to that time and remember what it was like then!
B00006FDCD|4.0|OK--My fault that I did not notice that it was a mini series when I bought the DVD almost a dozen years after it was issued. Nevertheless, I did not see it at one sitting, I never do  these days. Despite the occasional breaks of half-hour, hour, as well as shorter times, I did get tired both of the sheer length but also of flashbacks and seven people each getting a segment to him/herself, besides reiteration of the imagery from those earlier scenes. Not being one who likes flashbacks under any circumstances, it got very trying. The fact that I remained interested in the film does say something for its merits. The children did a fine job as did the adults when their parts allowed it. The logic of the one suicide escaped me: that is, I understood why he did it, just didn't understand why the plot required him to do it.<br />I should think fans of King would be satisfied; I give no credence to complaints from people (on any occasion) who have read the book and want a movie faithful to the book. Books are books and movies are movies: each has its own grammar, each has its own logic, each reaches the audiences mind and senses in different ways. If you want what is in the book, reread it. I didn't have that problem since I have never read a King book. The movie has the scary monster, the frightened victims and victims-intended, the victories and defeats of the good guys, what more can one ask. Non-fans, with the caveat I have offered about length and repetition, can find an interesting story with some good acting. Arranging to see it on successive days should reduce the tedium and increase the enjoyment. Certainly it is more of a general audience vehicle than the other King adaptations I have seen (though I have not come close to seeing them all).
B005HSGB6W|5.0|It took me a little while of reading to decide if I liked this book or not. I really ended up liking this piece. And it has opened my mind up to reading vast amounts of literature. Read this book.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Interesting and funny with a bit of thoughtfulness. It seems like a good reflection on human behavior while staying lite and funny
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Glad I picked this stand.  Our IT guru picked a different one and all I hear are complaints.  This one is way move versatile, it cleared the cardboard box off my file cabinet and put my monitor it just the right spot.
0345529057|5.0|still reading but love the characters and the way the writer works...already wishing there were more books off to the hunt
B000FBJF3M|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It has an interesting plot, and also has a great deal of information on Roman aqueducts.
0767824571|5.0|I went several years without seeing this movie. People kept telling me that I should see it. When I finally bought it, I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype....My fears were wrong! I loved it! Hilarious!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Read this book in two days.  The story keeps you very engaged and connected to the characters.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|Taylor Goldsmith is an excellent songwriter who speaks to every man or woman. His voice is clear and strong, and the harmonies are beautiful. I have recently  had the pleasure of seeing Dawes perform many of these songs live which has furthered my appreciation of this record.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Great beach read that will have you laughing out loud.  Entertaining and very funny but at some points you do question why you're reading it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|you actually have to honk on this one and figure out the clues and how they work together to get you to the next level. challenging but solvable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This production is so well done, as only the English do with period pieces. Beautiful costumes, settings, and acting...what's not to like!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app, but the latest version has much less info available  The screen is diminished by 1/3 because of ads you can't work around as they remain on top of the weather info. Going to find something else.
006079383X|2.0|WISH I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE BOOK.<br />THE NARRATOR IS REALLY DRY..I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR AWHILE....BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|A pretty entertaining attempt to capture the excitement of the games and the despair of the participants. Good quality DVD at a good price with good shipping.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|I only own one other album from them but I like how different the two albums sound. Talent is talent. No complaints here! :)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Another great James Bond movie. Daniel Craig probably captures the essence of Ian Fleming's Bond better than anyone since Sean Connery. Good quality DVD; good price; prompt shipping.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great book!!!! I Love RUSH!!!!!  The next books in the series are just as great.  Must read all of them.  I am hoping for another book in the series!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Great movie following up on the great Ludlum storyline. The movie's scripts do not necessarily follow the book's story as they focus more on the government secret program conspiracy more that on the character, but still pretty cool. Movie quality was good at a good price. Shipping was prompt.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This album has made its way into my favorites playlist. Its folky and light hearted (mostly). Its definatly worth purchasing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this very much, it went so fast but I am very happy with Amazon prime subscription. I would definitely recommend
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I did not initially understand what all of the commotion was about. I was hooked after watching the first episode and I can't wait until the new season begins.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|On sale for $19.99!!?? I recently paid $26.00 for my used box set on EBay and thought I got the deal of the century. If you are reading this trying to decide to purchase this or not: Do it...Get this box set now at this price. You will not be sorry.<br /> There are so many cool extras I haven't even started on the 4 movies yet.<br />IN CINCINNATI YOU CAN HEAR ME SCREAM---BUY THIS!!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Like the season up until the last scene, don't feel it was a direction the writers should have went.  May not continue on with the series.
1781162646|5.0|Kept my interest right from the start, finished it in two days. I liked the fact that it was not raunchy  like some of his books. Just a very good read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game!It is so good I can't put my kindlefire down to eat dinner.If you love mystery books,shows,or games..this is what you should get.I have to admit it...I read a whole lot of mystery games,watched mystery shows(including Scooby Doo),and played mystery games but the games weren't as fun as this game.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|No matter if you watch Castle or not, this is a great book with a lot of mystery and whodunit.  If your a Castle fan you will be able to see a different side to the characters.
1885167776|5.0|Makes complete sense and I started using these thoughts and ideas the day I started reading it!! LOVE IT! Thanks so much!
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|I'm a very big fan of REM and especially love Green album.  I like all songs ... The additional CD with live recordings its great!  The package with adittional items its very beautiful !
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Just watch all of them. What a great show! Can't wait for the next season. Some new cast members look very exciting.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't wait for the next book! I would recommend this book for everyone that wants to a true romance novel!
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Region free being the key, I have no issues playing these.  The only difference is that I watch &#34;The Philosophers Stone&#34; instead of &#34;The Sorcerer's Stone&#34; and that doesn't bother me in the slightest.  I love my Harry Potter collection!!
1118109791|5.0|I have been out of school for 15 years. I took the free online test offered through the gmat website and then studied using this book for 2 weeks.  I ended up getting a score well above what I needed to get accepted into the MBA program.<br />The book has a lot of practice questions and clear solutions. There are also sections to brush up on your geometry, algebra, etc.  After studying using this book, I felt much more confident going into the test that I was going to do okay.<br />I suggest taking a timed test online because having a set amount of time is a lot different than leisurely going through the problems in the book.
0061148512|4.0|Pretty depressing. The cover of the book is a bit confusing because it has zero relation to the rest of the novel.
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|This is a awesome album! I was very suprised how great the music is from start to finish. Worth listening too.
038533348X|4.0|pretty good. it has words. theres binding and a cover. the chapter titles are in bigger text than the body, which is nice.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I started playing and before I new it the whole family was involved. We had a blast trying to figure these out
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its like the first temple run but a bigger monkey and better graphics<br />(And better sound) I recommend this app for people who love temple<br />run plus you can unlock other characters like for example: Berry Bones.<br />And Scarlett Fox, LEE (I forgot the rest of her name) and Guy Dangerous,<br />Which is the character you start with. PLEASE BUY! IT'S AWESOME!!!!
B003QP4BJM|4.0|Such doom and gloom is written about humanities future in so many books; now thanks to the author's insight there is a very reasonable argument against all the negativity and for that I am truly grateful.  Easy read, logical presentation and just enough information to make for interesting discussions with friends when the hot topics of the media are discussed.  For a person who likes to see both sides of the coin before just listening to the &#34;experts&#34;.
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|Started out slow but it picked up more towards the end.  It drug along in certain places but overall it was just alright.
0061719544|5.0|Read it and loved it. This it is an easy book to read and it is very entertaining,funny,and sad. Whoever reads this book will have a new appreciation for this man with a funny speech.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|My wife has an android phone, I use an iPhone, we can charge our phones at the same time during road trips. I use it a LOT. I'm always mobile due to my work. Handy.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|The reason I bought this was to see Blu ray version . That disc will not play ,  This is my first bad experience with Amazon ,  I bought this a while back , just got to watching it , They will not refund me ....Hm,mm
B001DPDVE8|4.0|Arrived promptly, watched a few edpsodes, all worked great,  i did remove disks and put in plastic cases  to minimize scratches based on other reviews. There are a lot to watch and price was good
B0041VB8BO|4.0|Fun is just Fun.  We saw them in concert which made the CD even more fun to listen too. Fun
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I bought this movie to watch before I saw the new version.  I saw this originally in 1974 and wanted to give myself a background before I watched the 2013  Gatsby.  Actually, I LOVED the simplicity of this one.  I was not, nor have ever been, a Mia Farrow fan but after watching it again she was the &#34;quiet&#34; compliment needed for this film.  This Gatsby also explained her husband's mistress better than the new release.  This version followed the F. Scott Fitzgerald book almost to the letter.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|I picked this figure up a few weeks ago and have been relatively pleased with the product.  I am happy that they decided to re-issue the figure since SS1 Goku Figuarts were selling for $140+ beforehand.  I also own the SS Vegeta figure that was released last year.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- High quality sculpt and paint work<br />- Highly posable - Clothing able to be rotated so that many positions do not leave gaps<br />- Good price since re-issue<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The color palette is very unsaturated - the colors are very light, true to the manga, but I think I would have preferred the SDCC release<br />- The hair is not dynamically colored.  Goku's hair is straight yellow with a light fade to white near some of the larger tips.  Compared to the SS Vegeta figure which has several shades of yellow and orange and also has white tips, Goku's hair seems lackluster.<br />- Not the easiest to balance in active poses, a slight breeze can blow him down in the Kamehameha pose.  However, this could be chalked up to my lack of posing skill<br /><br />Overall: Definitely a great figure, but if the SDCC version was not $160, I would have preferred it.
B009QU9X44|5.0|Great book. Very interesting and a different take on American Negroes and immigrants. The words and paraphrases were beautiful. Very modern.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|This app is a very good with very good puzzles to solve. EACH LEVEL IS DIFFERENT. DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHERS. Very cute theme and very fun to play for all ages. I say no apps are worth paying for so it was awsome that this was the app of the day.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|As a dog lover and dog park go'er, I was fascinated with the possibilities of where The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead could lead my adventurous dog loving spirit. I am happy to say that I never expected what I got, which is a good thing.<br />This is a story of multiple characters (including dogs) all interwoven into a suspenseful mixture of mayhem. It's sort of a macabre Seinfeld episode--not in the sense of comedy--but in the sense of a lot of what seem to be disjointed bits of information, suddenly, at the end pull together into one complete package.<br />The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club was an easy, compelling read, rich in characterization and setting. The story line would certainly lend itself to the big screen or to as it's already been likened by previous reviewers, episodic television the likes of Desperate Housewives.<br />My first thought after finishing this story was, \\"Is anybody really who I think they are?\\"
B008LODRT8|5.0|I read this book in 4 days between completing my course work with such delight; it is a definite page turner.
1612680011|5.0|I sent this book to soldiers in care packages our church prepared.  I hope it will help them plan for the future.  It certainly made an impact on me and my husband.  We are now retired and have our home paid for and 3 rental properties which supply us with income.  I don't think we would be where we are today  had we not devoured this book many years ago.
0345803493|5.0|I actually came to tears while reading this book. I loved the series. I suspect I will be going out and picking up a few extra toys of my own soon.
0007447868|3.0|To start, I will say that I absolutely loved the first book and liked the second book.  The third book was good, but started to delve into details that I found myself trying to justify why such details were being provided.<br /><br />As of book three, I can honestly say that Martin is starting to make the books in this series long for the sake of being long.  I have read several chapters now where entire paragraphs (and in some rare cases, entire pages) could have been removed and would have only enhanced the story by simply moving it along.  The needless reiteration of the situation at hand and excessive detail into mostly irrelevant components of the storyline make the reader have to work to get to the story, and not simply enjoy it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  Getting into high detail about elements of a story can be really cool to read, but the way it's done in the 3rd book and more so in this one starts to get annoying.<br /><br />In part because of the TV series, I'll continue to finish reading the book series.  However, as each chapter progresses, I'm considering writing my own abridged version of these books just so people don't have to suffer reading through several pages of wasted ink on paper.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Beautiful movie, which introduces us in Miss Potter's life. It tells the history of a of life of pain and of overcoming
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|This is a great old action series, among my favorite Ford/Spielberg films.  Unfortunately, one of the movies' soundtracks wasn't balanced properly... music would play fine, but voices weren't coming through.
072325804X|5.0|Beautiful cover of the best stories that can exist for the children. Of great quality, photography, better than was waiting for the price. Really a wonderful work
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Maybe their best ever!  Great storyline!  Had everything we've come to expect from Preston & Child.  Ready for the next in the series!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the despicable me game  rocks you can have fun and rock out and Its great to have fun. I love it
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Perhaps one of the greatest shows on TV.  Reminiscent of &#34;HOUSE&#34;, I see a lot of parallels (scruffy beard, drug use, arrogance, inspiration (often the final clue to the mystery) from his associate(s), and general genius) which I enjoy immensely.  I had the opportunity to watch the Pilot and early episodes again.  Watson (I LOVE Lucy Liu) was a little rough in the beginning -- but it takes time to establish the chemistry.  They are a PERFECT pair now.  These are very well (but not perfectly) thought out mysteries and Holmes, Watson, Gregson, and Bell all work amazing well together.  Two words: WATCH IT!  (It would be nice if Sherlock started calling her Dr. Watson -- the only thing I miss about the characters.)  Oh, and the whole Moriarty sub plot/story – excellent!!!  (No spoiler here.)
B001LF347E|5.0|I will never understand why this show ended as abruptly as it has. Thousands are deeply saddened. This is how they are responding: [...]
B005RZ8W94|5.0|Love the band and have seen them 4 times and will continue to see them live.  But, if I ever get the itch of wanting to see them and they are not on tour, this DVD set does not disappoint.  Definitely worth putting in the player and cranking up the surround sound to this!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you don't know this movie by now you have been living under a rock. This movie is Awesome end of story. How it wasn't recognized in the academy awards just proves how good it is. Action scenes are intense and exciting. The plot was well thought out and dramatic. The acting was top notch and it even had a little romance to please the ladies. Great flick by all standards and I hope to see a lot more movies like this.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Great movie for ALL ages. It was delightful and uplifting with great graphics. It had lesson about friendships that everyone could relate to.
0345529057|5.0|Its the best price I could find anywhere. It was exactly what I wanted. I love the show and wanted to get the books to see if it was like the show on HBO.
B009CGKKXK|4.0|It's not the best jurrasic park film but it is entertaining and filled with action for family fun!  we enjoyed it!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Great special effects, good story line, liked the characters, lots of action. Family thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Couldn't wait to see second one.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am enjoying his books immensely. It is fun to watch the series and then read the books to fill in the gaps.
0316067598|5.0|This book is hard to beat in it's category.  I really enjoyed the background info as well.  It shows you that a lot of these type guys are heading this direction from an early age.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game helps me get my house fix without having to spend money. I love horses. I would suggest this game to anyone
B0020BUWX2|3.0|This book had my attention from the first few pages. However, I found the book way too short and the characters not fully developed. I did really like the ending and went right on to the sequel to see what happened!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great work out video, and I love how you can progress through the levels.  The other great part about it is how quick the work out is.  I can do it while my kids eat breakfast, and I feel energized for the rest of the day.  If you get sick of the level you are on, you can go to another level and just modify the moves.  I noticed results after a couple of weeks.  If you stick with it, it will work! :)
B004H4XDBI|3.0|This book grabbed my attention from the first few pages. I only wish it was longer and that the characters were more developed. Definitely worth a read though!
B000HF0J36|3.0|Same old thing, just another shark movie! Thought it was kinda boring. I did watch it all. No one will ever beat Jaws.
B006QPX7UI|3.0|The movie was good but I has to install a new browser for it to accept the movie.  It took 2 days to get it working.  The end of the movie kept freezing up so the quality eas poor.
B009UNH0EM|3.0|Purchased two; one each for different locations. Works well at charging but the device falls off regularly due to the weak magnet. Poor design of the Legend earpiece overall. I like the old styled mini USB charging port.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|for a free app, this is probably one of the best tools that i've seen. A definite download for music lovers
B0031KC8OC|5.0|Watching Season 1 got us hooked on the show and we have been watching seasons 2 & 3. The stories are fantastic interlocking puzzles.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Sad that there is only 10 episodes in the 6th season but, overall very satisfied in how everything wraps up. So happy! I love CHUCK AND BLAIR!!!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this season of sherlock with my older brother and dad. It really makes you think while still bringing back that wit and cleverness from the first season!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|totally awesome. takes lots of skill. start out with guns and is challengeing. missiles make it much easier. start in the 1950 and goes to 2006.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So i was worried when i got this game that it was gonna be to &quot; kiddie&quot; but no sirie Bob lol this game is to cute and i love it ( esp especially for c free)
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Back to his best after many years of ordinary writing, Hope he continues in this vein and we eagerly await more.
B00CIS1OKW|3.0|The movie gets lots of things right, but it seems more like two or three movies mashed up into one.  It was trying to do too many things and doesn't do any of them well.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|He never disappoints with plots, style, intrigue and I think that he is currently the best most consistent author of this genre.
B009MYARIK|3.0|If I weren't desperate for light reading during a 6 week recuperation I would not have finished this book. I will find it difficult to recommend it to a friend.
B004LROMWU|5.0|A gripping television series which held the interest of both my wife and myself Steven Spielberg shows his talent in this series
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Dustin Hoffman's first directorial venture was an amazing success. One of the best movies in a while. Definitely will appeal to a more mature audience.
0345803493|5.0|Very sexual, stimulating, but honestly got to the point that I began skipping parts of the sexual encounters. I liked the way it let you hanging wanting more, knowing for sure who the villain was but wanting to read to see his next move.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Typical Spielberg garbage in the guise of \\"history\\". Two and a half ponderous, pretentious, stiflingly boring hours about a few weeks in the life of the most overrated president in history. If he hadn't been assassinated, he might be seen now as the wildly destructive crackpot-on-a-mission he really was - a 19th century George W Bush - instead of as the wise, easy-going, deeply compassionate but pragmatic martyr this silly movie makes him out to be.<br /><br />Because Lincoln refused to allow the southern states to secede, which they had the right to do under the constitution, nearly a million people were slaughtered and the economy was ruined. Although he won his war, the damage he caused the country still has not healed 150 years later. Anybody who believes that this is a united country has his head in the sand. The South is and always has been a separate society in every way and has NEVER fit with the North.<br /><br />Just look at a red-state/blue-state map! The United States is made up of two distinct nations: one from the southeast westward, then up to the Canadian border and a skip northwest to Alaska; the other in the northeast, the west coast and Hawaii. It's a natural, organic division that has been here as long as there have been European settlers, and no amount of brainwashing or sappy movie-making will EVER change it. This has NEVER been a united country; it will never BE a united country. It's like trying to force Ireland to stay in the United Kingdom: it doesn't work.<br /><br />We are TWO countries, not one. It was a bad marriage from the beginning. The South should have been allowed to leave peacefully 160 years ago, to effect an amicable divorce when amity was still possible. But Lincoln the zealot refused, and the mess he left is still tearing these unnaturally \\"United\\" States apart.<br /><br />Slavery obviously was a peripheral issue, because it's long gone but the problems remain. Left on its own, the South would have eliminated slavery eventually anyway, as has every other civilized nation on earth. All Lincoln did by ramming it down the South's throat was to destroy the country, enforcing a union that has never worked, from 1620 until now.<br /><br />Stupid movies like this just preach to the choir, reminding Lincoln-lovers why they love him so much and celebrating his stirring triumph over the bad old South, when a TRULY visionary leader would have let it go. The South might very well have WANTED to rejoin the union later, after it had learned for itself that slavery is unspeakably evil, but it never had that chance.<br /><br />Lincoln did his best to destroy the South, and although he won his war he failed to annihilate the enemy. So now we have the South using Lincoln's very own Republican Party to wreak their vengeance on the rest of the country. Thanks a lot, Abe.
0345803485|5.0|Very sexual, stimulating, I like the way it left you hanging wanting more. I loved the encounter of the two and the plot of the story.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very Witty and entertaining. It's like a cooler law and order  but represent big corporate. Their a lot of back stabbing and cunningness
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed the book and liked the way it moved from sexual to emotional level. However there is such a thing as too much!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is an ok fame, not liken that I'm not getting any where. . Oh well that's I get for playing!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This movie is still as good as the first time I saw it.  The HD quality is superb.  I will watch this one again.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I really do happen to like mine but then I only use it two or three times a day. So what do you use your for right?<br /><br />dray
1444710338|4.0|it met my expectations.  Book received as described. Very helpful with some recipes too.  Lots of good information and easy to follow plan
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Loved this series and want more please! Ace is HOT and Eva just as much.  I want to read more about t them.  Book 3 can not be the end, please.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is simply something else. It's fresh. It's... UNIQUE! I had so much fun reading it. Even dare to say I wouldn't mind reading it all over again. Every single one of the characters is unbelievably fantastic.<br /><br />Emma Chase absolutely nailed it with this book. Well written. I said it already but I say it again, the characters, all of them, are just awesome.<br /><br />Hell, I give it 10 STARS!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Really dislike the new version of the app. Hope they are making plenty from the advertising revenue because they have lost me.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it was hard to put down. It was a real page turner. I was surprised at who the murderer was and why. I am looking forward to reading another book by Gillian Flynn. My daughter-in-law was the one who gave me this book to read. She has read two other books by this same author.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I have just recently discovered these guys on youtube and I can not get enough.  This cd is high quality and the music is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome but I can't log into Facebook because my gmom was playing and did something. I think she deleted it then gone try and play so now I have to get all of my coins back and people. Besides that it's a great game! People install this so when you get a chance.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|I love this movie! it is such a cute story... and its Nicholas Sparks so it cant be horrible! and its blu-ray.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I expected this app to be really dun because I love Pac-Man but it was really hard to navigate, it not the full version and its just not the same as playing it in an arcade
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Who wouldnt buy Mad Max on blue ray! its AWESOME! i love mel gibson! this version is amazing. better than i remember.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|It was good enough for me to watch the whole thing, but it had similarities to Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote. Hansel and Gretel kept having the equivalent of safes dropped on them - being thrown against walls or dropped from above the treetops. I could not feel any suspense because it was soon clear that they could not be seriously hurt.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I can spend a day playing it and never get bored...awesome! If you get easily hooked on games this is it.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Good visuals to accompany the fantastic score - shivers every time the Phantom's theme is played as the deep and commanding tones play out...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved the second half of this book much more than the first.  The first was slow.  I want more!!!  Spoiler alert: I cannot believe Jon is dead.  I hope the queen gets what she deserves...
B0021L8V0M|1.0|I have almost never seen anything, even in the world of suspension-of-disbelief American thrillers, as completely out of touch with reality, craft, or reason as this film. It is utter and complete nonsense. What is frightening is that Amazon reviewers could give it a good review, and people give it 3 1/2 stars. Are you all mad?
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The movie has all of the elements I like.<br />I would watch it again.<br />Jack Reacher is a cool character.
0770437400|4.0|If you're a fan of the zombie genre, this is a &#34;no-brainer.&#34;  (Sorry.)<br /><br />Telling the story from the perspective of the survivors is what makes this book work.  Brooks does a great job weaving the experience through different cultures, from Japanese to Russian and beyond.  It's an edgy and addictive tale, frought with all the decomposition and moaning you some to expect from the zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />The &#34;Movie Tie-In Edition&#34; is a bit misleading in that the movie takes its own liberties for continuity and suspense.<br /><br />This an easy, engrossing summer read.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Considering how Paula Deen was treated using the &#34;N&#34; word over 30 years ago...this movie should be banned. A waste of money.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|While I am using this unit well as a left-handed person, I have lost the use of the little joy-stick and those buttons.  too bad these companies do not care about this minority.  The product does work well and the software that goes with it is well thought out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging but super cool! only goes up to level 10 though.... still a lot of fun! definatly recomand this to everyone who loves or enjoys puzzles..
B0094K20FK|5.0|I am a big Star Trek fan, and I never get tired of watching the movies over and over again.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It was a documentary and not much of a story.  Very poor story line.  Didn't keep me interested.  Really hard to finish.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|The same ole, same ole that you come to expect from the master story teller.Thank you Mr.Dylan for many years of great music.I still like &#34;Saved&#34; and &#34;Slow Train Coming&#34; the best.Rock on Mr.Dylan,rock on.....support your favorite artists.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am so happy this is available on the kindle now. It is a very addictive and fun game. Will keep you playing for hours.
0425263991|5.0|I LOVED this book.<br /><br />I have read all of the books in this series and thought I would've liked this one the least.  I came into this one totally blind and was surprised to learn that it was going to be about Kaleb Krychek.  I might have missed it.  I might have put it off and picked up another book instead.  I would've been wrong.  It was so good.<br /><br />It was the perfect mix of bringing in a new Psy character, the ongoing war, the issues with the PsyNet, staying true to the characters/theme/story, and as always the romance between the main characters.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It came to a very satisfying end but also allowed room for another book to tell more of the story.  Nalini took her time and developed both Kaleb and Sarah with care.  It didn't feel rushed at all. 5 stars!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read the entire series of these books and this one was just okay. The first one was the &#34;best&#34; one of them. I really only read this one to see what happens but it's not a super read it's just okay. All in all I didn't find the writing to be great in any of them and the story was mediocre but if your in to tween reads with lots of kinky sex it will be right up your alley.
0316228532|4.0|I enjoyed this book even though I was sitting by the pool, with all kinds of distractions, on a cruise.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a great game! It has never done anything weird on my Kindle, iPod, and iPad! My mom likes it my little sister likes it and my little cousins like it too! GREAT GAME!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the series....I just saw Season 1 and 2 this past month.  I had to be caught up by the time Season 4 airs in January, so I purchased Season 3.  What a great series!
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Matt Damon was a great actor who found himself embodying a great dramatic action role. Jeremy Renner plays Jeremy Renner following a great dramatic action role. Don't expect a blockbuster! Everything you see here has been done before.<br /><br />That doesn't mean this isn't a good time. Grab the popcorn!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Now I am caught up; ready for January.  Each season gets better and better.  I recommend for all who have never seen this series, but start with Season 1.
B00136JS12|5.0|...this is one of the amazingest. Being a child of the 80's and 90's, my go-to comparisons include the first efforts by Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam; however, in terms of classic rock, I'd put this more in terms of The Doors, where most of the songs were timeless hits, and the others were just plain great. It's hard to get much better than this.
B0011XBLV2|5.0|Audio  and  video  of  top  quality.  Not  as  good  as  the  Blu-ray  but  wouldn't  expect it  to  be.  Very  good  second.
B008B3H4VQ|2.0|A few good songs. Not many. Mainly, there's an overwhelming sense of &#34;Didn't I hear this song already?&#34;<br /><br />It's not so much that this album and all its songs are BAD, but don't rush out to buy this. Maybe it'll go on sale soon.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Whilst this is definitely not most realistic show I have watched (aliens taking over the world excluded) it is still a entertaining show, and if you have nothing better to do, I would recommend watching it.
B001BIMYXQ|2.0|...I would stay away. I'm a fan of the 80s, and remembered with fondness a few of their tunes. Unfortunately, there aren't enough songs here that I'll listen to more than a handful of them before switching to another album. If you can get this at a bargain (I think I got it while it was 3.99$ or something?) pick it up; otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
B00457X7IQ|5.0|Amazing! The perfect sequel that keeps you hooked...and all secrets revealed except one...<br />I can't wait to read the next one!
B009X01ELC|4.0|It protects well... can't really complain about that.<br /><br />On the downside: the strap on mine tends to become misplaced on occasion; when it's closed and secured, it's fine... but otherwise it slips behind the Kindle. It's a minor annoyance.<br /><br />Also, be careful about how you handle the swivel on this item. A few times I tugged and twisted the wrong way. It's a sturdy device, but I'm sure there's a certain amount of abuse that'll damage it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Who knew you could get console quality game on your kindle?!. This is just enough to keep you entertained without the console price tag.  No lag.<br />I had a great time with this game.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Do a Google search for cracked.com and The Dark Knight Rises script. Everything I disliked about the film is right there!<br /><br />Look, we all wanted an end to the trilogy that would live up to the hype of the trailers. We all know it fell short.<br /><br />This was a decent movie that relied heavily on its predecessors and the audience's prior Bat-knowledge to be interesting. In terms of quirks and twists? Well, most of those are either telegraphed to the movie-savvy viewer, or are simply less interesting than the production team designed.<br /><br />Does that mean I didn't enjoy the film? Nope. It was a good time! Bane is awesome! Bat-fighting and large-scale...<br /><br />Well. Sadly, the more I think about the GOOD parts of this movie, the more I realized what I didn't like about it.<br /><br />Any chance that Nolan and Bale will give us a Bat-redo on this one?<br /><br />Meh.
B0031GUR44|1.0|Bought this for my 2011 GTI, I had purchased the Bosch kit for the front blades a few months before and they worked perfectly (and were a huge discount) so I ordered this to replace the rear blade. This blade is not only the wrong attachment type, it is also a couple inches too long.<br /><br />Ended up going to the VW dealer and got the OEM part for $14. If you own a Mark VI Golf or GTI don't bother, just visit the dealer.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Unfortunately, I saw Zero Dark Thirty before this movie, so I made the obvious comparison and found Hurt Locker to be a little bit lacking. It had a good story with good characters, but something about it lacked the *zing* that makes me want to watch a movie over and over again; there was no one moment that drew me in and wouldn't let go. Perhaps I've seen Jeremy Renner playing Jeremey Renner one too many times? Maybe I need to give this flick a second chance? The thing is... I don't have a strong desire to do so.<br /><br />In terms of Iraq/desert war movies spanning the past 20+ years, I'd opt for The Kingdom, Jarhead, Zero Dark Thirty... and if you want to go broader, Black Hawk Down. It's a good movie, but I was hoping for a little bit more.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is fun. It takes a while for some features to load. I like playing it at work to pass a few slow minutes every now and then.
B001FB4W02|3.0|There were a few major changes in this season, and the Amazon editorial hits the nail on the head: as bad as this series was going (I trudged through seasons six and seven more because I'm obsessive enough to want to finish what I'd started, rather than because I enjoyed the show), season 8 breathes some life back into it. The snippets of the Superman superhero world begin coming alive a little bit, and the overall feel is that the series is finally heading somewhere -- albeit slower than desired. It seems there was a conscious effort to start addressing the DC universe, and at times this works out really well... but even a casual Superman fan like myself groaned at the way the last few episodes -- including the finale -- tried to incorporate more than it could handle. Absording the Doomsday character would've been great if they'd turned that last issue (er... episode!) into the knock-down drag-out fight such a character deserved. The main problem? Doomsday was a SUPERMAN'S villain in the book -- not the Smallville's incarnation of him. The lack of history and special effects limited the emotional impact the final episode SHOULD have had.
0062197266|5.0|I absolutely loved the story. Any woman who has been with a controlling man can relate to the story line in eerie similarity. The story keeps you guessing, and the pages turning. I would read this 100 times more and I wish it was longer so I could continue to emerge myself in this chilling, but romantic thriller.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|...and listening to this album reminds me of how much I really do enjoy Phil Collins.<br /><br />That said, you can only listen to so much Phil Collins before you want to punch yourself in the face. Sorry, Phil phanatics!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Turned on my Kindle Fire HD yesterday to find they've replaced the formerly clear, concise Weather Channel page format with one that's been \\"pretty-fied\\". The results are pages which load slower, are filled with clutter, and require multiple clicks and page views to get what was formerly seen on one condensed page. Sure, it's prettier, but at the expense of convenience, efficiency, and a multitude of intrusive ads. Now am on the hunt for a replacement app.
B0011Z77OK|4.0|I wanted to like this collection a LOT. It's good, and there are great memories in most of the tracks... but maybe my expectation of hearing the Peppers all in order was too high.<br /><br />I'll give it another whirl and see if it can change my mind, but this is a borderline 3-star selection for me.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I say this with every hesitation removed - starting as a complete skeptic, my son told me to start watching this series - I never thought I would like a show about a group of motorcycle mafia. I was totally and completely wrong... The writing, acting and direction of this series has led it to one of my all time favorites standing right shoulder to shoulder with MASH (showing my age here). The story is believable - simple but deeply woven, the characters are complex intelligent and relatable even to someone so far outside the spectrum of their setting. The story is based around the Hamlet of Shakespeare fame, it can get dark and seedy so if you can't stomach violence or sexual innuendo then this might be a tough pill to swallow but if you can look past the plate glass morality play that this story sits upon then you have struck gold. The acting is incredible and engaging probably the thing that hooked me first was the stellar acting abilities of each cast member - you will find no weak links here and the leads go beyond what I have seen before.<br /><br />Even if this type of show isn't your cup of tea give it four or five episodes because it only gets better each season - each episode.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Do you REALLY need a review for this? Honestly, by the time YOU read what I've written, there will have already been two updates, a patch, and a societal shift back to MySpace. Ha!

B00A46H3J6|5.0|In the triumvirate of Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Stone Temple Pilots, can there REALLY be a winner? Ten doesn't have quite the kickass power of Core, but it has more soul; Smells Like Teen Spirit has a few anthems that can't be beat, but start-to-finish Ten has jams that you can sing along with and feel.<br /><br />C'mon, y'all: throw on your holey jeans and have a spin down memory lane. If you do not own this album, and you were alive in 1994, then shame on you!  ;o)~
B00A7W29BE|3.0|so far so good any time i needed to scan a page for later it came out great so no complaints.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This step back movie production is a great way to get acclimated to the Jesse Stone we have seen in the 1st movie, which actually is 2nd in the timeline of the character.  Tom Selleck plays the part of Jesse Stone, damaged ex-LAPD homicide detective as if he, or Jesse were made for each other. The story line creates the weaknesses and the strengths of the characters, and the great plots which Robert B. Parker is the best at bringing to life. If you haven't read any of the Parker books, do yourself a favor and check them out, I am sure Amazon has them, although I have not checked. I didn't check as I have read everything Parker has written for the last 20 years or so. Then do yourself a really GREAT favor and buy some more of the movies, for they are sure to please. Now I've got to get back to ordering the rest of this series! Enjoy!
B00APYKXFS|2.0|for these kind of games unless you have a gamepad you'll get hit by a lot. or unless you have noddles for finger i suggest you pass.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A very enjoyable read.  If you like a change of pace in your heroes the Jack Reacher is for you.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you have not read this book, read it. The musical and movie are fantastic, but nothing beats this story.
1451648537|4.0|I was extremely interested in the personality of Steve Jobs and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was bold enough to cover him in a good and bad light, detailing his eccentricities and  portraying him as a mysterious character, tortured in part by his genius.  I do have an IT contracting background, but one does not have to be a tech geek to enjoy this book, it is written for all audiences.  I highly recommend this book, no matter how you may feel about Apple or Steve Jobs.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The plot of this book left nothing resolved at the end.  It seemed like Ms. Day ran out of time before she could complete it.
1250006341|5.0|I chose this as a gift for my sister, who is a big fan. I am, too, so I looked through the book and found it facinating. Wish I had a copy for myself.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin has created an entire world of complex relationships, vendettas, and mysteries. This one was hard to put down I am looking forward to the next.
B00C1S945G|5.0|This season is fantastic! It is just as good as season 1.  You can not go wrong at all by watching any of the Star Trek TNG shows!
1476719071|1.0|Glamorizing a character as violent as Travis sets a terrible, terrible example for young girls. It is not OK to beat people into oblivion. Period. And it should not be romanticized. I would not want a daughter of mine thinking it was OK to sleep in someone's bed all the time, defending it as a bet, and then dating some other guy while the 2 keep running into each other. I would hope no self respecting guy would put up with that behavior either.<br /><br />Pretty much everything about this book sends a terrible message to the audience for which it is intended.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i thought this was gonna be a quick delete but i am really enjoying it.  you can buy extras for your car using coins earned.  not your own money like so mamy other apps.  get this and see how far you can get before a crash ...lots of fun!
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Mildly entertaining but just doesn't hold a candle to the rest of the series. The chase scene early on is fantastic though ... then it just goes down hill from there.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I had heard of this book primarily in connection to \\"grimdark\\" fantasy. Because of that, I didn't have a lot of urgency where reading it was concerned.<br /><br />When I did finally pick it up, I did not find it especially grim. I did, however, find it very well written.<br /><br />The story takes place from the points of view of a few very different characters. Logen Nine-fingers is a veteran warrior of a clan-based warrior society. As the story opens he's separated from his fellows, who he believes have been killed by \\"flatheads,\\" a non-human intelligent monster. He shortly becomes mixed up in the business of a Magus claiming to be an ancient and powerful figure of legend.<br /><br />Jezal dan Luthar is a young army officer and noble of the Union, Logen's people's southern neighbor. His primary concern when we meet him is carousing and becoming well known by competing in \\"the Contest,\\" a fencing tournament.<br /><br />Sand dan Glokta is an Inquisitor, a member of the Union's secret police and torturers. He was himself a victim of torture and questioning at the hands of the Gurkish Empire during the Union's last war. In his position as Inquisitor he begins to uncover wrongdoings and conspiracies among the Union's aristocracy and wealthy.<br /><br />Other viewpoints come and go, but those three do most of the work, particularly Logen and Glokta.<br /><br />The story takes place against a background of growing unrest. The Northmen, considered to be barbarians and uncivilized by the Union, have been at war for years. A King has finally emerged, and threatens the Union's northern borders. The Gurkish chafe over lost territory and threaten from the south. Politics, grudges and underhanded dealings threaten the Union from within. Bayaz, \\"first of the Magi,\\" has left his library and is meddling in the affairs of the rest of the world for the first time in many years (if he's even who he says he is.)<br /><br />The book sets the stage and brings the major players together. There are several subplots that are introduced and concluded throughout the book, but no major plot line is concluded. In addition, Luthar's character gets a great deal of page count without actually doing anything that's not totally personal. I believe this is to set him up for later events, but it was disappointing in the end. I'd consider these the book's only major weaknesses.<br /><br />I was very impressed with Abercrombie's command of the language. He was able to create an identifiable and characteristic voice for each of his point of view characters. He uses an intimate limited third person which puts us in the head of the POV character without switching to the first person. He also makes excellent use of cadence and repetition.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent book well written. I am looking forward to finishing the series.There are several subplots that are introduced and concluded throughout the book, but no major plot line is concluded.

B0040HERTY|4.0|Funny, fast-paced, action-packed, mindless movie glory!  It has everything a good 'Die Hard' should.  Regardless of the laughable title for this film, it is definitely worth seeing.
B0082POQY6|5.0|If you like Castle on television, you'll love this and all the Castle Heat series of books. The writing is sharp and verbal imagery makes it easy to see the characters as portrayed by the actors on the show. Altho' the story parallels the series, one does not need to watch the show to enjoy the books.  They can stand alone and are comparable to the best of mystery books.
B00371QQ0M|1.0|You would think that if the regular DVD would have both versions so would the Bluray but it does not.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game...having teammates is awesome! Like the various levels and means to progress. The matching scatters are fun & give an opportunity to gain more coins. Wish those HTG's (hard to get) collection items were a little easier to get. Overall the game is fun and gives a chance to meet lots of new people.
B007WPM7SO|1.0|This movie was hard to get into.  The sex scenes and gore in this movie merit nothing less than an R rating.  I couldn't finish the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. triple AWESOME. I love Love LOVE it I can't Believe. how AWESOME it is like seriously it's so AWESOME AWESOME AWESOM
B00CKZX0AA|4.0|I'm a huge fan of good soundtracks and the Man Of Steel Soundtrack is no exception. Hans Zimmer is a genius and this soundtrack is amazing. It gets you so emotional and involved with the movie that it brings out your emotions every time. Recommend it to all!
B00006AW2G|5.0|I had this record on vinyl way back when and loved it.  I loved it so much it has scratches and skips and crackles when you play it.  This CD plays in my car as well as at home and sounds just great: clear and without any crackling,hissing, or other imperfections.<br />Of course this is one of the Stones' finest hours.<br />This order shipped so fast and arrived at my door so quickly I nearly burned my fingers!  Well, I exaggerated but it did ship unbelievably fast and arrived well before expected.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is very fun. Especially all the details for a free game so if you like iron man and want a new mobile game get this! Just to worn you it takes up A LOT of memory.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|On the surface the premise of the series is unique, but the execution of the premise is brilliant and each character is unique and brilliantly played.  &#34;Rachel&#34;  is my personal favorite, way to old to be a &#34;groupie&#34; but she is the best.  Well worth watching
B001OFJPIS|5.0|Ron Perlman is boss. Guillermo Del toro is a genius. Darkhorse comics rules.<br />Make hellboy 3 before its too late.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|This is a sleeper movie that very appropriately starts off as pretty black and white and campy, but as the movie goes on it leads you into deeper thought and consideration. It paints with a colorful brush our conceptions of the world,in relation to modern American culture to it's idealized and romanticized recent past, while never demonizing either.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Is Born Sinner up to par?  The fact is, Born Sinner is an album that 99% of today's rappers would kill to have in their own discography.  But J. Cole isn't 99% of today's rappers.  Some critics will surely nitpick and find issues that, had this not been a J. Cole album, they would have normally looked past without a second thought.  Fittingly, this unreachable standard that has been set for J. Cole is, in a sense, a set of horns and a halo in its own right.  Meeting these expectations would surely secure legendary status for Cole, but until then, are we unjustly downgrading a superior album here?  Born Sinner has everything you could ask for in a hip hop album: strong messages, excellent lyricism, great production, varying formulas, authenticity, vulnerability and a focused concept.  Let's take a moment to appreciate that for what it is: no matter who the creator, this is quality hip hop.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is a fun movie with cute music.  My girls both love watching it over and over, and this is one parents can enjoy as well.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Great plot, accurate real the events time line. This novel puts you in contact with the feelings of the people that were part of the war, civilians, soldiers, idealists and the drama of loosing everything and keeping hope for a better world...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played!!!!! Would recommend this game for all puzzle lovers. Cant wait for next Room.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|REALLY GOOD!!!!!! Can't wait for more for this application! Left you on a cliffhanger though.... but overall very good and worth $2.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I am a recent fan of Firefly and although very bummed it only had one season i am glad there was a movie that kind of wrapped up the storyline and provided some closure (some). i heard about this from the Big Bang Theory, thanks to the writers for that tidbit and the hilarious script of that show. anyway, it is movie-like in the sense that it is not exactly the same as the TV version of filming. it's hard to explain but you will get it when you see it, it's good enough and a must see for real Firefly fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than temple run for sure.if someone reads this please give me a cheat.Good luck on subway surfers Paris.:)
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Love books like these. You know them, where you barely remember who you are as you turn from page to page. I am always searching out those prized tales that for just an instant, allow you to completely submerse yourself in their world. You will not regret this read.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's a fun game to play - but there's absolutely no information on how to &#34;get a star&#34;  or potions or scrolls - and is the map just aesthetics or is there something you do with it?  It doesn't appear that there is a goal other than going up levels
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am so glad I took the time to read this book. The characters were so video vivid. By far the best I have read. Now onto the next!
B00B1DC2FQ|4.0|When it comes to realistic dinosaur figurines suitable for children's toys, the big names are Schleich and Papo, with notable mention to CollectA.  As I have a four-year-old who has been fascinated with all things in the paleontological zoology catalogue, I fancy myself a well-informed buyer of the miniature offerings.  Schleich definitely has a nice piece in its 2012 Carnotaurus.<br /><br />The Carnotaurus is nicely sized for a child's plaything or a collector's display, at 8 ¼ inches long and just a bit over 4 inches high at the \\"horns.\\"  It is made of a soft, pliable, maroon plastic, which will prevent it from getting its extremities snapped off during rough play, something that owners (and buyers) of hard plastic creatures have learned to their dismay is a sad reality of the toy box.  Carnotaurus is sculpted in a more neutral position compared to Papo's model, as well as having a hinged jaw for open-mouthed roars.  The detail of the sculpt is impressive, consistent enough with current research on the animal, although the bluntness of the nose and enlarged horns reminds me more of the Carnotaurus from Walt Disney Pictures' 2000 release, _Dinosaur_, than of an academic model (it was maroon in the film, too.  Hmmm...).  The seams from the molding process have been nicely trimmed and burnished away, but the head-to-body joint is obvious.  Due to the high price for this piece, shy of $20 as I compose this review in July 2013, there are some minor faults for Schleich's Carnotaurus that need be mentioned.  The quality of the painting is good for a child's toy but not for a $20 display piece; the dry brushing of raised details, such as the back scales, the side scales, the side discs, and the horns, was done quickly, allowing for the maroon base material to show through and for noticeable overpainting and missed brushstrokes to stand out.  Since the head was painted and assembled separate from the body, my example has completely mismatched paint, with the head a dark maroon matched up to a tan underbelly and throat on the right side, making the head seam/joint readily apparent.  The eyes are painted blue, which is definitely a heavy application of artistic license versus realistic probability.<br /><br />Schleich's Carnotaurus was definitely a winner with my son, who holds none of his father's inane gripes over what is obviously a fine toy, but, when compared to Papo's dinosauria, Schleich has consistently come in second place, playing catch up at that, and its Carnotaurus is no exception; it's worthy of the toy box, but it's not a Papo.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|A strange / weird movie , i am a fan of Kristen Dunst's work  other Actors did a Good job also !

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Surprisingly entertaining.  Vivid characters, landscapes, and images with a few good running tips thrown in.  Makes 50-mile runs seem pedestrian.<br /><br />Now go outrun your dog ...
B0012QVJXS|2.0|I had forgotten how boring the first part of this movie really is. It seemed to drag on forever. After having the first part put me to sleep, I struggled to stay awake for the rest.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Great show can't wait to see third season. Amazon prime makes it easy to watch with no commercials. Watch it now
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can simply not get enough of Gideon and Eva!! I look forward to what comes next for these two!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like that it is large and fits the whole screen. Nothing fancy just what you need for everyday stuff.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This stuff is awesome but when my package came a little bit had already came out of the nozzle.<br /><br />Still, it did the job.
B008JEJNA2|5.0|It fits the best and is the most comfortable.  I have almost almost all of the colors now.  It is a good thing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game has enough different puzzles to hold your interest and to challenge you. Each floor has a different challenge. It is not too easy or too hard therefore pretty entertaining.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|After admiring Baraka, I was looking forward to this movie. It is good, but I won't say extra ordinary and will give 5 stars rating.
6304432461|5.0|For a VHS tape this is great.  Looks very clear because it is Digitally Mastered.  A much better picture on playback.<br />Just love it.
1885167776|5.0|Gary Keller nailed explaining the most pragmatic approach to success.  This book is also very well written, and easy to read.  Caution: Once you've read it you'll feel responsible for what you just read, and that's a good thing.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|Deep inside the seemingly perfect family, sinister secrets affect the individual members.  The teenage son begins to defy the dictatorial father, the mother and daughter suffer horrible abuse, and the father remains the village hero.  Only an aunt sees and understands, rescuing the children.  Set in strife-ridden Nigeria, this is a beautiful story of compassion and resilience.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you like Tina Fey and are looking for a fun beach book this is the ticket.  A quick, easy read, and very amusing.  It is somewhat auto-biographical but not  comprehensive.
B001N4OX82|3.0|An impressive visual spectacle I must say on the plus side.  If you want a &#34;high gloss&#34; version of the Iliad, ok.  The dialogue is too heavily laced with modern phraseology which is distracting.  The decade long siege (or thereabouts) was compressed into a few days on the beach until: Achilles gets pissed off & Odysseus gets a brainstorm around the campfire.  I'm sorry, but Brad Pitt is not a believable Achilles--his acting needed much stronger direction.  The whole handling of Hector's brother, Paris, is not at all believable from his infatuation with Helen to his cringing retreat from personal combat and everyone's reaction to these events was far too accepting and matter of fact.  Some good acting here and there but the emphasis here is on spectacle, not character development.
1400032717|5.0|I needed this book for my English class. It's in good condition. All I needed out of it was to read the text, and I can do just that. Not too bad for a penny!
0142418471|1.0|My daughter loves John Green and has read several of his books. She was very disappointed with this one as the subject matter of the book wasn't expected from the the back cover copy. She considered it  &#34;raunchy&#34; and didn't read past the first couple chapters.
0345529057|4.0|This is a good book set, but I think I am missing some more of the series? It wouldve been cool to know that and add it all together.
0812548094|5.0|hethis writer i love to read his books i do the same series over and over again.i love how he rights .
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|FIRST I MUST SAY THIS BOOK HAS EVERYTHING I DO NOT NORMALLY READ. THAT BEING SAID OMG! I REALLY LIKED IT . . .WHO KNEW? IT'S NOT A LONG READ BUT IT PACKS A MIGHTY BIG PUNCH WITH ALL THE STUFF GOING ON, GUESS GOOD THINGS DO COME IN SMALL PACKAGES (SOME TIMES) THIS IS THE SECOND BOOK I'VE READ BY THIS AUTHOR I WAS TOTALLY CAPTIVATED BY HIS FIRST ONE &#34;MATT COOPER&#34;. THIS BOOK IS A SERIES BK1, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. I GOT A FREE COPY ON SMASHWORDS READ FIRST 10% WENT ON AMAZON AND BOUGHT A COPY FOR MY KINDLEFIRE BOOKSHELF. THE STORYLINE SCARED THE HELL OUTA ME CAUSE ITS SOMETHING THAT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND SCARES ME, CAUSE IT COULD HAPPEN AND WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE IF UNLEASHED. THEN THE BOOK IS FUNNY TO BOOT,(GO FIQURE)WITH SO MUCH UNEXPECTED THINGS THAT KEEP HAPPENING THROUGH-OUT THE WHOLE BOOK. I WANTED TO STOP READING AND I JUST COULDN'T THEN HOW ALL THIS CRAZY SH*T ADDS UP AND MAKES PERFECT SENSE. I BELEVE THIS AUTHOR HAS GOT TO BE FROM ANOTHER GALAXY AND HE DOESN'T MIND TAKING YOU ON A TRIP TO HIS REALM. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS START READING ONE OF HIS OFF THE CHAIN BOOKS! PLEASE DON'T TAKE TO LONG WITH THE NEXT BOOK. ;D
1423124111|5.0|This book is exactly what the title states. It provides a visual history of the iconic posters we are so accustomed to seeing at our favorite Disney parks. This book is large, hard-covered and exactly what I was looking for. Great addition to our Disney coffee table collection. It is the perfect companion to our &#34;Art of Disneyland&#34; book. At less that $29, this is a steal. If you are a Disney Parks fan, you'll enjoy this book.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book is so complicated I got so frustrated my regular kindle is better than this ahhhh why can't it me more simple.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Only negative thing is the constant pop up ads, but that is to be expected with free versions.<br /><br />My kids love this game, and I know that I can let them play without constant monitoring.  I will be adding more later.  Thanks!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Good story, very deep, great characters.  However, I'm done waiting for the next book.  It's been years and while the author mucks around determining who will pay him for his next tv installment, loyal readers are moving on to other authors. I was breathless after book 5 but I've had years to catch my breath and now I just don't care anymore.  It's unlikely I'll be back.  I've forgotten half of what I've read and I'd have to start over again with book 1.  Waiting for the winds of winter has left me cold.  I'm done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't watch it at the theater because I think ticket prices are exorbitant. I recently got an Amazon Prime membership so I watched it on my WI-FI.  I live in the boonies so reception can be spotty.  What I saw of the movie was good so I bought the book.  The book was great and priced very reasonably.  In fact, I bought the trilogy and can hardly wait to start the next one.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Would not load because file is too large for first edition Kindle Fire.  Product description needs to tell customers of size problem.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I can't believe I waited to see this movie. I honestly thought it would stink and wouldn't be worth my time. I was wrong. Fast action, comic book to life. A little on the whiny side at times with the brooding characters, but those were small attempts at making this a dramatic movie, they quickly got back to the flair and action. Hulk was the best.
B004N622EY|4.0|An excellent and well developed world, that is written in such a masterful way that it's glaring differences to our own world make sense and is very believable in the way the characters approach and treat it. The characters are compelling with believable flaws and defects. A masterful story that leaves you hanging with twists and turns. A great read and I can't wait to sink my teeth into the next book in the series.
B004EWFV9K|4.0|The novel is a study of Wallander in his final years as a policeman. It’s a very natural evolution of the character we have all grown to know and love and a beautiful dissertation on aging. Aging is hard but not without its triumphs!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I've read the series, starting with Redbreast, and enjoyed all of them. The nagging frustration was wondering about what happened in Australia, the \\"big case\\" often mentioned in the other books. It was great to have that question resolved. Also interesting to compare the first of the series to the later books. Harry isn't quite as damaged a character here -- I wonder, do we need a prequel to explain origins of his drinking and relationship problems? Another noticeable difference: there were fewer characters in this book. In the last few that I've read I found myself keeping a list of characters as they showed up, along with a short description of their role, so I could keep track as they showed up later in the story. This story's number of characters was small enough for my 70-year-old brain to keep track of without writing them down.<br /><br />Consistent with the later books, the plot is complex, the characters are believable, and the false leads to the identity of the killer are abundant. I did miss Rakel & Oleg, but I guess they came later in the series.<br /><br />Nesbø's website says the 2nd book in the series, Cockroaches, has been released in Czech. Let's get his English translator, Dan Bartlett, working on that one as soon as he finishes the 10th in the series, Police (released in Norway in June 2013).
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|I've worked on Broadway and Lincoln Center as a stagehand for 36 years. Seen the talented and the hacks but SMASH is simply wonderful and marvelously talented. Broadway brought to you in a novel way. Totaly refreshing.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|All 7 seasons of the Shield with Chiklis are at the top of my list!!  I especially enjoy the camera direction, which provides intriguing views of all the scenes and characters in every episode!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|so much fun challenging but very fun to play it isevenfree and u cant beat free game needsmore levels I wand to play more
B008602KQI|5.0|I love everything about it............futuristic, romance, suspense, thrilling................Jennifer Lawrence is great..............can't watch it enough..................can't wait  for Hunger Games II to come out.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great second book in the series... couldn't wait to read the Beautiful Chaos!  Please see my review of Beautiful Redemption for my thoughts on this entire series.  Highly recommend!!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|one of the best batman movies of all time. i suggest you watch it. you will enjoy it very much.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Nice book set but type was so small I ended up giving it to my son in law and ordering for my kindle instead.  I'm really enjoying the books on my kindle.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I loved seeing this movie again after all these years.  The deleted scenes and documentary with extras made it all the more enticing.  I would recommend this to everyone who loves the original Superman the Movie.  A must have for all fans!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, the puzzles were just right not too easy as to be boring and not so hard as to be frustrating.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|What a difference!  There were times throughout the book where I didn't have my earphones and read the text 'normally', and it's only then that you realize what a comedic voice and delivery Tina Fey has.  I t elevates the book out of the just plain light-reading category into a laugh-out-loud experience.  A classic example -- one of the few -- where the spoken word adds enjoyment and depth over and above just plain reading.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The special effects are pretty good and the little china doll and the monkey put in pretty great performances, however the rest of the cast seemed (meaahh) Michelle Williams seemed to me like she was trying or holding back a laugh in so many scenes that it made her performace come across as shallow.. As for the Rest.. Forced, forced, forced..  I think the director truly missed the mark on this one. the tempo of the movie drags, and yes i seriously fell asleep twice.. of course i skipped back so as not to miss any of the movie.. but this is one of the first films thats had that effect on me.. weird.
B0040GURF8|5.0|I'll be honest, I didn't know if I had heard a John Mayer song before this, he was not on my musical radar.  I heard his son &#34;Gravity&#34; being used for a dance routine.  I tried lots of songs titled &#34;Gravity&#34; before I found the right one.  It was his &#34;Live in Los  Angeles&#34; version.  Good grief, there are still musicians who can really wail and whose music sounds better in the live versus studio cuts.  I love this album.  He can really handle the blues and makes each song, his own.<br /><br />I'll give him the ultimate compliment.  If he is playing live within 200 miles, color me there.  His audience could use a little color.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|If you dont take this to seriously its a absolutely great movie for mindless action and gore/horror and a little comedy sprinkled in. No its not going to win any awards, its not suppose to.. think \\"Battleship\\" only this is a period/fairy tale movie. It was cool to kill a few house just vegging out and not thinking , just watching, having a few laughs and even a few cringes at some gore.. pretty cool.
B000FC1KBG|4.0|I read this after reading Babywise and personally prefer this approach to scheduling and sleep training, although there are similarities. The EASY method is working well for my 8 week old daughter and me. I started EASY at 3 weeks and now I feel that I can read her needs consistently and she is napping and sleeping well. She only wakes once in the night and sleeps for a 5 or 6 hour stretch. All moms and babies are different, but this book works for us,
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book that kept you constantly thinking ans on the edge of your seat!<br />Looking forward to more books by this author
B00CHILW64|3.0|Other than that, it was a good movie bringing to life some of the tragedy involved in that devastating tsunami.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I  have really enjoyed this app.Never reaLized how much I would use it. THANKS FOR MAKING LIFE A LITTLE EASIER.
0375812024|5.0|I bought this book for a 3.5 year old. He loves air planes and loves Richard Scarry's characters. Happiness all around!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though this costs a lot of money it is just the best<br />Also as it has 4 and a half how about 5 complete stars
1608871088|5.0|This book is filled to the brim with a lot of beautiful work. The different designs are simply breath taking, and the different details and descriptions are awe inspiring. While I would have liked that it if there had been a bit more on the storyboard process, for such things such as the previous ideas for the movie, the other concepts make up for it. I couldn't put it down once I began reading through it, and I had to pause again and again because I couldn't stop taking in all the beautiful details of the character designs and the locations.<br /><br />It's definitely worth every single penny.
B005DI994W|5.0|Saw this movie on TCM and became a huge fan.  An epic classic that deals with such Victorian themes as honor and devotion to your friends and loved ones.  It may be a little &#34;dated&#34; in it's subject matter and a tad slow in the first half hour to those of us more used to more current standards of story telling, but it has action, suspense and fantastic scenery and cinematography.<br /><br />This movie just shines in the Blue-Ray format. Those early color movies (Wizard of Oz, The Adventures of Robin Hood are others) seem to just jump right out at you and the fact that they filmed on location is not lost in the storyline. Well worth the purchase.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I love Whitney's CD, the only thing was one of the songs skipped a little from previous scratches on it..
014241493X|4.0|john green has amazing stories and this is just one of them , the shipping was quick and i was able to read it in no time
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Simple game. Kids love to play it in a pinch. Starts off easy and gets harder as you go. Many different challenges keep it interesting to play.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I got this app a little over a month ago, my device says I have version 2.1. Today there was an update, but after downloading, the update refused to install, and now when I go to the product page, under \\"compatibility with your devices\\", there's a red circle with a white X in it beside my Kindle Fire, presumably indicating that the now-available version 2.4.1 is not compatible with the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The old un-updated version 2.1 still works, plus it was a free app in the first place, so it's not really a big issue for me. If I really want a different feature set, I can find another app developer, but for now I'll probably just keep using the old one.<br /><br />I just thought it was weird to have an uninstallable update pushed out.
0770437400|5.0|It is a very long book, more than 400 pages long, the words are quite small. It is an oral story, this means you are reading what people are saying to each other, like a script basically.<br />If you have no problem with that, then you will love this book
B005544TRQ|4.0|I had heard good things about this show.  Last week I saw it available through Amazon Instant Video so I decided to give it a try.  I have watched 9 episodes from seasson 1.<br /><br />The show is very entertainng.  The characters are well developed and likeable.  The plot while predictable keeps your interest.<br /><br />In summary this is a good but not great legal drama.  I enjoy and will continue to watch but it's no Good Wife.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|First person, no bs account of just another life in the Irish Republic in the 20th century. 20th century? Oh my God!
B004BUY0T2|4.0|Although filled in the early 1930's this film is very relevant to current affairs.  It addresses the validity of the insanity defense and our fears for our children.  Things really haven't changed at all in the last 80 years.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|25+ years later, still a great story well old.  And the sound track is great, too.  I think most people who are &#34;Boomers&#34; can and will relate.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very interesting book. Enjoyed it;<br />gave me lots to think about;<br />seeing different sides of many of the characters.<br />BUT, it was somewhat confusing, as he did not just go back in time<br />but kept skipping around in time and talking about the same characters<br />in different stages of their lives, without giving us a ground work of who<br />was who.<br />Perhaps if I had started keeping a list of the characters and the dates, and their family<br />members.... or I had read it all in one sitting I could have rated it 5 stars
B004KZOWEG|5.0|This book is definitely a must read if you've ever read Heart of Darkness (by Joseph Conrad), it gives you a lot of perspective on the history surrounding the events in the novel as well as the Congo region in general.<br /><br />The book on it's own is excellent even if you've never read Heart of Darkness and never care to. Although it's a non-fiction novel it reads like a fiction story the way it depicts King Leopold's life and his story with the Congo.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I have watched this movie every day since receiving the DVD.  I recommend this movie to everyone who loves a great story and good acting.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Made me cry. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It's super duper magical. You should watch it folks. I liked it.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Although corny, I can never turn down a movie that has our favorite action stars in it. If you enjoy seeing these guys like me and my boys, I would definately recommend it to you.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Very entertaining and cute, well made, good for all ages, can't wait to see the second movie, i will soon
B009KS4XRO|5.0|First of all, you do not have to \\"buy\\" anything.  The game is free, free for Kindle and Free on Facebook.  I play on both.  You get daily credits and daily free spins.  You have the option of buying extra credits, but it is not a have to thing. The cities that you have to complete, to get more daily credits when completed. You earn coins to buy some of these items.  Yes, the more teammates you have that play the more daily credits you will get, and the more you play, the more coins you will rack up.  It is very addictive, as you complete more and more cities and get more and more credits and coins to purchase items.  You DO NOT pay with real money, unless you OPT to buy extra, or wait until your daily earnings come up. There are always people wanting more teammates so you can get many to play and boost your daily earnings.  It is a great game, fun, and I have made several new friends in the 3 years I have been playing.
B000U6BT40|5.0|The SiFi channel has presented a truly original series. A good balance of mystery, science, drama, and humor, which moves along, with each episode building on the previous show. Worth your time to watch.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is everything we needed, even being a gaming mouse it's being used for 3D cad design. All the extra buttons makes the work easier when printing, saving or calling a new function in the software. The control of DPI is great, there is 4 settings that we can control however we want.<br />Even that I am giving it 5 stars (because it deserves), I did had a problem with it, the driver would not install in my desktop, tried all sort of things still didn't work. It did install in my laptop, so every time we want to change something in its configuration we need to do it trough the laptop.<br />The fact we can change the lights on the logo is pretty neat but not necessary, we did though match it with the lights on the tower.<br />The weights on it are great, we are using all of them and it seems perfect now, maybe a little to light without it.<br />The size of the mouse is great too, not too big not too small. There is nothing I would complain about the mouse, I just wish the drive would work in my desktop though.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have been hooked on this game since I started it last year.  it has a lot of different levels and I never get bored.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that it's easy and addicting wish I didn't have to wait for more levels that's a reason why I tend to delete apps like that but the game itself is great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is way better than subway surfers by far love the concept good graphics everything u would ever want in a game
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Being entertained from the beginning to the end of the movie. The characters are well played... From Iron man, captain America, Thor, hulk and others. Great visual effects. Go see and be entertained!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the costumes, the architecture, the fabulous scenery and, of course, the story line. I like the fact that we learn as much about the life of the servants, as well as the aristocracy. Not having to watch or deal with commercials is one of the best things about public television. I sincerely hope that this wonderful show continues for many years.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|Terrific cast, funny story.  Well worth watching.  Another great English comedy.  Maggie Smith is tops as usual as is the entire cast.
0307887448|5.0|I found this, hands down, the best novel I've read in ten years.<br /><br />Cline's depiction of the future, where most of society is submerged in a huge, detailed virtual reality, was so compelling, I was actively bummed out by the fact that I was not born a few decades later. Yet his references to every geeky thing about the eighties, and all of its pop culture, made me proud I was born in that century (even though that officially does not make me an 80's kid :) )<br /><br />Once I opened this book, I did not stop reading until the very last page, and I did not go to sleep after that, before posting this review. This book is serious, funny, exciting, thrilling and moving, all at once.<br /><br />Cline, you are the man.
1452110581|5.0|What a great collection of poems by cats.  Someone really got into the feline mind and figured out what they are really thinking about us!  The title poem says it all!
B005DJREJS|3.0|Over-the top in sexual situations, overdrawn characters and thin, improbable plots.<br />Some of the writing is good, and the thoughts of the main character are a lot like a teen thinks, but I think it's inappropriate for the target age. It seems like the series can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a serious and believable show, or just teasing entertainment.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Saw this series on TV many years ago and it kept all our attention throughout.  Probably one of the best documentaries on WW2.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is well thought out and bright. You can see what you're doing with it. My last calculator was so dark it was hard to see sometimes.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful series on PBS.  What a cast!!  What settings!!  What costumes!!  What a great story about a family and all the happenings in their lives.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is the way a fraction calculator should be designed. I love this app. You should at least try it.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|I have attempted to connect it to several 12v outlets without success on the 2.1A & 1.5A ports. Purchased for the price got what I paid for.  Lesson learned...
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Liked this better the second time ice seen it.  Watched it with my granddaughter.  I can honestly say it was as good as the book!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Marathoned my way through Seasons 1 and 2; couldn't wait to get to Season 3, but it's a predictable<br />let down.  Bates and Thomas must be napping or perhaps the 'reality' of the world outside Downton is getting to me.<br />I can only hope the new Footman, Jimmy, stirs things up!  Still, Downton is a lovely escape, and I especially admire the compassion of each member of the family.  The actors are extraordinary, lead by the incomparable and always entertaining Dame Maggie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The singers are great in the film especially since it is acapella. A great recent movie that is funny and has a great story
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Was expecting something aimed only at the 20-something movie crowd and was shocked and delighted to fing it utterly entertaining.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|An exciting story full of twist and turns - with an ending that makes you wish for more, If only the story would continue.
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|I thought this movie was really good.  I'm 35 - and can relate to many things in this move.  A good rent!
0684847817|5.0|Was able to receive the product in a very timely fashion. In excellent condition was very pleased! I've been looking to replace this book as it was a gift that got stolen.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Had gotten bored with Sudoku.  This game revived my love of the game.  Can't say enough good things about it!  So glad I decided to try it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Completely satisfied with this app. Speed of navigation is great. Works so much better than other apps I have had to struggle with. I give it an A.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|I love sci-fi programs and I think this is one of the best ones ever.It is the best thing since sliced bread.

B000NY12CI|5.0|I learned a lot about Islam, different practices of it and the beliefs and more about Somalia and other countries where the author lived during her life.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Best summer game evah I wish the game would go on forever until the earth end just keep it going
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I thought it was okay, nothing new about this movie reminded me of the hobbits.<br />I love the action and colorful back ground and I loved all the technical effects.
B008JFUUQ2|3.0|My digital download did not work and it is a one time try so now I am just out of luck.  There is no number to call or anything to help you with how to get the download when it doesn't go in to itunes.  If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars but I did buy it so I could have the digital download so feel bummed about that.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I bought this because I think this is just a very cute movie. (with an interesting way to relieve children's fear of closet monsters)
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Don't waste time or storage space with this app, use the eBay full version website. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible is all I can say.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my children every night. I will be giving a copy of it to each of my children when they have their own.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|It was a great movie for the whole family, and it definitely one we will be purchasing in the future.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|If you want non-stop shoot 'em action from many of the actors known for this type of action, you'll enjoy this one
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|The first time our 5 year old played this he loved it.  He had actually played it before on a friend's ipad, however, we quickly ran into problems that the app just would not work for us.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Not up to her usual standards.  Was disappointed and thought the storyline was preposterous.  Buy one of her other books.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Very slow moving-dragged out. Dry dialogue. And what's with Hollywood's obsession with blasphemy? This movie was laden with it. Lincoln was a God fearing man-not a blasphemer. Spielberg is losing his edge.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|This game was fun, but has a major flaw. It kept inverting for no reason while playing. It could have been a fun game, but after flipping 20 times in 3 levels, I was done. App deleted...
B005SCSL56|5.0|What a fantastic read! Definitely worth reading again and would absolutely recommend to a friend. Bring on the sequel, bitches!
159463176X|4.0|Beautiful account of present-day Afghanistan - all three of Hosseini's books are written well and give a clear description of the current events in the country
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As usual, Temperance Brennan is at the top of her game.  The subject matter is quite depressing, but a reality of our present world. Temperance always makes us care about those who cannot defend themselves. She also lets us vicariously find & help punish those who commit crimes against all who are defenceless victims.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can always count on the Weather Channel for accurate, up-to-date forecasts & storm warnings. Their information is valuable in all kinds of situations.
B006UV8DJS|3.0|Not what I expected but it is ok. I don't know if it is that I do not understand how to use it or that the program do not have too much to offer.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I will be downloading the next book immediately.<br />I can't wait to find out what has been going on with Dany and Tyrion.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I like the modern adaption of this classic story, better actually than the other series based on the Sherlock Holms character set in NYC.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought the app was challenging enough to keep my interest and not get bored.  I really had to search on some of the levels.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I really liked The Hobbit.  It is more whimsical than Lord of the Rings but then again so was the book.  I was skeptical about how they would turn the book into three movies but the first one kept me entertained from beginning to end.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If stein isn't a racer he sure did his homework. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|An interesting look at a possible experience. That makes you think what you would do in that situation. I loved the director in the movie
B007REV4T8|4.0|The Daniel Craig Bonds get better and better. I liked a lot of the elements of Skyfall. The story was so-so, but the actors, the elements were all good. Also, I liked the song, which was a big improvement over the Jack Black piece for Quantum of Solace.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Godfather 1 and 2 should be required viewing, period. The story, the acting all top-notch. How many times have you sat with a recent movie a looked at your watch? Each Godfather runs over 2 hours and I'll bet you never look at you're watch because the pace and the story are that good.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|It's good for what it is. It brought back the memories of frustration with Galaga. For free I cannot complain.
B00AKCJB44|4.0|I find John Legend's voice to have a striking resemblance to every drunk uncle at every family reunion, but somehow it worked in &#34;Who Did That to You&#34;. &#34;Freedom&#34; was just excellent!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hope to see more levels soon. Levels get increasingly more difficult as they go.  Fun game. Check it out.<br /><br />Thank you
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. I teach my kids on how and what a city needs to function. How variouse items are needed to create a single product. That is made possible by logistics.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This movie will make you dream of living on a winery. Great script, a must watch! Russell Crowe did a great job!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Jenna is easy to root for and makes for a very relatable heroine.  I haven't watched much of MTV's scripted shows, but I loved this one.  I finished Season 1 in one weekend.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|If you like Bocelli at all, you'll love this CD--the ENTIRE CD not just a few songs. His voice is simply beautiful.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|Can be a little tricky at first getting used to holding the button and trying to locate target.  But after some practice find it to be very accurate.  Now I just need to learn to trust it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Two recommendations: The capacity to organize content into files/shelves in order to streamline access would be a great help. I also would remove purchase recommendations from the opening page of the personal library.
0060987464|5.0|Awesome book Im a big fan of Marilyn Manson I don't usually read books but this I did. I love it Im glad I bought it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|ONE DOCTOR'S ACCOUNT OF A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE.  HE IS TRANSPORTED INTO AN ULTRA RICH AUDIOVISUAL<br />DIMENSION IN A COMA.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome it is better than temple run two you defently should download it i would recommend it for your child
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This collection has so many great items in it.  My girls and I sat down and watched the movie as soon as it came. They now love it as much as I do.
B001JRB16U|5.0|This was my daughter's favorite movie growing up. We only had it on VHS so it was time to get the DVD and rewatch this great movie.
0345803485|5.0|It is very interesting. I finished the book with excitement and now I am reading the 2nd one so hope I will like it too.
1781162646|5.0|His earlier works were more cliff-hanging.  If this is anyone's first Stephen King, I would hope they would backtrack and read all the previous SK books.  The Stand was believable as well as terrifying.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series of books, you can't put the book down once you start, I can't wait unit the next book comes out!
B00APYKXFS|5.0|really great. so much better than a lot of other games of this sort. it is really hyper and you have lots of different soundtracks to pick from. it is really fun
B003H4I4JU|3.0|This is not Dune, Foundation or even I, Robot. But in a world where fantasy and horror have  overtaken sci-fi in print an  on TV, a welcome respite.
0399255370|5.0|You know a picture book must be good if you catch your teenagers reading it and laughing, and then rereading their favorite parts!  By that measure alone, this one is a winner.  The premise is lighthearted and humorous.  One day Duncan reaches for his crayon box to color and instead finds a stack of letters awaiting him.  Each crayon has written to him with engaging voice and personality.  There are complaints, requests, and compliments.  Each crayon presents its case with a unique voice and with much fun for the reader.  How will Duncan keep his crayons happy and resume his \\"coloring career?\\"  At the end Duncan manages to find a creative solution that satisfies him, his crayons and his teacher!<br /><br />Out of the many picture books I've previewed this summer with an eye to acquiring for the classroom, this is one of the few that has made it to the \\"must buy\\" stack. It is a delight from start to finish and I can't wait to share it with my second graders this fall.  I can foresee using this as a mentor text to teach about point of view, voice, persuasive letter writing and more.  More importantly, I know kids will immediately fall into the spirit of the story.  I can already hear them giggling at the humor and predicting what each color will write.  I suspect they'll look at their crayons through a different lens and perhaps even be inspired to add a new color to their coloring repertoire!<br /><br />Bottom line, this book is a delightful read aloud for all and a wonderful addition to any home or classroom library.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Beyond the story line ... very insightful of how Law Firms really view their clients and how politics really works.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Bourdain is the bad boy of culinary and this is just a great, fun read.  A little disturbing what happens in the back of the kitchen sometimes, this tale is nevertheless an interesting and insightful view into the world of chefs and restaurants.  I would recommend this for any aspiring chef and all foodies.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great insights on how Law Firms really view their clients versus their own self-serving interests. Political tactics via Ian Gold also on spot.<br /><br />The crossroads of Alicia are interesting to study from a human behavior perspective.  Much is written to add sizzle to the show.<br /><br />One takeaway is both parents, regardless of the plot, are trying to put the interest of their children first over everything else.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|What...the...****? I can't believe this album even exists. It's an awesome slab of electronic punk from the dudes who practically invented the genre. Seriously...anyone criticizing this album never understood or cared for the band. Dive in and absorb it.
B003XRELEI|3.0|maybe it was his age, but his ego got in the way with this one. the author as god, creator, manipulator, recorder, and sadistic perpetrator...yes, perpetrator because of what he does with his characters... just gave this book a tone that really was not that funny nor thought provoking. i did not enjoy this as much as i did Water Method Man; Bluebeard; God Bless You Mr, Rosewater; Monkey House; Player Piano; Cat's Cradle; Slaughterhouse Five.... I may have read Timequake and Glapagos, but i do not remember them.<br /><br />Essentially, enjoy the others, and skip this one unless you feel you would like to see how for every winner, there will be a loser.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story, the production, the performances - all these are rich with depth and nuance.  The interaction of the characters, the fight to maintain a way of life that can no longer be provided, the love stories, the intrigue, the cultures and mores of the classes are all beautifully drawn and are wonderfully compelling.  I really care about these people.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My Kindle Fire was not charging and I ordered this cable and it works great!  I lost my original cable and bought a different one which was working but then quit!
B0090SVDO0|4.0|This is just a great crisp recording of the doors at the pinnacle of their career.  If you like the doors you should really enjoy this show.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|Wouldn't it be wonderful if all lawyers actually cared for their clients like Matt Damon's character does in the movie as opposed to the sleazy &#34;rich&#34; lawyer played by Jon Voight. Perhaps with those ethics, we would not have the grist for Grisham' wonderful novel. Great film!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great charger.  Unfortunately the headset doesn't live up to its case.  But, the charger is a nice addition and easy to use.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Knowing about the NOLA surroundings added to the film's reality and our enjoyment. Love the big Easy! Will see it in October.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a brilliant book, told by a 16 year old with terminal cancer. The author obviously knows this world well, and he never sentimentalizes it or allows it to overwhelm his story. &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; stayed with this reader long after finishing the book. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is a really fun game and my kid loves to play and watch me play.  I would say yes to this again.
B00A27X972|5.0|I could not put this book down! It will make you smile, keep you guessing, make you sigh with emotion. One of the best books I've read in a long, long time. Matt Haig has such a gift of seeing us as beautiful among our flaws.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This is an amazingly written book, that forces you to see that every statement you utter to some one. Everything you do or don't do, can affect someone for the worse. This book shows that anything can shatter a person, and just one person can save them from themselves.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book Ioved the comedy Greg was very unlucky about his Valentine's day dance I loved it a lot cool
B005L38QHA|4.0|Overall I enjoy the mouse, I recently started playing WoW again and decided to get something with macros keys, the only one that I have trouble with is the one for the ring finger, because I play with my pinky there so it's a bit harder to reach ( at least I think it's for the ring finger). The mouse isn't bulky like it sort of looks, fits to my hand well I wouldn't by any means say that I have large hands, probably more on the small side if anything. The only big complainant I have is the movement speed, turning the movement speed all the way up still isn't as fast as I like.<br />Oh! The light settings aren't as in depth as they say, but still really pretty :)
B0000AQZYM|4.0|Bought it for the grandchildren and the love the movie.  Glad we bought it.  Thanks for sending it to us
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so addicting! I cant wait for more new levels. I hope we don't have to wait too much longer.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins may very well be the best Batman movie ever made. Christopher Nolan does a brilliant job of depicting the origin of Batman. The 1989 Tim Burton film does a great job developing the Joker but is far weaker on developing Batman. That's where Nolan succeeds. From Bruce Wayne's early childhood to the murder of his parents to his journey to become Batman,Nolan weaved an awesome origin story. This movie doesn't have as much action as some other Batman movies but it still may well be the best 1 because the STORY is so great. The character development of Batman is great. And the plot itself is well thought well and well told. The conflict between the League of Shadows and it's determination to destroy Gotham and Batman's determination to stop is well plotted,well acted,and well told. Ducard turning about to be the real Ra's al Ghul was a great plot twist. And then you see a piece of setup for the Dark Knight when Gordon tells Batman about the Joker. And then there's the fact there's no campiness in this movie. It is wonderfully dark and serious. Everything about this movie is spot on. This movie succeeds because of it's awesome plot and character development. The Batman origin story was a great way to reboot Batman and is quite possibly the best Batman movie ever. 5 out of 5 stars.
B000059TEP|5.0|This DVD was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law.  I wasn't there when she viewed it but she said she loved the movie, so it's all good!
B003B02O7I|5.0|This is a well written book and I love it. I am the only male in my book club.  The women are smarter than me
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's slow to start out but after you get the hang of it your park will grow and you can buy new dinosaurs. It's a bit slower if you don't want to buy the dollars but I have been able to, it just takes a bit. Complete the tasks and earn money from familiar faces from the movie and add dinosaurs that were also in the movie. Great pass time and the more friends you have the easier it is.
B005F9TPWK|5.0|I choose the I love it rating because it brings back many memories and I saw a version of this Group &#34; Electric Light Orchestra &#34; in concert called &#34; Electric Light Orchestra Part 2 &#34; and they where great in concert and brought back memories of songs like this that are on this CD and it has great beats and is well done one of &#34; Electric Light Orchestra's &#34; best Cd ever. One to think about Getting or just getting this CD out right
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining.  Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent is not to be missed.  A beautiful sinner who will thoroughly surprise you. Wicked and wonderfully written, another best for Kleypas .  Bravo!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|This movie is a mixture of sad , but happy ! This my new favorite movie ! I loved that movie and that I would watch it if I was you !
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this app is very good.  I like the extra characters that u can play as.  but I wish that stats from svz1 would carry over.  I also wish that svz2 would let u get flu credits from other sources like deerhunter reloaded.  also there is the occasional freeze up glitches.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I am fairly new fan of 30STM but I have to say this is a beautiful album and I can't wait to see what else those creative geniuses have in store for us!!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|riviting dialog. great casting. characters well developed and believable.  the chemistry between the actors is impecable and ingrossing.  couldn't stop at just one show.  love the bits where you are given the rabbit hole connections that give insight to the deductive logic.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have been addicted to this game for months now, excited about the new update! Fun and easy, plus it's free! A must for any Jurassic Park fan.
B0081336FO|5.0|Captivating series. what to keep watching more.  the writers are superb.  the actors due the characters justice at every level. If there are more I hope amazon picks them up.  the most engaging entertainment that I have seen in a while.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This has been on my TBR list for awhile, I've been LOVING this genre lately. This did not disappoint AT ALL.  This Dystopian  read has quickly topped my list, right up there with HG :)
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I read each book every day!I have osteo arthritis, And congestive heart failure.So I have lots of time to read!BUT  I am angry with sylvia! She left us hanging!You can'read a better set of books.And I will be waiting for it to come  Hope this helps you!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is a great show. My husband and I watch it all the time. We are on season two right now.
0811869261|5.0|This is a wonderful showcase of this illustrator's work, and the lively scenes do not fail to disappoint. There are discoveries of the smallest details that continue to surprise even after you've looked at the book many times.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with Boutavant's work, and ran across this in Chinese while taking a long trip to Hong Kong. Even though I have a first grader's command of the language, I was struck by how much could be communicated even without reading the text bubbles. My 6 year old has been reading this book for hours and the vinyl stickers are a nice playful touch as well. When we returned to the states, we purchased the English version, and found that the text adds to but isn't necessary to enjoy this book!<br /><br />Highly recommend, for visual fun-loving adults and children 4+.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is great for reflexes and eye hand coordination.  I feel like i am exercising my brain. Not just playing games.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A must read for every aspiring e-book writer.  Read this book early. It takes you step by step through the whole process.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We don't have cable at the mountain house and this is so easy to use and wonderful quality... access to lots of great shows!  This being a favorite!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|not that good because you have to buy for it to go on playing. I have played it on line.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|The killing floor mentions his brothers untimely death and references Blind Blake. Now we find out the actual link and what his brother was doing.<br /><br />The book has a sad perspective with the reasoning behind his demise from the army. While he was doing what he had to do, the hierarchy of the army can't see beyond its own shortsightedness. A shame Leon Garber couldn't push his case.<br /><br />Jack not only saved the army's face but also saved Elizabeth Deveraux's ultimate reputation.<br /><br />Rather than just accepting the fate Jack wouldn't let go of ensuring that the facts didn't get in the way. Everyone's face was saved. .......  Except for Jacks.  While his post army experiences in the previous 14 post army books
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book grabs your interest from the first paragraph and holds it throughout the reading. I love a good story of intrigue, mystery and  suspense, not to mention relationships that teach us something about life, maybe just giving us a significant insight into the complexities of relationships, maybe even just a little of who we might be, how we may be perceived by the ones closest to us. This book covers it all, plus more. A keeper. I will read more Gillian Flynn.
B000L53D4O|1.0|Had this toy for almost a month, my daughter was 9 month when she started using it, and now she is 10 month. She is at ~5% tile weight for her age, so she is consider very very light. Yet, when she tries to hold the toy to stand up, it would fall over on her. If she lean a little bit backwards during walk, it will roll back and she would loss balance and this toy would fall on her (if her hands are still holding on to it). If she lean forward too much while walking, the toy would go forward and she will try to knee down and the toy would fall on her. The only way my wife and I feel safe for her to walk with it is crawl behind her and hold both wheel with our hand to control the speed, that way if she fall backwards, we would catch her before the toy falls on her, and it would never go too fast with us holding on and turning the wheel by hand slowly at her pase.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a good walker, most of the time we just lay it flat and let her play with the things on the front, but not for actual walking.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My grandchildren really enjoy it and watch it a lot. The character are so good it.<br />and the plot is great.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|Imagine Dragons' debut album \\"Night Visions\\" is loaded with hooky songs, two of which have already been hit singles and/or commercial jingles. \\"Radioactive\\" is the most inescapable of the batch, it's also the lead track on the CD. I hate to say this, but whenever I see that happening, a red flag goes up. \\"It's Time\\" is the song used for an Apple commercial, it's from an earlier EP and makes it to the debut on sheer momentum. Lead singer and primary emoticon Dan Reynolds heaps on the drama; you can tell these guys want to make it in the big time.<br /><br />But. There's always a but. Why the ridiculous amount of built in distortion? The drums on \\"Radioactive\\" sound like the band put rubber pads on a mud slab and aimed for the biggest splat they could catch in the studio. When you've got a song as obviously catchy as this, why not play the song with real production instead of this amateurishly lo-fi bleating? If you think you're making a statement, you're not. It shows a certain lack of depth. When the band does match the songs to production that doesn't flatten the sound down to a pancake, you can hear the genuine ambition, like on \\"Nothing Left To Say\\" and the gentle, nearly folkish \\"On Top Of The World\\" (which reminded me of The Lumineers, of all bands).<br /><br />Imagine Dragons could be the next big arena rock band. They've got the songs and the attitude that keeps \\"Night Visions\\" and it's gawdawful production from being a complete dumpster diver. I hope they can figure out how to use a studio by the time they get to the sophomore album.
0399160450|4.0|This is a massive book...835 pages! I rented the CD version while I was driving and did not realize it was on 8 CDs (18 hours worth.) I only made It through the first two CDs but wanted to finish it because I was hooked. The intricate plot reeled me in quickly so I had to buy the book. So far it's a great read. BTW, the hardback book was in almost mint condition.
B006YMLE7G|4.0|Redline was a very action packed and graphic anime movie. Anyone who is a fan a anime and racing will enjoy this flick.
B0073COMUW|2.0|Bought these to replace 8 compact fluorescent bulbs over my wife's sink in the bathroom to go with 4 LEDs already there on my side of the room.  It took 11 bulbs to find 8 that did not flicker.  Until this batch, I had only been buying UL tested bulbs, but thought I would try these based on the reviews and hoped to save some money. Obviously the amount of my savings is now in doubt.  The next questions is how long these will actually last?<br />I love LED bulbs and over the last 5 years since I bought this house, I have replaced over 80 incandescent bulbs with LEDs, but not all brands are equal in either quality or life expectancy. The light quality has gotten consistently better for most brands and the bulbs are getting cheaper, but quality is still something to be concerned about and once you find a good brand you should probably stick with it. For now I'll continue to pay more for bulbs that I believe will last because the proof of the savings is not having to change the bulbs every few years..<br /><br />PROs: Nice bright light when lit<br /><br />CONs: 3 out of 11 flickered when installed and changing sockets and re-installing them did not make a difference.
0385341008|5.0|Rally good book,<br />the info on rationing, child transport and the &#34;potatoe peel pie&#34;<br />YouTube gave me the recipe for what is served in Guernesy Restaurants, it was excellent.<br />Course the actual pie sounded gross.  But a treat when there is not much else
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Absolutely my favorite Gaiman book so far -- and I have read them all.  The story weaves itself through your brain until you are a child yourself, cowering from the scary-awful monsters. Then it all comes somehow right. Well, sort of. The characters seem as real as my own family. I'm just sorry the book ended. The anticipation of reading it each night has been replaced by a big empty space in my heart. Will recommend to any and everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was a random purchase. My Grandchildren and I decided to each buy a game. This was my choice as it sounded the most interesting. Boy, was it! We couldn't stop playing...it was so fascinating. We played until 12:30am the first day and picked it up the next morning and played until we finished. We high fived each other for solving each challenge, and we are eagerly awaiting the sequel. I loved the fact that it wasn't something that ended too quickly. What a great game!
0316187216|5.0|One of my favorite authors hits another one out of the park with this epic adventure that features some old friends from other great works.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|Great performance by Ms. Streep with outstanding support from the rest of the cast.  See this on a large screen in a darkened room with the volume up.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina makes her celebrity life something that we all can relate to in this book. A perfect and witty combination of humor and crisis. Made me enjoy Tina even more!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|JULIETTE is such a strong character...she makes you  root for the good guys.  Duplicitous government,  a devious villain, and social caste separation spell a recipe for Silo disaster.  Who  will survive?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush I think is a very cute game. One of the minions is trying to do minion of the year. So it's kind of like Subway Surfers but like a most way better version of it!!!!
B000W93CHC|4.0|Worthy of any great writer using history as a background for his story. I only hope my own books can achieve this level.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It gives you the responsibility to learn how to take care of pets. Such as horses, cats, and dogs. :)
B009PMEEY2|3.0|Absolutely not my favorite game. Sorry. There is no challenge here. Too bad. Good for killing time if nothing else though
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very nice read. I think it is good for all ages as well. No graphic details of violence, quite a lot of drinking and a bit of drug reference though.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|One of the best jack I have read.  Always a twist in the plot at the end. That's all folks
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought the book Is great  and i think  that it should be  publised EVERWHERE!!!!!!!  Keep  on making your  dreams come true! Greg speaks the truth about everything!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is a really great game to play just wish there was a way to add more friends from a random parks like they did for tiny monsters
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|David Duchovny at his best! Can't wait for season 6 to be available on demand. The system is very simple through the Roku channel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As I sat here and read this fantastic book I was appalled an  thrilled the whole time. There was such realistic and terrible atrocities is grateful that we don't live in.  World like this.
0439023521|5.0|This book is filled with exciting moments. It always had me on the &#34;edge of my seat.&#34; I have read all three books in the Hunger Games series and each one is just as good as the first book. Very good read!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've tried other escape games and would get frustrated and quit. But this has enough challenge to keep you thinking but not so hard that it's impossible. I am however disappointed that it ends at level 10. I do hope new levels come out soon.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Have borrowed it at the library and loved it sooo much I had to have one so that  we could watch it any time we want.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is the best APP I have ever played I encourage people to get it .even though it's a lot of money it's 100 percent worth it and if u get this game I'm sure u will love it too
0061950726|5.0|once again...I wonder what happened to the characters after the story ended. I was fascinated with the whole story, past and present. I am likely going to look for more to read about the orphan trains, and the poor kids who were on them, What happened to them? how did they grow up?  What an awful thing to put a child through!
0807014273|4.0|\\"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\\"<br /><br />I really didn't have high expectations when I opened this book since I've never been a fan of books about Auschwitz (they always leave me with a hopeless lack of faith in humanity), but somehow small beautiful lines and sentences about the way a human being can use pain to build his strength, got me through the first part of the book. It never got too deep into the facts about the camps but stayed within the 'hopeful' mindset.<br />The 2nd part also surprised me and became some sort of brief introduction to psychotherapy and I found myself scribbling down small tips and ideas that I'd like to remember the next time I'm going through a hard time.<br /><br />I loved reading this classic book and it's a beautiful story about how you can handle so much more than you ever thought you could. It's about trusting your story and about always saying yes to everything that happens, because it happens so that you can learn something. Everything happens to teach you something that you need to know in order to become who you're really meant to be. I will probably re-read this many times.<br /><br />- Charlotte Eriksson, author of [[ASIN:B00CF0OITC Empty Roads & Broken Bottles; in search for The Great Perhaps]]

B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old app was easy to check back forth between cities. This one ..... NOT! Why the made these changes beats me. It's frustrating to use. )
0307960471|5.0|Loved this book!  Nesbo has a writing style that grabs me and keeps me reading long after my bed time.  This is the third book of his I have read and am looking forward to reading the Bat now that it has been released this month, and all of the others he has in pring.  Fabulous writer!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Tried this after years of ignoring great reviews. The story is compelling and cast is excellent. I look forward to seeing subsequent episodes.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love it!  Just what I wanted to protect my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  And I love the color.  The stand makes it easy to read when I want to prop it up and the entire case is easy to carry and travel with.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was a good movie, I would watch it again. My husband even watched it with me. Didn't end the way I thought it would but it was good
B004HWYTP4|5.0|funny and lots of action, whole fam loved it!  Can't wait for sequel.  Awesome cast that was loaded with great actors
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I think this game is great I love the sealed that is great gives a more real way to play and feel like it is your deck
B009NY43NY|2.0|It appears that Charlaine Harris has lost her passion for this character and this series.  It left me wondering if she threw names and plot devices into a hat, withdrew them at random, inserted them into the story, and wrapped up the series with as little effort as possible.  A huge disappointment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a good and fun game when your bored but needs more gru tokens but other then that a really fun game
B00CFITJKW|1.0|I downloaded for my grandson but he wasn't able to work the program so it has been a waste of money
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game! Challenging yet not unsolvable like some other games I won't mention. I hope to get more rooms soon... hurry up already :)
B0082Z447U|5.0|I saw the old black and white movie on which this story was based.  And a character (Count Fosco) from this book was used by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child in their book Brimstone, so I decided to read the original and see how it stacked up against both interpretations.  It is a good story and is a very early mystery (written in 1859) with gothic elements included.  I have found it hard to put down and am reaching for my kindle or smartphone with kindle app every time I have a minute to spare.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I love AiC. I love that they're making new music and getting out there. I just don't love THIS music. Voices, Hollow and Stone are the stand-out tracks here, and worth the admission price.<br /><br />Other reviewers have remarked on the dynamic range of the mix, and they're right: This CD is a victim of the Loudness Wars. But a bigger problem are the vocals and the tempo. Yes, Layne is gone, can never come back and will never be forgotten, but AiC in his era had a broader range of tempos, and the lead vocals had a more theatrical presentation.<br /><br />Tempo: Most of the tracks on this CD trudge. Trudging isn't necessarily bad, but when 80% of a CD is at a trudge tempo, it get freakin' monotonous. Ponderous. Boring. Music can be up-tempo without being upbeat - and AiC has done exactly that on previous releases.  Gloomy is fine, but get some anger, some energy back in the mix, guys.<br /><br />Vocals:  I dig William, glad he's aboard. He and Jerry do some good harmonies - not Jerry/Layne great, but good.  But this CD is overflowing with harmonies. William's voice doesn't stand out enough in the mix, IMHO, to really merit lead vocal status. Maybe it's not harmonies but double-tracking the vocals. If that's the case, though, it's way too much.<br /><br />Listening to the whole disc is like drowning in molasses. It's smokey and sweet, but it drags you down and you want to get out before it's over.
B008602KQI|4.0|Interesting story line.  Viewer able to see conflicting human values between the various individuals involved.  Good triumphs over evil, held interest throughout.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|This album rocks it's some of the best stuff they've put out combining old with new and it works.  I love these guys no matter what but this was worth the money and I got a free download of the album so I could hear it all before the album got here and a free dvd It Rocks!  The only tears I had were of Joy!
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Wow, talk about forgetting major events in history. I would say the genocide of 10 million Congolese people is a major event. This book is an eye opening journey into the history of not only the Congo Free State, but the Belgian King who ran his own private empire. I thought I knew something about the &#34;scramble for Africa.&#34; I was wrong. This is a well written history of the Congo region during the time of colonization. The author makes sure that we hear not only European voices, but the voices of the Africans that were brutalized under the regime of the Belgian King Leopold. The horrifying labor system used to extract rubber was the basis of Joseph Conrad's book, the Heart of Darkness. I recommend reading this book. It will open your eyes.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great app but I would only rate it a five if you didn't need Internet to access it.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Despite the spot on reviews I decided to give the game a try since it is the faotd..however after a few rounds attempted on Easy I found a win to be impossible.  It would be a fun game if only 1or2 pieces came in after each move, however it takes very few moves to fill the board thus making a win impossible.  It is frustrating rather than enjoyable. Unistalled after 3 plays. Samsung GS3.
B0073COMUW|5.0|These are one of the best bargains I have ever acquired on Amazon.  The daylight color is perfect for our home and they are cheaper than anything you will find in a home store or department store.  The quality is excellent and evidenced by the weight of the bulb.  WE have used these in the bathrooms, kitchen, and dining room and been happy with them in each room.  The fact that the light only emits through the top is a hard idea to get used but is not noticeable at all in a shaded fixture.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|They did a great job building each characters story so you get hooked fast.  I loved this series!  I can't believe the next series doesn't come out til 2014
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Don't go into this looking for a masterpiece of story telling or cinema. If you are in the mood for guns, slow-mo, blood crazy, then Dredd is a perfect movie for you. Fingers crossed they make another.
1587613379|5.0|This is an awesome book full of great advice for singles and couples. Also has some eye opening descriptions to help you pinpoint your partners or self personalities, flaws, and strengths. If you feel like you don’t fit into the sexual world around you then this book can help you figure out why. It can also help you find a the sexual world that you do fit into.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Well shot movie, excellent pacing and story telling. The inside look at the event around the assassination the movie showed was interesting and gripping.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great game for your kids or for yourself it is very easy to play and very addictive.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I absolutely love this game never put it down! But how do you update on the Kindle Fire HD? To far to uninstall and start over!  My other apps. Can update but when I go to update this one it just say open not update PLEASE HELP!!!!!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|this is a fun little app for your kids to play with if they like to make musical sounds, but it has room for improvement.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this because i started playing arma 2 dayz and needed a mouse with more buttons, with the features and price,mi wanted to try it, and works great, it has 2 profiles, and can be changed in a single butron, the software is easy ro use, and useful, confortable on the hand, its big, which is a plus for me, can use 3 buttons with the thumb, the other three you need the scroll wheel finger, which can be awkward, but reachable, but it is a fantastic mouse, and the price makes it better
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great game for kids to practice had eye coordination and awesome way to kill time or keep the kids busy.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I definetly recommend this movie for the stripping scenes. This movie is filled with Attractive men it's a girls dream! & Channing tatum can dance I really mean dance! The movie would've been way better if it was all strip scences as bad as that sounds. Theres only like 5, 10 minutes at most of the guys dancing. Boo! The plot didn't flow well, no reason for Channing to have a love interest. Would've make it more entertaining if they simply had more shots of the guys talking and joking around. Just bad story line. Another problem is the bonas features. There's nothing beside commentary! No dance scences, no bloopers nothing! A tip for magic mike 2, more stripping less story!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|i really enjoyed this puzzle game. the only thing i wish out of it was for it to keep going ! i know you can keep playing after you won the game, but more levels + challenges would be nice!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|The best books I've read in years, and much much better than the tv series! I've found myself spending far too many hours a day reading them.
0375869026|5.0|Really better than i thought.<br />Book with great message and is worth reading for any age. I do recommend as a nice gift !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I though I wouldn't like it whatsoever. But when I got bored with my other games I tried it and now I'm completely addicted to it!!!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This artful album is not just music, but a story. The whole thing is well thought-out and very emotionally-engaging. If you're a parent, there is some explicit content or content that may not be questionable for young kids (themes of death, macabre imagery) This album is absolutely perfect in every way! Just make sure that the appropriate audience is listening. :) Enjoy!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the best game I ever played. And I would like to share it with my friends and family members.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is good like the graphics the minions they're funny and its a good game with good challenges and good supplies to help with the run
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've had this app for as long as I've had this kindle. And it's AMAZING! I absolutely love it. It gives you so many options and settings to choose from. It allows you to create as many alarms as you want to. Definitely worth getting. Best free app I've ever gotten.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've played this game on my little brothers tablet and I loved it. Now I can play it on mine.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Having a blast the kids enjoy it and I like beating my family, don't know how long they have been playing but I'm b going to d whoop them.<br />Best game ever
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A classic for all children. A story with great imagination expressing the morals of people that all childred must understand.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to hard but not to easy fun overall.<br /> I Hope they come out with more levels soon, I enjoyed this game.
B000SXOK0A|4.0|This is the end of their EMI run; after that Greenwood, Greenwood, Selway, Yorke and O'Brien distributed on their own, free as could be.<br />As with all RH releases, anyone over 40 should be patient. To mix metaphors, Radiohead ranges from baroque to dada. For the literal-minded, sounds closer to The Bends and OK Computer than Amnesiac or Kid A in that has actual tunes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|These are challenging puzzles but not too difficult. Good variety. I look forward to seeing the next update. Give it a try.
B001EYK52O|4.0|Clever but slight, &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; is entertaining and stylish, which is all it was meant to be. The story begins with a carefully orchestrated bank robbery in downtown Boston. The ridiculously wealthy and monumentally bored Thomas Crown has planned it all to a T, and it comes off smoothly. It's hard to imagine anyone but Steve McQueen playing the role. &#34;Tommy&#34; is cool and remote, not given to displaying extremes of emotion either way. This is a big help when Vicki, the insurance investigator played by Faye Dunaway shows up. Her job is to recover the $2M stolen in the heist, and she fingers Tommy as having pulled off the bank job on little more a hunch.<br /><br />Vicki goes about chasing Tommy in plain sight. He doesn't mind getting caught, but isn't swept away by her charms until the justifiably famous chess scene. I wish Hollywood would return to making seduction scenes like this one. It is wordless for about 7 minutes. Tommy and Vicki keep their clothes on. Michel LeGrand's music is perfect throughout, but in this scene it does a lot of the talking for the characters.<br /><br />This is a quiet movie in many places; not what most people expect from a heist or caper movie. But that's really only one aspect of the story. The rest of it is games; mind games and the games rich people play. The split screens, which to many just scream &#34;1968&#34; actually move the story along, and they are so well constructed and presented that they aren't distracting. I will always stop and watch this movie whenever I see that it's on. The 1999 remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo was unnecessary and over the top. The remake is frenetic. In the original, director Norman Jewison understood that less was more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun. Be ready to kill major time without realizing it! Two decks is hard. Four would be impossible. Very challenging!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie at the theatre.  It's awesome to now be able to stream it at home.
B0050IY61G|4.0|This is an indispensable read, but frustrating due to the lack of a TOC. A kindle update with the extra info would take this to a 5 star review. Some readers may prefer the hard copy due to this oversight.
B00181MHQU|5.0|This story is timeless.  Many correlations can be drawn between this musical and current issues.  Still a great watch.  My 14 yr old daughter and I watched and enjoyed.
B0011E7JBW|4.0|Works fine. Very good story and is a collectors item for me. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work well together. And the story line is unique if not a little bizarre. Good effects.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Action pack for the whole family with no profanity, nudity or bad behavior. Just good entertainment. Even iron man is not a playboy or alcoholic and he's cut down on smoking etc.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Works fine. Very good story and is a collectors item for me.  Another great Will Smith movie. He is just fun to watch in action and great actor.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It really is a fun game. I love it! But after I started playing it for a while, it started to freeze up. Please get that fixed.
B002GHHHKQ|4.0|Works fine. Very good story and is a collectors item for me. As many have said this a Sci-Fi story for people who like Sci-Fi and those that don't.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The author's unique style makes this a page turner..clever, witty and full of fun twists with characters that are unforgettable.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its not that great the other survival craft is a lot better you can ride horses and stuff like that
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Cooking is always fun. This game is awesome. The graphics on Restaurant Story is amazing. I'm competing against family members to see who can have the best restaurant and the best neighbors. I recommend this game to everyone of all ages.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is a good look at the whys behind behavior and gives ways to change thinking to improve our lives. Would be a great gift for a person graduating or a senior in high school.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I was impressed by this book. It showed detail and humor, also creativity. Kids love this book, and so have I.
B00D02Z1EA|4.0|Having been an ABR since 2005 and having listened to countless hours of their music, I can say for certain that I am well pleased with this album. That being said, I have heard a lot of people say that this is their best album, and I do not believe that is the case. Rescue & Restore is by far a good album, better than Leveler, Which I did not enjoy, but not as good as their greatest Album, Messengers.<br /><br />This Album is definitely worth getting.
B009HNCS9M|5.0|FANTASTIC ACTORS AND SUPERB WRITING EQUALS GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!!! MY WIFE AND I ARE BOTH HOOKED ON THIS SHOW. CAN'T MISS IT
B001TIQT98|2.0|Have been listening to this 7th for a month now and find Bernstein's recording very idiosyncratic and too often tasteless. Sorry, esp considering how major a champion he was of the great Mahler.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I'm a dedicated fan of Jonny Lee Miller and it's so exciting to see him bring his talent to the Sherlock character. As an amateur Sherlockian, it's a delight to spot the references to the original stories, i.e., names like Gregson, Holmes alluding to Thor Bridge, the pin on Sherlock's lapel like the sovereign given to Sherlock Holmes by Irene Adler Norton on her wedding day. I also love the imaginative twists like the revelation of Moriarty and the gender of Ms. Hudson. Lucy Liu is perfect as Watson and, in my opinion, the understated yet sensual chemistry between her and Holmes has not been done so well since Mulder and Scully in X-Files. Holmes to Watson: \\"Stay......not as my sober companion but as my....companion\\". Holmes to Moriarty: \\"She solved you...my 'mascot'\\". I see and read everything I can about Sherlock Holmes and for me this is the best yet and I realize the bar has been set very high in the past so this is no small accomplishment. This series is perfection.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Certainly worth a try, and you can have a lot of fun without spending a dime.  Simple and free, that is tough to beat.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I've been looking for this movie to share with my four year old granddaughter. Even with ordering less than a week before her birthday it arrived in plenty of time. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|saying in need update will not let me. freezes. up at times. please help. have paid money for coins.not happy
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this product to charge my iPhone 5 and is working very well, it doesn´t heat my iPhone as with other chargers I had before. I recommended it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|i have always loved Les Miserables its the best book yet<br />and a bit confusing but it is so cool
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Oddly manic at times, with a lot of &#34; fast forward&#34; but not necessarily in a bad way. Ewin mcGregor can really sing! This goes on my to buy wish list!
0316019984|5.0|This is the ultimate pop up book and can be a great keepsake item for a child as well.  Gave to my nephew for his 5th bday and he loves it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book,  gee, where do I start?!  I don't want give away anything, so I will just say the more you read the more surprised you will. Love, love, loved it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like the quick tempo of the writing and the &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; humor. I am not sure how accurate some of the legal jargon is but I am not watching it as a tutorial and as entertainment it is definitely 5 stars.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I wanted to finish the book before I saw the movie, and I did! Was not disappointed! The book is so much better; Max's descriptions are right on.  All five senses were firing while reading this. And I could tell who some of his characters were modeled after; some compilations, some individuals. FANTASTIC READ!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The album was put together well with some great classics and some very nice duets. I discovered / purchased this because i saw a PBS special, however the selection of songs on the PBS special were not quite the same as the album even though they were both titled the same.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I loved the cast and Mary-Louise Parker did a fantastic job. It's fairly cookie cutter. Girl leading boring life yearns for adventure, meets boy with a dangerous past, they fight for their lives together.... I like those movies. Good action, great comedy, a little love story, great movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I can't put it down. These little guys are  so cute and funny. This game is just a blast. Graphics are great. The game plays great. It's free Don't pass this game up, loads of fun for all ages.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It continues to get better from the first season! It's full of great acting and great scripts. Who knows where season 3 will take Harvey & Mike, but this is definitely one show and a great season full of great episodes that is not to be missed!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I get so lost in this game my bus ride goes very quickly, I like the sounds affects.. i like this game a lot
B00B2QA646|1.0|Part of the movie is set on a stage like a play. The movie was inconsistant and dashing here and there
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Kids love to cut, style and color hair in all sorts of funny or cute ways. App creates many giggles!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|it seemed like it would be cool but it crashed my kindle every time I tried to play it I still don't know what the point is
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is classic Tom Clancy. Great action, he is on our side. It is a long book, and I'm glad. Jack Ryan and Jack Ryan Jr. are true Americans. I'll be looking for the next book. Thanks Tom.
0199270295|4.0|It is a fantastic book. For someone like me who sucks at chemistry and has never taken orgo, this book gave a very clear, and thorough information on all basic organic chemistry concepts. It was easy to read, and did not withhold any information.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I was twelve. I keep researching it and it just gets better.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|very hard to use and i cant find a way to set it the time i want to be waken up and to get what time it is here
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Series points out the differences of the haves and the have not's.  The backstabbing to get ahead, cowardice in action, almost unrequited love,  Excellent series.  Can't wait to finish it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great study of English gentry class transition to the 20th century through the diverse characters living and working in Downton Abbey in post WWI England.  Entertaining episodes with many personnel/cultural crisis to be resolved by well developed characters through an excellent screen play.  We have recommended this series to all of our friends.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I have found this a brilliant game to play and I have invested quite a bit of real money as well. So when the ice age update came along I thought it would get even better.....WRONG. it is now impossible to a) update it, and b) go back to the original version. The result is that, having got to level 41 I have lost everything it seems. Can anything be done to rectify this disaster?
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Thrilling!  Thrilling!!  Thrilling!!!  Non stop on the edge of your seat thrilling!  Hours of suspense!  Having the set is great for us!  Keifer Sutherland and all members of the cast are true to their role!  Many surprise twists and turns!
B00846REIS|5.0|This story reminded me a lot of the Fifthy Shades series which I *really* liked. In some instances it was even steamier and more dysfunctional. The romance was so exciting, I could barely put the book down; and barely get out of bed ;) If you like erotic-romance, you'll probably like this book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a good game for the family to play, my boys love to look at the dinosaurs. The graphics are great, game play is to do, all around. Good game. Only bad thing is the price of dollars for for a lot of the stuff you can't earn.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first book and was anxious to find out what would happen in the sequel. Much of the same. The story and their relationship barely evolve. At the end I felt like, &#34;that's it?&#34; I didn't even bother purchasing the third book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this app daily, there are some glitches but nothing that annoys me from using it. Love this app it works for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so entertaining. There is a calm fun to it but also a bit of competition to earn enough of everything to be able to compete in shows. Even my 21/2 yr loves to play. He cleans the horse, and the stable. Pretty realistic.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like this app but I feel that it needs to offer more options so that the user can decide what is best for them.
0871137380|5.0|They say war is hell, but they usually don't elaborate. They don't talk about gunning down an unarmed woman standing in the street and pointing out soldiers' positions to the enemy. They don't say what it's like to lie on a Somali couch, legs sliced up by shrapnel, aiming a rifle out a dark window and breathing the acrid scent of urine mixed with the metallic tang of blood.<br /><br />Mark Bowden's \\"Black Hawk Down: a story of modern war\\" does - in all its dirty, smelling, exhausting, confusing glory.<br /><br />Bowden narrates the 1993 battle of Mogadishu, Somalia, which began as a simple mission to capture Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed, and turned into a 15-hour nightmare.<br /><br />Civil war between rival Somali clans began in 1991, and proceeded to tear the country apart, triggering a raging famine and mounting civilian deaths. In 1992, the United States began supplying the Somali people with food and other supplies through military airlift.<br /><br />In December of that year, the United Nations formed a task force to restore peace and order to the African country, The majority of the troops sent were American. The task force did establish order and stave off starvation, but in May 1993, the task force was transitioned into a military operation, charged with restoring social structure to the country, and bringing the waring warlords to trial for war crimes.<br /><br />One of the top wanted was Mohammed Farah Aideed. The operation in Mogadishu under U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Admiral Jonathan Howe focused on bringing in Aideed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as on of Bowden's Somali sources note, the plan shows how little the U.S. understood the clans. If a leader was killed, a brother or a son or a nephew would instantly fill the void and cary on the war.<br /><br />On Oct. 3, following a number of embarrassing failed attempts to capture Aideed, U.S. Army General William F. Garrison was sure they had some of Aideed's top men located, and gave the scrambled Army Rangers the go-ahead for a daylight strike.<br /><br />\\"The men had girded themselves with extra ammo, stuffing magazines and grenades into every available pocket and pouch of their load-bearing harnesses, leaving behind canteens, bayonets, night-vision googles, and every other gear they felt would be deadweight on a fast daylight raid.\\"<br /><br />Bowden allows the story to unfold through the eyes and thoughts of the highly trained Rangers as they anticipate the rapid helicopter ride over the city, the short, rapid slide down the fast-rope into the streets, and after months of waiting, get their chance to \\"kick some serious Somali ass.\\"<br /><br />Once down, the Rangers will form and maintain a perimeter mourned the target, while the elite C Squadron of the Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, or \\"Delta Force\\" operators locate and capture their targets. A convoy will roll in and pick them all up. They'll be back on base in under an hour.<br /><br />Then they plant their boots on the ground.<br /><br />As the bullets begin to fly - popping and zing-ing, as Sergeant Raleigh Cash remembers them - the perspectives and characters begin to crowd in on the reader. The growing list of names and brief personal histories run together, and the story becomes a blur of exploding grenades, severed appendages and bloody bandages.<br /><br />The disoriented and exhausted men don't know what's happening where, and neither does the reader. All the men know is the deadly reality of the Somali gunner crouched in a window overhead, pinning them down. The larger narrative emerges from a mosaic of hundreds of these desperate moments as Bowden skips from one to the other, only dwelling long enough to let that moment engulf the reader.<br /><br />As Bowden introduces a character, he gives a bit of background and a fact or two to turn the name a living, breathing man. Specialist John Waddell was a reader - siting in Mogadishu, he read boxes of pulp fiction. On Oct.3, he was in the last chapter in a John Grisham novel, a book he feared he would never finish as he dodged bullets in the climax of another story. As his feet hit the ground out of the helicopter, and he sprints for cover, he is surprised at how light the full kit on his back feels in the moment. After that, Bowden will simply toss the name into the mix, leaving the reader to remember what made each man unique.<br /><br />Bowden treats his Somali sources with the same dignity. Ali Hassan Mohamed's father owned a hamburger and candy shop, and his 15-year-old brother was gunned down by the Americans when they first landed on the street. At the call to arms, he retrieved his AK-47 and started firing back at the invaders who buzzed across the city many times a day, and who had decided to attack this time.<br /><br />\\"He would shoot a Ranger or die trying. Why were they doing this? Who were these Americans who came to his neighborhood spraying bullets and spreading death?\\"<br /><br />Bowden uses the same level of specific detail as he describes the harsh moments of battle. His pen doesn't flinch away sights such as when Delta operator Tim \\"Griz\\" Martin loses part of his torso to an explosion, but survives long enough to try holding his visceral tissue inside with his hands. Bowden follows Delta medic Kurt Schmid's fight for the life of Jamie Smith, through each agonizing moment, as his measures become more desperate and more painful for Smith.<br /><br />Through most of the book, Bowden tells the story through his characters - the emotions and reactions are those of the about 150 sources he interviewed. He checked the interviews against the many parallel accounts he collected of the events, and the recorded video feed and radio communications from the battle.<br /><br />As Bowden wrote in the epilogue, he'd expected that the greatest barrier to writing a battlefield narrative would be convincing the military to declassify documents. It wasn't. His greatest challenge, hewrote, was creating a coherent sequence of events, because the military didn't have one. After publication, military brass invited Bowden to speak at conferences and give talks to their personnel.<br /><br />\\"I was flattered in every instance, but uneasy with the idea of that our armed forces would rely on a journalist ... As one of the former Delta team leaders remarked after hearing of yet another invitation I'd received, `Why aren't they talking to us?'\\"<br /><br />The book, after all, is about them. It's about how the battle of Mogadishu - how war - affects the living, breathing men on both sides. It's ugly. It's messy. It's hell.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app supplies an great release for you if you are in the doctor's waiting room or just bored. The levels are a bit challenging but need to offer more steps.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is just difficult enough. Not too easy but not too hard. It takes a little patience to get through each room. I liked it a lot.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|When you start reading you can not stop till the last page. It takes you back to England during World War II, politics and intrigues
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a novice when it comes to computer games .  This is the only game I play on my Kindle.  I especially like the &#34;auto-finish&#34; is quick!  Some other solitaire games take forever to go thru the auto-finish, making you have to click to finish before you can start a new game.  This one is super fast so you can skip that step before starting a new game.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I read it twice and still need more. It is catching, and take your for a few hours to another time, another places. Well done me archer
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|glad to see a band that sticks to their roots. could listen to it all day. great city great band
B00BD6RFFS|4.0|I've used this book in a course at the university I attend, and it provided valuable information about the building blocks in the Business Model Canvas and how to analyse each of these. Good information on patterns and strategies that can be used to further improve a business model is also present in the book.<br /><br />In general it is easily readable and you do not have to read it from one end to another. You can just go in one chapter and read pages necessary to gain an understanding of what is discussed in that chapter.<br /><br />The most important chapters for me were the ones about Patterns and Strategy, which were used a lot in the course.<br /><br />So to conclude, it is a well written book, which is easy to read and has a lot of valuable information. However, the Kindle book destroys the format the book is written in and might not present you figures as easily as the book itself.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The voices in this movie make it great! There is also a wonderful story line for both children and adults. A MUST SEE
0425252868|5.0|As the title states, this is an incredible true story and it was written incredibly well.  Thanks to the author for sharing this fascinating story with the public.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is more challenging with each level.  Quite addicting! I play on my ASUS 300 and enjoy it.  I even challenged my son with seeing if he could figure out a level.
B00CBT04LI|4.0|I really enjoyed this. THE THING (1982) is probably my favorite horror movie ever made, and easily in my top ten movies, period. This movie, while it dumbs things down a bit, and the CGI is not nearly as entertaining as the stop motion and puppetry of the 80s version, is still a fun movie. I really enjoyed the cast.<br /><br />Also, throwing \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" by Men at Work into the soundtrack is pretty funny, with the plot of the film being about not knowing who is a THING and who is not. The fact that Men at Work is one of my favorite bands helps too.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Nice updating of the famous Sherlock Holmes approach to life. Deductive reasoning is alive an well for Elementary fans everywhere.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|As much fun to read as the movie was to watch....although the movie was a different book by Michael Connelly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I typically, am not a gamer. This game kept my interest and I'm hooked! The puzzles made me think creatively and had me stumped over and over. I love &quot;Can You Escape!&quot;
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|I really loved this app then one day it stopped working! I think it happened after an update. Highly disappointed:0(
1423136802|5.0|Starting to proof-read these for a 5 year old. I don't think there is anything too bad in them for her. For me, the stories are very enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many craft ideas, yummy recipes, and home decor ideas on this site! Love that I can search by a specific idea too!
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|We loved this disc.  We first saw it on PBS and enjoyed it so much, we bought two copies so that we could give one away.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|WILL NOT WORK ON MY \\"AMAZON KINDLE FIRE\\" NOT EOR AMAZON FIRE!!!!!U WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE COMPATATABLE......NOT FOR KINDEL FIRE...WONT LOAD!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great story and I love how it draws you into this world.  The characters are well thought out and the story line moves along at a smooth pace.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|This app will not load on a kindle fire hd. It says to just reopen it and it will work, but I won' t this is a waste of my money. And if the creator of this game is reading this, I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I really wish there was a money back guarantee. And it is really weird. This app works on a kindle fire, but not a kindle fire hd. Come on people! Step it up!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is great it fun it addictive and one of the best games I played only kindle the best game ever
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I chose this based on the 5 star reviews and was not disappointed. I suppose my only issue was how short in was, but I am good with puzzles so this may prove challenging for others and last longer for them. Love the graphics and detail. The puzzles were well thought out and even a bit of a challenge for a seasoned player like myself. Cannot wait for more.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved this book.  I had read this author with the Kite Runner and felt I learned a little about Afganastan's history and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This book told more of several people's lives and although I would have liked to see a happy ending, I loved the book.  The author writes in a way that helps you to visualize what he is describing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. It's a perfect escape game although it's very short. Hopefully new levels come soon so I can continue to play. I beat it already within 30 minutes.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was very good game. You had to really think and pay close attention to the clues to slove this puzzle game.
B005T87QCI|5.0|don't listen to any of these losers the game is awesome and you can actually unlock atom not pay for him
140123755X|5.0|This book is the start of the Fables series by Bill Willingham-- it collects the first 5 or 6 of these comic/graphic novels into one volume. Beautifully written and illustrated with an amazingly layered and rich storyline. These aren't the fairy tales you read as a child.
B00474IVGA|5.0|I loved the movie and bought it and then I had to have the CD. The music is great on a long drive and love it at home, anytime.<br />I've always been a fan of Tim McGraw but had never really known Garrett Hedlund, he is great, love his style. Gweneth Paltrow<br />did an awesome job in this movie, I didn't know she could sing too.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not his best effort (and he admits as much in the epilogue!).  Still a fun story to read - especially if you like people outsmarting the government.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I used to really enjoy playing this game. But, lately, once I get past the initial loading screen, it logs me in and then just sits, and sits, and sits... I never actually get to the tournament screen.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The biggest problem with the book is that it comes to an end leaving you wanting more!  I can't wait for the third in the trilogy!  I wish I could have given it another star
B000JMKQX0|4.0|First 2/3 was creative and enjoyable- it got long, same story through a different lens.  Overall it was a fun read.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I never would have thought I would like a quirky series about a high school chemistry teacher who gets into &#34;cooking&#34; crystal meth. but I love this series and plan to buy all the later episodes.  As in all great shows (Sopranos, Mad Men, etc.), the acting, down to the smallest roles, is superb and the viewer has to bring something to it. I look forward to all the twists and turns of the episodes to come.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is a great play for free game anyone familiar with this style of game will know how this works
B005544V6A|5.0|Love the premise and very realistic.  Very well done show. The characters are very believable. Great execution, and great plot.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I can not get through level six. But I do like the game. Could someone please give me some hints?
B004GF244K|5.0|I love rock and roll, and music videos. This is by far the best combination of both. Trust me, you'll enjoy this from A to Z...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. It wasn't as scary as you would think it would be. Great for Teens. I am 9, But I loved It
B007MNV5WU|3.0|A little too easy for my gaming  experiences. Not totally a wast of time, bu, a little too easy, eh.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I find this game strangely addicting. Me and my friend who are 12 are baffled by the fact that it is so fun when we don't even like princesses that much!<br /><br />The full version is soooooooo much better than the free version. I would suggest the free version only for those who would like to try this game out. It is much better than any other dress-up game I've ever played.<br /><br />The only problem is that sometimes on my kindle fire HD when I go to click a screen button such as an arrow or a utensil, the whole game shuts down and I have to start all over again. This has happened many times and becomes VERY annoying. But other than that, this is a very good game and worth buying the full version.
B0045INTVA|5.0|Sheen, Brando, Hopper, Duvall, who could a ask for a better cast than this. I give this movie 10 stars. A must see. I just watched it again and realized it even has Harrison Ford!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's my main calculator at home.<br />I love the big numbers and the way it shows the problem you are working on
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I never palyed angry birds before. this is the on that got me addicted to bird mania. Loads of fun!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the first gaming mouse I purchased, and I am glad I purchased this one!<br /><br />I tend to like larger mice that fit my hand, and this one feels great. The teflon feet are perfect, the mouse slides effortlessly. The thumb grip tends to get a little slick after a while, causing my thumb to slip, but this is not really a major concern for me. All 9 buttons are super responsive. The left and right buttons, and the mouse wheel, have just the right amount of resistance to prevent misclicks, but not too much that it's difficult to use. The side buttons are placed perfectly. You can easily reach all of them without it feeling awkward. The right side of the mouse is smooth plastic, which may get slick after long periods of use. You may need to wipe down the sides every once in a while (again, not a huge concern). The ability to change profiles on the fly is awesome. The braided cord never gets tangled, which is great.<br /><br />The software is also incredibly easy to use. I had no trouble finding the DPI settings and light settings. The light is covered by your hand when you actually use the mouse, but is good for distinguishing between different profiles.<br /><br />Fantastic quality, and the price is much lower than other high-end models! I had this overnighted, and it still cost me less than a Razer would with free shipping.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|and space on my kindle. Don't waste your time with this one. Pass it over even if you like angry birds
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Love the game' for any of you having issues with the UPDATE with kindle fire. Open the app, pull down the menu u use to change the volume, brightness etc.  And hit the sync option I had to hit mine once or twice I think. Then the update should down load. Good luck.
B0026KX68A|5.0|Mila, I love you(My wife knows)!  Well acted well written and when Milas'  costume goes ultra violet she about to kick butt! Unfortunately, this film I think came out around the time Aeon Flux (another good film) came out so it didn't get the credit it deserved.
B003YFJ5U4|5.0|Described in detail are (1) the history of modern physics on quantum theories which emerged in the early twentieth century, (2) histories of vivid personal lives of concerned physicists, and especially (3) the debate between Einstein and Bohr concerning the view of the physical world based on the quantum theories.  Those are as interesting as mystery stories to those readers who have at least some knowledge of physics and physicists.<br /><br />  The author seems interested in compiling a large amount of quotation, as listed in 20% of the pages, to document histories as well as in having the readers to understand them.  As a result, some descriptions are repetitive and reduntant, and others are harder to understand.  Sometimes the author made me wonder whether he might not be as knowledgeable in physics as a physicist.  Some details of Einstein-Bohr debate may not be articulate enough, or alternatively, I myself may not be smart enough.  Incidentally, I found an apparent mistake on page 215, where the author writes &#34;The square of 4+3i is 25&#34;.  It is not mathematically true.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, this book is invaluable in the sense that it describes important histories in a very informative as well as interesting way.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I was disappointed, I watch moves while on three and a half hour of dialysis and could not get through this movie. the only highlight was Iron man.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I have been playing mtg for years.  The game on Kindle is a great enjoyment for my time.  I would've given it 5 stars, but there is a major issue with the play mechanics.  The game decides which lands to tap for mana.  Not a problem for single colored decks.  It makes it a bane for multi-colored decks.  With a flaw lime that, I would hope they release an update that fixes this issue
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Or, maybe I shouldn't be disappointed.  I got what I was expecting to some degree.  I just didn't think it would be THAT bad.  I did not even finish the movie.  Actually, once they arrived in Oz and the color came to life, I was done, but I continued to watch, TRYING to give it a chance via the story.  I probably didn't watch half of it before I left the children to it and walked away.<br /><br />I suppose I'm so disappointed because The Wizard of Oz is one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of all time, if not THE greatest.  And without CG.  It was amazing, beautiful, and realistic.  Maybe I have Disney to blame for that because the minute he arrived in the land of Oz, I felt like I was watching Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Or The Incredible Mr. Limpet.  Only without as much realism.  The colors are TOO bright and bold.  The animation is TOO cartoon-like.  There is no way to pretend it's not entirely computer generated.  Maybe had James Cameron made it, it would have been awesome.  Maybe I'm spoiled by good movies.<br /><br />The actors are great actors.  However, they had so little to work with, I felt like I was watching a Syfy original acid trip.  Franco as Oz was unbelievable.  Kunis was not at all appropriate for the role given.  Just disappointed.<br /><br />Rent, if you have kids.  Don't buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good. The graphics are pretty realistic. The movements are not unrealistic like a lot of animated horse games. The tournaments are pretty fun too.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This is a fun game and its free scrolling unlike many kindle games and apps it has great graphics i highly recommend this game but be ready for a long download i hope u like my comment.
B004TPXVKS|4.0|This is a great album, and the extras, while no more than a collection of outtakes, are more than worth it.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Dont buy from nohope club  50-50 chance you'll get your stuff .He'll never see my money again. Rip off! rip off rip off
B000065V42|5.0|A classic purchased for my grand kids. Bound to bring many hours of fun! Can't wait to watch it with them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is really fun. I enjoy playing it. And I love how it's like the movie. But it could have more minion's to choose from.
B001P5HI4A|4.0|I brought this movie as a gift for my mother. She have the VHS and she been looking for this movie in DVD. So I happen to find it here on Amazon.com. It arrive on time and the shipping was fast. But the price for this DVD is not cheap. That explain it was a Two-Disc Director's Cut. I thought my mother would like the feature on this DVD. She love it and was happy to have this movie in DVD.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I was very satisfied with the quality and condition of the case and dvds inside. Everything worked out as expected. Thanks
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This movie is a misguided attempt at telling this classic tale with a modern artistic sensibility. As such it fails because Anna Karenina is not an artistic interpretation of human beings, but a very insightful study of human nature and passion and the consequences of their actions. I couldn't get through this film because it missed the mark from the starting gate.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was very satisfied with the quality and condition of the case and dvd inside. Everything worked out as expected. Thanks
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely fabulous show! I am so happy I found Season 2 on Amazon Prime. Thought I'd have to miss it!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Grandkids love it. They enjoy playing this on a rainy day like today.  The tutorial on this game was wonderful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it I love horses but when I saw unicorns  it blew my mind if u like horses u will love this game I mean blew my mind!!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|this is a nice game, but not very original in concept.  It is designed to force you to either buy more bubbles, or delete the app.  I deleted.  Bejeweled is better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Clean and Refreshing.  This show is excellent.  It hooks you in and you can't wait for the next episode - a definite hit!
B00D41H2PS|4.0|This puzzle game is based on the point and click adventure games for the PC.  The puzzles are not very challenging to a veteran of these games, but very enjoyable.  I look forward to more of these games.
B00005JM02|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. While watching in HD the colors are awesome! We watched it as a family when it was first released and now we are watching it again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Perfect summer reading.  Couldn't put it down.  Wouldn't call it literature but perfect for the beach and leisure time reading.
B0090SI44M|5.0|I purchased this for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter and it is currently her favorite movie. I used to watch it with her mother and now my granddaughter and I have watched it many times! We even went to the movie theater to watch the new Monsters University which was a hit also.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story itself had the potential to be ok however, I did not like the way it was presented. Kept going back between husband and wife telling the story. Lots of unbelievable twists and turns. The ending was not good at all.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I didn't know if this existed when I started searching.. it does!  Now in my car I have my android phone charging (using this awesome coiled cable [[ASIN:B005RWKAA6 B005RWKAA6]] and my iPod Nano charging at the same time!  Works great, just plug in and go. Fit my car well.
B00005JLEU|1.0|I LOVE animation movies and since this had won an academy award I thought I would give it a try. It was the WORST animated movie I have ever seen. I'd give it a minus but one star is the lowest amazon allows me to give. The animation was lousy, the music was lousy, I felt the story was choppy and lousy, and it wasn't moving in any way. I really do NOT understand why people rate this so high. I bought the DVD and after watching it I donated it to the Salvation Army thrift store. What a waste of money!!!!  :-(
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Even better than Winter of the World!  Again, so many times this tragedy could have been avoided.  Having lived during these times it great (but sad) to relive them.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show and I can't complain about the men. Gabe is so handsome. Great story line. Can't wait for season 3
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever it was so awesome i love it it is so awesome but i want the nether in the game
B003YL4KS0|3.0|I am debating whether I should bother getting a refund. Although some of the information is helpful, the audio/video doesn't work. That was why I purchased this edition.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great for horse lovers every where. It's so realistic and a huge amount of fun for all sorts of age groups.
006178480X|5.0|This was a great a read. James Rollins delivers again. Loved to see the introduction of new characters and sad to see the departure of others. Cannot wait to read another Sigma Force novel.
B005AUWY90|5.0|My 4 yr old loves anything Disney Pixar Cars, he had the DVD, which I ordered on accident, but we wanted the blue ray-- wow the clarity! You can really tell the difference. The seeker sent right away, no complaints, the blue ray was perfect.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I loved Emma!  It took a while to get into the characters but it's worth it when you get to the end.  The acting was quite good at times and the costumes quaint, but I will warn you--Emma is definitely a chick flick!  My husband didn't like it but I went back and finished all of the episodes.  Well worth it!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE Lady A. Yet again they have made music to enjoy over and over. Even more amazing live.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|the doll was exactly like the pictures i have seen. when i got her in the mail i was loving her even more.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|The characters develop further and you feel the tension developing. I enjoyed reading part 3 and would definately buy the next story.
147674355X|5.0|[[ASIN:147674355X Hopeless]]WOW! Loved Dean Holders POV! This was one of my alltime favorite books and this just made it better! Love ALL of Colleen Hoover's. Books!!! Can not wait to read more of her stories!
0920668372|5.0|Read this to my son when he was little. He loved it and would bring it to me when it was time for his bedtime story. Bought this one for my granddaughter!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I only hope they don't start writing dumb story lines. The first season was awesome, the second season is great, they did have a couple cheesy shows but overall it was great. Cannot wait for the thiurd season...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game but there is not to much you can do in it. They try to keep you busy. If you don't have anything to do on the weekends this would be a great game for you.
B000OLV97I|5.0|I hope they make a sequel.  It was well acted and a very good story. Now I want more so I hope they make a sequel
B003VANOFY|5.0|writing this review after 6 months of owning and I do not have any problem. Batter is is good, you will get good 6 hours with full charge and it charges really quick under 2 hrs. Range is super long im getting around 40 ft before it starts to break up a little.<br />ear sits comfortably for long gaming. surround system is at its best.<br /><br />pros: Everything about it<br /><br />cons: NONE (just absolutely love it)
B0071AKB38|5.0|Already had the wired X-mini II speaker and it's awesome.  I wanted to add BT functionality so when I got a text or something while listening to music, I didn't have to lean over to my phone which was 3&#34; away from the attached speaker.  With the audio passthru, I can now rock both speakers wirelessly!  Personally, I could do without the built in mic for conference calling, but I suppose it's a nice feature that I'll probably never use.  Do note, BT streaming will cut the play time of this by about half, but you do always have the option to run it wired as well.  Sound quality is what yo'd expect from an X-Mini speaker, was easy to pair and use, no complaints!
1451695195|2.0|It may have been this doctors experience, but heaven as he saw it looks bleak and depressing.  I know Jesus has a much better place for me!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a REALLY fun game for kids, I personally enjoy it but the only thing that bothered me was that it took awhile to load. Other than that awesome game! :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't wait to continue seeing this series.  I didn't get into it until late so bought the first 3 seasons in order to catch up.  So happy I did and have shared with others who heard it was good but hadn't caught on yet.  The characters are so believable and interesting, not to mention the beautiful clothes on the women.  Very happy with my purchases.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I really enjoyed the Man of Steel movie and listening to the soundtrack on its own as well. It is very well done.
B0007OCG56|5.0|I played this movie to my Mom and a Latina friend. We all loved it and we are in love with Adam Sandler. I cried at the end.
B000OSDSKM|5.0|I loved the movie, the popcorn, the large drink, and the ones who watch it with me. Thanks so much. Peace
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a great app until today when the entire display was changed. All the glitz makes it hard to read and some of the information not available anymore. When it comes to weather I preferr accurate; simple; and to the point. This app doesn't deliver that anymore.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved how the book ended.<br />I wish it could've been longer even though it was 377 pages. Haha(sorry I'm a fast reader)<br />I chose five stars because I thought the book deserved it. It really made you feel connected to the main character,Percy.<br />I love Rick Riordan's books and would love to read more please.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is the third Neil Gaiman book I've read, and this is the third time I've told myself to read more Gaiman!<br /><br />I won't recount the story, but I will say this was wonderfully-told and well-written.<br /><br />Never underestimate the power of Neil Gaiman.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very glad I read this. I absolutely enjoyed every word of this book and it is definitely worth a read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! So much action and romance! Can't wait to read the others! I really think that teens would love it. It has characters of their age.
B000093BDX|5.0|Love the Beach Boys songs, this one has a great mix of well known and a few not so known songs.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|There are a few things I would have suggested be done differently, (Where are the ruby red slippers?) but over all I thought this was a decent attempt at it. I don't think any fans of Oz will be terribly upset by this movie.
1612930425|4.0|I was lucky enough to get a lovely, scarlet cloth bound version with a built in bookmark. A surprisingly captivating story. I've developed a taste for edgier, modern writing, so was very pleased to find that this classic held me captive to the lovely end. There are no modern plot surprises, and this lack of trickery and devices and the plethora of charm and skill was refreshing. The modern reader won't be bored.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|What a fun game, with other side games to choose from.  A large slot selection along with the numerouse bingo levels.  Love Bingo Blitz!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The fourth season of Breaking Bad is even better than the third and everything from the acting to the way the story is filmed is superb. I can't wait for the next season.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|We recently bought this movie for our 4-year old daughter and it is a huge hit with her and the whole family. We've only had it for a week or two, but she's already seen it three times and I am sure she will ask for it again during our next movie night. But as I've mentioned, there is enough in the movie to enjoy by the parents too: just the right amount of grownup jokes.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Wow, this set is wonderful! The show is so compelling, well-acted and a pleasure to watch. Kevin Spacey is amazing, but the cinematography and the script are also superb.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I am Michael Buble fan now ........ great  CD. Really liked it, easy listening, romantic..perfect for the car as well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am just dumbfounded by how well this program has been performed from the very first episode and now we are at the end and still want more.  Well done people of England.  Keep up the excellent performances and Maggie Smith is the quintessential person to perform granny.  I had seen The Pride of Miss Jean Brody quite a few years ago and truly appreciate how mature and realistic the performance.  Matthew is quite the mans man, he has to be to love and work with Mary and Mary has come into her own as the plot would be so boring if she was not a part of the excellent casting.  I could go on and on but simply put you must watch and see the realizm and the historical accuracy from the Titanic to pre World War II.  I do hope that is the next twist and turn of the plot for season 4.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the characters in the story and was glad the trilogy is not complete. I look forward to book 4.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was reluctant to start watching this, but I'm glad I did! Interesting story lines, great casting and acting, brilliantly paced. Great show.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I LOVED this movie as a kid... i bought it for my daughter, but I think I may have forgotten at what age I watched it because she is 5 and really couldn't get into the story line.  Anyway, I figure she will like it in a couple more years.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It's great that you can get the season before they come out on dvds. All caught up, can't wait for next season
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice game for children to have fun. Also for adults. The difficulty ranges so everyone can play. I have played similar games but like this better
B003QS9WIE|4.0|My sister convinced me to watch this movie.  It was confusing to say the least - but definitely entertaining.  I was clueless that David Bowie was in the movie.  How time flies.  He did a good job, as did the others
B009AMANBA|5.0|While I have never been a fan of great people in history movies, Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" wins my respect for how it takes a larger-than-life person like America's 16th president and builds an accurate narrative around him during a very defining time in the country's history. Spielberg artfully combines the character of a national leader with a complex chain of interconnecting events whirling around him to produce an authentic sense of very special times. Back in the early 1860s America was at war with itself and Lincoln, the Republican president, wanted to keep the concept of the union alive in the national consciousness. While supportive of the idea of the emancipating slaves, his main task was to find a way to win the war while avoiding a compromise with the Confederacy. As the film illustrates, Lincoln ever the cautious pragmatist and opportunist, looked for that key moment when the tide of war was turning in favour of the Union to deliver on emancipation, but since that was on a wartime proclamation, much more had to be done in Congress to make it a constitutional reality. It is early 1865 when this version of history really gets going. Both the North and South are war weary and some members of the Republican and Democrats are talking about negotiating a peace. If this move ever went through, Lincoln's presidency could likely have failed to achieve the saving of the nation and the six hundred thousand soldiers lost in the conflict would have died in vain. It is at this critical juncture that the Lincoln White House got the Republicans in Congress to sponsor an amendment to federally make it unlawful to keep slaves anywhere in the country. While I always knew that Lincoln was an inveterate teller of yarns, I never appreciate how effective it was as tactic to getting people onside until I watch this movie. The enduring wisdom and patience of this iconic man, in the midst of great adversity, within and outside his family, is definitely a strong point in this production. While I have been used to appreciating the fullness of Lincoln over five decades of political maturation, this film emphasizes the importance of seeing him at important moment when all could have been truly lost if he given in to less resolute minds. The supporting cast does a credible job in bringing out those noble traits in the man as he humbly tried to make sense of his destiny without getting too far ahead of the events at hand.on.

B00AK77WPE|5.0|Excellent DVD, the video image and sound are first quality. Very value price. I was amazing how this concert was recording under the rain. I very recommend this DVD to enjoy part of the life.
B00BXI26XC|5.0|My friend in the FAA turned me on to this App. I use it quite frequently to monitor the air traffic where I live. I would HIGHLY suggest aviation fans download this app for use.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is better than others that wont give u the next clue until u unlock the next in order. it is challenging.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ok I was skeptical that this series would live up to the hipe but I was pleasantly surprised. No it is not a pulitizer prize winner but EL James does a great job on engaging you from the beginning and leaves you hanging wanting to turn the pages. For her first books she has done a very good job. I read all 3 books in 3 days and then decided to go back and read them again at a slower pace. I am glad that I did that I missed some details the first time and enjoyed the book the second time much more. Yes it is descriptive and has tons of language, so if that is a problem for you then don't read it. I thought the love story was wonderful - I loved to watch Christian fall in love with Ana in these books, as well as watch Ana fall in love with him - even with all his 50 shades...This is one time that I have to see the movie when it comes out to see how it compares to the books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love the multi platform support and sync accross devices and platforms enjoy reading books on all of my platforms  .
B0000669JL|5.0|Best Marley cd for the price! Has almost all his greatest hits like Easy Skanking, Is this love?, Buffalo Soldier, Three Little Birds, No Woman No Cry, Jamming, Exodus and One Love.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved playing solitaire on the computer and I found it on the kindle fire HD when I got it. I can play it on a car trip or just waiting to go into the doctors office.
B00005MKA3|5.0|Really great album for rebellious reggae and Wailer fans alike. I highly suggest to I and I interested in Rastafari, Pan-Africanism, and social, cultural, and political struggle.
B004SC8XHI|3.0|This is interesting as a historical piece, but if you like the Beatles or you like Booker T and the MG, there are probably better albums to listen to.
0425267695|5.0|I'm always critical when reading books, especially new series like this. But I've got to say, that this quickly became one my all time favourite fantasy books. It's an amazing book, and you do yourself a disservice by not picking this book up. I had a really hard time putting this book down, which I usually force myself to do, so I can think about the story, its characters etc. It proved impossible with this book.<br /><br />Get this book - your soul demands it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|How can you not love it? It wasn't what I expected. It's more along the lines of 'Coraline' than American Gods. But it is brilliantly written, and beautiful.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|I think I played this CD so many times I busted the sound card on my laptop. So worth it though. Best decision I ever made and I appreciate the guys of Tesseract for creating this amazing album.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series. Just finished Season 3 and have to wait until next year for season four. Looking so forward to it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Difficult to watch due to the moral implications brought to mind in a society that &#34;hungers&#34; for blood sport.  I am looking forward to the next movie.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The book is practical to use on a daily basis. I would recommend it to people who are looking for a paradigm change in themselves!
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Great song - saw the movie and this song came on so ordered it right there in theater. If  you  want a  good  feeling  buy  it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This gives you a great look at how hard Lincoln worked to do the right thing. I wish we still had politicians like this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|With each episode of Downton Abby I find myself filling in the blanks of what they have not shown us in a season. I love this show and I am so curious to see how season 4 will begin.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I guess I still like the old Karate Kid version.  The kids liked this one though and have watched it many times.  It was in good condition and works well.
0307474275|5.0|Anyone who lurks in thrift stores for books knows that there are approximately 7 copies of this book at any given time in every resale shop across the country. Criticisms aside, it's a page turner. Start it on a Friday and send the kids to grandma's for the weekend.:-)<br /><br />Not being a big fan of fiction (apart from the classics) at the time, I initially thought this was a non-fiction book. I received it as a gift soon after it came out, and realized it was a novel when I set down to check it out. It was a year before I finally decided to read it... out of obligation lol.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down! Sure I watered and fed the kids, but the bulk of my time was spent reading this book every moment I could till I was finished. Luckily it didn't take too long to get through it! I don't mean to \\"hype\\" this book up, but it is solely responsible for my new interest in... pop fiction.<br /><br />I've read some works of fiction which did a better job of stimulating mental imagery. I've read some books which didn't contain as many little... annoying things. Forget the controversy. If you're looking for a fast paced book and a page turner this is it.<br /><br />When I say it's fast paced, I mean there's really no good place to put the book down! Sure there are lots of little chapters, but you want to know what happens next from the very beginning. I missed a lot of sleep, but I found the book riveting. I've checked out a few other pop fiction authors (though admittedly not many), and The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were the *only* two that started out interesting and stayed that way, so far. I'm in the middle of Inferno right now, and can't believe it has more stars than The Da Vinci Code! I'm inclined to believe the controversy naysayers had something to do with the low rating lol. It took me twice as long just to get to the middle of Inferno, and I was so sure I would read it cover to cover over the weekend. The beginning, at least, pales in comparison.<br /><br />The Da Vinici Code is not a masterpiece. It's not flawless. The ending is a little dull IMO compared to Angels & Demons, but it is an exciting read./><br />The Da Vinici Code is not a masterpiece. It's not flawless.

B001AQT11M|5.0|This is another Disney classic that I can enjoy as a grandmother as much as I did as a child.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not the type of show I thought I'd be into but I really got sacked in.  It is great! (seasons 1 &  2 also!)
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I enjoyed this as much in 2013 as I did as a small child!!  This is Disney at its finest.... It's delightful!!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I've had, and loved the weather channel app for over a year and loved it. It WAS so easy to use, easy to see pertinent information. Easy to see multiple cities of my choosing at a glance. So imagine my shock tonight when I go to check the current temperatures in my city and the one I work in and its not there!!  As your Granny might say, &quot;it's all gussied up&quot; now. Oh with some frustrating maneuvering I found a similar list, but in a drop down window. And what's with the unnecessary fancy colorful background? Whoever made these radical and unwelcome changes obviously never heard the old saying &quot;If it ain't broke don't fix it&quot;
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is a very well written show. The twists and turn in the story line truely keep me intrigued and coming back for more. I cannot wait to see what happens next.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we love it.it is not too hard which makes it really fun. I hats games like this that are too difficult to figure out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing it.  I am not very skilled at this yet but find myself getting better every day.  It is fun and is a nice change of pace during the day instead of reading.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Very Good Drama Movie & good acting by Danzel Washington. Overall good Movie, good story. Makes you wonder about Pilots running your Flight
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|a great movie, especially if you've ever toured europe, but even if you haven't, you will enjoy.  not a film for young children, by any means, nudity, language and sexual themes abound.  but even more pervasive are the laughs and great lines
B0001EFTVA|4.0|But I will give credit where credit is due. This is a pretty good anime. It's humorous and at times it is moving. This one isn't as well recieved as his &#34;psychological&#34; movies like Perfect Blue but he did write Magnetic Rose for Memories and that's perhaps one of my favorite Anime shorts.<br /><br />I recommend watching this at least once for a chuckle.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|A lot of options you would expect (such as tracking tweets enmasse as well as by who you are following). A well thought out app. Don't know if this was a coincidence but I got a lot of junk email after I started using the app.
B00014X8KO|5.0|And opera... And Anime.<br />Basically I rented this on a whim back when Blockbuster was still around. I was not displeased with it. The stories are good, short and they do their job. My personal favorites are the first one &#34;Magnetic Rose&#34; and I believe &#34;Cannon Town&#34; the last story.<br />Made in the same manner as Robot Carnival this is simply a series of short stories for you to watch and enjoy.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Just picked one up for a spare. Have to make sure I can always charge my kindle. Thanks so much.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I did everything exactly how it told me to and every time the bottle cracks in the wrong place. This was a stupid idea to begin with, what the hell was I thinking?
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games, and so far this one hasn't let me down. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games.
B00DHNBY02|3.0|Definitely a one-time watch for me. Extremely gorey and campy. However, the acting was decent for a horror film, they kept to the premise, and it was very entertaining.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I was disappointed the first time I listened. Dylan's voice has moved beyond croaking here, and the music seemed uninspired on first hearing it, ordinary, which is a word that never should apply to Bob Dylan. But after forcing myself to have a second and third listen, and a fourth, I began to pick up subtleties in lyrics and licks that I began to enjoy, true Dylanisms, if you will, and now find myself listening to Tempest regularly. I keep hoping for another &#34;Time Out Of Mind.&#34; This isn't it, but it isn't bad, but it took a while for it to grow on me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I luv this game so much, even tho it took a long time to load. It is so much fun! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|well designed. I enjoy playing this game to pass time when I am on breaks or just sitting at home relaxing. recommended for all.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book was a disappointment compared to the first two books. There was very little to get excited about. Just warm, not HOT!
B00005R2IS|5.0|I surprised my husband with this movie as one of his pre-Father's Day gifts.  He has been trying for years to find this movie to complete his Mad Max set.  He is so proud and watches this movie a few times a week.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this app has supported and encouraged my grandkids to talk and act like out OUT OF CONTROL wild people with CRAPPY mouths and foul language. the IDIOTS who ???contribute??? to this app/video are so foul of mouth as to make me want to sell my Kindle and never get another device like it in the future. I personally got my Fire to read and Enjoy books and videos, my grandkids have almost totally destroyed this for me. I am going to delete this app and hopefully not totally destroy my Kindle, but if so, too bad. other parents who may read this and Kindle staff, tempis fugate (buyer beware) this app is or has become very bad news for users like me. feel free to join the fight for better behaved children and users, I am no saint but I am not a blind follower either.

B00002MZ4V|5.0|So many people ignore John Williams because he is &#34;just a film composer. Actually, because of his music in films, music backing up films took giant strides ahead. This is 30 years of John Williams at his very best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Better than Temple Run and Subway Surf COMBINED!!! I recommend this  game to everyone who likes the adorableness of minions plus the action of Subway Surf!!!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The problem is with the Ipad not the device. Product worked exactly as described without any problems. I wish the Ipad had native support to transfer files to the SD card. I found a similar device online that allowed file transfer both ways after downloading an app but the cost was $169. Five stars for working as described, no problems.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome graphics. It takes a lot of skill though. You have to concentrate on what you are doing. Definitely worth five stars. And it's FREE.
B00BIR381W|5.0|This series is one of the best I have seen in a while. I definitely love the mystery of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is awesome!  If you like Despicable me and subway suffers you will love this app! Again this app is awesome!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is amazing.it actually works.with this. App you can,change your game mode on any world that you have saved,edit your inventory and add any item or block you want into your inventory,and you can also copy any seed you want,I recommend this to all minecrafters noob or pro all minecrafters will love this app,I guarantee it.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|One of the best books I've read on the reasons behind the success and failure of political and economic systems to date.<br /><br />The model of the inclusive and extractive is a comprehensive answer to the age old riddle. Perhaps it is accurate and perhaps not, but it is comprehensive and persuasive.<br /><br />The authors' argument against the Chinese model succeeding as is, over the long term, is also well considered.<br /><br />This is a long book but well worth your time and energy.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those serious about understanding why liberalized markets and politics are the way to go...even today.<br /><br />Note: one of the very few books I have given 5 stars to.
0812993845|5.0|I really had fun reading this book. It was hilarious and very touching at the same time. I def recommend it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Downloaded this game to my Kindle fire cause I have always been a manning fan.  This game is fun, challenging and entertaining!  Absolutely recommend this one to always the manning fans out there.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game!  It thrilled by th  adds in between games but suppose they are necessary.<br />Mom likes it and her doc has its good for her brain!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Like other reviewers I found the chapters about life in the orphanage to be difficult but thankfully the author did not dwell on the abuses.  It is difficult for me to imagine that women, who enter religious life with an intent to follow Jesus by serving orphaned children, could be so intentionally cruel.  I was intrigued by Jamie's character and loved the ending.  After finishing the book I was so &#34;into&#34; the characters that I daydreamed how their lives continued with their new relationships.  To me that's the sign of a good book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game. Pretty angry it's making me rebuild my park at lvl 30+ also won't update on my kindle but no problem on android phone.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book is interesting but the plot did not hold my attention like his other books - The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I enjoy Hosseini's writing style immensely but did not feel as involved with the characters in this book.  I did find the comparison between life for ordinary Afghanis before the modern wars began and life after the invasions compelling.  Overall an easy read but not outstanding.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was a little disappointed that I had to wait so long for the 3rd book.  I am hoping the 4th will be sooner.  This is a good fantasy read!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I just don't get all the 4-5 star reviews, the book swings between a husband chapter (real-time), and a missing wife's chapter (personal diary from the past), the wife's chapters are simply put: boring and unbearable. The husband's chapters started ok, but then they smear and smear and after a dozen of them, there is zero progress in the story.<br />I think the 5 star reviewers have never read a good Stephen King book, if they find this book thrilling and suspending. This book put me to sleep almost immediately.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Very very nice.  Hmmm where do I start?  Paul Williams it's so nice to hear you and your work.  Come on everybody that loved the 70s and 80s this is a wonderful mix.<br /> Pharrell Williams sings and brings me back to the day!  I am a music freak.  Everything from Mozart, Talking Heads, Doors, Dolly Parton, Green Day, Trance, House, Electronica, Rap, Jazz etc.  When I first saw the album I thought of DEVO but this is not DEVO.  Daft Punk is a sound unto themselves and very enjoyable it is.<br /><br />My favorites:<br />Giorgio by Moroder. I mean come on!  This is so good!  Giorgio Moroder narrating and then his sound.  Awesome.<br />Touch.  Paul Williams?  Nuff said. Beautiful. Love is the answer hold on.<br />Get Lucky.  They got it lucky all right.  Pharrell nailed it and brought me right back to techno punk.<br />Motherboard.  Smooth.<br />Contact.  Techno at its hardest.  (I watched Eugene Cernan take off in Gemini 9a.)<br /><br />Lounge music?  Hey thats a compliment!  If you go to the \\"lounges\\" I go to don't forget your glow sticks!  Music that is good crosses all age groups, as it should. This is not just for 18 year olds but all of us who can \\"get down and boogie\\".<br />Can you dig it?  I can.  Now let me go smoke a doobie and relax to Daft Punk.
B00006CXSS|5.0|We have seen most of these on TV but wanted the set for ourselves since it is such an excellent series.  I'm not much for blood and guts but I have enjoyed this series, anyway.  The casting and acting are excellent, even for a gal who usually goes for chick flicks and sci fi.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a fantastic read. To my non-profits scientist point of view it was a realistic near future speculation about NASA ingenuity and thinking processes. Every space nerd should read it.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I love Daniel Craig as Bond and will see the next one when it comes out for sure.  Just giving this a 4 because I liked Casino Royale better.  If you haven't seen this before, see it now.  If not just for the theme song.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I picked it up and couldn't put it down until I got to the last word. _The Panther_ is strong on action and even stronger on sense of place....I felt as if I were in Yemen myself. When John Corey is the protagonist, I don't expect deep character development: he's more about being a smart *ss than a lot of introspection. Thanks, Mr. DeMille, for another page-turner!
B000000HHE|5.0|My son-in-law had this on his Christmas list and seemed thrilled when we got it for him.  So.  If you like this group, I guess you will like this.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|It's Schindler's List! Maybe Spielberg's masterpiece. Watch this and American History X for a one day movie marathon education in man's inhumanity to man and the redemptive power of mankind.<br /><br />Then next day watch Munich, also by Spielberg, for a lighter hearted espionage type movie that examines the cost of inhumanity on a man/woman.<br /><br />Or rent Transformers.  It has cool effects.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|My husband had heard about this series which blew me away.  Wow.  A husband hearing of True Blood?  I had already heard great things about it from my hair stylist.  So.  We bought Season 1.  Halfway though watching It, we went ahead and bought seasons 2-5.  That should tell you about how good it is.  Beware, a little kinky and some nudity.  Also some blood, but it's pretty harmless.  If you're even slightly inclined to buy this - GET IT!!!
B007VYAJAE|5.0|...informative, educational and entertaining. with a sad ending. Days later I think back to various scenes from the film. I didn't know what caused his death; how sad.
0060873175|1.0|HUGE Michael Crichton fan here, HUGE. so it pains me to say that this is a terrible, terrible book.  Just leave it alone. Keep the MC you have right now in your mind.  Yes, it's that bad, really.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The movie is well cast. Martin Freeman is perfect as a young Bilbo, and I was glad to see familiar characters from the L.O.T.R. trilogy, like Frodo, old Bilbo, Gandolf, Saruman, and Galadriel, among others. I eagerly anticipate the Hobbit II.
0061914177|3.0|\\"Crush it!\\" is a good and quick read.  The book has a number of good/great ideas and is laid out in easy to understand language.  I really appreciated the appendix.  It laid out all the important aspects of the book.<br />Now the but...It took almost half the book to get to the real content. Appendix a is all I really needed.  Could have saved myself the 4 hours I spent reading the rest of the book and used it to begin implementing the great ideas that are listed...in the appendix.<br />When I recommend this book to others, I will point them to a few chapters and the appendix.  Did I mention that it has a solid appendix?
B000IZ8DZQ|4.0|we greatly enjoyed this movie- took us back to the 60s; the car chase then was spectacular- still looks good as it isnt computer generated;
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I had read the other two books and found them very good,<br />however this book just went nowhere and the ending was<br />nonexistent and very disappointing
B0049985XW|5.0|A story that has to be watched and listened to... lots of good lessons if you can read between the lines = highly recommended; when ordered: got it fast and in mint condiition, would do business with this seller (again and again) Thanks!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I have read all of his novels and this one was a real page-turner with a very surprising end.  Character development was excellent, and drew me into the story like I knew the people.
6305922756|5.0|A story that has to be watched and listened to... took me years before I watched it, then years later to watch it again, funnier with each viewing, now I understand why it it a &#34;classic&#34; = highly recommended; when ordered: got it fast and in mint condiition, would do business with this seller (again and again) Thanks!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Max Brooks does a fantastic job of not writing another stereotypical zombie novel. Rather he examines the social, cultural and religious ramifications that a zombie war would cause.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie...A must see for anyone..Warm, heartwarming. ...Makes you appreciate old folks even more.. Love it!!!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|It's hard to believe a company could make such a fantastic knife and sell it for such a modest price. $50 for a knife that is a 1/4&#34; thick and can take a beating! I would buy this knife over any other the rest of my life!
B0001I561Y|5.0|I loved this DVD set! It has alot of extra's, and not a bad price! A Amazon customer<br />It goes into movie facts that were interesting also! Quick delvry!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very fun game, not overly difficult but does require logic and thinking. Great game for all ages highly recommend!
B00DHMXJUG|5.0|I enjoyed her music since 1999 and still do. this is a good one to get if you enjoy her music.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the most aewsome game awesome just way to cool it is so action packed and adventurous. just way to cool.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids absolutely adore this movie and to be honest, so do their parents! It is a great family movie and a great way to teach your kids about the importance of taking care of our earth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is pretty freaking cool. Being a 15 year old guy , naturally I'm an expert at video games. This fits the criteria all too well. 1: It is dynamic. 2: It is addicting. 3: Can entertain any age ( My dad ,who is 37, plays it, I play it and I just downloaded it only 5 minutes ago, and my little brother plays it,also downloaded it 5 minutes ago, and he's 12.) So that's my review. Well...... what arte you waiting for? Download it! Hurry! Like right now! Do it! :-)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|need more!! ended too fast, when will the next book be out? i am so glad the the stoty didnt stop at 3 books!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The last version was excellent. This new version has the apperance more like a silly child's game.<br />Please bring back the old app! I wont be using this new version, sorry.<br />I'm in agreement with the last several disappointed reviews.<br /> This is NOT better.
0062082353|4.0|This was a very interesting book about the little known work of snipers is the Iraq war. Aside from the colorful language, it was informative and I recommend it. This man defines what 'patriotism' is.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Please tell me there will be pay app that will get rid of the horrendous new format.<br /><br />garish backgrounds, massive and intrusive ads, some kind of stupid childish point system, etc.<br /><br />It will be deleted and I will check occasionally to see if app has been changed.
034580404X|5.0|I bought the set of books and I am almost done with it...I like how fast it was to buy and receive my books very quickly.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I read this before the kite runner and I have to say I preferred this book, it is a story of women in Afghanistan during the wars and the Taliban regime how lives particularly woman's changed overnight. I never thought of Afghanistan having a thriving metropolitan city, all the visions I have see are a war torn country. With khalids writing painting such a beautiful picture and the telling of two women's story with such heartfelt passion. In this day and age it is a book that everyone should read to give you a glimpse into the hard ship of the normal person living during such a turbulent time that unfortunately continues today.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|When are you guys going to create more levels? A lot of fun and a great game to play with a friend. Keep up the good work!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|really enjoyed thinking about what I was doing. kids liked too. we played together. as a family we had a great time playing this game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app has so many versions of the bible right on your phone!<br />I love that you can also listen to the bible in many of the different translations.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />Kevin Fukao
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I find I continually turn to Evernote for jotting quick notes.  New categories are quick and easy to create.  I have not used it for any of the other many possibilities, but I intend to as I explore further.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Liked the plot and story and the characters as well, though there would be a little more sci/fi drama towards the climax but i liked how this eneded.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|Got just the limited Free App to start..but my 3 year old son loved it..very challenging for him.<br />So I got the full version..very worth the $0.99
B00BHU261S|5.0|I love renting on amazon. It's perfect for when you are sick or Netflix doesn't have what you want. I recently had knee surgery and wasn't able to move anywhere. Amazon made it perfect for me to stream movies on my computer.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Can't wait for season 6. You get interesting back stories for some of the side characters in this season, like Espo and Ryan.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I like the construction of the case, it is roomy inside for a DSLR and normal sized lens. There are 2 side pockets that can hold SD cards or lens wipes, and the front pocket has enough room for a shutter remote or extra batteries. The shoulder strap is well padded and comfortable. The only negative is that sometimes with the case loaded up it became top heavy so it wasn't able to stand up straight when placed on the ground.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I have been playing these types of games, since 1980. this one may not be the best but its easiest one to get the hang of but not the easiest one to win. even when you have it you can still lose.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|First off, I love music documentaries. Second, I'm not a huge Foo Fighters fan, but after seeing this it made me one! Before watching this I had no idea the backstory to Fleetwood Mac, but now I do! Great doc on Sound City Studios and love that someone who actually gives a crap about music now owns it!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Not many love musicals, but, I enjoyed this very much. I was surprised that Russel Crowe could sing, and of course, I love Hugh Jackman's movies and I knew, he could sing. I was curious, since I heard good ravings of this musical, and wasn't disappointed watching it. I would recommend to anyone, who loves musical, and the drama this movie portrayed of the French Revolution and of the struggles of the common people.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used this alot until the recent update.  Used to be weather, now it's ads with a little weather getting in the way of the ads.  Uninstalling and finding a different app!
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Wasn't to my expectation. I gave it this rating, because I watched the entire movie. Some other customer may have a better liking, since it does portray storytelling at its' best.....to believe or not to believe.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's simple to use and handy to have on Kindle Fire HD!<br />Buttons are big, so it's easy to speed along typing calculations!<br />Thanks for the great app!
B00947N6D8|5.0|I love it, and the children that I care for, love it also. This is one of the movies that I can watch several times, and whenever I am in the mood. Since they had shown trailers at the big screen, I wanted it for my collection at home. It is a good Children's movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great series by Sylvia Day and I cant wait for the next book to be published.  I read all 3 books within days of getting the first one!  Would highly recommend.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I love movies that Drew Barrymore acts in. I enjoyed the movie, and do watch it on occasion. Also, I like movies based on a true story.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this series. Once I started reading I coudlnt put it down.  Would highly recommend the series and looking forward to the next book coming out.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|This movie was entirely too predictably formulaic.<br />It felt almost like a ' made for tv' movie.<br />The movie never felt like it took the Oz story and made it its' own.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Would highly recommend the series and lookig for to the 4th book that is suppose to be out any day now.  Loved it!
B00A4VGUIG|5.0|It is really fun that you can play with dolphins and you can feed them and do a lot of more  stuff<br />;)
B009CPGHDI|4.0|My boyfriend and I watched it and figured we would get bored and turn it off after a few minutes.<br />But, it was very entertaining and an emotional, inspiring story for me...as a singer/songwriter. :)
1595828753|4.0|This 3 book series is a little slow, but I appreciate the follow-through on the television series I loved so much.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Works as advertised.  Wish app was smaller.  I'm able to open all current MS Office docs with this app now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is good for learning and improving but it is a little hard. But I do like it! You should get it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've been reading romance novels for years, finally caved in and read this one because of all the rave reviews. Personally I have no idea how this is a best seller, I was disappointed in the quality of writing and the over use of the phrase \\"ohh my\\". The first couple of chapters leading into the relationship, and the last were the best in my opinion, these were the only ones that invoked any emotion. The whole middle of the book just had far to many poorly described sex scenes and a protagonist who has absolutely no personality.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great for long road trips and a great activity when I get bored.I really like this game
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Opened the book at 10 last night; read til bleary-eyed. Read more during a break today and finished it tonight! It's not a short book nor is it an easy read -- intensely far from it...But without question it's a page-turner  Read 'Bones'. Wasn't a fan of style or subject matter but thought this was straight from the (broken) heart. Content doesn't get any more real than this.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great series. Fun and should have lasted longer than it did. The network showed unsurpassed idiocy in canceling this now cult classic!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I wish I could ask for a refund. Terrible! I loved the first 2 books,  they were a good story with a decent plot line.  This one however had no story.  How can you write 300 pages and leave the readers feeling less connected to the characters than when they started?
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Unusual plot, engaging characters. Felt like I was watching a real family's story (most of the time). Great rental. Always good to see Robert Deniro.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It is a lot harder than I thought it would be. Especially since it is a free game. I get lost in the rooms and loose track of time. Can't wait for updates.
B002QS1O36|5.0|I would like to start off by saying I love musicals and some movies can pull off an on screen adaption while others can't! This was a beautifully done adaption! While differing in some part a of the broadway version it was wonderful! At first I wasn't fond of Gerard's take on the phantom but as I warmed up to it I saw that he gave us a more vulnerable version of the phantom. And don't even get me started on Emmy because throughout the whole movie I was just trying to figure out how they curled her hair:) she, unlike Gerard who had no previous vocal experience, was trained to play Christine since a young girl. Her notes were flawless and even though most people would argue she is one of my favorite Christines. The sets in this movie were also magnificent ! If you can't tell by now I loved this movie and I listen to the soundtrack every day :) BUY. IT. NOW.
B003YUWALK|5.0|I love these sneakers. They look good and fit well. I have been getting compliments on them and its all positive.<br />We've been getting a lot of rain lately so I haven't worn them as much as I could since I want to keep them clean as long as possible. They also have them in red and I'm looking at buying them too.<br />Their stylish, great color and with all them compliments I'm getting, I'm glad a bought them.<br />Buy em and you'll love em. I did and I do....
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Fantastic movie.  A new twist on an old story.  But some of the language is unbelievable.  I didn't know they had cuss words like that in that time period.  This movie is a keeper.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Held my interest.Love reading fictional stories and learn the culture of a country like Afghanistan. I have read this Author's  other books , starting with Kite Runner.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this show. It has a great mix of drama with a bit of humor thrown in. Can't get enough!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|short story and you have to spend few bucks to play the full  game.i wish it was all free. game graphics was nice
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show. It has a great mix of drama with a bit of humor thrown in. Can't get enough!
B000H7JD4A|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums! Bruce Dickinson's voice is amazing on this album. They have a lot of quality in all of the songs. I think it's one of the best heavy metal albums of all time
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A little slow moving but a nice quiet afternoon movie to watch.  Like the stars that were in it.<br />How relationships when we are young come back to bite you.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Satriani is amazing. Sit comfortably and enjoy this wonderful music. It has 2 or 3 songs that are memorable, the rest of the album is simply spectacular
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Witty, fast-paced, good story, good acting. Love this movie. I use this in my class to illustrate logical fallacies. P.S. LOTS of profanity.
B00AQA94M4|5.0|Excellent album. It has plenty of power and the musical quality of these guys is amazing. No doubt that is to enjoy every day.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Love this CD!  Eliane is a outstanding jazz pianist and vocalist. Outstanding jazz vocalists are generally accomplished jazz pianists, e,g, Diana Krall. Marc's bass playing is wonderful ( he has a lot of chops but is judicious in displaying them) and Randy's trumpet playing is great -  a great tribute to Chet Baker.  Not much more that I can say is that this is one great CD.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|Great album, Timo's voice in this work has improved a lot and the musicians are wonderful. Songs like Unbreakable, Stand my Ground, Halcyon Days make you enjoy the best of the power metal of all time. I was lucky to see them in Uruguay at a show and they were fantastic.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I read the book when it first came out and haven't re-read it before watching the movie and I really enjoyed the movie a lot!! The book is long and drags out in the middle of the story but the movie does well in making it go fast paced. I like the protrayal of the Seeker, in the book it was confusing and in the end she was annoying as her human self. But the movie did it well, Diane Kruger is a great actress! I was excited to see who would be playing Wanda as her new self but Im not a big fan of that actress, don't like her acting. I also was hoping they would show a part in the book where Wanda sees a \\"alien\\" couple with an infant but the infant was left human. I really think this summarized where the invasion was going, in terms of realizing there were more \\"souls\\" out there that really learned to love humans.
0785153942|3.0|I was expecting more from this novel but was dissapointed at the amount of material that was presented in it the novel looks at the prequel to the movie showing a lil bit of story behind how the jaeger's where made but almost not action or scenes with the actual jaeger's or fights are scene in this novel just lil bit of backstory on how the jaeger idea came along and where the characters come from truly dissapointing in alot of aspects
8172238479|4.0|got this book for summer read project  its was many awards and the cover is very different three moe words
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like so awesome.I never get tied of it.it's like for you to learn and have fun at the same time.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Black Sabbath 13 may be the best yet total effort for a compleat<br />Album . If you like Sabbath&Ozzy you will like 13
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun you are a minion competing to win minion of the year the girls try and the guy that makes all the weapons give you missions for you to complete and Victor shows up there's costumes hope this review is helpful
B00C81LYH2|5.0|When I was a child I played with my Barbie everyday, in fact I loved Barbie so much that my parents build me a HUGE Barbie Dream House. This was all many years ago but Barbie has never left my home. My little girls love Barbie and come up with the funniest stories for Barbie and her friends.<br /><br />When Barbie 2013 Holiday Doll arrived I was pleasantly surprised on how much detail her dress has. The photos online do not do her dress any justice. In fact she just sparkles if you move her around. But also don't forget about her beautiful & styled hair! Her quality is also top notch and just what I expect from Barbie. Even though this Barbie is considered a collectors item my girls already have her out of the box and dubbed her Barbie Snow Princess. She has been to many tea parties and even danced with Ken.<br /><br />I recommend this Barbie to any true Barbie fan or just Barbie collector. She is so beautiful but also durable so that if you are like my girls you can have hours of tea time fun. Or if your a collector she is a beautiful addition.<br /><br />She came well packed and the box she is originally in is well made and perfect to shelf for display.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This book was so good I could not put it down. There were so many twist and turns it kept hold of me to the end.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|I've watched this movie a dozen times.  The visual effects are worth watching at least once even if the story plot does not suit your fancy.  Music is nice too.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit ninja its a really good way to get your anger out or if you are bored you automatically get hooked
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I have a weak spot for saving the Earth,or was that just Manhattan?<br />The Hulk's observation of Loki is great.
B006UV8DJS|5.0|I love it I did a photo shoot and I had to to do some photo filtering this works like a charm so awesome
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Love graphic novels of books/shows we're all familiar with and this one is no exception. Would recommend for the great artistry and storyline!
0765348276|4.0|WARNING - SOME SPOILERS.<br /><br />Most \\"sci-fi\\" these days is actually \\"fantasy\\"; this book is the exception. Sci-fi in the tradition of Larry Niven, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein. Enjoyable read ... if you're OK with occasional (well, not so occasional) cussing. Interesting world in which you have the choice to negotiate with your enemies or obliterate them. No wait, you just obliterate them. I'm currently reading the second in this trilogy, \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" and by the end of the trilogy (actually there is a fourth spin-off) I'm expecting this policy to be resolved. We'll see.<br /><br />In Old Man's War the soldiers really are old men and women, given new faster, stronger, immune-to-infection-and-most-injuries and sexier bodies. (Oh, yeah, there is some not-too-graphic sex, so be warned.) Problem is, there's no going back to earth once you join the Colonial Defense Force (CDF)although once you have served your term you have the option of returning to normal human form on one of the dangerous and vulnerable colonies.<br /><br />The \\"science\\" in this \\"science fiction\\" story seems to this lay-scientist to be quite plausible, particularly the description of the \\"skip drive\\". Scalzi gets round many of the problems associated with interstellar travel in ways that no other writer--to my knowledge at least--has attempted.<br /><br />Scalzi has a compelling and engaging writing style, and a great imagination. Some have compared this book to Heinlein's Starship Troopers, but I have to admit, I liked this more. This is Scalzi's first novel, and I gave 4 stars because I think his writing style needs some maturing, and based on my initial impression of the second in this trilogy, I think this is definitely happening. Definitely keeping a close watch on Scalzi's future work.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its a great game and I love it! No doubt about that! But the only reason it's four stars is because the game doesn't update NEARLY as quick as the ios version. Hope this helped someone.
B003G4W49C|1.0|A good friend loves these books and suggested it to me but it wasn't for me.  More for kids, too repetitive for adults.  I was bored and couldn't finish it.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This movie was so much fun to watch, especially with the kids.  Full of youthful adventure, humor and suspense. We all loved it.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I like a basic watch, simple and functional, but that doesn't look cheap. THis is that watch. I like the automatic feature and the way it looks. I have had some issues with the band popping off when I turn my wrist at an angle, so  did not give it five stars. I have fairly thick wrists so this is not the only watch I have had this problem with, but it is still an irritation. Also, if you look closely you can see that rather than regular numbers (1-12) on the watch face, the numbers ascend by 5's (5-10-15.....) to 55, which is a little odd. The month and day is also a little finikey and hard to set. Despite these small issues, I liked the watch enough at the price that I bought a second one in black.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I had to watch it again as the 2nd is coming soon. Love it. Recommend to everyone who likes funny!
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|The first season of Boardwalk Empire left me hanging, so I couldn't wait to get the second season. I have to say that the second season did not disappoint! You continue to &#34;bond&#34; with the characters, but plot twists continue to change the way that you feel about each character.
B0064MGU98|5.0|A great cast and great writing make for a fascinating show with layers and layers of story.  Satisfying and compelling.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I expected AHS to be similar to the first season as far as the supernatural goes. I thought that it would be so cool because now it's at an asylum! I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I bought the entire season expecting it to be similar to the original, so I kinda had to force myself to watch the rest of it to get my moneys worth. I was nearly half-way though the season until I became interested. It's not something I would recommend if you're expecting something similar to the original AHS, but it isn't a terrible show.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|I usually don't watch movies have watched this one three times and have purchased it to watch it some more.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I grew up reading the comics of each of these superheroes. At first I was a bit skeptical about it thinking that it would be too &#34;childish&#34; for me to watch, but I was definitely wrong! The movie was funny, action packed, and the plot was interesting as well. I would definitely recommend it!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I have always been a Kanye fan and this did not disappoint, I enjoy this album from beginning to end :)
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Beautifully observed piece about the perversions of power and the delusion of order. Disconnections at the point where connections are usually taken for granted: between father and child, wife and husband, employer and employee.<br /><br />Children provide clarity. Sometimes that clarity crosses lines which can only be described as love. Sometimes it can be insane. The tone of passivity is so well rendered by the director. It is the background to an apocalypse.<br /><br />The difference between [[ASIN:B0009ZE944 Heimat - A Chronicle of Germany]] and The White Ribbon is one of evil visited upon and evil from within. Heimat portrayed events coming from outside whereas The White Ribbon has a community debased from its own breath.<br /><br />Ignorance is part of the landscape. Brutality the only answer. Communication broken down beneath the weight of servile expectation. The message as strongly, as vividly expressed as the starkness of the film makers' palate. Top marks. Highly recommended.
B004B8DH98|3.0|This film tries really hard to be an interesting Euro art film. Maybe it is and I'm too much of an American to appreciate it that way. Predictable, humorless and missing the requisite appreciation for the bizarre and ironic twists and turns life often takes which would lift it out of banality, it was precious, pretentious and depressing. As always, George Clooney looks amazing, but his wooden, petulant performance is a real drag. Beautiful people and locations beautifully photographed aren't enough to make this film worth watching. Do so if there is absolutely nothing else on or available and you must see a George Clooney film... otherwise, meh....
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I can`t believe I wasted all this time &amp; some money on this game only to loose it with a bugged update.
1476734941|5.0|This book presents a pattern of &#34;fasting,&#34; i.e., eating very lightly, on two days of the week and eating normally on the remaining days.  It doesn't require constant calorie counting or feeling very deprived, while you continue to lose weight.  It includes scientific evidence to support its effectiveness and health benefits.  I lost 11 pounds, and i am maintaining my new weight of 115 pounds by observing one &#34;fast&#34; day per week.  I always know that I can return to the 2 day regimen if I gain too much.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Batman Begins is very good.  The Dark Knight is exceptional.  The Dark Knight Rises I thought was mediocre.  I still think it is a great trilogy and one of the few I own on Blu-Ray.  Every time they are on TV I watch them so I figured I might as well have them on Blu-Ray so I don't have to sit through commercials.  Price was right to purchase these.  Picture quality is great and the box is just the right size to store.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A great book, written by even a greater writer.  This book puts you in charge of your future.  Don't rely on anyone else to take care of you, because you are the only one who can plan out a roadmap for your future.  I just finished my first reading, and I will immediately read this book again and again just to reinforce the many tips on making one a better person.  It's not about money - it's about success and the many pitfalls one may go through, to achieve in life.  I'm 66 years old, and I wish I had this book when I was 20.  Remember, you and only you can make your life a success.  James Altucher has been through it all from a millionaire, to almost living on the street, back to a millionaire, and he says it's not about the money, it's about what you love to do.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun and basic battle system. I do enjoy playing but I would not buy from this game as you don't get hardly anything for your money.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Great book just the wrong way to end it. Why make us wait for another book. Not even knowing what the name of it will be
B0027MJU00|4.0|Whilst not as clever as Gone Girl, this story still winds and weaves with a number of plot twists that ensure you don't want to put it down.
1400069289|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the way it dives into the understanding why people do things and what provokes them to have habits or act on impulse.  I understand TV commercials and the Que that makes me react.  good read.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This collection is great. Led Zeppelin is the one group that I just love. Too have this Edition is too love.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|This case is a good bargin for the price.and I would recommend it to anyone.Here are five more words to make this complete.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|If you loved Bee Gees songs, you will this collection. I know I did. Even if you do not like all it is worth the cost.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is incredible!! A quick read and a great story about an American hero. You should take the time to read it
B0000DZU4U|5.0|I have always liked this album and will continue to do so.  I know it's the remaining tracks from the &#34;Rock and Roll Animal&#34; show that didn't appear on that particular album, so buy &#34;Rock and Roll Animal&#34; and this CD and you have a complete Lou Reed concert from back in the day when Steve hunter and Dick Wagner were totally shredding on guitar with Lou Reed as the singer, in my opinion the best era of Lou Reed EVER!  Granted I like most all of Lou Reeds output, but these two CD's are my faves.... ok, so I really liked &#34;Sally Can't Dance&#34; and &#34;New York&#34; and &#34;Coney Island Baby&#34; to name a select few of my other faves by Lou, but I think you get the gist.
B009FA98JU|5.0|This adapter works perfectly and just exactly as advertised. I'm using it to connect my MacBook Air to an older PC monitor and I can't attest to the quality of the connection because the monitor isn't the best, but I got the extra screen space I needed.
B006JD48NM|4.0|very well done, would recommend it to all racing lovers, well worth the money, shipped very quickly. movie scenes are spectacular.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|I loved Joe Walsh in the '70's his voice and his lyrics!  Today's JW sounds GREAT and his songs about his life struggles and new happiness are wonderful.  Loved this album from beginning to end!!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great show, I wish they hadn't canceled it.  There were so many story lines that needed to be completed and to add insult to injury they canceled it to make room for wrestling.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|At times a bit contrived but, overall, a grand old show.  Flows well just like a good book.  Like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only thing that I wish was in minecraft is a enchantment table also you can have eggs and be able to make iron and snow bloomed.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|If there's anything you DO read this summer, this book ought to be it.  It's a beaut!  A great storyline combined with incredible writing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn's unique combination first person narrative was quite enjoyable for me. I liked the plot twists and the \\"character\\" twists in this novel.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|This is little more than a collection of &#34;War&#34; stories, and poorly told ones at that. The only life in this book is the part his wife wrote and it is not fleshed out. This was little more than the authors attempt at making a few bucks on his life's story before anyone else did, and in so doing his life is diminished.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I downloaded this app for my wife before I purchased a tablet for her. Since I'm not much of a Facebook fan I'm not rating it very high, but it does what I need it to do.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some are easy some are hard. No directions but once you figure it out it addictive.<br />Definitely worth the effort of downloading.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I'm still trying out this app and I'm not fining it to be very user friendly. The note taking is ok, navigating around is a bit cumbersome.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I love how easy it was to read and navigate the book. I read it from front to back, but my husband is not much of a reader and it was easier for him to take the test and read the chapters that pertained to our relationship. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed this season so much better than season 2 of Downton Abbey!  So much fun and so entertaining to watch...
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This was a gift for my mom.  She loves it!  It has all the songs she loves from the movie.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I think this is the most fun I've had in years (which probably doesn't say much for my marriage, huh?  Oops, hope my husband doesn't read this...) - this is fast-paced, easy to do, and so entertaining - I can't put it down!  And I like winning every time...
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Some of the set ups are challenging, and others are very easy.  I am usually a word game person, but this works for me.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This is the fastest, most fun and most frustrating game out there. I'm 70 and can't quit playing.  Time flies!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|This was a waste of space for me as I do not have, nor want a Facebook account.  How can I delete it?
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was disappointed how this book ended. It left me hanging. I waited all that time for book 3 for it to drop the bomb on me! Don't get me wrong it was a good read. The great part is that there will be a book four. I won't spoil it for you!
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a  fictional exploration of the end of the world by the hand of man. It is Kurt Vonnegut's satirical theme of the failures of man that really makes this book stand out from others. It has an odd element to it and has a lot of underlying themes that are hidden in its chapters. It is a great book by an author that was kooky, cool and a genuine writer of his time. R.I.P Mr. Vonnegut!! Thank you for your contribution to this world!!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|it's great I've been looking for this for years at a good price and in good condition so thank you
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book is better but I think the author does a good job continuing the story. It is odd with Katniss' feelings being more thoroughly written out, but overall I still find her character believable. Looking forward to start the third one now.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie but the books were better for sure. See the move but read the books first. Get the movie on Amazon for the best price.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Multiple compelling story lines in each social class that live in Downton Abbey.  Who would have thought that a footman's status could depend on whether or not he serves the meat or the gravy.  Fine details and heartbreaking situations.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|It was very interesting and I usually like John Grisham no matter<br />what.  It wasn't quite as spellbinding as some but it was still<br />an enjoyable read.
B0014DQSGW|4.0|I like almost everything Sandra Bullock is in. This was a good combination of purpose and humor. I've seen it twice.
B00C061I3K|4.0|i could be classic, in a couple of years, only two or three songs are just ok, but the entry albumn is very nice.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|While not as good as the Phantom it continues the story with lovely music and good acting and singing.The actors look their parts.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm loving this app...just keeps me guessing and engaged. Shame there are only a few levels at the moment. Keep up the good work. Can't wait for more.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is a gala performance that anyone would enjoy.Ramin Karimloo makes a grear phantom.The extras at the end are interesting.
1434441636|5.0|I bought this book for myself and we recently had a loss in the family.  My husband picked up the book and he says it is helping him move through his grief in a way he hadn't thought of before.  He is so grateful that I bought this book.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Loved every second of it.  One of my favorite Daft Punk albums.  My favorite song on the album is probably Instant Crush.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i like it. it is just tricky enough to keep it interesting. please update the game with more levels. good job!
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|One of Jack Nicholson's best roles. Burton really did do an amazing job on this. I think Keaton was like his Depp for the early 90's there.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|ugh!!! what's up with the update??? it tells me the version is to old and need to update. however, there is no option to update.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is epic! It's multiplayer is fun and its campaign was actual involving. You will have no problem finding multiplayer match. The custom classes have plenty of weapons and plenty of attachments. Best fps for tablets so far!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If you liked Where Men Win Glory, Unbroken, etc. then you will love this book. Truly an incredible story. And very well written!
0143118706|2.0|I was disappointed in Gilbert's sequel.  The flow was boring and couldn't hold my interest.  The book itself was in great codition and I donated it to the local library.
1475167547|1.0|Yep . . . this is the bowdlerized 1831 text. This is the second edition I've found claiming to be the 1818 text and it turned out to be the 1831 text...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It was a pleasure to sit for hours and re-watch the whole series.  I also have the first two seasons, it will be great amusement in the years to come to watch over and over again.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|setting aside the fact that the book originally stated it would be a trilogy NOT a series and suddenly changed to a 5 book series, I was VERY let down. No character development seen with the main characters in instead the book focuses more on the secondary character lives and back story with eva and gideon having thrown in the mix. What sex trafficking and the russian mob will have to do everything not sure....and the so called ending. I cant believe I waited so long for this book to be released, only to find out it was sooo horribly written. Dont think I'll be continuing with Silvia Day
B0000CFW87|3.0|I could listen to Josh Groban all day long, but I wasn't crazy about the selections so I gave the CD to a friend of mine.
B00ATK02WM|5.0|I much prefer this version of Les Miserables to the new musical. The characters are draw you in to the story.
B0042816YK|5.0|I could watch it over again. I  l love Julia Roberts in almost everything she does and this is no exception.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I cant wait for the next one. This game made wasting my life worth while. I think i staved off dementia by at least one year.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|game says i need to update, when i go to app store only option is to open version i already have! where is update????
B003EY7IRC|4.0|So a lot happens in this conclusion of the Fever series (well conclusion for now..).<br />Mac thinks she loses someone she wasn't even sure she cared about. Now she realizes that this person means a lot more to her than she's willing to admit.<br />And she goes all \\"hulk\\" on the world. She's going to do everything she can to get that book to make life different so she can have that person back again.<br /><br />Later on Mac learns a lot about the person she realizes she loved. A lot more she never thought possible. I don't want to give anything away, but I am seriously so glad with what happened between Mac and this \\"person.\\"<br /><br />Anyways, overall it was a very good ending to this book. It leaves it open to wear there could be other books later on, or there could be a spin off series, which I do believe there is one.  And almost all of your questions are answered about Mac, and Barrons, and everyone else. Well almost everyone else. There are still a few things we don't know. But  otherwise I really enjoyed this book. I am extremely happy with it, and I highly recommend this series.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|What was true about teenage life almost 30 years ago still rings true. Had to 're watch it after seeing Pitch Perfect.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I was told this was not a &#34;chick flick&#34; and that it was very good.  While I disagree with the first item (no car chases, no explosions, a touching love story) I don't disagree with the second.  It was a very good movie, and both the principal actors were outstanding!
B0064MGU98|3.0|I think that this is a good drama with interesting and likable characters.  There's lots of intrigue in the story lines, and the writers do a nice job revealing and developing the characters, and their relationships to each other.  The quality of the acting is high.<br /><br />I give it only four stars, however, because the courtroom scenes are pretty ludicrous.  I'm an attorney who has spent considerable time in hearings and trials, and the courtroom scenes always make me roll my eyes.  I don't understand why the writers felt that they had to make every judge a biased, neurotic jerk.  In every trial, there has to be a big &#34;gotcha&#34; moment with a key witness (who they often discover only hours before putting him/her on the stand). I know that they have to add drama to make the courtroom stuff more interesting, but it's hard for me to watch.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I haven't even finished the book yet, but cut out wheat and gluten 3 weeks ago and feel so much better already. I have more energy, a stronger sense of well being and mood elevation, less cravings, and am clear headed and more focused. I have tried a couple of recipes from the book including the Banana Blueberry muffins and they are amazing! I am continuing to read the book and not planning to add wheat back to my diet!
B001N18HOQ|5.0|The best group ever, and the best period of them....<br />next step is to find the dvd from Pink Pop 90's...
B008C20TDG|5.0|This is probably the best diet/ healthy lifestyle book I've ever read.  They don't say do these things because we're telling you to,  they come with all the science to back up why.  Plus there are clear guides on what's good or not plus some good recipes.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|If you like HBOs &#34;Rome&#34; story line and the filming style of &#34;the 300&#34;, then Spartacus is for you. RIP Andy Whitfield.....
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved it got it a week ago just finished it<br />I will say it one more time amazing  book
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great! Thanks HBO. Another awesome TV show that I can't stop watching..... I'm Hooked, now hurry up with a new season.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|This one is a hit with me, good acting, good plot and it really keeps you on the edge. I look forward to the next season
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with this series! The love Gideon and Eva have for each other is amazing!!! I def recommend this book to everyone!
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|This is RoboCop on steroids! As I watched this advance screener, I mentally scanned my Thesaurus for words that could describe these robots: Herculean, massive, enormous, gargantuan, stupendous, vast, humongus... Do you get the idea? I live on the eighth floor of my downtown condominium and these behemoths (there's another!) would have to stoop to look in my living room!<br /><br />Earth has been attacked by gigantic monsters who come out of a volcanic rift in the Pacific Ocean. Humankind is helpless to ward them off and the end of the world (as we know it) is fast approaching. Only a handful of now-obsolete Jaegers (Hunters) offer any promise of hope, but each one requires two (2!) compatible operators to make it work.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro directed this action-filled (with Computer Generated Imaging) PG-13 Sci-Fi actioner. This is targeted specifically for fans of Sci-Fi actioners and last night, they were entertained! In addition, del Toro included clever bits for the rest of us, like tasteful pretend water drops splashed against a pretend lens, plus subliminal hints of other movies.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Idris Elba (\\"The Wire\\") his rallying cry to his troops is Shakespearean, but we worry about his health. He has only two rules: One, you do not touch me. Two, you do not touch me.<br />  * Charlie Hunnam (\\"Sons of Anarchy\\") is one of the last Jaeger operators.<br />  * Ron Perlman (\\"Drive\\") gets the final word, wait for it! And check out those chuntaros (fancy Mexican shoes with extra long, pointed toes.)<br />  * Max Martini (Lots, and lots, and LOTS of TV) is a veteran in the Jaeger unit.<br />  * Robert Kazinsky (\\"Red Tails\\") is an egotistical S.O.B. with daddy issues, according to his commanding officer.<br />  * Charlie Day (\\"Horrible Bosses\\") provides half of the comic relief (and some science) for this doom-laden plot.<br />  * Burn Gorman (\\"Game of Thrones\\") is the other half of the comic relief.<br />  * Rinko Kikuchi (\\"Sideways\\") providesthe estrogen for this testosterone-soaked story.<br /><br />As a non-fan of CGI, this became a bit of an endurance test for me (131 minutes), but there were delicious bits of humor and the interaction of the humans was mostly believable (unlike the moment when one of the monsters sprouted wings and gales of laughter erupted from the advance screening audience).<br /><br />The visual effects are overwhelming. There is hardly any profanity, there are no kisses or sweaty bodies and very little blowie uppie stuff, but endless mayhem as CGI monsters whale the tar out of one another. Whew! Amazon will notify me when the DVD becomes available.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I was caught with the first episode.  I just really enjoy the dialogue and the story line.  If I were going to be a lawyer, I would be Harvey. :-)
B00170MYIS|5.0|All 3 of my daughters each have Sony cameras.  These batteries work well and hold a charge.  They are priced competively and arrived quickly from seller.  I would not hesitate to buy this product or from this seller again.
B005H9B44A|3.0|It was ver dark an was difficult to see on Ipad. The move itself was slow moving at first. Worth watching if it's free. Glad I didi not spend the money to see it in a theater.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is so addictive!!  I have it on all my computer,s and my kindle too!<br />Try it, you will love it too! :)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I like that the story evolves the way it does - But believe it or not you DO start to get tired of all the sex scenes that all sound the same... very predictable - nothing evolves much there.... It's like:  &#34;blah blah blah&#34; skim over it and on to the next page.  I guess she put that in there for people that were expecting it.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Straightforward, funny and to the point! Just like Bordain. Can't read anything else written by him. You won't be disappointed!
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Yossi takes a story from 10 years ago and doesn't just add to it, it builds on it.<br />Excellent film and the cinematography is beautiful.
0545128285|4.0|nice to have as addition to Harry Potter book collection, but some stories were not quite as good as I had hoped.  would have liked a little more of something.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Love the new album and can't stop listening! I always buy music on itunes but I have to have the CD when it comes to Mr. Bocelli!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It's is sooo fun. I can't stop playing it. I never get board now. I play it wen I'm out or just with friend's, as they get into it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book it was fun thrilling and it made you feel like you were there I recommend this book for adults or kids that love sci-fi with action
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Truly I am enjoying this SciFi series!  I wish we had a 6th season for sure!  Love Amazon Prime Instant Video!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was expecting this to be the last book. So I was expecting an ending. No such luck. I loved the 2 previous books, but may be done with this series. I don't want to be strung along. The story is getting very repetitive and the characters have stopped evolving.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|IT IS SUCH A AWESOME GAME!!!!!! It's funny because how the minions fight over being the MINION of the year
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My daughter had given up on math, decided she couldn't do it. We bought the game and didn't tell her what it was. I started playing it, then she wanted to play. When she reached the end the screen said, &#34;You master the basics of Algebra!&#34; and she said, &#34; Wait. That was school?&#34; Aha! Sneaky-schooling strikes again. Now she's going back through on the Bonus level and loving every minute of it.<br /><br />There are a couple of points where an instruction is lacking, but would be helpful. Maybe some hints, but we've all been able to pass every level with three stars (eventually).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is overall fun and is worth it. The downloading time isn't that bad either. The game is also easy to control.
B008BQLH52|5.0|Sure the premise has a couple of holes, like does Pearson-Hardman even have a HR dept?....but the story lines are very entertaining, and the banter between characters is witty and fun.....and the women on this show are all hot, with great body language....watched the two seasons in 4 days, and am awaiting Season 3...they better not pull the plug on this one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is an awesome game that is fun for all ages. it is really easy to play and you will not regret downloading it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The is ber awesome. the is very fun my sister loves it so much when we are in the car she plays it. My sister plays it every day.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Entertaining but short. Wish it was longer and frustrated with games being advertised as free when they are not :-(
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia, you have done it again.  This is definitely your best book yet.  Gideon and Eva needed this.  I can't wait to see what is next for them.  I am so totally addicted to these two characters!!!!!!!!  Keep em coming.
B002PNER9U|5.0|I absolutely LOVED Rent. If you're looking to watch the best movie ever, Rent is for you. It is AWESOME!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|One of my first downloads to my new kindle. It came highly recommended to me so I decided why not. I thought it was a great book. Kind of reminded me of that movie \\"The Island\\". The author has a unique style of writing. I may check out his other works as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever I don't see herobrine tough and I want the seed but I don't know what it is but I still give it 5 stars :)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Better than subway surfers and temple run!  Subway surfers or temple run cannot compete with this game. It is great fun
B002NZK5TG|5.0|good for adults, kids may need adult supervision on this, as it's about A plant that needs blood for nourishment, but, it's still A cute movie, I highly recommend it
B008BU75IQ|3.0|If you love English government you may enjoy this. Jeffrey Archer certainly does and it shows in this  third novel..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the graphics and the movie the minions are so lifelike but their arms look a little weird but don't mind that! get this app now! you'll regret it if you don't get it
B000002MJC|5.0|They start to experiment with more guitars and have a heavier sound. It bangs and clangs and echoes...I love it
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Amazing show, good quality playback.  Barely any lag.  Overall, my Amazon instant video experience was very good.  I will use this in the future.
0937381888|5.0|Even if you're only a beer fanatic and not an actual beer producer, you'll love this book. The author approaches everything as if you know absolutely nothing about brewing and speaks extremely concisely, packing tons of information into very little space. I really enjoyed this book, definitely one of the best-written textbooks I've ever seen.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Bearing in mind that the writers took some artistic license, the movie was suspenseful, well written and well made. Ben Affleck did a fine job. A must watch.
B0011Z51QG|4.0|If Michael Jackson was the 'King of Pop', Prince with the 'Prince of Pop'! Fun album, fun to go back to the 80's
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|And I especially like that I can watch it at any time on my new Kindle Fire HD. That's amazing.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Next to Rock -n- Roll Jesus, this is probably my favorite album. Has a 'country' feel to it, but still Kid Rock. What a great Artist!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Always fun to spend time with John Corey, but this story is meandering and talky, with most of the action reserved for the last quarter. No surprises and what are supposed to be surprises can be seen coming a long way off. DeMille brings together two of his most famous characters and adds a few new memorable cast members to his stock company, setting us up, no doubt, for the next book.<br />Seems like a draft sometimes, not to mention the plot does all sorts of suspension of disbelief contortions to get Corey and his wife to Yemen. At one point DeMille begins what seems like a slow build up to a big action sequence, then the whole thing is completely forgotten and we are off on another tangent. Was a little bit torn about the villain. While I have tired of super villain, Hannibal Lector I-am-always-one-step-ahead-of-you types, this guy just seems like a loser. No one seems to have much respect for him, including his followers, so why should I?
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|One of the best stories I've read. Makes you wonder just what reality is or can be. Can't wait to read the next in the series.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This was an enjoyable book and a quick read. A little too Harry Potter-esque for my liking. I was expecting more adult themes; but I guess that's what I get for deciding to read a book based on a 1 minute movie trailer.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|Really like this soundtrack. There aren't really any songs I don't like on it. The highlights are definitely Lana del Rey, Florence + the Machine, and Beyonce's cover of Back to Black.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I could not put it down!  Hands down his best book yet. I loved Angles & Demons and The Davinci Code but this tops them!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I would give this app a five star rating but it needs to update. I've played the Xbox version and the animals will follow you and there are wolves that will become your pets.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Started playing it yesterday. Tried to stop but it's a lot of fun. The graphics were great. I recommend it for all ages
B0084B5TK8|5.0|i loved it but it was a bit sexist and hard to follow as it is all in diary entries. for a free book it is a great thing to have.
