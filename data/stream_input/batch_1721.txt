1849161577|5.0|Great book.  What is written should be recommended by doctors.  Exercise does give you a high as long as your heart rate is up.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|A delightful coming of age movie with an all star cast and an all star script. This is one of those movies that really takes it home for those who felt they were oddballs growing up.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I do really like this case cover for my Fire but I only gave it 4 stars for one reason...I also like to lie in bed and read and holding the Fire is awkward with this case.  Sometimes when I'm holding it and move a bit the case flips \\"open\\" and throws off my Fire and the direction of my screen changes with the motion.  I also have discovered I hold my Fire most of the time and have rarely used the stand.  With all that said, if you really want a case where you can stand it up on a desk or counter this is a great case to have.  I just didn't think through the way I would use my Kindle Fire most of the time.  I would recommend it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Absolutely lost an entire weekend because I couldn't put it down. Even though at times I thought I had it figured out, there was always a twist that made me wonder...and keep reading.  Great book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|never have issues....game goes on and on....really like it!  Especially great for gamers seeking objects.  with challenges. never boring, great fun, kills time.
0425263916|5.0|i thought that the second part was better than the first...it really showed you how much Gideon really loved Eva..what lengths he would go to protect her
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy the game. my only gripe would be the amount of time it takes to get energy. but otherwise fun game.
0425263908|5.0|i absolutely loved this book,i think it was a little better than 50 shades..cant wait til i get to read the next one.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I was happily shocked and impressed with how this movie brought together a great twist on history, action and horror. Highly imaginative. Great action sequences. The wild horse stampede chase scene was fantastic and unlike anything I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies at my ripe age. This is well worth a rental, IMO. There are reviews on here that are far better than mine and trust that it is well above average when you see this many raving reviews.
B007N31YH0|5.0|I had to watch this movie with my grandpa, he said he cant belive that it is on dvd, well just to do him a favor, i watched it, because i really dont like \\"old\\" movies but this one WOW l loved it so mutch that i had to buy it! The Comedy's from today are nothing compared to that ! EXCELENT !
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case for the Kindle is a good buy so you can carry it in your purse and not scratch the screen.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson fans will not be displeased. Wonderful story-line, great cast, perfect cinematography, What else can you say?  His movies just get better and better.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Took my picture right away, I don't need pictures of me so how do I delete it?<br />I would defenitely like some more instructions.
B000JQV68A|4.0|I gave it a four star rating. Fitzgerald is sometimes a reflexion of his characters. His characters are very alive.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|If you're a fan if the show but haven't read the comics you don't know what you're missing. I read these as they came out and now I'm rereading through the tpb's.  Great writing and art.  Kirk man is at the top if the zombie heap with Romero and Brooks. So good!

B008Q09K2U|1.0|I have been a fan of Nelson Demille's for many years, having read all of his books as they were published and I looked forward to more publications.  I was very disappointed with this effort from him.  It was puerile, with almost every sentence followed by a comment from the 'hero' which tried to be funny, & didn't quite make it. Demille portrayed J Corey's wife as being a bit of a bimbo, unlike how she was portrayed in his previous books.  The story-line was OK, but completely ruined by the numerous trite comments & sentence endings.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Lion;  it's a pity this book is not of the same calibre.
B007704HO6|5.0|This book is one of the best heart warming, real life story, of struggle and coming out the other side recommend to everyone.
1423113462|5.0|This is a great book and it arrived in excellent condition and very promptly. I am happy to have this book in my library.
B005HE5J7I|3.0|I had read and enjoyed Rutherford's Russka and Sarem, and I looked forward to a similar experience with London.  But I think this one fell short.  Although we worked through the stages of history, relating appropriate events to London's progress, there didn't seem to be a destination.  I enjoy historical fiction, but I need a stronger thread and ultimately a sense of accomplishment.  This one didn't have it for me.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is the first kindle book I have purchased. I am satisfied so far. Thanks for having it in stock.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Note: I will not say much about the plot here. If you really want to know, it's easy to find out. But I believe you will enjoy the movie more without knowing what will happen, especially what happens leading up to the showdown at Skyfall - you do NOT even want to know in advance WHO IS THERE at Skyfall, trust me, or you will miss some of the emotional punch. So here goes ...<br /><br />My first impression, right after the movie: not enough spectacle.<br /><br />The opening chase was pretty good, but otherwise there's not much in the way of thrills in the middle apart from a couple of brief scuffles (and a poorly-chosen mode of vertical travel). The action is not that interesting, but thankfully it is not shot in the idiotically shaky \\"Bourne-camera\\" mode. And there is a ridiculous thing involving a, uh, diverted train, which doesn't really add much. The finale is a mixed bag - more complexity would have been nice, but it's interesting because Bond is preposterously outgunned.<br /><br />But a little later it sinks in: this is not the heart of the movie. Yes, surprisingly, it's about heart.<br /><br />This movie is about depth, in more ways than one. It is about creating and experiencing a deeper, emotional connection with the characters, especially Bond. And in this it truly succeeds. You feel for the poor guy, from his opening plunge, through his feelings of betrayal and duty, and to the deep, terrible loss that is embodied in one of the movie's most important characters, Skyfall Lodge - Bond's childhood home. It is a genuinely moving, touching, darker and deeper Bond. When I watch it again, it will be for those moments.<br /><br />Everyone is top-notch - Bond, M, the new Q, and of course Silva, played by Javier Bardem as a strangely sympathetic monster you can't stop watching. His meetings with Bond seem anticlimactic, and their final face-off not too satisfying, but his connection to M is well-played, disturbing and affecting.<br /><br />M has a greater role here, explored in more depth - the hard calls she has to make, her connection (such as it is) with her agents, and her dedication. Her hard-nosedness and her professional and physical vulnerability are nicely juxtaposed. One of the most moving moments is her quoting Tennyson -<br /><br />Though much is taken, much abides; and though<br />We are not now that strength which in old days<br />Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br />One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br />Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br />To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.<br /><br />- while we see Bond, a broken and betrayed Bond, a seemingly outdated relic, rushing to save her. It is quite a powerful moment, one that you will want to see again.<br /><br />At the end, the movie takes an unexpected turn which ties it into the whole Bond mythology. Although tinged with sadness, fans will rejoice.<br /><br />The title song, which seemed weak and forgettable on first listen (before seeing the movie), turns out to suit the movie quite well along with the brooding visuals of the opening credits. Both take on more meaning and emotional wallop after having viewed the movie, and I find I could watch them again and again:<br /><br />Let the sky fall<br />When it crumbles<br />We will stand tall<br />Face it all together<br /><br />That last line really hits home, in the context of the finale.<br /><br />So - I wish there were more spectacular action. The middle drags a bit. But it is compelling and engaging on an emotional level, giving us a Bond we can feel for and even cheer on., explored in more depth - the hard calls she has to make, her connection (such as it is) with her agents, and her dedication.

0143118706|1.0|I found this book wearisome - nothing like its predecessor.  I skipped more pages than I read.  It's more a course in psychology than an interesting story.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I recently got this app for $3.00. It was fun. After I defeated the first 2 worlds I saw their was a third after &quot; wait for more updates&quot; I played the first level. Then it said if I wanted to continue I had to pay $2.00 more !!! So angry birds goes around giving them a $3.00 game then charging them $2.00 extra can you believe this garbage!!! That is $5.00 for 1 app just 1! &gt;:(
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|easy to use, useful and free. I love it. it links with your computer tablet, etc. helps keep me organized.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|An entertaining read.  DeMille places John Corey in another encounter with a terrorist - this time in Yemen. DeMille combines the fictional narrative with some history and geography and introduces another interesting CIA operative.
B008MM9630|3.0|I haven't been able to access my game for over 2 wks. sent email, still no reply.  please help, all it does is cycle the loading screen many times.
B005F96URI|5.0|In an amalgam of samurai film, spaghetti western and chop socky and using a stylish blend of neo-noir, German expressionism and Russian futurism.<br />the most interesting movie ever.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Such a great angry birds game!  I have all the others and by far, this is the best.  Love three light saber for the&quot;luke&quot; bird and the ray gun for the &quot;han solo&quot; bird!  I had a hard time putting this one down.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Homeland stylishly fills part of the void left by the end of 24.  Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin are superb.  Frankly when Mandy ran out on Criminal Minds saying he couldn't stand the violence, I didn't expect him to be back on TV ever especially on a show about the CIA and terrorists.  Claire Danes is so manic-depressive in her role that sometimes it's a bit aggravating to watch but overall she's fine.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I don't have the habit of reviewing free apps of the day, but this app is the simplest and straight forward chess game you could want. Plenty of options to choose from that make the game very nice. Didn't encounter any bugs up till now. If there's one thing missing that's playing scenarios. Took me 2 hours to beat the game at level 10, so i guess it's pretty hard, at least for my knowledge skills. Best chess game I've tried up till now.
076115678X|5.0|I love the book it showed me how to manage and wash my curly hair.  I also bought diva curl product which I adore. give 5 stars for this book.
B0039PPW60|5.0|I can't possibly understand any of the negative reviews, I have used this board on a daily basis for about a year now and have had NO PROBLEMS with it. It has been through live stage productions as well, all channels, 4 phantom powered mics with pretty heavy amp up and it performed exceptionally well. The effect processing is cool and the alt 3-4 is very useful(for those that don't know what alt 3-4 is, it is an output that comes from your muted tracks). Aux 1 has pre OR post fader settings, very useful. Some things I would like to see: USB volume control(available on more expensive models), gain for stereo tracks, control room unity setting, off switch for effect processor(constant orange glow even when i'm not using the effects).
1423140605|5.0|I'm a huge Rick Riordan fan, and this series may be my favorite of all. Can't wait for the next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have mc on my PC and its awesome and I have wanted minecraft on the kindle fire for EVER! I think its really good I prefer it on the Pc but if I'm on the go I like to pull it up its such a great game OMG!Get the app its worth the money trust me its cheaper then on the Pc ENJOY!!!!!!!
B009GYSQV6|5.0|This album really blew me away. Crystal Castles fans will definitely find something to like about this album. No fillers, every track stands it's own ground. One of the best albums of 2012. Absolutely brilliant.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I read this book with a group dedicated to continuing spirituality in our lives as physicians, photographer, community organizer, parents of high schoolers. The four agreements provide guideposts for figuring out what you believe versus what we have been indoctrinated to believe.
B00860YICC|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE!!  Never heard of this but was just saw \\"five stars\\" and thought why not. Had second thoughts after I ordered it thinking that those 76 reviews were probably all on the same bus from the assisted living place lol.  But when I saw the movie I was just blown away how well done it was.  Only problem I had was that the first one I ordered had some kind of interference that caused it to go from B&W to color, almost like the old VHS stop-copy interference.  I think that it was the company in Ontario.  The second one we ordered was no problem.  Every one that I recommended it to felt the same way I did about the movie.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is a great game. Really good music, addicting gameplay, fun and appropriate 8 bit style graphics. My only wish is that the left and right arrows could be moved closer together, and that the frame rate was higher. But these are so minor I am giving it 5 stars anyway. This game deserves a medal, doc.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this game is really good and I don't even really like star wars but u should get it its awsome
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I love all but maybe 2 songs on the whole album, and I like those ones too. It is one of the few albums I can let shuffle and repeat.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|One of the most boring and uninteresting books ever. Her books use to be so page turning but this book the story is as dull as a razor blade.
1451673442|5.0|It makes you stand up and take notice. Thinking twice even. Although thought provoking,it is so profound. Lots of insight and wisdom on life's road. Please consider giving this a try. You won't be sorry,only blessed. Soul seeking! God bless. Veronica

1451688091|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin chronicles an intelligent narrative that draws the reader in immediately as she paints a colorful portrait of Lincoln, his life, and his political rivals. This enthralling story portrays how Lincoln freed America, and protected a nation. The author creates a Masterpiece that is not only elegant in style, but mesmerizing to the very end. Goodwin delivers an incredible, addicting, and rich account of the Civil War Presidency, and all its trials-and-tribulations. She includes a splendid historical view that's beautifully written about the history of several men on Lincoln's team, and the politics behind-the-scenes. I admire the books I collect on different Presidents and their lives and time in office. This is one of my favorite presentations about one of the most notable men in history. Enjoyable, comprehensive, concise, and educational. A Must read, and Highly Recommended!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Thank You.The Dvd was great.Iappreaciate it very much.It an't Halloween unless you watch Michael Myers Halloween.Right?And thanks to amazon.com for all there support as well.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|The case I received stated that this was the 2 disc edition, just as advertised. Inside the case, however, there is only one slot for one dvd, and the one dvd that was sent was the \\"second\\" disc with special features. Therefore, I did not actually receive the movie that I purchased. Unfortunately, the \\"return window\\" for this product has expired, so I am unable to ask the seller to rectify the situation.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|After watching this movie in the theaters, I couldn't wait until it came out on DVD.  The music is fantastic and that is what a musical is all about, not dialogue and acting.
B006TVQU6C|3.0|Case is ok for the price, but for a little extra you will get a far superior product with the 300.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|\\"Music From Another Dimension\\" has some good moments.  However, the next time you mouth off about KISS' music, make sure that your latest release is better than theirs.  Whereas KISS' \\"Monster\\" is their second consecutive solid, return-to-form album written, played, sung, and produced entirely in-house, your first new album in more than a decade is an album of too many fillers, songs that go in one ear and out the other, an abundance of Diane Warren-penned fomulaic pop schlock, and guest vocalists to hide the lack of inspiration and new ideas.
B0087HT36U|5.0|great app. no issues on droid razr! have finally completed all lvls and looking for more. i love mini clip games. 5 stars
B004PIA4BI|5.0|My phone was so slow I could not even make a call without it being plugged into a electrical socket.  Didn't want to have to get a new phone OR a new two-year contract.  Decided perhaps a new battery would fix my problem. AT&T no longer offered a new battery saying the phone was too old and that the battery had been discontinued and they tried real hard to get me under contract or their other option was for me to pay an outrageous price for a phone without a contract.  I liked my phone and just couldn't believe there was no other option.  Two local battery retailers said they could get me a battery - both wanted over $40.00 plus shipping.  I found this site which offered just what I needed at great price and crossed my fingers it would work.  IT DID.  PHONE IS LIKE BRAND NEW and hold a charge for days. No new contracts. No price gouging.  If your phone is slow or worse, try this before being taken advantage of by the \\"Big Boys\\".  Thanks again from a happy user.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It kept me in suspense.  I could not predict the ending.  I am going to purchase more of her work.
B0096I9UTE|4.0|Played the C D twice and what was missing was Kylie energy.  This C D sounds nice, and I like it for more quiet times like relaxing in a recliner with phones on. Most of my Kylie music discs possess so much beat and presence; the kind of music that would get your heartbeat going and adrenalin up. I also noticed that the fidelity was not that good with Kylie's voice being secondary to the background melodies and lacking presence like being right at the microphone. I still really love her as a singer and entertainer, but this disc is a much different style and I will listen to it when I am in a more peaceful mood like late night relaxing....If you like Kylie, I still recommend this C D for your collection, but consider it as a different mode of Kylie's talent. And, I always recommend Amazon for whatever you need-no sales people, no running around, no hassles, best prices and awesome return policy..
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Plays a great game of chess. I am very grateful for this app, thank you! I was fortunate to find it while it was the FAOTD. Still, it is worth the money. If you want a great chess game on Android, you found it. 5 stars!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game so much I wish I could play it more. energy to get tasks done runs out way too fast. which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Book kept my attention. The ending was disappointing as I was expecting a final twist in the story. So I guess Grisham wanted us to make assumptions and fantasize what happened to the murderer in Jamaican penal system.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was even better than the first book. I couldn't put it down.<br />I recommend it to all women interested in romance and drama.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Hydrogen Sonata is classic Banks, and if you love the Culture novels it is a must read. If there is something less than stellar to be said about the novel it would be that it is not something we have not seen before. The last Culture novels have explored different new aspects of the culture, this otherwise fine book feels a bit unimaginative at times.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love love love this series!!  Liked Reflected in you so much more than Bared to you.  Can not wait for the next book in the series.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I almost didn't order this, but then saw some long trailers and decided to try it. I can honestly say I was surprised and enjoyed the movie. It's different to be sure, but I like movies that aren't predictable. A good storyline and very entertaining. I would recommend to friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the most exciting books I've read. Can't wait to start on the second book. Suzanne Collins is my new favorite author.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I LOVED this movie. It is a very endearing and funny movie. You get wrapped up in the lives of the characters and actually feel the emotions behind it. Very unexpected and delightful movie for the family. I have already recommended this to others.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really fun.  I liked it but wish you could earn coins a little faster when not playing though. good graphics
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a decent calculator and easy to use ^_^<br /><br />If you need a calculator for kindle this is a good one ^_^
B0054SMID0|4.0|Great actor did a good job on this film. It was very real and the drama and action was intence.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|This is a great third movie for the series. Not to happy with the dropping of Meagan Fox from the series, however this movie gave the general population more of what was wanted...giant robots fighting. There was a perfect mix of disappointment, sadness, and then again joy in this movie. There were also a lot of parts that just left me stunned...in a good way. Disappointed with the way they had to throw one f-bomb into the movie. Great movie, lots of fighting, and an acceptable conclusion to the series, for now.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I bate this app dont get it its sooo stupid its not worth the money $2.99 like really u got to be kidding me kiss my butt

0060873175|5.0|Three men are found in a Honolulu office, dead, but without outward signs of cause except for tiny cuts all over their bodies.  Seemingly unrelated, seven graduate students enter an experimental lab and find themselves caught up in a technological marvel that shrinks them to a size only slightly greater than ants and dumped in a rural jungle area a couple miles away.  It might as well be as far away as the moon. In a short time, they will die unless returned to their normal size.  Oh, yeah, the man who was responsible is hunting them.<br /><br />A fast-reading techno thriller that gives a more complete look at the microworld than other books of this type, where soil bacteria can be seen as clumps of dots, where ants are deadly killers, and where momentary safety is an illusion.<br /><br />The twists and turns pull you along, with plenty of motivation from a homicidal Snidely Whiplash villain you can't wait to see killed off.<br /><br />Definitely a worthwhile book to get.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was so excited when I realized I could get the entire first season on DVD.  I did not get into the series until about half way so it was nice to start at the beginning.  Not only did the set arrive in great condition but it arrived REALLY fast.  I was able to watch the entire first season right before the second one started.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|ok rovio, I'm sensing potential lawsuits here.  you sell a complete game....I don't mind waiting for the 3rd world, but after the first stage in Jeri, you're asking for an additional 2 dollars?  this is bs.  I paid for for a full game, and want a refund, and ail truly never buy another app of yours again!

B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love Pinterest. It's my online bulletin board to save the things that are interesting to me. It's better than tearing a page out of a magazine or a recipe from a newspaper because I cant lose it and I don't have to store it. I have used so many of the ideas and can truly say that my life is better since finding Pinterest.

1451695195|2.0|I was so excited when I heard about this book from a friend. I am fascinated with people that have had NDE's. I was especially interested since this man is a scientist and doctor and didn't believe it when his patients told him what they saw in their own NDE. I did read many of the reviews before I purchased the book so I was aware that the author did not detail a lot of his actual experience and what he saw in Heaven, but I was still very excited to read it. The author describes his experience in the Core, the Gateway and the realm of the earthworm's eye view. He did not explain what the Core or Gateway was. He used these words, but what exactly are they and where did he get those terms? He describes the first place he goes to as being in mud with blood and veins as if he were a worm in muck. That was confusing and strange. There was very little description or explanation of what he saw. I am glad to have read the book, happy that he is getting his message out, and I do believe him, but this book leaves the reader unsatisfied in my opinion. Anita Moorjani's \\"Dying To Be Me\\" was a better book for help from her heavenly visit. She gives more details and it is a better story all around.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Read it in 3 days , couldn't put it down!also read litigators right after and it was also a quick read and fun.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book makes the events of the Civil War come alive with all the personel infomation about the characters.

I would recommend \\"Team of Rivals\\" to anyone interested in learning from history.
0345803507|2.0|The 50 Shades of  Gray trilogy was exciting and suspenseful. There was  never a dull moment.The erotic scenarios  in the books set your body on fire. I could not put the books down.  I had not read any books this exciting  in a long time  and cannot wait for EL James next book.

B009CPES4I|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this as it put into focus what happens when you get a little older (past the age of 55). The movie was somewhat slow in spots, but it was enjoyable and worth watching.
B007REV4T8|4.0|It may be hard to believe, but James Bond was a complete stranger to this household until the week \\"Skyfall\\" was released. Squeezing viewings of \\"Casino Royale,\\" \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" and \\"Skyfall\\" into one day probably isn't such a bad idea, but it was a pretty interesting experience for someone who was unfamiliar with James Bond films and who had no expectations whatsoever. \\"Casino Royale\\" is really well-rounded as it provides thrilling action sequences and a superb story that keeps you engrossed while making you feel like you know Daniel Craig's version of James Bond by the time it's over. It was so disappointing \\"Quantum of Solace\\" wasn't anywhere near the film \\"Casino Royale\\" was. \\"Skyfall\\" just really needed to tap into that same sense of greatness \\"Casino Royale\\" had to keep this franchise as good as its numbers. Judging by its overseas numbers alone (\\"Skyfall\\" made over $321 million before it was even released in the states), it's safe to say \\"Skyfall\\" more than delivers.<br /><br />One of the keys to a great James Bond film is a memorable villain. That's one of the reasons \\"Quantum of Solace\\" was so disappointing; you went from Mads Mikkelsen who cried blood and tortured a nude James Bond with a rope in a chair to Mathieu Amalric who had no charisma and just kind of whined about everything. \\"Skyfall\\" introduces Javier Bardem as Silva, a former agent who worked for M (Judi Dench). Out of the three Daniel Craig Bond films, Javier Bardem is the best and most mesmerizing villain. Silva is like a more flamboyant Hannibal Lecter who always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else. His speech about getting rid of rats on an island and his mannerisms just sells the character so well. \\"Mommy was very bad. Hm?\\"<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" explores James Bond getting older and whether he's still fit to be an agent after getting injured on the job. To make matters worse is that M has been forced into retirement and only has a few months left until that goes into effect. MI6 comes under attack while a leak is revealing the names of MI6 agents to the world, which has Bond go after Raoul Silva who has a past with M and has every intention of killing her.<br /><br />By now you've probably already seen it pointed out, but it's really difficult to look past how many similarities \\"Skyfall\\" has with \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Bardem's performance has more than a few ounces of Heath Ledger's Joker injected into it, Silva plans on being captured and brought into custody, there's a memorable interrogation sequence, Silva disguises himself as a cop, there's a scene that mirrors the \\"Nothing in his pockets but knives and lent\\" scene in \\"The Dark Knight,\\" and Bond is an orphan as we see the grave with both parents on it much like Bruce Wayne. Sam Mendes has gone on record as saying \\"Skyfall\\" was directly influenced by the 2008 film directed by Christopher Nolan, so the homage and similar formula certainly doesn't come out of nowhere.<br /><br />The opening you've come to expect from these films is delayed as we see Bond on a mission with Eve (Naomie Harris) and events unfolding in a way they didn't plan on. However, the film doesn't break the tradition of a high fueled action sequence opening the film as dirt bikes fly into the camera and the entire train sequence is just extraordinary. The opening credits sequence proves to be just as stylish as ever as we see Bond drowning in what seems like himself and shooting his shadow as we drift along the ocean floor. The film is a visual treat, as well. Everything in Shanghai leaps off the screen thanks solely to the setting and the extreme use of multicolored fluorescent lighting. There's the fight in the skyscraper and the boat ride to the casino. The brilliant cinematography is just as thrilling as the seat-clenching action and incredibly captivating story.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" puts things back on track after the many shortcomings \\"Quantum of Solace\\" left us with. Javier Bardem's exceptional performance and hisdemanding screen presence more than makes up for the follow-up to \\"Casino Royale.\\" \\"Skyfall\\" is visually impressive from beginning to end, offers what feels like the closing of one exciting Bond chapter and the opening of another, and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the Daniel Craig James Bond films. But as excellent as \\"Skyfall\\" is it still doesn't surpass \\"Casino Royale.\\" The Sam Mendes directed Bond film will have to settle for a well-earned second place trophy.demanding screen presence more than makes up for the follow-up to \\"Casino Royale.\\" \\"Skyfall\\" is visually impressive from beginning to end, offers what feels like the closing of one exciting Bond chapter and the opening of another, and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the Daniel Craig James Bond films.

B003O86FMW|5.0|It was amazing! At the begining i thought it went a bit to slow but then it started fast and i could not put it away! I brought this book with me everywhere for two days! It goes quickly to the point if you dont like it when a book has a whole chapter explaining a street for example!:) its amazing worth reading for sure!
B008NR91DO|5.0|This DVD proves just how versatile a player Gary Moore was. Gary was one of the finest blues-rock guitarists who ever lived, leaving behind a staggering legacy of recordings to document his own greatness--he had no need to make tribute albums to other guitarists. But the fact that he did just shows his great character in showing respect to the masters before him. First there was the \\"Blues for Greeny\\" album dedicated to the great Peter Green, and now the Hendrix tribute DVD/album, \\"Blues For Jimi\\". As with the Green tribute album, Gary really nails the spirit and technique of the original master, and fittingly throws in some of his famed \\"blueshredding\\" for added effect here on this DVD! Great stuff! At first, he's playing a Strat with no whammy bar, and I thought, \\"Oh man, he's not going to use a whammy?!\\" But I should have had faith, as pretty soon, he grabs another Strat with a whammy, and boy, does he know how to use it! Jimi would be proud!<br /><br />His rhythm section is also dynamite and excellent musicians in their own right. For an added treat, though, they give up their spaces to allow the legendary Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox to come out and jam with Gary for 3 numbers...fantastic! Actually, poor Mitch has trouble keeping up with the pace on one number, but still, what a thrill to see the actual '70 Hendrix rhythm section go at it again after nearly 40 years!<br /><br />One non-musical aspect I couldn't really figure out was Gary's apparent hostile attitude toward the crowd...lol. At one point during \\"Foxy Lady\\", I believe, on one of the breaks where everything stops and he normally would say, \\"Foxy Lady!\\", he instead sneers, \\"Hey, f-- off, you!\\" Was someone heckling him?? And then when Billy and Mitch are onstage, after playing a number, Billy says to the crowd, \\"We love ya!\\", and Gary pipes in, \\"I Don't!...well, maybe some of you.\\" LOL Not sure what that was all about!<br /><br />Anyway, great CD...highly recommended!!

B007REV4T8|5.0|after watching this new \\"Bond\\" movie,i left totally satisfied the franchise in headed in the right direction.before Daniel Craig,\\"Goldeneye\\"was the last good one.after that,the Movies were more stiff comedy's than tense spy dramas.before the end credits it says on the screen \\"James Bond Will Be Back\\" I cant wait.the series has been updated for the newer generation with a younger \\"Q\\" and a new Money Penny,the other positives I can't give away.as for the new Q,{never knew it stood for Quartermaster}he is younger and computer savvy.<br />there were no corny jokes or scenes for laughs.A solid action Movie with a genuine villain who is confidant and menacing,not comical.

B00457X7XQ|1.0|The plot is as overdone as a 48 hour turkey.  Our hero is so smart he figured out 9/11 weeks in advance but was prevented by his boss at the CIA from taking action.  Really?  Multiple inconsistent descriptions of various computer viruses.  It's an IT thriller for people who don't know much about how computers and code really work.  Surprisingly naive considering the author's background.  Tossed it at about the 40% mark.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books were amazing...really can't believe that ab happy ending came from all the pain and suffering. The first movie seemed a little stupid to me, but after reading the book, everything took form. The books are a must read, even if you go see the movie.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Here's a movie for the special effects fan, the science fiction fan, the person who judges movies by how they look on the elaborate home theater, and by how dramatic the sound is. It's ponderous, vague, meandering - but it still holds appeal for the fantasy-oriented audience who love epics like Lord Of The Rings, and whatever that other fantasy movie was with the blue things. Sadly this was marketed to those who liked Alien. That film (I and II)happens to be set in the future, in outer space, but was a tightly scripted, well-acted suspense and horror thriller that had little to do with science fiction. Also it was a great movie. A really great film, the opposite of this interesting but meandering fantasy. I think that if this film had been marketed to the correct audience it could have been a five star winner. People like me who thought they were in for something completely different, though, were bound to be disappointed.

1596680296|4.0|I've never knit socks before and I learned from this book and some helpful videos from YouTube. One part of the directions is confusing: when turning the heel the instructions don't tell you to use the same needle your remaining stickers are on rather than the remaining needle you were using. I was so confused so I had to look it up on YouTube before I could proceed. When going back it made more sense but as a complete beginner you might need a little help with that part. I appreciate how the pattern is generalized rather than just being a specific sock pattern.

B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I have played all of the other Angry Birds games on my tablet over and over again, but this one will not open.  It downloads and installs with no problems but when it comes to opening it up, it will not open.  I am really upset as I am also a huge Trekkie from way back in the early black and white days.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Sensational.  Playing it all the time, singing along and just enjoying it.  Great movie and the music is amazing.  Love it.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|As a faotd, this is great! Definitely a good chess game even if you have to pay. The game runs smooth and has a ton of options. However, the size of the board is a little small, and you can't name yourself or your opponent in Multi or Single player. There us another &quot;chess free &quot; game that lacks the options, but has names and a larger board. Both are nice apps. If you have the money, get this one, if not, get the other. Get one of the two though, these are great!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Really enjoying it.  Only one issue thus far with one episode not playing at all.  Only at disc 3 so far.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Streaming season 4 from Amazon.  I streamed season's 1-3 from Netflix, however, season 4 is not available from Netflix.  This is an absolutely great show with a great and unusual story line.  I saw the ads on FX for years and ignored them thinking that this show must be beneath my intellectual status.  (I am joking here!)  I finally tried it and discovered how wrong I was.  As soon as I finish season 4, I can go on to a DVR full of season 5.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While not a \\"best ever\\" Grisham effort, I enjoyed the context, the characters and the twisty plot.  Try it, you'll probably like it a lot.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|I really liked Prague Fatale by Philip Kerr. I am surprised I never came across any of the Bernard (Bernie) Gunther books before. Bernie is a great character, especially within the context of Nazi Germany. I loved his bravado and most of all, his sarcasm in the face of pure evil. A lot of this book follows along actual events and mentions real people during Hitler's reign. The plot was good, even if the resolution fizzled slightly. But then, history isn't always like a popular novel either, is it? I wholeheartedly recommend this book, and definitely plan to read more in the series.

B008FOB124|5.0|This is a work of sublime beauty and transcendence - all of the originality and inventiveness of classic Dead Can Dance, evolved into an even richer, more inspiring musical experience, which rewards repeated listening.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead season 3 is a great improvement from season 2, there are twice as many zombies in the first two episodes than there were in all of season 2.  No one is safe in this season so far, new characters have been introduced and eaten already, and there is plenty of bloodshed for the horror fan.  I'm glad I stuck with the show, I thought season 1 was great, but season 2 was too slow and not nearly gorey enough.  Well AMC has redeemed the show with this season, the zombies are back, the team has been split up and survival is the name of the game.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|If you look at it as a standard Sci/Fi & Horror affair, then 3.5 stars. If you were wanting a continuation of the Alien franchise, then 1.5 stars. It posed more questions than answered. Not great in the thrills or horror department, a couple of \\"gross out\\" moments. No character development to speak of and no real \\"concrete\\" tie in with Alien series. I was hoping for the story of how the Aliens find themselves on LV-426. What we get is: a \\"meet and greet\\" on LV-233 with yet another space fairing hominid species that may have \\"created\\" the Aliens, a message piece that hits you over the head with it's plot allegories(director/producer is getting to be an old man and this view point is coloring his story telling ability) and a possible sequel of a prequel, think Star Wars: Episode II. Alien fans can skip it and live the rest of their lives fulfilled. Alien COMPLETEST, should see it, but keep in mind you may be less than satisfied, and basic science fiction fans can see it and have a little fun... or not.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Great book with a good story line. It keeps you guessing as to how the plot will unfold right until the end.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I really enjoyed the first series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The show had everything: action, violence, passionate story lines and above all, great historical accuracy. So as a history junkie, I couldn't wait for more on the series. Sadly Toby Whitfield, who played Spartacus, passed away and the producers came out with Spartacus: Gods of the Arena as a pre-story to the first series. \\"Gods of the Arena\\" does an excellent job explaining in much graphic detail how things came to happen in Capua before Spartacus appears in the arena. The cast is fantastic and creates a very believable glimpse into life in ancient Rome. John Hannah, Lucy Lawless, Manu Bennett, and Peter Mensah all reprise their wonderful roles from Blood and Sand. Newcomer Dustin Clare as the hero gladiator Gannicus,establishes himself as an incredible actor to keep an eye on. I highly reccomend Spartacus: Gods of the Arena as a must see for anyone enjoying historical Roman History and gladiator action stories.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|Amazing action game for my kindle. Graphics are awesome. Controls are nice and smooth and navigating through skills, inventory, and such is user friendly.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|What can you say? This absolutely unique film has been a \\"cult classic\\" since its opening in 1975. It's best seen at midnight showings with its many, many fans. Looking back to 1975, it's still fun to see just how heart-stoppingly beautiful the young Susan Sarandon was.  My teenage libido was seriously inflamed by \\"Touch-a / touch-a / touch-a / touch me...\\"  Although many of the actors in this film later regretted their roles because the movie type-cast them for any later work, I contend that it's better to have acted in one masterpiece than in 20 mediocre movies.<br /><br />The movie is hotly criticized for being campy, twee, and far too long. Whatever sexual gospel the movie is trying to preach also confuses or offends many viewers.  Despite the justice of the criticisms, the movie prevails with its wonderful soundtrack and over-the-top characters. If you've never seen it (What, you're a VIRGIN??!!), then not to be missed. Even if you've seen it before, who can resist doing the Time Warp again?
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George Martin continues the series Game of Thrones and it is excellent reading.  These books are hard to put down as the characters all come to life.  There are some to love and some to hate which keeps you turning pages to find out what happens to each of them.

I'm trying to get all of my friends and family to read it too! I actually just re-bought this book for my cousin's Christmas gift. It should be mandatory reading! The mass market paperback is an affordable way to get this great book, though I do recommend reinforcing the binding with wide clear tape before you wear it out from reading it again and again!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read Jordan and Martin and all the huge fantasy/sci-fi authors. This was an amazing start to an epic series that could eclipse Wheel of Time if Sanderson keeps it up. I'm not sure how Sanderson keeps coming up with novel ideas for magical systems, but this book uses a system thats entirely new to me. Hopefully in the coming books he will tell us more about where the power comes from! My only problem is that he's only written this one, but once WoT is finished, he will hopefully make these books his next project. The rate he published the Mistborn trilogy gives me hope we won't have to wait very long for books to come! BUY THIS BOOK!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Let me start by saying that there are spoilers in this review. If you don't want to read spoilers, move along. You won't be warned again.<br /><br />Let me also say that I don't review books that I don't like, so if you look up my other reviews, you'll see that they're all four and five stars. This is by design. As a writer, I don't disparage the work done by other writers. If I don't happen to appreciate their work, I just don't comment.<br /><br />Now then, time to dig into this amazing book.<br /><br />With The Persistence of Memory, David Mack again proves that he is a writer's writer. What I mean when I say that is that there are a fairly large number of authors (not naming names) who tell excellent stories, are popular with readers, and sell a lot of books, but aren't what I would call technically adept. They often overuse the to-be verb, or their descriptions aren't quite adequate to convey the scene, or they focus too much on exposition. Maybe the average reader doesn't notice these things, but when you write for a living, you're aware of them and you appreciate it when you discover an author who spends the time and effort on their craft to make it as near-flawless as possible. David Mack is one of those exceptional authors who has honed his pros to a point that puts other professionals to shame. I've read many of his other Star Trek books, and I'm always left with the feeling that we're lucky to have him as a Star Trek author, because authors of his caliber don't associate with tie-in fiction.<br /><br />But enough gushing about the writer, let's talk about the book. I'd imagine that like many people who would be interested in this book, I was raised with Star Trek: The Next Generation. As a child, Star Trek II was what initially roped me in, and then I watched the reruns of the original series since they aired after the game shows every night in the early '80s. But it wasn't until Next Gen that it felt like MY Star Trek. It wasn't just a space adventure show, but it was also a thorough examination of what it meant to be human. Of course we saw this through the thoughtful nobility of Captain Jean Luc Picard, the love of adventure of William T. Riker, the empathy of Counselor Troi, and of course the growth of Commander Data as he very innocently tried to navigate his way through the complex and difficult to understand realm of interpersonal relationships on his quest to become more human. I think that after Riker, Data was my favorite character because of his understated humor and, ironically, the humanness of his character.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise then that I didn't particularly welcome Nemesis when it was released. At the time, I was working for a large gaming corporation that I'd place even odds you've heard about and one of my co-workers had connections in Paramount. As a result, I'd seen the script about a year in advance of the movie's release. To me, it felt like a betrayal. People complain about how George Lucas has ruined their childhood, and I'm not particularly sympathetic to that sentiment, but I did skip watching Nemesis in the theater and didn't get around to seeing it until about four years later. I think I made the right call. How could they kill off Data and then just end it there? This wasn't like Star Trek II where Spock's katra could get dumped back into a resurrected body. It was done. Over. Finished. I would have been infinitely more happy letting Insurrection be the final word on Next Gen.<br /><br />Since Nemesis, there have been some excellent books that have continued the Next Generation era. Destiny and Typhon Pact (both of which Mack had a very large hand in) took Star Trek in a new direction while staying true to its vision and history. Despite this, I always felt the absence of Data.<br /><br />By now, it should come as no surprise that this is the book where we get Data back, more or less. David Mack picks up where the 2002 book, Immortal Coil, left off and plausibly breathes life back into our favorite android. The beginning and end of this book tell the story of the abduction of B-4 and the other Soong Androids, the discovery that Dr. Noonien Soong now survives as an android, and the desperate mission to retrieve B-4 from the Typhon Pact. The middle of the book once again demonstrates David Mack's mastery over pros because it tells Soong's story, from his conversion to android form and then his activities throughout the final seasons of Next Generation and the events that have occurred since. He does this in first person present tense, which is a very difficult form to write and do well. It was a daring choice, and I think it was a risk worth taking. During this part of the book, we learn how Soong built up a financial empire that would allow him to continue his advances in android development, and then loss of that empire to the Borg. We also learn about his failed relationship with Julia Tainer, Data's \\"mom,\\" and the significance of that as he tries to move forward with his life. This is the meat of the book, and it's really the first time in Star Trek that we get a really good peek into the mind of such an important character. We learn of his envy of Emil Vaslovik (first introduced as Flint in the TOS episode Requiem for Methuselah), his sense of loss over the failure that was Lore, and his sense of existential despair following the death of Data. By the end of the middle of the book, I feel like we finally know who Dr. Noonien Soong is.<br /><br />It's clear from the beginning that this book concerns Data. Without reading spoilers first, at no point during the book did I feel like there was a guarantee that Data was actually going to be restored to life, nor was it clear to me how this would be accomplished until it actually happened. There were also moments in the end when I was concerned that Mack was going to knock off another one of these beloved characters. In fact, he does kill someone of importance, and it came so suddenly that I sat stunned after reading it. I feel bad about this particular character death because I felt that it was one of the few new additions to the \\"cast\\" that really fit in and worked well.<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed with Data's decision not to rejoin the crew of the Enterprise at the end. While I was happy that he was no longer dead, it was clear that the new Data had everything that the original Data wanted - real human emotions, a more human appearance, and a closeness with Soong that had never before existed - and it became clear that he was going after Vaslovic in hopes of restoring his daughter, Lal, to life. I don't feel like there's any guarantee that we'll see him back aboard the Enterprise any time soon, if ever. I'm holding out hope though.<br /><br />And on that note, I'm not exactly convinced that the Next Generation books are going to continue much farther into the future. It's already been hinted that Picard and Crusher are going to retire so they can raise their son, Renee. Once that happens, the only original characters left aboard will be Worf and Geordi. If Data comes back, maybe they can continue on with Worf as the captain, or they could pull Riker off the Titan and put him in charge of the Enterprise, though I doubt that last scenario very much. They could also combine casts and move Sisko in as captain, and rope in Dr. Bashir to take over Crusher's position, but I find that scenario even less likely. So I'm left wondering what the future of MY Star Trek is going to be. Are they winding down the novels so they can focus on the Abramsverse Trek, or are we looking at a new beginning for TNG? I'd like to believe its the latter and not the former.<br /><br />At any rate, this is an excellent and powerful book. I highly recommend it if you love Star Trek, particularly if you're one of the people who just wasn't satisfied with the way Nemesis ended things. It's one of the few books that has left me a bit shocked, not just by the unexpected character death toward the end, but also by Data's unexpected change in direction. More than anything, however, it leaves me wanting to know where they're taking the series next. More please.
034580404X|1.0|I guess I don't really know what I was expecting when I bought these books. I had heard so much about them and how great they are so I figured, why not give them a shot. I picked up the first book figuring that I'd blow through it quickly like everyone else but I was very mistaken. It was the most disturbing and disgusting thing I had ever read. I could have never come up with such weird things. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these books. I didn't think that they would contain such disturbingly inappropriate scenarios. It's so unfortunate that so many people have advertised this book and now young girls are reading them and getting the wrong idea, as if society doesn't advertise sex before marriage enough...
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved the book I thought it was much better than the film because it explained everything in detail compared to what the film tells. Can't wait to read the second one! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was everything that looked for! Its always sad when you finish a good book because you start thinking what book to read next... And you just have to see if it will be as good as the one you just read.
B0041KXNA4|5.0|WE WERE SOLDIERS is based on the memoirs of then-Lt. Col. Hal Moore Jr. His [[ASIN:034547581X WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG]] is co-authored by Joe Galloway, played in this film adaptation by Barry Pepper.<br /><br />In \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" director Randall Wallace presents a careful recreation of the initial phase of the battle of La Drang, the first major clash in Vietnam between American troops and those of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). It's the harrowing story of a vastly outnumbered and green 7th Cavalry unit choppered into the field on what quickly becomes a suicide mission.<br /><br />They engage an enemy with 20 years fighting experience that also has the geographical advantage of high ground entrenchment. Reporter/fotog Joe Galloway choppers in just before the worst fighting begins and ends up battling for his life.<br /><br />On 11/15/65, Col. Moore (Gibson) radios a \\"Broken Arrow\\" distress call when his troops are being overwhelmed by sheer numbers and it looks like they'll all get slaughtered just as French forces were a decade earlier. The American response is immediate and decisive. Machine gun fire from helicopter warships in co-ordination with accurate artillery barrages turn the tide of battle and decimate the NVA.<br /><br />This most graphic of all 'Nam films has a solid hour of horrendous battles that intercut occasionally with scenes of the pressures wives back home must cope with. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is brilliant, bloody, tragic and definitely NOT for the squeamish!<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.0) We Were Soldiers (USA/Germany-2002) - Mel Gibson/Madeleine Stowe/Greg Kinnear/Sam Elliott/Chris Klein/Keri Russell/Barry Pepper/Duong Don/Dylan Walsh
B0015DYIH2|5.0|All ready for the movie. Have to say that the book is always better than the movie! The book brings you all the details in compared to the movie where they just skip thru it.
B008RTE066|5.0|I had seen MMT before, but not in this quality. There are also LOTS of bonus video and deleted scenes, all of which were wonderful. Watching MMT with 2012 eyes, it struck me as being very \\"modern.\\" Other than I wished they had included the Hello Goodbye videos, this was a really great release.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It had been over 5 years since I had picked up a book. After hearing all the hyped about this book, I decided to start up again. I am so glad that I read this Trilogy. Absolutely great! Thanks to this Trilogy I started back reading books. I just can't put the books down.
0060543981|5.0|I have an elementary aged daughter who has a hard time reading books due to her severe dyslexia.  We homeschool and wanted to study the pioneer period this year, knowing that the \\"Little House\\" books would be a part of our curriculum.  I was looking for an audio version of the series and this book did not disappoint.  My daughter loved listening to the story of Laura and her family on her CD player, and we were able to discuss the book at great lengths because the narrator had a clear, calm voice and used a lot of intonation to keep my daughter's interest.  I would recommended this book on CD to anyone who wants a great listening experience.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the first book and loved it. With this second one, i had to wait like a little kid for its release date. Yet again, I will have to wait for the third book. Wish they would realease it sooner...
0425263908|2.0|I thought Fifty Shades was better by far! I read this book and found that it was almost boring. I thought if i read this book first before Fifty i think i would have kept going with the series,but I plan on moving on and not with the rest of these series of books.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. In the beginning, I really didn't get into the book. It took me about 5x to read the first chapter but for some reason I kept trying to read it. Once I got to the second chapter, I was sold!!!<br />The book is very addictive!! I could'nt put it down. Recommend it!

B007THA4FI|2.0|I really expected more from J.K. Rowling and perhaps that was the problem.  She is a good writer in her description of characters and events...it is just that in this case the plot was not very good and I found the book rather boring.  It began promisingly and the ending was okay, but so much more could have held the readers attention for the duration.  I would have put it down halfway through if I was not one of those people who finishes every book, hoping it will redeem itself.  I would not recommend this book.  I am hopeful that J.K. Rowling's next attempt at adult literature will be more entertaining.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|i have a transformer prime and cannot install this on my device. why can other users install on their tablets ... and i cannot? i dont care if its HD. I just want to play this
0307887448|5.0|The most stunning book ever! I found my self wanting to get out of my self and start shadow boxing the procrastinators. The characters were so well developed that I felt empathy for all of them in their worst times. I kept trying to put the clues together in my head while reading to see if I could get the answer before the narrator could. I could honestly say that I wanted to be a character in that book, even with the hardships of the time period. I got this book on my kindle and started to read it even when my kindle was charging at my desktop. This book is so addicting and you can easily lose track of time due to the constant excitement placed in the book while still having the perfect amount of details incorporated into the plot. Throughout the book I was thrown curve balls in the story line and was always wondering which game they would play next. One of the best books that i have ever read! I hope you enjoy reading this fantastic book!
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is just like the one I used to play on my computer. and I find myself just as addicted now as I did years ago.

Of course this is NOT a rental...It's recommended that you buy this in Blue Ray! It's (Damn) good!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is still the man! I am troubled by the fact that the actor chosen to play him on the screen (Tom Cruise) is so far from mine and all the Reacher readers I know in everything from stature to personality. Big Mistake.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Nothing fancy just a good plain Jane phone cover. Snaps on firm and tight, protects entire back and edges. Proper opening for side attachments and adjustments. Dropped phone a couple times no problem. Doesn't add much to the size. I'm happy with it.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun Fun Fun. Can't stop playing! Dragons and more dragons. Easy going, casual play that everyone can enjoy. A must have for dragon lovers everywhere.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Let me me clear, this show is NOT for little kids.  Heck, I'm a grown-up and it scares the snot out of me at times.  However there is a quality about the show which touches on the humanity of the characters and makes them real.  Imperfect people in an upside down world trying to carve out a slice of normalcy.  Friendship, family, loyalty, and love are drivers for the characters.<br /><br />Season 3 is already a wild ride and we're only a few episodes in.  I hate spoilers, so you won't find any here.  But for newbies and graphic novel fans alike, the Walking Dead does not disappoint.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|An excellent read, although highly imaginative.  Perhaps John Grisham could teach the criminal world some new tricks!!!  A most enjoyable book.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I remember the opening night of prometheus and how amazing it looked on the big screen and thought nothing could come close to that, but after getting this bluray from amazon I was blown away, the clarity of the film and sound were second to none
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I really enjoyed this game at first and spent several hours a day playing but when you get all the pieces there isn't any more levels and this is something i would really love to see
B005HSL626|4.0|it is a great game i admit but dont you think they could add something new to it to bring in younger players. it needs more modes to play in.

B009GEBBNQ|2.0|The biggest problem with movies like this is too many heroes all vying for screen time.  I loved Thor, loved Captain America,  and loved Iron Man.  These heroes need to have their own movie.
0785163174|4.0|Now I see that there are a bunch of reviews trashing this item, and while I can see the bad in this crossover, I can also see quite a bit of light, as this crossover is more than just crossover itself. First off, I must state that this is Marvel's weakest crossover to date, which is a bummer because Marvel is the king of crossovers. Comparing this to Secret Invasion and Civil War is just sad, because we can see Marvel can do so much more. There isn't as much action as I'd hoped, and there are pages clouded with word balloons, so if you're the big action type, maybe this isn't for you. Not that all those promised fights aren't in the book, but the first few issues this trade collects are just plain boring and a whole lot of setup. But, on the plus side, this is a must have if you want to have the complete history of the Marvel Universe, because Avengers vs. X-men does lead into Marvel's new reboot, Marvel Now; the publishers answer to the recent Dc comics reboot, the new 52 (which I really enjoy). And I found this crossover quite enjoyable near the end, and I liked the Phoenix Five, even though there could've been more character development on most of them. As a Marvel fan, I was disappointed at first, but now I appreciate it more, and as I'm happy to have it on my shelf. Bottom Line: While it is not the best Marvel crossover, it certainly is one of the most important, and you will find yourself enjoying it half way through. personally, I enjoyed it a lot, and the ending isn't so much an ending, but starts a new chapter in the marvel Universe.<br />If you want to own the next chapter in Marvel history, I recommend this, and while it shouldn't be your first Marvel book on your list, definitely consider it, especially if you're going to start reading Marvel Now.<br />So that's why I give this a 4/5, and while I think hardcore Marvel fans won't agree with my opinion, I still respect it and have yet to regret it.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|I found this movie by chance on video tape 10 years ago and was blown away.  Having it now on blue ray is like discovering it all over again. Cant wait for the third episode. Highly recommend\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is not as good as the computer edition but it is making progress in its stages. I think you will be satisfied with this game no matter how old you are. and be ready to wait a week longer than everybody else for updates on kindle. Oh and by the way it is much harder to update stuff for android and kindle fire because of all the different screen sizes and Crap. So please stop rating one star just for that be patient.

B0083B3KOQ|5.0|On my Windows desktop there were several .avi and .wmv video files. My Kindle Fire 7\\" HD doesn't play those files. I downloaded File Converter, and ES File Explorer as recommended by File Converter. STEP 1: I attached my KindleHD to my computer by USB cable. STEP 2: Then copied my video files from the desktop to the Kindle. IMPORTANT: just drop them into \\"Internal Storage\\" NOT into any of the folders, not even the Video folder! NOTE: you'll get a little window that reminds you that the Kindle Fire doesn't play those files, but can store or transport them. That's fine: we just want to store them there for conversion. STEP 3: Open File Converter and tap the large icon \\"Video Converter.\\" Under \\"INPUT FILE\\" tap the gray box \\"Choose File.\\" A window will open giving you your choice of programs to help you find the file you want to convert: choose ES File Explorer. STEP 4: you'll see all of the Kindle's folders, and at the bottom you'll see your file(s) you want to convert. Tap your finger on one of them and it will magically appear in the earlier \\"Input File\\" box in File Converter! STEP 5: Under \\"Submit\\" simply tap the \\"Convert!\\" box. Watch closely and you'll see a message advising you to go do something else for awhile since the conversion takes time, especially for large files. You will also see a running count of how much of your file has been uploaded for conversion, and later you'll see the same thing as your file is sent back to your Kindle Fire. TA-DA! It will be sent back with the same file name, except as an .mp4 file! *****Now there's one more thing to do: go back to the Amazon Appstore and download \\"CineXPlayer\\" which will be able to display your video files. It will scan your whole Kindle to find your .mp4 files and give you a thumbnail for each one. Tap on a thumbnail and watch your video!! >>>>>File Converter works fine. But as always with computers, do things step by step. I enjoy watching \\"home movies\\" I've taken with my digital camera, and they make my Kindle Fire HD more personal. THANKS to File Converter!  --HINT: try this first with a SMALL file.  :-)
B008GVD6D8|5.0|OMG what a ride this novel is- can't wait for the third book now... December 31st seems so far away. Wouldn't we all like a Gideon? Love all the characters and the journeys they are on.
1401324649|5.0|One of the best I have read in a while and I read a lot !  Allan is so charming and obviously a bit of a devil.  If you are the type who reads a variety of fictional books you will love this one.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|You can read really good, professional reviews about this book that go into lots of detail that I don't plan to do. I loved all the stories, though he can be way to verbose. Many time, as much as I loved the story, I just wanted it to finally end so I could go to the next story. That is the main criticism.<br /><br />At heart it is a book about reincarnation and just so you get the point there is that birthmark which gets reincarnated,too. Nevertheless, this is a good read with strong characters that you care about.<br /><br />I bought this as a Kindle book and it was nicely done.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great story, reinforces faith and the knowledge that this is not the end of the road, but only a testing ground to grow strong in times of trial and sorrow and ultimately, to return to the arms of our Creator, a better soul for having lived our lives on earth.

B005EHILV4|4.0|PROS:<br />* Small. Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf.<br />* If using USB, does not need external power supply.  Very convenient.<br />* Easy-to-use, accessible controls.<br />* Pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio mikes.<br />* Plug & play with Windows 8.  Didn't have to install any kind of driver.<br />* Variety of input options.  Dual track with low/high volume sliders.<br />* LEDs make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range.  Easy to adjust.<br />* Awesome for those who need a mini-mixer-- and costs the same as a USB-based preamp-only device.<br />* Free shipping-- gotta like that<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Only one power setting, 15v. That may not be enough for some, but works great with my studio mike.<br />* Line In / USB buttons somewhat confusing, non-intuitive.  However the manual shows exact settings for computer use.<br />* As with other low-end Behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out.  Can take some fiddling to overcome it.<br />* It's pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion.  Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good.<br /><br />NOTES:<br />I purchased this for use with my studio mike, which I hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs.  Plugged it in, worked first time, no problems.<br /><br />This unit is very sensitive.  If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room.  With a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work.  I use it for guitar/voice solo live Internet music shows.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit.  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect... but then it's only fifty bucks.  For the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range, sensitivity and plug-and-play, I don't think one could find a better unit.  Two thumbs up.  I don't know how a Pro would rate this... but I definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average \\"USB microphones\\" available on the market.  You not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal.  Hard to beat at that price.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  A few days after the initial review-- I just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast.  No background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission.  Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance.  Quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp.<br /><br />HINTS AND TIPS:<br />Two good hints on this one:<br />* Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 AA cells), hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery.  It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE.<br /><br />* There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound. I have found this to be true. It pretty much takes over your entire sound system. For some folks this will be fine. For others, they may not appreciate this. So what I did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer USB (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait...)... and plugged it into one of those new portable-USB power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10). This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer. What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like Audacity.<br /><br />You then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output, a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want. This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device. You are instead powering it from a USB wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well). That's what I finally did and am still most happy with this device.<br /><br />In addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use. You could use this with Windows, Mac, Linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables. Works very well in this capacity. Gotta love those new external USB power nodes. : )nction it performs very well).

B003TSEL7S|5.0|Full of action adventure and some Greek and Roman mythology. If you read this, I guarantee you'll like it! READ IT!
0374214913|3.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore is two books woven together. In one book, Clay Jannon happens upon a secret book cult while working at a mysterious store run by the eponymous Mr. Penumbra. In the other book, author Robin Sloan hijacks his characters' voices in order to deliver introductory lessons on font type, The Singularity, immortality, and anything else that happens to interest him.<br /><br />If it sounds like that last sentence is being written in an annoyed tone, you're only getting half of my emotions. The truth is, I enjoy Sloan's viewpoints and his interests. The way they are written and explained is--like the rest of the book--not only entertaining but even gripping. This is because Sloan employs a casual voice throughout the book that makes you feel like you're hanging out with him at a coffee shop in downtown San Francisco. Sloan sits across from the reader for the entire book and doesn't let the written words overtake what is being said.<br /><br />Having explained that, I must admit that annoyance is definitely there. These scenes of history and theory are not fit neatly into the narrative of the main plot: which involves the mystery of the cult. Instead they take place at odd interludes--while characters are having drinks or going out on dates. The reader rarely understands why these characters are talking about these things and many of the subjects raised do not have a bearing on the plot.<br /><br />They could have! The most interesting conversation Sloan starts is a much more subtle one. It involves the question of \\"Digital versus Physical\\" (this was particularly ironic for me, reading the book on a Kindle) and gives some startling examples of what cannot be done with all of our vast technology that CAN be done through tactile sensation. The arguments are there in the book and clear for any reader to see without having to rely on asides, random conversations, or interruptions to the flow of the story.<br /><br />And it is a good story. The mystery described in Mr. Penumbra will keep you flipping pages until the final reveal, which is more or less satisfying in its philosophy. Why does the book work? Because it's a good, old-fashioned mystery with all of our favorite characters and settings. Cultists in cloaks, old libraries, wealthy investors, hidden messages and cryptic clues, and an ensemble cast of characters who literally name themselves after DnD classes (the thief, the wizard, the warrior). It's hard not to have fun while reading Sloan's tale.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these characters aren't developed at all. This was my biggest complaint with the book. No motivations are described aside from the grand one of \\"let's solve a mystery!\\" which puts these guys on a level with Scooby Doo. No change occurs in Clay, our main character, because he enters this book without any need to change. He has no inner-destination. Without a destination, there cannot be obstacles, and without obstacles there cannot be the all important conflict (the heart of any good book). Without this, the journey ends up feeling too easy. There's never anything at stake, because nothing has been risked. Even physical danger doesn't come into play, which should be raising some alarm bells for those of who are remembering the last paragraph. That's right: this is a book with cultists and there's no danger. The biggest risk is that they will fail to solve the mystery, but you know from page one that they are going to figure out the answer. It's just clear that this is that kind of book--a little too tidy, a little too nice to its characters.<br /><br />Because of this flaw, Penumbra can only be called a success in the ideas it raises and the conversations it may start. And it does do a good job in this. It could've gone deeper and it could've been given more weight if supported by real characters dealing with problems a reader could relate to. It is just smart enough to make you think, and I appreciate that; but the premise itself promises more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its wonderful to be able to pull up the Bible and read a verse or a whole chapter when you are at home or traveling with the kindle as its light to hold in my hands and its always available to you. Thank you for giving us the ability to read the Bible at any time.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|I like the basic premise and  I diddled with it for about an hour but even when the difficulty was easy I couldn't get very far no matter how much I practiced on free play mode. I am not the best game player in the world but I am fairly convinced that the controls are not calibrated properly...or it requires so much precision that no mere mortal could advance very far. Whatever, it was free when I got it so nothing lost. I wouldn't pay for it though. Sorry it could have been fun.

0062127241|4.0|I've read about 90% of the book so far, and it has been really interesting, esp. since I am a long-time fan of the Who. I think the more of a Who fan that you are, the more you will like this book. I do wish that Townsend had spent more time explaining his songwriting inspiration, as his body of work is quite impressive.<br /><br />The general overtone of the book is somewhat somber, and not nearly as entertaining as Keith's autobiography. Several passages in the book give witness to a dark, self-destructive side--not unlike similar parts in books by and about Clapton, Hendrix and Garcia.<br /><br />However, this book is a must-read for any serious Who fan, and it has caused me to go back and re-listen to a few Who albums, which is always a good thing.

B00005JNQS|4.0|I've seen this movie at least twenty times and I enjoy it every time. Rodney is a great character. The relationship between him and his parents is nice to see too. It is very pretty to watch as well...the graphics are well done. I would say it was a safe movie to watch for most ages of children. Some bathroom humor but nothing past fart jokes as far as I can remember. Some young kids might find the bad lady scary but they don't make her too serious. Definitely worth watching. FYI when Rodney is at Fender's house look at the wall...great robotic version of the American Gothic painting :)
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A good, not great, John Corey story. John seems to be more cynical and sarcastic in earlier novels. He has always been a \\"bad ass\\" but more so in his home environment - New York. Bringing in Paul Brenner was also a great idea. As expected, Mr. DeMille excels in his descriptive details of landscape, characters, and surroundings. What's next?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Wish washy ending- felt disappointed but overall a good, interesting read.<br />Wish the movie could capture her images in more detail.
0316228532|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was extremely tight and well edited, and showcases the authors skill at composing beautiful visuals.  Not to mention her insane ability to pick apart the human psyche.  This is literary fiction.  It's not about plot, it's about people.  Snarky, backstabbing, troubled people.<br /><br />If you need a cheerful, happy protagonist to hold your hand throughout a novel, The Casual Vacancy is not for you.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It's hard to say I loved this book as it covers such a huge series of tragedies which led up to the great war and during it. I thought I had read most of the best books on that war in which both my grandfathers were involved, one as a stretcher bearer in France and one as a stoker at the battle of Jutland. The writing about the miners conditions at the time and the changes which came about in society both for rich and poor was very often heart-rending. It was very humbling to see what was suffered for us to be where we are today.
B0018STVHQ|4.0|For anyone interested in the working of kings and courts in England under King Henry the eighth, this is a must see.  A very human-interest oriented story.  Then ending is absolutely glued-to-the-screen viewing.  Natalie Portman's exit is absolutely stunning and heartbreaking.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Both my grandfathers were involved in WW1 and both my father and mother in WW2. The most surprising thing that comes out also in the book is that nobody could talk about either war. Consequently, I am always avid to know as much as possible about what really happened. This book is amazing in its coverage but also quite-soul shaking in it's decription of how Naziism came about and how Hitler took power. You have to read this so that it never happens again. Ken Follett presents the facts of his research in an easy to read(apart from the shock to your soul and spirit)format continuing the tale of the families encountered in the first book of the trilogy. I write this just 2 days before the 11th November. I will be at the cenotaph in my village in France to remember my grandparents and all the beautiful young people full of hope for life and love who have died in that war and all the wars since. I am lucky to be here and to have a life. After reading these 2 books, one realises how lucky one has been. There are wars all the time even now so watch your politicians carefully. I can't wait for the third book of the trilogy and will be reading the other two again on my kindle after a pause to recover from the shock.

0425263908|1.0|This book is bad, really bad!! The author clearly copied most of the concepts from the 50 Shades Trilogy. The characters were badly developed and not likeable as in 50 Shades of Grey.  Every time I read something that was copied from the 50 Shades Trilogy, I laughed!! The writing didn't even come close. At least the sex in 50 Shades was very relevant to the story line.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am never disappointed in a novel by Ken Follett! His first, Eye of the Needle is one of my all time favorites. Again, this is a wonderful book, amazing story and great cast of characters.  Follett's research is impressive - his historical novels are very accurate. I waited a year since reading the first of this trilogy, Fall of Giants to get the second. Looking forward to the final book.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|If you can shut off the critic inside your head you will enjoy 10,000 B. C.! I have a background in anthropology, history, linguistics, geography and biology. And, I could spend all day picking this film apart - BUT IT\\"S A FANTASY STORY! HELLO! Remember: FANTASY! That's what I paid my money for! Not a documentary or historical fiction, but a FANTASTIC, DREAM-LIKE story.<br /><br />Nor do you have to be a genius to figure this out!<br /><br />The movie works on many levels. First, as an adventure story, a saga, like Lord of the Rings. I felt swept away. It's also an enjoyable love story. The chemistry between the actors is excellent. I cared about the characters. In addition to being erotic! - Its been a long time since I've seen so many good looking men and women on the Big Screen all at one time!<br /><br />Very little of the violence is graphic or gratuitous. You can tell a fantastic story without blood and guts flying everywhere. It's also a movie suitable for older children.<br /><br />Tribal people and people of color are shown with respect. Their rich variety of physical features, skin colors, dress, languages and architecture are shown in all its glory. Before the White Man came, and ruined everything, there was mind boggling cultural diversity on this planet!<br /><br />What is most striking to me is the very moving and insightful portrayal of a Medicine Women performing profound acts of shamanism in order to help protect her people as best as she can. This is the very first time I seen such a pivotal role for tribal spiritual beliefs in a big Hollywood fantasy film! My hats off to the whomever wrote the screenplay! You did your homework!<br /><br />Granted the ending did bother me a bit. It begs the question: Did the ancient Egyptians actually treat their workers that poorly? If only the Egyptians didn't use slaves, and treated their workers well. And what a metaphor for the year 2008, where most workers in the world are treated like dirt and instead of whips, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.<br /><br />But I digress, this is a great movie. At the end a tear rolled down my cheek, and I felt good when I left the theater. That's all I can ask of a story. My money was well spent, for a change!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0738705756 The World of Shamanism: New Views of an Ancient Tradition]] and [[ASIN:073871562X Shamanism for Beginners: Walking With the World's Healers of Earth and Sky]] and [[ASIN:1848190816 Shamanism and Spirituality in Therapeutic Practice: An Introduction]]ps, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.<br /><br />But I digress, this is a great movie.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great to pass the time. Some games are a little stupid, but you only have to get so many points to actually beat the game and you don't have to beat games to unlock the other games, you just have to gain so many points. I down loaded this on my phone and my Kindle fire and it is definitely easier to play on the Kindle fire. This is because Amazon will only take updates that actually work with a device.  The frog game that a couple people have had problems with I figured out in secounds. They warn you ahead of time it is a matter of timming which lets you know that you will have to place your finger on the screen in front of the butterfly and not on it. Most of these games are hand eye coordination games and it sems as though the touch screen is not working with you but the truth of the matter is it is the user and that is what makes the game chalanging. So far I have found that to ne true for all the games accept one and that game is more a puzzle and I just cant figure it out. lol It is entertaining but if you don't like stuff to be to chalanginging this is not for you.
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|\\"Hellboy\\" seems like a film where everyone enjoyed the process of creating it.  The movie spews vibrant energy in every scene.  You can sense the joy that went into making it.  Its construction is layered upon bizarre makeup and nonstop special effects; which helps portray the joy of the film.  I have never read the graphic novels based on the \\"Hellboy\\" franchise, but I have a feeling that the film sticks close to its roots.  The story is preposterous, but it is exactly why this film differs so much from other comic book adaptions.  Other movies within the genre take themselves very seriously; however, \\"Hellboy\\" seems to be crafted for the joy of entertainment.<br /><br />The movie, directed by Guillermo del Toro (\\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"Blade II\\"), opens with a scene involving Nazis, who in a desperate scheme to summon forth the Seven Gods of Chaos, manage only to summon a little red baby with horns and a tail.  Thwarted by Prof. Bruttenholm (John Hurt), President Roosevelt's personal psychic advisor, the Nazis do not get to finish their summoning of the Seven Gods.  The Prof. coddles the baby demon with a Baby Ruth bar, eventually raising him to become a warrior against the forces of hell.<br /><br />The film, which is filled with terrific action sequences, seems to be transformed from the pages of its comic book counterpart.  Hellboy gets the hell beat out of him, but manages to pick himself up and rise to the occasion, with the occasional comedic one-liners.<br /><br />Ron Pearlman takes on the role of Hellboy, one for which he seems extremely suitable.  I mentioned earlier about how fun this film seems to be, most of this is due to Pearlman's terrific ability to transform human emotion into his giant red character.  When Hellboy chomps down on his cigar, it is hard not to want him to kick the crap out of some hideous creature; however, it is Hellboy's personal life that makes his character interesting.  It is hard being a 7-foot demon, he doesn't fit in with society and trying to keep a love life must not be easy.  It is in this regard, that the character is fleshed out.<br /><br />With characters that range from a giant red demon to an amphibious crime fighter, it is hard to imagine that you can feel emotion for them, but somehow you manage to care.  This placed alongside del Toro's beautiful ability to tell a wonderful tale, you get a film that I place in high regard.<br /><br />I give this film four of five stars.y and trying to keep a love life must not be easy.

B00913DPW2|3.0|I agree with previous reviews; this has great graphics but is entirely too difficult. The hints are worthless and there is little logic to your quests for objects. Any game can be hard if the items you're looking for are completely hidden or illogical. I finally gave up and resorted to the walk through and at the end when I realized I was missing 4 puzzles pieces  I quit. You definitely get your money's worth but expect to be frustrated a lot.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I wasnt expecting more than a silly vampire movie when I rented this, but it turned out to be a fantastic action movie. It also had a good bit of humor and some pretty decent \\"pop out and startle you\\" moments. The vamps were pretty gruesome and the effects were good. The acting wasnt campy or contrite and the storyline, as odd as it sounds, followed Lincolns life pretty well. The writers managed to adapt parts of Lincolns life and actually make it seem like this could fit into it and explain some of his decisions pre and post presidency. They did a great job! Give this movie a shot, I actually ended up buying it after renting it here. My only quip is more with Amazon than the movie itself. 5 bucks to rent a movie? Really? Redbox is a buck fifty! Come on amazon, lower your prices!

0307949486|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson is a book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading overall. However, it took me a while to actually get engrossed in the book. The first chunk of the book was just business talk, which as a seventeen year old, did not interest me. I would most certainly describe it as a novel for a mature and educated audience for Larsson is definitely one to write in much detail, almost so that I was a bit overwhelmed. This being said, I often found myself reading a paragraph over and over to be able to absorb its meaning. In the first half of the book, I was fascinated by the short one or two page appearances of Lisbeth Salander. This, of course, broke up the long, fourty to fifty page appearances of the main character Mikael Blomkvist who never quite captured my fancy. He was far too ordinary of a character for my taste and his appearance often lead to more business talk, which as I have stated before does not interest me in the slightest. I found myself groaning when seeing the name \\"Blomkvist,\\" but Lisbeth Salander kept me reading until I got to the very interesting part of the book. The plot within the novel built up very slowly, which made me very impatient. However, when the interesting part came along, it captivated me and I couldn't put the book down. It was definitely worth the wait. As everything starts to line up, it is impossible to stop reading. I started to feel a real emotional connection to the characters and was truly interested in solving the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance.

Basically the headset on a scale of one to ERECT. It's about a 32. 32 out of Erect is excellent. Only issue is the wireless signal sometimes gets feedback if you have anything else using the same frequency in the area.. So... Wifi or microwaves.

B007REV4YI|4.0|The 50-year old James Bond franchise has come of age. Whilst retaining superbly realized edge-of-the-seat action sequences, `Skyfall' is a pacey and character-driven film with strong script and fine editing; a deeper, darker, more grown-up thriller for a mature audience. It's by far the best of the three Daniel Craig reboots, and a strong contender for the best Bond film to date.<br /><br />In addition to a complex and absorbing plot full of unexpected twists, both 007 and M are revealed as three-dimensional characters with their own intertwined back-stories, their complex psychological motivations driving essential elements of the narrative. Director Sam Mendes summarized his version of Bond in `Skyfall' as \\"a combination of lassitude, boredom, depression and difficulty with what he's chosen to do for a living\\".<br /><br />Although 007 is the hero of the piece he's far removed from any of his predecessors. Here Bond is part-product of a tragic childhood; ruthless, damaged, flawed, unfashionably devoted to country (pay attention to Bond's word-association test at MI6 when he's being assessed for fitness to return to active duty to gain real psychological insight into the character). When recalled to duty he's old, tired, has gotten out of condition and can't shoot straight. The significance of the film's title is revealed only in the epic denouement, which takes us into young James Bond's childhood past and - with the spectacular destruction of the iconic 1960s Aston Martin from the early Connery films - symbolically turns a page in the history and re-defines the franchise for a new generation.<br /><br />The film might have been less of a success without Javier Barden, who plays the villain of the piece to perfection: genius cyber-terrorist Raoul Silva, a study in complex psychosis from M's murky past. Barden brings genuine creepiness to the role. Sporting dyed blond hair he reprises in part his screen-stealing performance in the Coens' `No Country for Old Men' combined with the more theatrical elements of Batman's Joker. The intelligent and sometimes witty recurrent dialog between Silva and Bond throughout the film is screenwriting excellence.<br /><br />There are no mediocre performances here. Naomie Harris is perfect as the unambiguously devoted young field agent assisting Bond throughout the action. Just the right amount of sexual frissant between Harris and Craig ensures the triumph of an unexpected but satisfying twist in the final reel, when her real name is revealed (you may know already but if not, this review ain't gonna spoil it for you). Young Ben Wishaw takes Q into new territory with a fine performance as a brilliant but personable cyber-geek whose razor-sharp intelligence and cool-head-in-a-crisis wins Bond's genuine respect. Ralph Fiennes is excellent, emerging as something other than what he initially seems to be, and Judi Dench as vital co-leading character bows out of the series in style with a powerful career-defining performance.<br /><br />Overall `Skyfall' delivers an absorbing viewing experience on many levels. There's much to savor here: strong, almost novelistic storyline; first-rate performances; fine script; action, mood-perfect soundtrack and - rare in a Bond film - some genuine emotional involvement with the characters who, for once, we start to care about.<br /><br />Now, Bond 24 is something to look forward to.bined with the more theatrical elements of Batman's Joker.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|For some reason I have found it difficult to like the first film, Stallone & Lundren's fued & Dolph's betrayal, then being shot & living, was just unnecessary & slowed the pacing down in the first film, although Eric Roberts & \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin were effective villians, they were a bit underused in the first film, but with this second film, we get a better pace & everyone this time around get equal screen time it seems, plus we get more Arnold & Bruce here, like many people in my age group I grew up watching Arnold, Stallone, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, & Jean Claude Van Damme, to have them all in the same movie is somthing I never thought I would see & I have to say this made the film for me, you don't have to like the first to like this one, this one carefully avoids the mistakes of the first film, Stallone, Jason Stathom, Dolph Lundren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, & Jet Li all return here, although Li bails in the first 15 minutes, everyone else is in on the action more this time around, not just Stallone & Stathom, & Arnold & Willis get to do more, & Chuck Norris does his trademark character, the \\"Lone Wolf' type character very well, & you just can't help but laugh a bit, Willis' character Mr. Church sends Stallone & Co. to stop a mercenary (Van Damme) from getting nukes, & mayhem ensues with guns blazing & explosions galore that really take you back to the 80's, there isn't much I can say that others haven't already covered, except to say that even though everyone is showing their age, they all still have it, & reminds us viewers how it is you do an action film, today's studio executives & the younger action stars they are trying to push could learn a thing or too here, this is old school & it is still the best, & it is clear that everyone is having a good time doing just that, reminding Hollywood how it is done, I loved it, I just wished the first could have been this good, if they do a third film, they really need to get Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, & the godfather of them all...Clint Eastwood, imagine Clint as Stallone's mentor & former teacher, these three have to do a thrid film, they had just as much influence as Stallone, Arnold, & Willis in the 80's & 90's, many have mentioned Kurt Russell, I agree, however I would not be as disappointed if he didn't do it as I would be if they can't get Mel, Ford, & Clint, all in all, this is a good soild action film that will make you yearn for the 80's & 90's all over again.

We have a sordid love affair with a blithering bimbo who decides to go ice climbing in high-heels. Then there is the \\"bad guy\\", a NAZI of course, who just wants to drink wine, eat veal and sit by a warm fire while our courageous brothers risk their lives trying to climb a huge ice cube wearing pajamas and tennis shoes. In the end the brothers all die and the ice-bimbo moves to New York to take pictures of black musicians (presumably to prove her open-minded anti-NAZI bona-fides). But, of course, she'll never love like THAT again. Blech! This movie is trash!

1451629192|5.0|LOVED this book!  SOOOO well written, I couldn't put it down!  Jaycee Dugard is one brilliant, brave and special women.  I wish she could know how very many people she has touched,  I, thankfully, have never had something even similar happen to me or a loved one but her positivity, strength and hope somehow give me strength and hope in my own life.  That goodness can prevail.<br />I SO recommend this read!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I couldn't wait for Christmas or my birthday to receive this as a gift from my family - so I bought it for myself! I received it sooner than I expected from Amazon and upon opening it, I was not disappointed by the packaging (as some have been), the contents, the sound quality of the CD nor by the DVD's audio and picture quality. Sure, it would be a plus if the DVD were in HD or even in Blu-Ray, but I've now watched it 5 times (3 times with family or friends) and I don't see the flaws - if there are any - that keeps me from enjoying the concert!<br /><br />I have the 'Bad' album (still looks brand new) so I'd heard and love all the songs on Disc One. My favorites on Disc 2 (Bonus Material) are 'I'm So Blue', Streetwalker, and the Spanish and French versions of 'I Just Can't Stop Lovin'You'.<br /><br />I really didn't know what this set consisted of - just that it included 3 Cd's and the DVD of the July 16,1988 show in Wembley Stadium. I was surprised to find a 16\\"x 20\\" 2-sided poster with MJ dressed in the 'Bad' outfit on one side and a full-spread photo of him from the concert on the reverse. It also includes a sticker of the 'Bad 25'cover! All of this is in a black box/case (5.5\\" x 5.5\\") with a thin silver strip on the sides and the 'Bad 25'logo affixed to the lid . It has a magnetic closure which securely holds the contents and I found it to be appealing to the eye - not cheap or gawdy!<br /><br />Another surprise: 2 full-color, booklets that are filled with pictures and other details about the album and tour.<br /><br />This set would make a great gift for any MJ fan - young or old. Diehard MJ fans likely have most, if not all of these songs/albums in their library, but the bonus songs and extras in this set make it worth adding to their collection - if for nothing else but having the case to display!

B000FA5SMK|5.0|A nice addition to the detective genre.  There are lots of interesting twists and turns and the women are not just weak little paper-doll cut outs.  I will read the rest of the books in this series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I got this book, because my sister thought I should read it. I have to say I'am not into erotica kind of books, but this one is truly something else. I could not put it down, that's how captured I was by this book. I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone, but more of an adult, because it is pretty graphic. I read the whole series and I can't wait for the movie to come out if it does.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I purchased the deluxe game to get away from all the ads in the free game.  But it's hard to write a good review when I can't find the site/location to do the download.  After buying it, it gave instruction to go to 'all apps'.  Where is that??
B0088TG252|4.0|I rented this movie for a plane ride. It's a really good movie, both characters played the role well. It was very suspenseful. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was sorry to have reached the end. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.

B00631VJIC|4.0|My boyfriend is a huge fan of SOA and he loved this product. They absolutely picked the best music from the series. Every time we listen to it we picture the scenes the music was played in and it's a lot of fun.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Interesting Concept, however I did not find this novel to be up to the normal standards of a Chriton book.  The book turned into a rather shallow depiction of the students and did not seem to establish a scientific foundation for its basic premise of the subject.  I would have preferred to see more of the science and less of the personal traits of the characters.
1611761565|4.0|The book was well written, fast paced, and informative. The only part I did not like was towards the end he started letting his political opinions and dislike for the current president show. This should not be expressed in a factual account.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The first season offers an \\"escape\\" that I love.  And now that I have the dvd I can watch it whenever I want.  I would recommend for anyone who just needs to get away from reality.  =)
B005LAII0S|2.0|While it was amusing to see Julia Roberts portray the Evil Queen, the film as a whole is greatly lacking. An interesting aspect is the twist on the portrayal of the Seven Dwarves. \\"Prince Charming\\" is a rather flimsy character. When Snow White manages to dance with him at the castle and tell him of her dilemma, he pledges to help her; however, he almost immediately decides she is insane and ought to be stopped. He is disdainful, arrogant, offensive, and ridiculous. This film could have been very strong; instead, it is glaringly lacking on so many levels. I cannot recommend it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is for someone who does not mind trying again when it isn't right. It is challenging and fun. It provides a book to help with figuring out the best way to build your pig. I like that it makes a person think and try again.

0061992860|5.0|This is a very small book that you can carry in your<br />get home bag, bail out bag, or camping gear.<br />Full of information you would need if you were<br />thrust into a survival situation.
B002TZ3C6I|4.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />Well what can I say? Overall I really enjoyed this book.<br />It started off with a high school student named Zoey. It starts off with her seeing a \\"dead guy\\" by her locker. She is talking with her best friend called Kayla when she suddenly gets Marked by the \\"dead guy\\" who is actually called a Tracker.<br /><br />  From here on, everything in Zoey's life turns upside down and she goes from, normal high school student to Vampyre in the making.<br /><br />  I thought this book was really good to say the least but at times I found the writing to be somewhat childish with some of the things she says but I still thoroughly enjoyed it and will be buying the next installment for my kindle :)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was so well written that I found it hard to put down. The characters stayed with me.  Definitely recommend.

B009GX6TQ6|4.0|I have been watching NCIS: Los Angeles for a number of years, but recently had a DVR malfunction that forced me to wipe all the data from the hard drive.  I lost a couple of episodes of a number of shows, which I was able to access from HuluPlus,but Hulu doesn't offer CBS shows.  Fortunately, Amazon Prime came to the rescue.  I was able to buy the episode of NCIS: Los Angeles that I lost.<br /><br />I really enjoy the characters, especially Hetty Lange.  I never miss an episode and with Amazon Prime as my backup, I never have to!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Purchasing this book was dependent on having been exposed to the author and the story line.  It was easy to want to continue the saga and I purchased the remaining two stories.  This insured that the story would be complete.<br /><br />Unlike the first book, this was easy to anticipate and accept the new challenges presented.  The events did not seem so far out of character and as a result, the reading pace was quicker and the book ended too soon.  The ending was weak leaving a sudden stop to the story.  It slammed on the brakes and left me feeling that I needed to take a break before reading the last story.
B004XANKVO|4.0|I was sceptical when i first purchased this bag, as i had already been through 3 others that did not make the grade.  I have had the bag now for 3 months or so, and i appreciate it more each time i use it.  the pockets, space and organization is perfect for my mobile office.<br />I can easily fit my 11\\" alienware M11X laptop, iPad, 7\\" samsung tab, portable 14\\" toshiba monitor, (2) external hard drives, wireless mouse, security cable, power cables, chargers, adaptors, etc... and yet i STILL have room to spare!... i have no idea how it all fits so perfectly, but it all does!<br /><br />Very happy, and would highly reccomend!
B0016BP0PW|4.0|wonderful movie of the turbulent late 60's set to the music of the Beatles - underlying meanings and inferences make the music come alive
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book; John Grisham rarely disappoints. Though I wanted to finish the book to find out<br />\\"who done it\\"...I also didn't want it to end.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Loved this book I pre ordered and waited with anticipation to receive it.I was not disappointed she's a master at story telling and making you fall in love with the characters and there lives. I am waiting anxiously for the next book. Till then i will reread the old ones. Great book genius author.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I've spent a lot of time mulling this picture over as I wanted to check several Batman graphic novel references before reviewing (see TRIVIA & SPOILER section below).<br /><br />For starters this trilogy this does not disappoint and it's an awesome and indelible finish to arguably the best Batman movie series ever. Yeah, I enjoyed the Michael Keaton/Tim Burton take on Batman but the quality dropped each movie thereafter to the point in which it was as ridiculous as the old and goofy Adam West TV series (you can watch them on the Web or syndicated TV). It wasn't worth watching by the third installment but I digress.<br /><br />So it's 8 years later and crime seems to have diminished in Gotham but Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale once more) is in isolation (still on a cane per his injuries in the previous picture) and in emotional mourning for the loss of his alter ego. But if that was it, well, we wouldn't have much of a story so a new supervillain, Bane, shows up and at a later point captures Detective Gordon (who is carrying a guilt ridden note over the cover up in the previous film) and begins a devious plan which will call up The Bat once more.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Wayne's emotional mourning is reflected in his outside world with Wayne Enterprises close to bankruptcy as it tries to develop a fusion reactor. Then, Bane strikes and puts Gotham into nuclear peril and nobody is just walking away from it.<br /><br />What follows is Bruce Wayne's voyage from broken man to the Batman most of knew and loved in the first picture. This is more of a mental journey than one of physicality.<br />In fact, even though this tale focuses more on Bruce Wayne than Batman it also gives scenes to the supporting cast and their inner turmoils. Selina Kyle a la Catwoman is played by Anne Hathaway who does an impressive job of switching personalities on the spot as needed. Alfred Pennyworth plays the loyal and only remaining \\"family member\\" to Bruce Wayne and is emoted by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman is back as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is Gordon and Tom Hardy plays Bane (who felt subdued compared to the Ledger take on Joker).<br /><br />Yes, that was  Cillian Murphy playing the unmasked Scarecrow (did you see the bits of straw in his hair?) who was one of the death judges. Matthew Modine has a small role but does a credible job as Foley who in the end makes the right heroic decision. I would surmise that the Talia character (played by Marion Cotillard) was perhaps the least engaging of the bunch. I should mention that Blake, an up and coming detective, is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />I have something to say about the thematic elements but I am going to put it down in spoilers as my information is a minor spoiler. You can probably read it without being spoiled by the movie and it might even give you a better perspective but I can see a few \\"sensitive\\" types whining.<br /><br />Overall, this is Sterling Silver quality and therefore tremendously satisfying for a trilogy well concluded (I already said it but wanted to hammer it in again). I'm very pleased that this graphic novel based character was executed as a serious work and done exceptionally well. Now, I can point non graphic novel readers to it just like I point non fantasy readers to LORD OF THE RINGS or GAME OF THRONES.<br /><br />SOME TRIVIA PIECES (Wiki and IMDB sources): the Batman suit consisted of over 110 separate pieces and several had to be remade during production. Cinematography was intended as raw and gritty. The Batman cowl was sculpted from Bale's face. Bale is the first actor to portray Bruce Wayne in three Batman films. Jessica Biel and Keira Knightley both came close to playing Catwoman. Almost 10,000 extras were used at the stadium scene.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan said that this film's theme deals with \\"Pain\\". For Batman Begins, it was on \\"Fear\\", while The Dark Knight deals on \\"Chaos\\".  According to producer Emma Thomas, the filmmakers elected to shoot the film in Pittsburgh to emphasize Gotham's immense size and scope and because \\"they literally shot every inch\\" in Chicago, where the previous two films were shot.  Christopher Nolan wanted Marion Cotillard so much for the role of Miranda Tate that he modified the filming schedule to accommodate her pregnancy. Cotillard started filming two months after giving birth.  According to costume designer Lindy Hemming, she took two years to design Bane's coat; it was inspired by a Swedish army jacket and a French Revolution frock coat, to make Bane look equally dictatorial and revolutionary, \\"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together as he passed through some very remote places.\\"  Bane's theme is a chant which features the term \\"deshi basara\\", which is Moroccan for the word \\"rise\\".<br /><br />When Selina Kyle disappears from a rooftop, Batman's remark \\"So that's what that feels like\\" is lifted directly from the DC graphic novel \\"Kingdom Come\\". Even the circumstance is similar, except it was with Superman.  In the film there are a total of four Oscar winners: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, and four Oscar nominees: Anne Hathaway, Gary Oldman, Tom Conti, Liam Neeson.  Bruce Wayne's doctor visit in which the doctor lists off all the degenerative injuries to his body (lack of cartilage, scar tissue, etc.) and the use of a mechanical knee brace both are reminiscent of Kingdom Come, where an older Bruce Wayne requires the use of an exoskeleton to move due to years of physical wear and tear on his body.<br /><br />Each movie from the Dark Knight trilogy is 12 minutes longer than the previous one (Batman Begins is 140 minutes, The Dark Knight 152 and The Dark Knight Rises 164).  The Lazarus Pit/Bane's prison scenes were shot in the city of Jodhpur, Rajasthan. (India). In the comics, Batman visited India to learn how to control his pain.  Though the fate of the Joker is never revealed in the film, the novelization does mention his whereabouts in passing: he is the lone resident of the newly-rebuilt Arkham Asylum, held in solitary confinement and thus has no one to \\"play with\\" as ultimate punishment for his crimes.  Although used to soften a landing, this is the first movie in the Batman \\"Nolanverse\\" where the cape isn't used to glide.  Patrick Leahy:  US Senator from Vermont cameos in the movie as a Wayne Enterprises Board Member. Leahy, a fan of Batman, previously cameoed in The Dark Knight and Batman and Robin.<br /><br />The budget for this film after tax credits was $230M and so far it has made ONE BILLION at the Box office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus to A; ACTION SCENES/SCOPE: A to A plus ; THEMES/BATMAN FOCUSES: A minus to A ; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2012 (at the movie theater); OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.<br /><br />SPOILERS/THE MOVIE: As pointed out by \\"Filmkiller\\" and a few other movie reviewers the whole trilogy deconstructs the role of a hero and challenges the typical belief that we must rely on one heroic person or a group to save us. In the second film the incident between the two boats demonstrated the people of Gotham becoming the heroes of this trilogy as well (remember when both boats refused to blow each other up and mucked up the Joker's plans?).<br /><br />However, the cover up at the end of the second film demonstrated Batman and Gordon were willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they felt the people of Gotham could not handle it and arguably that sometimes people need to be lied to so that their hopes are kept up.<br /><br />But then in the final movie of the trilogy you see Alfred telling the truth to Bruce Wayne about Rachel choosing another man over her and that Wayne is going to die if he keeps at being Batman.<br /><br />The high casualty rate for the police of Gotham as well as many other people arguably made this the darkest of the three Batman movies. That said, the police of Gotham (which includes a doomed Foley played by Modine) step up and deal with taking their city back.<br /><br />I would argue that Wayne trusting Selina and then forgiving her and having a relationship with her is arguably not true to the graphic novels but I suppose you could argue this was the early Batman who was not so cynical and suspicious.<br /><br />SPOILERS/THE GRAPHIC NOVELS (several of these are my own ideas and then further down are from IMDB.COM)<br /><br />Christian Bale has stated that he would not play Batman if Robin appeared anywhere in the trilogy. Christopher Nolan agreed not to include Robin as it would undermine the dark tone of his series. At the end of the film, Detective John Blake's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) legal name is revealed to be \\"Robin\\", and he quits the police force and is shown to enter the Batcave by following the instructions presumably left by Bruce Wayne in his will.<br /><br />In the graphic novels just like the movie Bane really did break Batman's back. In the graphic novels another person took on the Batman mantle while Bruce Wayne recovered<br /><br />Gotham Occupied similar to \\"No Man's Land\\" when villains became judges to execute people and the law went into hiding, which included Gordon.<br /><br />Catwoman and Batman didn't really have a serious relationship as far as I could tell but it wouldn't surprise me if some alternate universe DC take did something with that romance. The biggest issue in the graphic novels is that Wayne simply didn't trust Catwoman and she rarely proved herself as more than a temporary ally.<br /><br />Robin had an unusual intro which makes me think that actor might be carrying the series forward as Nightwing (the superhero name the first Robin took after he left Batman).<br /><br />In the graphic novels Talia and Wayne had a child named Damian (who would become one of the Robins later) and Wayne at one point has mixed allegiances. In this film Talia is more of the bait and switch element.<br /><br />In the comics, Bane carried an apparatus that contains a steroid that amplifies his strength and fighting ability. In the film, the apparatus he carries contains an anesthetic as he is in chronic pain. (IMDB)<br /><br />The filmmakers cite the \\"Batman\\" comics 'The Dark Knight Returns' (an aged Batman operates in a future Gotham), 'Knightfall' (Bane pushes Batman physically and mentally, causing him to burn out) and 'No Man's Land' (Gotham descends into gangland territory and are cut off from the rest of the US) as major influences on the film.  (IMDB)<br /><br />When Batman is chasing after Bane for the first time after the stock exchange robbery an older policeman tells his younger partner to \\"sit back, you're in for a show\\". This is an almost direct quote from the graphic novel \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.\\"  During the fight between Bane and Batman in the sewers, Bane lifts Batman above his head and drops him across his knee. This is a direct parallel to the first fight between Batman and Bane from the comics where Bane broke Batman's back during the \\"Knightfall\\" story line.  (IMDB)<br /><br />At the end of the movie when Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is exploring the Batcave, his black jacket has a blue stripe that dips in the middle on the back of it. This is very reminiscent to the character Nightwing, who the first Robin eventually became.  (IMDB)<br /><br />In addition to the numerous elements from the \\"Knightfall,\\" \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" and \\"No Man's Land\\" storylines, the film also borrows from the \\"Legacy\\" storyline, which involves Bane becoming Ra's Al Ghul's successor and plotting with the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.  (IMDB)<br /><br />The villainous character portrayed by Liam Neeson Ra's Al Ghul, who died by the end of the first movie, makes an appearance before Bruce Wayne's eyes, claiming to be immortal the whole time, only to be revealed as a hallucination. This is a reference to Ra's Al Ghul's comicbook counterpart in which the character IS immortal by the use of Lazarus Pits.  (IMDB)<br /><br />In all three Nolan Batman films, the spiked gauntlets on Batman's arms prove essential in defeating the main villain. They shatter Ra's Al Ghul's sword in Batman Begins, disarm the Joker in The Dark Knight and damage Bane's mask in The Dark Knight Rises.  (IMDB)

B0087DFIYA|4.0|Mel Gibson is back after several years from film in his usual edgy, \\"to the point\\" action rogue archetype character (how's that for too many details?). Tale opens with Gibson and his pals being pursued by Mexican police and not quite making it to the border. Gibson gets sent off to a prison which turns out to be prisoners with their families with a bunch of shanty towns formed around the crime boss of crime bosses. Along the way he picks up a meager number of allies, including a boisterous boy who is special in that he has the only matching liver and blood type for said crime boss.<br /><br />Gibson wrote this very engaging script. The movie went straight to DVD but it's hard to state that's because of Gibson's public image since he has been in a few big budget movies as of late.<br /><br />Public reviews for this action thriller have been high and DVD sales have been over $7M so far (it came out in May 2012).<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; BAIT AND SWITCH FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early October 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Understand that when you buy a pack of 4 500+ page books as an eBook, your percentage complete will essentially never rise. I cannot tell you how disheartening it is to read 2-3 lengthy chapters and have the percentage meter not budge.<br /><br />That aside, the books are amazing. I got into them after watching the first season of Game of Thrones, and reading them as a complement is a great experience. Some characters change, a few who were required only to meet HBO's nudity quota never appear, and most just have an even more in depth and nuanced look then the show gives them.<br /><br />The books feel like historical fiction written in another world, which is a new feeling for me. The fantasy elements are far from overwhelming (though their presence increases as the series continues), and frequently it feels like an amazing book of stories from medieval times in a different world.

0385344228|5.0|This novel kept me rapt from the first page to the last. Landay knows how to construct a story and develop characters that you feel you might know. The plot revolves, ultimately, around the possibility of a 'murder gene' and the idea that a violent nature may be something one can inherit. In our society today, that is certainly an interesting and relevant topic to explore.  As you read, it's likely you will keep trying to decide, for yourself, if Jacob is guilty or innocent.  This is a highly readable book, well written, well contrived and in its own way, a genuine page turner. If you like this book, I highly recommend THE GOOD FATHER by Noah Hawley. I read that book right after DEFENDING JACOB and it was a great choice. Landay's novel is a very exciting and enjoyable read and strongly recommended; you will be highly engaged as you go through the family drama that is central to the plot.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have never liked Tina Fey. I don't know why, I just didn't like her. So when Bossypants came out, despite the wonderful reviews, I decided not to read it.<br /><br />Then this past weekend my husband and I had to attend a family gathering in Georgia. This meant a long car trip, and I can't stand reading a book in the car. I decided to join Audible.com and download something to listen to instead. I chose Bossypants because I wanted something funny, and something my husband wouldn't mind.<br /><br />Bosspyants kept me entertained the entire time. I couldn't stop laughing. I love that it was narrated by Tina Fey! I think that added to it's greatness. I also loved her sense of humor and the fact that she let you inside of her life. We learned about Tina's days in college, as a child, at SNL, at 30 Rock, and even enjoyed several glimpses into her family life.<br /><br />You won't be sorry if you chose this book. It's one that you won't mind relistening to either.
B0068RHGJM|1.0|If this is the new Nightwish, I'm not interested.  Hard to tell as this was meant to be a specific music/movie project and (I think) intended to be a little like a soundtrack.  It explains why the music is ALL OVER THE PLACE with very little thematic elements and flow.<br /><br />Here's my theory... Tuomas wanted to shift the music a bit before Tarja left but her vocal stylings werent appropriate for the direction he wanted to go (probably a small part of her firing), and having Anette as the new singer allowed him to get a little farther from the symphonic/opera sound they previously had (and did incredibly well).  I think with Dark Passion Play they were trying to ease in to a new sound, and it was fairly good - an adjustment from what we were used to, but not bad.  I think they were heading to a place that wasnt good for their music, and Imaginaerum is proof of that.  Anette's voice is pushed to a place that, in my opinion, symphonic metal does not belong, and the sweeping orchestral drama they once had is now cheap and limited.  They went from pros and being the primary pioneers of the genre to sounding like amateurs.  Anette's voice has limited them even more and I think is a big part of the problem, but not the biggest.  I think Tuomas is trying too hard to write very deep concepts and lyrics and he's lost sight of the beauty they had in the past.  There's no beauty in the words here and specifically the last song (song of myself) made no sense and was ridiculous... not moving and profound like I'm sure he intended.  It is possible to do that in only a few words, you dont need a novel.  Nothing is catchy anymore.<br /><br />I wish I could speak more articulately on the issue, but what it boils down to is that Nightwish should get back to their roots, find a more operatic singer and find their epic sound once more.  Hopefully with Anette leaving, they'll do this and spare us another hackneyed album like this.  Not worth the money

B001QXE0OC|5.0|In 2008, Selena Gomez came to a decision that if she were to become a music artist and put out an album, she didn't want to be a solo artist and instead formed her band The Scene. Once the band was formed in 2008, they began production on Kiss & Tell. It was released on September 29, 2009 and spawned two singles: \\"Falling Down\\" (released August 25, 2009) and \\"Naturally\\" (released January 19, 2010). This album has more a pop rock and electro rock vibe than their later albums and that is why it is so special. The best songs on the album are the title track \\"Kiss & Tell\\", \\"I Won't Apologize\\", \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Crush\\", \\"Naturally\\", \\"More\\", \\"I Got U\\" and \\"Tell Me Something I Don't Know\\". To me, this will always be my favorite Selena Gomez & The Scene album. :)

B008KE3960|5.0|Creative spin on tower defended... addictive.  There are in game purchase options but It did not seem like some games where you have to pay to keep playing. I might be wrong though. It seems you can eventually gain enough gears to use in shop to get more planes may take a whole though.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Product is well made, stand is sturdy, color is bright, unit is compact and easily fits into small spaces, price is fair.  Great gift for the Kindle user.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love movies and TV shows alike that are about zombies and/or the end of life as we know it. Natural disasters and man made disasters are great and I will watch them all. Good or bad. The walking dead is by far my favorite. The actors are fantastic and show a real bond that has formed on and off the screen. They make the show seem all to real. They show what true family is all about and what you can accomplish with real teamwork.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Welcome back, Dr. Scarpetta!  My main complaint with the last several books was that Dr. Scarpetta seemed not quite human.  She was wooden, paranoid, and extremely unhappy.  This time the human qualities were back, there was no conspiracy to \\"get her\\" by named and unnamed people, and the story wasn't so dark and depressing.  I loved that she is so concerned about animal welfare, and her interactions with the cat she rescued and the dog from the last book were endearing and believable.  Thank you Ms. Cornwell for making Dr. Scarpetta someone I want to spend time with again.  Welcome back!
B005GFPZYK|1.0|Did not like it; thought from the title it was an action book do. Not reccomend it to action readers
B007JMW46U|4.0|This is a classic no more no less, if you've never read Sherlock Holmes before your in for a treat.
B00633W614|5.0|Just as great as part 1 of the trilogy.  Excellent story telling!  Its going to seem like forever until I can continue with the story.  Please write fast Mr. Archer!
0762777931|5.0|Awesome Mantra, and super inspiring! I love the way Kris breaks down everything in her own terms.<br />I can't wait to get through the book and start my new Crazy Sexy lifestyle!
0553382152|1.0|The person behind this book has been deceived by demons and or is seeking to destroy peoples souls by following the hell bound lies in this book. I have been reading the  refutation of this book in the book \\"The Glory of Heaven\\" by John MacArthur. I also read a refutation in \\"Invasion of other gods\\" by David Jeremiah, & \\"One Minute after you die\\" by Erwin Lutzer. Do not believe the lies in Embraced by the light for its written by someone preaching another gospel (Gal 1:8-9).
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Was pretty excited about this movie as I have been a big fan of the Alien series. this was ok but not nearly as good as the previous movies. The cast was ok not great.
B009ESIGHI|4.0|The song was not part of the theatrical release version of the film so nothing has been 'cut' from the film - it is true to the original.<br />The song was an addition to the LD and P&S versions.<br /><br />From the look, the 2005 P&S version reused a previous transfer and wasn't all that great. Disney probably didn't want to add the song for the new WS transfer then. Still, I don't know why they couldn't have included it with seamless branching in the new HD transfer. Especially since it is reprised at the film's finale.<br /><br /> And while I like the song, my wife always thought it brought the story to a screeching halt. I would have to agree, but I  still like it. However, I would guess that is why it wasn't included when shown in the theaters.<br /><br />I haven't watched the entire Blu Ray yet, but the samples I've watched look and sound great. Highly rcommended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked this book.  While I was Bared to You I felt that it was a real copy cat to the Christian Grey series.  I didn't fell that way with this one.  It has suspense, love, hate and sex!  I couldn't put it down!
B007THA4FI|5.0|When I read the synopsis of the to-be-published J.K. Rowling's book I immediately fell for it and decided for a pre-order. Having started to read I doubted a little whether the book was a good purchase but as the story evolved & unraveled I liked it more and more and, having finished, I was able to appreciate even the introduction I had found less appealing before. The author indirectly attacked not only today's society but also secret fears of many individuals as well as \\"illnesses\\" the contemporary society bears upon its shoulders. Unlike many books written these days, this one leaves a message behind.<br /><br />To conclude in one sentence, I expected something different, nonetheless I do not feel disappointed at all; and I recommend the book to everyone who seeks a book where they read not only the story written, but another story in between the lines - the story they might know from their very lives.<br /><br />5 stars, definitely.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game. can't stop playing it. this game helps me relax after once I unwind down for the night.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book is for entertainment, not some classic literature. But the autor reminds the british classics novels describing a modern romance, full of sex, with all of the ingredients that were present on the 1800s... It was worth reading the trilogy.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Having never read this very old novel that is often required reading in school, I took the plunge and almost drowned in it before its completion.  I found it to be depressing with its tale of abuse and relationship problems coupled with old English wording. Nevertheless, I had to know the ending so persevered to the end. Now ready for something lighter and enjoyable.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book differs greatly from most of Grisham's previous legal books firth in that is difficult to place it in the realm of possibility and second being told to the reader as a story rather than letting the plot unfold.  I can live with the first but I like to experience my fiction in real time heavy with dialog and character development.<br /><br />I wanted to quit many, many times until about 2/3 of the way through when he starts to pull everything together.  Till then, you have neither clue nor deep interest in what our protagonist is perpetrating.  For as much as we are in Malcolm's head, the reader never really gets to know him.  As they say in high school English, he is a bit of a flat character. We know or find out WHAT happened to him and we can infer from his behaviors his feelings but I sure don't know who he is.<br /><br />To me, telling a story as opposed to writing a narrative is the easy way to compose a book.  I was disappointed and yet I continued to read to the end which I found satisfying.  Go figure!
B004LROUNG|2.0|This is just not a very interesting read, actually to be honest very pedestrian and boring. It does not tick any of the boxes, not interesting legally, as a thriller, as a story; just yorn.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I really like this app! It's very helpful and keeps  you organized. I love being organized and this app really helped me since I make checklists and little notes to myself ALL the time. You can make them as long as you like and cross/check things off your list.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|Very good book! Liked it allot and was very funny and adicting! Easy to read and most entertaining! =very good book!
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|I must admit that I am a huge Seth Godin fan.  I'm yet to read something he's written that hasn't stirred emotional or thought.<br /><br />In my opinion Linchpin is one of his finest pieces of work.  It speaks to a need that is both personal and enterprise wide.<br /><br />It speaks to our societies need for leadership.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to become the best version of them self.<br /><br />Ryan Hanley<br /><br />Author of [[ASIN:B0078HTSLA The Social Tools Book]]
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The time keeper gives an excellent message.  I appreciated the many thought provoking quotes, which I copied.  A good book for a book club to discuss.  Take the time to read it.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have seen a lot of apps and printers promise simple and fast wireless printing over the years, and I have to say this app is the first one to truly deliver on its promise. We have a multi-device network both wired and wireless and very often getting an app to sort this out just doesn't work. This one however was simply install, sign up, and hit Print. As a pretty tech-savie user not a lot impresses me, but count me in for HP ePrint.
B00899F0G8|5.0|If you enjoy mystery/teen drama this is the show for you. Every episode draws me in and makes me want to know more. There always seems to be an unexpected twist to the story everytime you think you figured out who A is. Can't wait for more!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|If I had to guess I'd say Mr. Grisham wrote this in a day, and consumed a nice bottle of red wine along the way.  This is a fast paced, completely unbelievable story that is a five star read if you are stuck on a 5 hour flight and don't care that all of the action is totally implausible.  If you were looking for something a lot more realistic and believable, as I was, this is a clunker.  Admittedly the Author's notes stated that no research was done prior to or during the writing of the book and that it was basically a story he penned very quickly.  The story starts well enough and devolves into a very predictable plot (I use that word loosely), that ends with a nice little 'everyone gets a pony for their birthday' ending.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I've enjoyed all of Ford's other books that I've read, but this one lacks the effect. I cannot recommend it.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As promised, Grisham is back to being the mastermind he is.  I'm sure the Racketeer will soon become a movie.  The leading role just has to be Danzell Washington. A perfect fit.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This definitely has a more \\"indie\\" feeling than Fun's newer CD, but \\"Aim and Ignite\\" is still a gem. Lots of fun upbeat songs that you'll find yourself singing even after the iPod goes off. Highly recommended!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game very much!  while I'm playing the free version, I still derive great enjoyment from this game!
B0069UP2PI|3.0|The premise of the movie is good, so was the effort to bring dramatization. Although each individual segment could be a seed for a full length movie, in total, the movie fail to be one movie. Some may find it appealing and artful, I found it lacking to be what I can naively term \\"movie-ness.\\" The casting was great, so was acting. The suspense was there, but what I experienced is not a beginning and an ending of a movie, rather explosion and disappearance of a movie with much prospect. In other word, to me, the movie started as a solid piece, then got diluted. Pass, you won't miss much.
B0098WWEH8|5.0|After buying a number of great albums this year among them from bands like; The Antlers, Metric, Bon Iver, Black Keys, St. Vincent, Of Monsters and Men, Spoon, Silver Sun Pick Up's and Radiohead to name a few I've been very happy with the music that has been released this year.<br />Besides St. Vincent's Strange Mercy all the above artists are favorites of mine and I had no problem taking a chance in purchasing their albums. Except for Grizzly Bear.<br /> I bought Veckatimest awhile back and to this day it remains an album that I would rank along side my all time favorites . After Veckatimest I went back and bought Yellow House & Horn of Plenty. These two I enjoyed in bits and pieces but not as albums which made me hesitant to get Shields. Even the sample listens were not enough to convince me despite the fact I know that their songs will make some dramatic shifts.<br />After finally making the purchase I can actually say that this album in my opinion is a better than Veckatimest which I'm certain it's going to be compared against. I'm not sure which album is more accessible to a new listener because I'm too accustom to their music at this stage, but this album somehow has taken their up tempo and the slow songs and balanced the album beautifully. So while nothing about Grizzly Bear sounds familiar I think any new listener would find more to grab on to here than Veckatimest which I cannot get my girlfriend to listen to ( her loss ) because it is such a different sound.<br /> Shields is an absolutely entrancing listen from start to finish. At the point I get through the entire track list and the first song plays again, I realize that I've heard the whole thing but am ready to listen again which I have easily done three or four times at this point.<br />I don't do that much but that's the music we are all looking to find. Something that you can't get enough of and it's rare that it happens as it should be. I can't pick out any single tracks that I would say stand outfrom the rest as they all can definitely stand alone. Though you certainly get the impression that they should be played as an album.<br /> If you've heard it comparing this album with In Rainbows from Radiohead is an easier reference point than with their previous efforts, not that they sound alike, but in that they have a similar feel in tempos, mood and the way it seems that they have perfected their sound. They are very confident in a sound that seemed experimental a couple albums back. So even though it might seem as though they are about to come off the hinges sometimes things come back into sharp tight well timed focus.<br /> It's hard for me to do this album justice but it is my favorite album in a year that had some great releases. I hope that someone takes a chance on it. Its an album they should be proud of and that I think you might enjoy.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|As others noted, 'Live at Hull' is somewhat redundant given it was recorded the night after the legendary 'Live at Leeds' set. Given the 2 performances, I think The Who made the right decision all those years ago to release Leeds instead of Hull for several reasons-<br /><br />1. The Leeds show just has more....umph, more electricity in the air. It literally teeters on a knife edge of chaos at times. Hull does not.<br />2. John Entwistle's bass is more up front and cuts through the mix much better on Leeds and shows, very clearly, why he was one of the best.<br />3. Following onto #1 above, Townshend's guitar and Daltrey's vocals are more urgent and spontaneous. The Tommy songs from Hull are much closer to the studio recordings.<br /><br />But....Now we come to why I think Hull IS essential and that is Keith Moon, or more to the point, how Keith's drums sound. On 'Live at Hull,' Moonie's drums are waaaaay up in the mix and right up front, They crack like rifle shots and every manic fill is clearly heard. It is, quite literally, the greatest recording of Keith Moon I have ever heard anywhere. Townshend has said that he often didn't follow Moon's drumming like a guitarist would in a traditional rock band. Instead, he would often keep the beat and Moon would play over it- very much a role reversal. That is heard on 'Live at Hull' in spades.<br /><br />If you are a Who fan, this should be a no brainer. 'Live at Hull' is a must-have and it will make you miss Keith Moon all over again.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|Although the box for this product shows a lady using it to listen to TV, this product picks up noise in ALL directions making it very difficult to listen to TV. If someone is cooking, walking around or a cell phone goes off, the amplified sound can be damaging to the ear, hardly a way to watch TV.<br /><br />So while it looks like a directional microphone, and the specifications talk about it being a \\"multi-element\\" microphone, when I took off the foam wind cover, I was disappointed to see a hollow plastic column and just a single off the shelf (standard) electret microphone element (the same kind used in cheap toys). This kind of microphone is very basic: [[ASIN:B005XIW1FQ Gino Small MIC Capsules Electret Condenser Microphone 18 Pcs]]<br /><br />It is also cheap feeling in general, using light weight plastic. From the picture, it looked like a serious personal amplifier that might be made of metal or aluminum, but it is just rather thin plastic.<br /><br />The included headphones are also very cheap, like the dollar store variety. I had to order a basic Panasonic headphone to at least be comfortable wearing them: [[ASIN:B00004T8R2 Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port]]<br /><br />Good idea, but this product doesn't appear to have been updated since it was first introduced in the 80s. The photos on the box are extremely dated.
081297381X|5.0|Its been a few years since I read this, but find its treatment of rare and potentially devastating events remains relevant. Economic reading for non-economists, it can inform you thinking on law and environmental issues beyond the narrow silo of investment. A pleasure to read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game presents a great chalange, there are many different challenging levels, and it really makes you think! I think that this game is for everyone!
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie had no story at all.  I was looking forward to seeing Matt Bomer dance since he is so talented..never even saw his face...waste of money..I paid $3.99 for a foolish movie..
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is the only app/game I've ever paid for the full version of, cuz my son loves the tv show, &amp; it hasn't disappointed!  It's an excellant game for children, as it teaches them to &quot;think outside the box&quot; &amp; come up with multiple solutions to each task. BUT, &amp; my ONLY complaint, (which has nothing to do with the game play itself) is that it's been quite awhile since we've been able to play this, cuz my 6yr old has finished every available level &amp; they haven't added any new ones in quite some time. So, for now, the free versions of Angry Birds Space &amp; Star Wars will have to take over as his most favorite games on my phone! (Until the new Fish Hooks game finally comes to Android!)
1594135851|4.0|What can I say. I really liked it. Since the first book leaves you hanging you feel incomplete of you don't get the second one. The action parts were exciting, however, sometimes I wish Collins would put a little more emphasis on some of the details. Sometimes it seems to go a little fast and I don't always get a feel for the<br />situation. However, all in all, I really enjoyed Catching Fire and look forward to reading part three of the series.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I have never been one to buy tech toys. I've only had my Kindle for 1 month and I have been loving it and every little thing I purchase to go with it. To order my Marware stand was like the hit for me. Great price, came in my favorite color and when I realized that it worked as a stand - I was to happy. I have ordered other Marware products and their price works just right for my budget.<br />Thank you Marware!
0061537969|5.0|My dog doesn't talk either. But from his facial expressions, I can tell she has a working brian and sometimes thinks in human-like terms. She is very observant and quick to forgive. As the old cliche' says, she has a mind of her own. That said, this author does a brilliant job of telling a multifaceted story from the dog's point of view. After 3 pages, I was thinking,\\"How silly.\\" After 6 pages, I was hooked. Skipped half a day of work to complete the book. If you have even the smallest fibre of human sensitivity underneath your skin, then this book is for you. A must read, and not just for dog lovers.

030759565X|5.0|I have been a faithful Smitten Kitchen blog reader for a few years. I was so excited when the cookbook was announced!  I pre-ordered my copy of the book and I received it this week....IT IS BEAUTIFUL! I love the photos and there are some great sounding recipes!

I love how the cover of the book differs from the dust jacket!

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Any time I feel like a fun challenge I go to this app! Love it! I would recommend it highly to anyone else who enjoys mental puzzle games.
B008FTAAG2|3.0|This is a pretty decent album overall.  It could do without the filler tracks, not a fan of 11:11 and Comanche is terrible imo.  But a lot of the other songs range from good to great.  Favorites are Burn and Whore.  I think it's definitely worth $6.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been thinking about reading Wool for sometime now and when I saw the omnibus edition that sealed the deal. Be warned, this stuff is so good you will not want to put it down. I didn't. The characters will remind you of people you've probably met and ate with in a cafeteria and got to know. They are fully developed, interesting, and draw you into their lives. The backdrops don't seem like backdrops and the descriptions never became wordy or overbearing; to borrow from the story; you'll be convinced by what you see in your visor. If you are a fan of the stories behind games like Fallout, movies like A Boy and his Dog, or books like The Road, read these! If you are at all like me, you will finish wanting to know more about these people and their lives and, well, you'll have to read them to know what else.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is super ultra cool game.as a longtime fan of starwars and angrybirds I think rovio totally hit the spot with this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much. if u have never played this game u should.it is so much fun. and u have so much fun
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|This is a refreshingly solid new album from Joe Walsh. I don't think it's quite up to 5-star status, but it's not that far off. I'd give it a 4.5 without hesitation. Songs with clever and/or touching lyrics, those trademark licks, and some tasteful use of synthesizers. What's not to like? Unlike some fans, I like the way that producer Jeff Lynne treated these songs, and Joe himself sounds happy and revitalized.  Maybe there isn't a classic like \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\" or \\"Turn to Stone\\" on here, but these are all very good songs. Really, not a stinker in the bunch. Longtime Joe Walsh fans should enjoy this one, even if some of them don't dig the production. For me, it's a bold, strong, and moving album of rock music.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This is the worst game I have ever put on my Kindle.  I could not figure out how to play it.  Even my grandkids - the ones the game was for - had no idea how to even start the game.  Here is a novel idea for the designers:  how about putting the instructions on how to play on the game.  All in all a big disappointment for all
B0089IGUP4|4.0|Now this is more like it; very good album! Not quite a 5-star recording, but a 4-plus for sure. I bought \\"American Slang\\" two years ago and was quite disappointed. It just sounded too samey and too derivative to my ears. But on \\"Handwritten\\" the songs seem to have more focus, more drive, more passion. At times, some of their tunes still strike me as being stuck in the same musical gear, but this time around I hear more nuance, more layers, and more tempo changes. No doubting the sincerity and passion of these guys, but it's all about the songs and the tunes and lyrics sound more polished and thought-out on this album. A few of these songs even get me out of my seat and waving my hands in the air. Anthemic? Indeed it is. And that's not such a bad thing. All in all, an impressive step forward for this band.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game that keeps on going.  Even when you run out of coins, you get more after waiting for a bit of time. I only wish that the coin walls would stay up longer.  You can only put through a couple of coins before the walls disappear.
B0063GORYU|5.0|What can I say, it is fun and that's because I win a lot. I often play this game in bed on my Kindle Fire.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Best show on tv- dramatic and artfully portrayed.<br />Claire Danes is an incredible actress. The writing is terrific with unpredictable twists and turns.
B0009W5JS2|5.0|Item arrived promptly and well-packaged.  My family really likes this movie.  They like all the action and adventure! They kind of missed Vin Diesel, but this was still great!
B004WR125O|1.0|You would think an Onkyo receiver and this gizmo would work flawlessly since they are made by the same company, but unfortunately, that is not the case.  Set-up was pretty stright forward, but signal is spotty at best.  My receiver is only about 30 feet away from my wireless router, yet the singal strength is 30 or 40.  This causes interruptions in play (if it plays at all) and trouble all around.  If I was further away from the wi-fi signal, I could understand the poor performance....I do not recommend this product.  Currently researching an alternative.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This was an absolutely awsome movie!  Great actors and great story.  Makes you really think about how our cultures began and what people will do when they completely believe in an ideology.  Even my kids really enjoyed it (while they learned something!).  A must-have for your video library.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|I'm not gonna make a half-essay long review like everyone else.<br />Simply put: EVERYTHING could have been better from the cast to the dialogue, special effects, music, etc.<br />It'll amaze you if you're a kid. But when you analyze the historical accuracy and all that stuff...<br />This movie seems like it had great potential but was definitely made on a budget.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Does really explain a lot wife was lost cause she didnt read the book movie just sucked.they wrote it like everyone read the book to know what was going on
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I opened the package and the case immediately felt cheaply constructed. I removed the case from the packaging and the mute switch fell off into the floor. I performed the water test and the case didn't leak but when I started to dry the water from the camera lens the glass window fell out. I don't recommend this case at all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun to play, but a bit difficult to play some of the games on the touch screen.<br />I enjoy games that you have to unlock levels on as well as games that are quick if I only have a few minutes.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|[[ASIN:B000W91RUG The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season]]Absolutely charming!  I can watch it one night and it seems just as fresh the next. The acting is superb and believable.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I had heard a lot of bad things about this movie from critics so when I first watched it I didn't know what to expect. Lots of people said it was confusing or full of holes and not really a prequel but a side-ways blah blah whatever. I have no idea what any of them are talking about. The plot was fairly simple and easy to follow. The idea was well laid out and not at all confusing. It was a very direct prequel to Alien. There was no beating around the bush, no questions about anything. The ending left it open for more story to be told, but certainly didn't leave much unanswered.<br /><br />The movie was visually, probably the best movie I've ever seen. To explain that a little better, the CGI didn't look like CGI, it looked real. It was like a cross between CGI and rubber suit technology. CGI always leaves me feeling like I just watched a cartoon and a rubber suit always leaves me feeling like I just watched a guy in a rubber suit run around. When the creatures featured here did their creature feature thing (say that 5 times fast) it left me with the feeling of; wow that was awesome.<br /><br />The chick from the dragon tattoo flicks did an extremely impressive job of equaling (if not surpassing) Sigourney's B.A. sci-fi chick image. She went from delicate religious flower to (Spoiler Alert (sort of))\\"I'm going to go ahead and carve myself up like a pumpkin to survive\\" in a relatively small amount of time. The most impressive thing about this transformation was it didn't seem rushed or false, it just seemed like she was truly terrified, and had no choice but to suck it up and take it like a boss.<br /><br />One thing a lot of people harp on, that I totally agree with was the scientists did a lot of really dumb stuff. I would argue though, that they were put under quite a bit of duress before they started acting ignorantly. I'm sorry, but if I'm on an alien planet and I discover the very first signs of life outside of Earth and then immediately discover that those signs of life were killed heinously by unknown assailants that may or may not still be lurking around the spooky caves I'm in, I'd probably experience a slightly heightened stress level. This could possibly be accompanied by a slightly lowered ability to properly assess my surroundings and act with the utmost clarity of thought. The scenes in particular that people are harping on, can be paralleled pretty easily to the original Alien film, which nobody seems to be harping on. Would I let in a crazy zombie-alien infected crew mate? Hopefully not, but I wouldn't let in a crew mate that had a giant spider-squid stuck to his face either. The thing we have to realize about horror movies in general is, if nobody did anything that allowed them to be put in terrifying situations, the movie wouldn't be scary. This is a movie about two scientists that want to find the origins of life, and a bunch of support staff that could care less about that and just want to get paid. The exception is of course, the always questionably unethical android that may or may not be working for \\"the company.\\" If those scientists didn't want to go out and explore, the movie wouldn't have gone anywhere. It would have been about a spaceship that landed on an alien planet whose crew then did nothing except say \\"this looks like it might get a little scary, lets fly back home for 3 years and report that it looked scary so we did nothing.\\" According to the critics, this is what would have made the film more realistic and therefore, more watchable. I respectfully disagree. Sometimes making stupid mistakes is what people do. That makes it more realistic than having a ship full of 180 IQ nuclear physicists that never make any mistakes or act questionably.<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is, this movie was awesome. Anybody that says it was dumb has a problem with separating fantasy from reality and realizing that sometimes one does not need the other to be good. I would say this was the best installment of the Alien franchise yet and I can't wait for the sequel. It was suspenseful, had an awesome story, fantastic visual effects and top notch acting from everyone involved.ent of the Alien franchise yet and I can't wait for the sequel.

B005LAII0I|2.0|[[ASIN:B0086DBE62 Mirror Mirror]]I didn't care for the changes that Hollywood made to the basic tale of<br />Snow White.  I didn't believe that it enhanced it one bit.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are inventive and bring a fresh new perspective to the music they play.  I couldn't wait for this release and was not disappointed one iota when I played it--it's fabulous!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I am continually amazed at J.K. Rowling's ability to create another world with very real characters. You are sucked into a small country town with immense problems. The only issue I had was there seemed to be no real plot. It was more a look into the twisted and sad lives of the towns  people. This book is not suitable for younger readers. It is a tiny bit dark but a great read. I look forward for her next book.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|The Amazon Mobile app is wonderful! I am able to find an item in another store and compare the price on Amazon by using the app to read the product SKU. If Amazon offers a lower price, I can order the same item through the app. I might have to wait a few more days to receive my item, but I save money. Very convenient and easy!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Brought back childhood memories and realized it was about being what we think we can be :) Brave, smart, etc.
0876391277|5.0|This book made the extended sounds on the saxophone very approachable.  Lays out how to make some of the more difficult sounds to produce in a very clear way.  People should check this out because the techniques described can quickly add new colors to someones playing.  It's also great to learn which prominent saxophonists made these sounds popular.
0316286850|4.0|I love this book. I have had it since I was 16 (now 22), and because I didn't have anyone to teach me how to properly put on make-up, this definitely taught me how. Although it doesn't have more styles as I would wear, it shows you how to complete many looks along with teaching you how to properly groom your eye brows. It's a great learning experience for any and all people who love, or are curious about make-up!

044024238X|5.0|It may be a tad unrealistic, but hysterical at times.  One of my preferred Kinsella novels.  She is an author who will give you a guaranteed smile and laugh.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Talk about accessible!  Several of my piano students told me to watch these incredible musicians on Youtube.  These young musicians are watching, copying, and being inspired.  The CD has been terrific to listen to in the car and I just visualize the Youtube scenes I've seen to go along with the music.  Thanks much.  Connie
0385342063|5.0|I loved this book.  I have read it twice since I bought it months ago.  I will say the footnotes are difficult to manage on a Kindle.  Once I figured out how to get back to my page after viewing the footnote it wasn't as troublesome.  BUT the story is excellent and hilarious at times - so that one flaw in that format is not enough to keep you from reading it!
B00136NVH4|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite albums of all times. Guess that's saying my age, but I think anyone who listens to even one song, will see why its so great. Its fun and more fun. Try it!
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|This is classic Rand and a tribute to individuality.  The final scene with Gary Cooper atop the towering building says it all.  I win!

B0055L5M4S|5.0|Having suffered from the brightness associated with my new LED monitors and the eye fatigue that goes with it. This product has taken the bite out of brightness, smooth glow from the back of the monitor makes for less strenuous long time viewing.<br /><br />Only gripe is that the lights don't go off when PC is put to sleep, but thats not a problem of the lights.

B004N44SOI|5.0|\\"The Heroin Diaries\\" was a five star release. Just a visceral and infectious rock experience. Could Sixx and the boys do it again? The answer is Yes AND No in my opinion. It isn't better than \\"The Heroin Diaries\\", but it is still a damn good rock record. The songs are creative and catchy again. I have to admit that it took a few listens just because of my high expectations, but it definitely grew on me. It is just great to hear good riffs, catchy songs and original vocals that don't sound like all of the generic voices out there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed this book until the last few pages. Once you find more out about the main girl you start to realize how into herself she was and I didn't like that (which is probably how I'm supposed to feel). Also the ending REALLY let me down. I really, really wanted to let the book (and I did for the most part), but obviously the ending is where you leave off and I didn't like it. At all.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|This is a great movie, especially if you are in to independent films. I saw it in the theatre, and loved it. Joseph Gordon Levitt, and the other cast members were great! But it's not a movie for everyone. If you even got to the point where you are reading this review, you would probably like it. It's fraught with hidden innuendos and undertones. Loved it enough to buy it. It's dark, it's funny, it's sad, it's awesome!
0156027321|5.0|I ordered Life of Pi and my book came super fast! It is in great condition just as the seller said it would be. I am finding this book to be very interesting and I can hardly put it down for a second.
B007THA4FI|2.0|So far this is very slow reading and quite confusing.  There is not enough character development so I forget each character from one chapter to the next.  Story is not captivating.  Expected much more from this author, I think she should stick to children's books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was absolutely perfect! I recommend re-reading the first book prior to reading because there were a few parts that i had forgotten about. I read in one night! Couldn't put it down and can't wait for the third!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is awesome, lots of great action with some great one liners that are both clever and funny. Can't wait for the next one!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I think this book is better than 50 Shades of Gray. Awesome book and I can't wait to read Reflected in You. This is my first book to read by this author, but I am sure to try many more!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this following the hype but was disappointed. There is very little story and what story there is seems very long and drawn out. I found that I couldn't put the book down but that was because I just wanted it to be over. It will be a long time before I read the next one.
B007SGM084|3.0|After hearing this book from every girl I know, I decided I has to read it, just to see what the talk was about. Nit going to lie, if you are looking for a deep and interesting story, you have wasted your money. But if you are like most of society and want some entertainment this will do it. This was a quick read, I did all 3 in a weekend, and though it was kind if predictable in plot, the kinky kept it interesting to read.<br /><br />I would put these books under, a fun way to waste a day away.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I travel for a living, so every ounce counts. This case adds only a few ounces to the weight of the Kindle Fire HD, and only a few millimeters to the dimensions, so it's very compact and lightweight.<br />I don't tend to charge my Fire while I'm using it, so having to open the case completely to attach the charger isn't a problem for me.<br />I'm very pleased with this case, and highly recommend it.<br /><br />Edit 12/5/12: Although I'm still pleased with the dimensions of this case, and that it's still looking sleek and practically brand-new, I'm a little concerned that the auto sleep/wake feature appears to be wearing out. About as often as not, when I undo the elastic and open the case, the KFHD does not wake up. While this was not a huge selling point for me for this case, it's only of little concern; if the auto sleep/wake is something you're looking for, however, you may want to look elsewhere.
1463707606|3.0|I removed this from my list because I found a book that appears to have better illustrations of the assembly of some forms.  This book appears to be for people more accomplished at Origami than I.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I enjoyed the entire album. My two favorite is Sepremacy and Animal. Compare to the Resistance album it seems a little more mellow. Theres no high's or low's it's just consistantly good.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer<br /><br />It was pretty good. Not as good as my fav Grisham, The Litigators, but a fast read. Worth $10<br /><br />To my mind, the title is a misnomer. I thought a racketeer was someone politically connected engaged in illegal activites, ie Al Capone.  And then maybe I am too old school.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good but not his best.  I read many mysteries and action novels, but the suspense in this one was a little obvious.  I would still recommend it though as a good easy read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I never review anything, but this CD is so wonderful! There are very few CDs that I can stand to listen to without constantly skipping songs, but every single song on this disc is amazing. I'm an artist and I love listening to inspirational music while painting and drawing and this is the perfect music for that. I even have some of the songs on my mp3 player to take with me running (and I'm pretty picky about the songs I choose to exercise to). I highly recommend this CD!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show and this season is the best so far. I just hated seeing some many people go already.
1878424319|5.0|This book is amazing.. a quick read..  great advice to help liberate you from the things that drag you down in life.. making assumptions..taking things personally..mis using your word and regrets in life from not doing your best.. since I've been practicing these agreements my life has changed for the better.. if u read the book with an open mind and heart it will help.. i try to read this book often as a reminder.. with practice it can change your life
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. Easy to use &amp; view. Great way to remember &amp; catagorize items found on the web or within the app itself from other users boards.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|Uneven, but good! It's been way too long since the last Aerosmith record. The guitar work is excellent on this album as Joe Perry rocks out. It really is a fun record to listen to. That being said it goes off track at times, but just listening to Joe Perrys guitar work is worth the price of admission alone. I'm not really to sure why it takes this band so long to make an album, but when they do it's worth the wait.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love this standing case for my Kindle Fire HD.  It is much sturdier than it appears  and it locks in so well due to the plastic stabilizing brace built into the case.  You can also charge your Kindle without having to remove it from the case.  I absolutely am so glad I purchased this case.  Worth every penny. Darlene
B008673ZAQ|4.0|After reading the first book I was left with mixed feelings.  I didn't really like the characters to be honest.  This book changed my opinion completely!  Great book and worth trying out.
0385344333|1.0|I am an avid fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series. I have read them all--with mostly great pleasure--- and impatiently wait for the newest one.  I just finished THE WANTED MAN--what a slow clunker!  The book drags on for 350 out of the 400 pages (total) before Reacher springs into action. That's only 12% of the entire book and even the last 50 pages weren't that great. When you compare this new book to THE KILLING FIELD, where he zaps 6 guys with a sap, then carries the bodies to a panel truck and calmly goes to the basement to wash his clothes--that's action. Or in PERSUADER, where beats up the huge Paulie and dumps him in the ocean, that's what I look for in Jack Reacher. I hope the next,new, Jack Reacher has more thrilling action that only Lee Child seems to be able to offer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very fun, but it costs $6.99 on the appstore. Just go to 4shared.com and you can get it for free. Thanks and the best luck to you.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Great book!  I Loved reading every minute of it.  Fast delivery. I  Would buy from this seller again.  Best book
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another good one by Grisham.  Had me rapt throughout; couldn't put the book down.  Stole glances at the book during the day couldn't wait to get home to finish.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I agree with the Pentagon that this book shouldn't have been written so soon, but I'm sure glad it was anyway. It gets straight to the point and is very exciting. Thank you Navy SEALs. Y'all are the baddest men on the planet! I wish I was as athletic and disciplined as y'all are. Real role models and heros.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Nice & helpful app! It gives me info on my Kindle power status when I open it.  Great when on the road & it is free!
B0015S6AFU|5.0|I just received A brand new original 1995 double vinyl LP copy of What's The story Morning Glory from a fantastic Amazon seller that sold it at a used price and I've got to say this brilliant work of art sounds ten times better than the CD ever did. It's presented in a holographic soundstage that surrounds me In musical details that have always been lost in the CD mix. There Is an naturalness to the music but with amazing presence and finesse within these grooves that makes the listener want to play this album over and over again. In comparison the CD shows its aggressive digital nastiness that I now find so irritating. I can only describe it as pushy or not allowing the listener to relax and fully take in the signal that's being presented them. That has always been my complaint with the CD format since I forced into switching over In 1987 from a superior analog format that wasn't making the recording Industry enough profit at the time which Is the same complaint they're still making 25 years later.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|This is a superb Collector's item for all Bond fans.I'm probably talking to the converted. A pity Skyfall theme couldn't have been included. Love it.
0316228532|5.0|This is a book to come into with an open mind and a willingness to read past 80 pages. For those who do make it past the slow beginning, the book is definitely rewarding. This is not the 8th Harry Potter book, and it's important not to have the expectation that it will be like Harry Potter. This is a stand alone book that is amazing not because of its plot, but because of the depth of the characters. No character in the book is black or white, and just when you think that you have correctly classified a character as weak or mean, J.K Rowling throws something in to change your mind completely. The Casual Vacancy draws the reader into the complex relationships of a town in England. The town is so realistic that I found myself thinking of the people in the book as real people. This is a book will stay with you for days after you finish it, and will make you question the way you live your life. The Casual Vacancy proves J.K Rowling's exceptional writing skills and shows that she can make anything interesting to read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really love these guys; Excellent music, perfect quality, impressive inspiration. They do unexpected stuff, always pushing the limits.<br /><br />But I have to say this: Even if their music is very good, one of the thing that marked me about them was their videos (watch them on Youtube!).<br />And until the end, I hoped they would put a couple one their DVD... but no, nothing.<br />If you've never watched their videos, than this DVD is really worth it. But if like me, you associate all their songs to it's video, you might be a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I'm still happy to have bought it to help them finance their work, but I think I'll continue to watch them on Youtube.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I like a wide variety of music and I have to say this album is amazing. I think it is probably the best i've heard from any artist in the last year or two.
B004OR199G|5.0|Reading \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" made me reminisce about my old 5th grade days as the book is set up much like a social studies textbook, complete with short chapters, captioned pictures, and even a main points summary at the end of each chapter.  While I used to dread reading those old social studies text books, I was excited to read this book as the Carr assembled a fresh, modern, helpful, easy- and fun-to-read user guide about how to align one's body, mind, and spirit.<br /><br />I particularly loved the colorful pictures.  I could imagine that even the strongest veggie hater might view the vibrant, vivid, fresh vegetables that were depicted and be somehow magically allured into trying them--perhaps even just one bite!  The images made the veggies look so fresh that I felt like they would pop right off the page for instant consumption.<br /><br />Other reviewers noted concerns about the \\"colorful\\" language (aka curse words) in the book.  While these words popped up here and there, it didn't bother me as it allowed me to feel more personally connected with the author as she let her full personality shine through and used an authentic, believable, everyday young woman kind of voice throughout the book.  While it didn't offend me, I can understand how the language might offend some so if you are bothered by the notion of seeing a swear word here and there you might want to try another book.<br /><br />In \\"Crazy Sexy Diet,\\" Carr gives advice on a range of holistic health topics from juicing, to meditating, to pooping (and everything in between)!  The information is health and nutrition 101, so this book would be great for someone new to the subject matter or for those who want general explanations about why certain health/well-being recommendations are commonly made.<br /><br />Reading Carr's book was like getting a gentle nudge from a girlfriend to take better care of myself.  I appreciate that she gave a gentle push without throwing me over the edge.  She encourages readers to take one healthy step at a time.<br /><br />An \\"A+\\" for this adult-version health and wellness textbook.  Note: I would have given extra credit if she had included more recipes.  Perhaps I'll just have to check out her newest book for that.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!!!!!!!<br />All of you people should read this book.<br />Great job Jeff kidney.sorry if that's not how you spell your name.
1589795474|5.0|I was mostly aware of the philosophy presented in this book when I entered the work force in the mid-1980s.  When the first edition came out in 1996, I was very happy to see the principles of wealth building that I had learned from my uncle had been validated by academic studies.  The book just inspired me to keep on that path.  By the time I reached age 50 I had accumulated a portfolio of investments worth in excess of $1M (not including my home) while never making more than $70k/year.  Nope, I never started a business, I just diverted my discretionary income into slow-growing, boring investments.<br /><br />The results of the recent US election have left me discouraged and disheartened because it appears most of the electorate still don't get it.  In fact, they don't have a clue.  As usual, lawmakers have targeted the big salaries for increased taxation and not the assets of high net worth individuals, a point that is made in the book.  Hopefully it will stay at income re-distribution and not wealth re-distribution.  If that happens, we're all in trouble.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies so I wanted it in Blu Ray.  However, the audio on this Blu Ray Disc is only Dolby Digital 2.0, not Dolby Surround Sound.  I thought when upgrading to Blu Ray the audio would also be improved.  That's why it got only one star.  What a disappointment!
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Space Battleship Yamato was a blast from the past. Anyone who remembers the old cartoon or Starblazers will love this movie. Even though it is subtitled it was very easy to follow. It is a Live action movie. It is not an exact remake of the original but is very close. It is the Iscandar story with a few changes.<br /><br />Here is a link to the item:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005H5H3LW Space Battleship Yamato - The final battle (All Region, English Subtitles, Uncut)]]<br /><br />As usual shipping was quick and hassle free.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Badly written smut. No story line and the theme repeats itself over and  over. Nothing in the ending would entice me to read anymore of this hyped up tripe.
B006WXHJNU|3.0|This movie was good but didn't live up to my expectations lots of good action but seemed to drag along
B000MTPANQ|1.0|No - I really wasted my money.  The sound quality was sub-par and the video was awful!  They had some really washed out video of Neil playing but, on many songs they didn't and simply showed a reel-to-reel tape recorder in a chair (get it?)  This was a total waste of money as I looked at it once and never will again. What a dud!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game, and it's easy to play.  Nice variation of bejeweled.  I like the different levels and special blocks as well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has done it again, this has been a great novel, and I strongly recommend this book, to all Grisham fans..
B008PNBU30|4.0|I Love 3daysgrace.  I went to see them in Baltimore Oct. 24th and they rock the songs from this album incredebly.  Of course they play many tunes.  Transit of Venus has some great songs like Chaulked Outline. I really like all the songs.  You won't be dissapointed. Adam is a great singer.  I think this record shows a different range of his voice, widen his capabilities as a singer. Awesome.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is another great game that I have enjoyed very much ...Love Angry Bird also but this game is differant and just as much fun playing ...Keep up the good work and add more games ...
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is humorous and adventurous. I found myself chuckling outloud! The chapters are short, thus making the book a quick read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is awesome. because it has so many different games and you can play all of them just by getting enough points you can buy a game my favorite is milapede I am not sure how to spell it but it is my favorite and remember if the game asks you to rate it do it and you get 250000 points FREE. just for rating the game ghats how many points I got after dating it!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|haven't. played it too long but I'm already really liking it!  remembered the one I played as a kid and this is fun :)
B0086221SS|4.0|Michelle Williams continues to prove that she is one of the best actresses today in TAKE THIS WALTZ, but that's not the only reason to see this film. A true-telling tale of adultery and a married couple who is trying to pick up the pieces in their fractured relaionship makes TAKE THIS WALTZ one of the sleeper movies of the year. A little long near the end, but it's definitely worth watching! Interesting role for Seth Rogen too, but I liked it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is awesome from beginning to end. I highly recommend it to everyone who is into comics and action movies
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|Start Up Nation is a very comprehensive and exciting book. It is amazing what the Israelis have accomplished in 60 years. From sand to a diversified county with so much talent. Their expertise is being studied by many countries. I read it on my kindle and now my husband is reading it.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I always wanted to learn to play the piano. this isn't a teaching program, but you can still get the feeling while making a beautiful noise.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|Well I guess I am not the target audience being a 40 something Mother and not a youngish geeky man.  I think you would like this movie if you like the comics but otherwise, it just seemed so pointless.<br /><br />I was also very annoyed by The Hulk.  To start he could not control his anger (just like in the tv series of the same name) and was a danger to others but then suddenly, he could control it and use it as he wanted to while working with others!  I either missed something or this is a bad continuity error in the story.<br /><br />Not a fan.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This is my favorite game at the moment, the only thing that would make it better would be a bigger action button, sometimes I miss it and hit something else instead. I can't wait for more levels!!!!!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The story is well known and, therefore, predictable but there is some great acting from Charlize Theron in this movie as well as fantastic cinematography.  This movie proves once again what a great actress Charlize Theron actually is and Kristen Stewart should take note from her.  Kristen Stewart is cast as Snow White and, in and of itself, this would make good casting but you just cannot forget that she is currently playing Bella in the Twilight saga which comes across as much the same role and acting as this one.  The moody looks, the love triangle, a lot of nighttime shooting, yes that can describe both this movie and Twilight.  It would have been better to cast someone else at this time.<br /><br />The dwarves were hilarious and a number of British faces that I recognised from other favourite movies.  So funny see their faces on little dwarf bodies - Ray Winstone as a dwarf anyone - laugh out loud.  I did have some tears for the dwarves as well at one point but won't say why as it would be a spoiler.<br /><br />In the extended there is some quite graphic scenes that made my stomach heave slightly.  I assume these are not in the regular version, so if you are at all squeamish, don't watch the extended version.<br /><br />Well done movie for the subject matter but dropped a star for the casting of Snow White.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I was super excited to see this movie, it had all the guys I like. Boy was I dissapointed! Dumbest movie ive seen in a while. The plot was non existant. I was expecting more. Thank goodness I didn't buy it. If you don't want to take my word for it I advise you to rent it first.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best movie this summer comes home to Blu-Ray! Please don't think twice about getting this one. It comes with some funny little extras, but the real reason to buy this flick is to simply pop it in the player and watch what can only be described as and epic movie experience. Yes other superhero movies came out this year...but lets be honest you can't mess with the best! Each character brought to life by amazing actors and action that's truly over the top but totally amazing to watch. Have a fun time with the heroes that saved summer 2012!
B006MW3VC4|5.0|Great, great, great! One of the best shows I've ever watched. Great acting, costumes, stories. You can't help caring about these characters as if you knew them personally.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Like others said - fine since it was free - but my son played with this and then I couldn't get out of it.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|Not a bad game but at the end of level 1 on the high platform there is no landing area so it is impossible to complete. If fixed rating will go up.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I look forward to the \\"Harry Bosch\\" new releases and in fact go back and re-read the earlier books from my library.  The Kindle makes it so much easier and convenient.  If ever a serious crime were committed against me or a family member I would hope it was an officer like Harry Bosch that was assigned the investigative responsibility. His tenacity in seeking out criminal enterprise should represent an example for police to follow.
B009G78EE2|5.0|A friend of mine showed me the music video to 'Thrift Shop'(which IMO makes the song 10x more enjoyable). Went home and watched the video again along with a few more on YouTube. I then decided to go ahead and buy the album. No regrets. I enjoy most of the album and have been listening to it almost daily since I've purchased it.<br /><br />It's not my favorite genre of music, but I do enjoy some rap. This album is a refreshing change compared to the content of mainstream rap you hear on the radio.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read this book while I reread the fist one. It was just as good as the first. I didn't want to put it down. My children laughed at me and my sex books which i throughly enjoyed.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I like this movie and, finally, found a movie that both of my grandsons (5 & 10 yrs) enjoyed watching - start to finish.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009RI4FRU Moonrise Kingdom]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read this book twice back to back. Wish my husband liked to play like this and as often. A movie will never do justice to this book because there is no way to go where my mind went.
B008SVFX96|5.0|This is a must have album if you enjoy blues/rock/truth.  Outstanding musicianship and lyrics.  This is how we used to rock but people got lost along the way, \\"Aftermath of the Lowdown\\" brings them back to the path of what music is.<br /><br />I have been an avid Richie Sambora fan since 1999.  I have bought both of his previous albums and I liked them.  I think I appreciate \\"Undiscovered Soul\\" more than \\"Stranger In This Town\\" but still really like S.T.T..  I am so proud of Richie who has been like a friend to me in my times of need with his music.  This album delivers so much, I pray for him and his family daily.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Again could not put this down!!, I can not wait until the movies are out, I am sure they will be as amazing as the first
B009CFYRCG|5.0|What, rate the Dude? Really? WOW.<br />Saturday, Amazon, is Shabbos, the Jewish day of rest. That means that I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't f***ing ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as sh*t *don't review movies*!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|My girls I coach put me on to this and omg I can not put it down great style of writting I look forward to the rest and the movie
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book that I would recommend to anyone. I could not put it down. The story of over coming all the odds to survive.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Ok I love reading but have never been able to read a book in less then a month...... This changed with this series!!! Such a great read had a week and a half of very late nights a long days as I could not put this down
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! I can not wait for book three to come out! It's such an easy read! I read the 50 shades series and think that this series is much better written!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good reading. Fast paced with lots going on between Eva and Gideon, both intimate and adversarial. Never, ever gets boring or slow.Good sub-plots. I like the characters. Having read the first book, I had to read the next. I could not put this down once I started and even when finished went back and re-read certain chapters. Only drawback for me: descriptions of her clothing. Sounds like it was written/described by a man, not a woman. Totally recommend this for fans of the new erotica.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking Dead is the best thriller of this year.  Surprising twists and turns around every corner keep you at the edge of your seat.  I think highly of this series and would suggest it to a friend.  Looking forward to many more.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|its a really awesome game!! I'm so glad I got it!! at first its a little confusing but on the end its one of the best apps.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|So, the majority of Android tablet devices are not supported? (Kindle, Kindle Fire)? This game gets a one star until that bug is fixed.
0316228532|1.0|What a bummer of a book. Are people really like this? What a waste of time. I can only think of how depressed Jo must have been spending months with/creating these characters. I expected amazing from her. Didn't get it.
B007SXB498|5.0|A wonderful journey into another era.  The writing is pure music, the author billiant.  So enjoyable on the screen, but an even more special experience to read.  I have it on my tablet and read while on the treadmill.  It is truly entertaining.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Mayer manages to continue evolving as a musician and this album allows him to grow-up some more.  There's definitely a feel of \\"country\\" to some of the songs but the way he encompasses blues and rock into this songs completes the sound.  His effortless ability to deliver on lyrics and music makes this a very enjoyable album.  Highly recommend.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Always a fan of Christopher Hitchens.  This was a privilege an insight a farewell from Christopher.  I was touched and deeply sadened to read his final words, so brilliant to the end.  I will miss him terribly.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|You have got to try this..it is absolutely The Best Angry Birds yet...sound effects and characters are terrific and I love the bonus rounds.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This is the first I've read by Blake Crouch and I have to admit I really enjoyed it.  I found it easy to get invested with the charachters and loved all of the twists and turns.  It was fast paced and very entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have read several books about near death experiences. This book is written by a neurosurgeon and he writes like I would expect a scientist to write..somewhat dry but certainly believable. His experience is amazing and the condition he had is downright scary.  I am glad I read it. It supports the fact there is life after life. I purchased this book  using my Amazon acct. and read it on my kindle. Love that electronic tablet and love using Amazon!
B001FB0WBK|5.0|I stumbled across this DVD on netflix and was completely blown away. I had not even heard of Tommy Emmanuel, nor experience any of his music until I rented that DVD. Since then, I bought several copies of this (on Amazon, of course!) and gave them as gifts. In addition, I have now attended a concert in February 2012 in San Francisco to see and hear him in person, along with enjoying other DVD's of him and many of his CD's.<br /><br />To say he is talented is insufficient. He is extraordinary. I play guitar myself and it is so obvious he is from another planet when it comes to playing the guitar. I have never seen anyone make it look so effortless, and even more than this, so much FUN! He seems to be lost in joy the whole time he is playing, whether he is playing alone or with another fine musician.<br /><br />Center Stage was filmed in Chico, California at the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company auditorium not far from where I live. How perfect it was that this DVD was my first introduction to the great Tommy Emmanuel.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I liked the movie when I saw it at the theater. I thought it was worthwhile to buy it. So, I did. I was not disappointed. There was lots of action. The plot of the movie was great. The actors and actresses were perfect for the parts they played. I look forward to the sequel (if there is one).
0345803507|5.0|Just like the description it was perfectly new. Edges were still sharp from the manufacturer and fresh bits of paper shred in the box. Love the book and delivered right on time.
B008FPZQRO|4.0|I've been an ELP fan since the '70s.  Yeah, that makes me \\"unyoung\\" but that also makes me one who's experienced this amazing trio of musicians in concert a number of times.  While \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" is and has always been my favorite ELP recording, \\"Tarkus\\" is No. 2 in my book.  This reengineered release is terrific effort and renews the magic.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is my fifth Nicholas Sparks' book I have read, although it was a bit different then he's other books(hense the tiny suspence) still I found this book to be just as predictable as the rest of his books. I think Nicholas Sparks is a great writer I just wished he would change it up a bit.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|I think the Walking Dead series has given zombies new \\"life\\". It is well written, and the fx are fantastic. This series is very enjoyable and I hope it goes on for years to come!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Highly recommend this season, as series that keeps you guessing right up to the very end of every episode. I did purchase the entire season and one week later it became available on prime.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I'm surprised Nelson DeMille put his name on this book. It's so bad, I wonder if he actually wrote it. It's grossly overwritten. Weak plot. Poor character development. Excessive use of Corey's sarcasm and snide side comments to the point where they become really, really irritating instead of humorous. DeMille's use of quotes and attribution are sophomoric; was this book edited? This book is a major disappointment. Save your time and money. You're better off reading The Lion or one of DeMille's other books. The Panter? Don't bother.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|They royally screwed up with this game. This page claims you are buying the full game ... but you are not. Once you have bought this puppy, in the game, they have in-game purchasing ... that is not possible if you bought the full game ...<br /><br />One star until they fix that blatant bait and switch issue.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good plot,  well written characters, and constant action bring back the suspense of the original Grisham's. I have waited for a long time for a Grisham as good as the original few. Couldn't put it down.
B0089LALHO|3.0|Safe House is certainly full of action and intrigue and the actors do the best with the material they have to work with. But there could have been more. Denzel Washington is fairly believable as Tobin Frost, but Ryan Reynolds less so. The locations are great and the action is fast-paced. If you are looking for pure entertainment and don't have too high hopes than this is for you.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A must read...not because \\"Bella\\" says you should.  But because this story is just so powerful.  Aside from that one guy you can't ever understand, it takes you to another time with language that is so much like woven yarn.
0307943194|3.0|Whenever I'm back in the US, I always buy a Grisham audio book to listen in the car for the long drives I plan. The radio is usually full of ads, chit chat or music I don't want to hear. I love these Grisham stories because they are so entertaining and you get a good look at the legal profession from all sorts of angles. The Litigators does not fail. It starts with a man on the edge of a breakdown who falls apart then somehow ends up strongly back on his feet. This story was particularly good because it looks at a small law office rather than a big slick firm, which his books I have read often do. While this is not deep literature, it is what it should be, a good read (even if I did listen to it). Highly recommended, entertaining story.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This is a great album which reminds me of Machina mixed with adore with a little bit of Siamese dream in it. I love the \\"darkish\\" atmosphere this album creates which also reminds me of Mellon Collie. Mike Byrne on drums is great! While he is no Jimmy Chamberlin, once you settle into Byrne's style of drumming the album is really enjoyable. Old pumpkin fans won't be disappointing with this album. Definitely recommended to old fans and new listeners as well.
B0070NSPCU|2.0|Large chunks of the storyline are actually interesting, but the writing is sloppy and in dire need of a proofreader. I suspect that the multitudes of five-star reviews come from bots or paid shills.
1479374121|1.0|this is a copy of the real book.  don't buy it.  no publishing info, no page numbers.  find the real thing.  really disappointing to receive.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|I am a guy surprisingly good:) good story good actors . Didn't want to watch but once I started I wanted to see the outcome.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first Sparks novel, I couldn't put it down.  I almost didn't want it to end!  Now I'm looking forward to reading more of his books, from the reviews I think I'll like them all.

B000YJ85BI|4.0|The first book \\"Oldman's War\\" was great.  This is the follow up to that book.  It was pretty good with the same characters and ending as you would expect based on info from the first book.  The first book was great because you did not know what to expect.  This book you knew some of what was going on so it was more of an action adventure story than an SF book.  Still I liked it and would recommend it.  Read the first book before this one or this won't make much sense.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome game. Really fun and is a good game to kill time with. One of my favorites! :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just finished the Racketeer,couldn't put it down.  I love to read a book that keeps you guessing and doesn't<br />insult my inteligence.I can't believe some of the books that my favorite authors are now turning out.I almost didn't read this one because I had given up on a good read.I hope that other authors will read this book and see how it's done right.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is a really cute movie that was made here in Rhode Island last summer.  It had a wonderful cast and the story is cute and fun, about a couple of kids who run away from their strange families so they can be together.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I mean Radiohead can do no wrong. It is a great album from start to finish. A must buy...like buy it right now.
B001EBV0P8|5.0|This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite movies.  \\"Get busy living or get busy dying....\\"  I already own this on DVD, but really like the thought of having it available whenever I want it...
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Prometheus tells us where Ridley's aliens came from. I was expecting a slightly more cerebral journey based on the hype, and there is a message for sure, but it does not reach the heights of a Contact for sure. Noomi does a great job as a proto-Sigourney and there story holds up admirably well. I have to admit I almost ditched the movie after the sub-par CG sequence in the beginning, but it gets better. Many of the \\"scary\\" elements are really recycled Aliens cliches, but at least Scott is recycling cliches he invented himself, and he is entitled to that, right? If you are scifi buff or \\"scifi adjacent\\", you will enjoy this flick. I don't think Scott brothers could make a mediocre movie or TV show even if they tried to, so you can't really go wrong.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Awesome info!<br />Formulas and diet ideas work amazingly<br />Already purchased more books.<br />My body has changed and I will remain in contact for future q's.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is just about perfect.  Not so difficult that you lose interest, but challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. As soon as I finish one level, I have to see what the next level looks like, so it's a difficult game to put down.  I had complained that the \\"play next\\" screen pops up over your finished board so you could never see the board in a finished state, but I've just downloaded an update that adds more puzzles and fixes that issue by giving you an \\"X\\" at the bottom to hide that menu and show you the completed board.  So I'm amending my review to five stars.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Enjoy all books by John Grisham, read many & will continue to do so. Find his books easy & quick to read as I do not have much time to read.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this is what my six year old son said. I like it. I am glad you bought it and would ask for it again.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Reading the reviews that Minecraft is obviously planting on Amazon is depressing.<br />I'm surprised Amazon allows this to continue.<br />No one could really be buying this over-priced crap.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fast paced, scary at times and great characters.  Lots of twists and turns. A thrill a minute and well worth tuning into. Makes you look forward to the next episode.
0385360169|5.0|learning about the characters and why they acted as they did.  I couldn't wait to read the next book.  It was hard to put down.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the concept and the characters of this story. Some parts seemed a bit disconnected, but I'm guessing it's because this is actually a series of progressively more complex short stories, the last of which really qualifies as a novel on it's own. There are many unanswered questions in this story, and some holes in the plot, however it still left me wanting more. Even though this is a work of fiction, I saw many similarities to real life in the sinister, secretive, and controlling characters who exerted their will and power to keep the masses uninformed, ignorant, happy and distracted. I hope the author continues to tell the story of this world and it's inhabitants.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was a little disappointed while reading the book.  I found it drawn out and wordy.  I am an avid fan of Grisham and expected a bit more from him.  I was not surprised at his ending comments about this book.  He admitted not working very hard on this book and it certainly showed.  Hopefully he will work harder on his next book as I thouroughly enjoy reading most of his books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like flow because. I like puzzles. don't wait get the game for free now.I mean right now you will love the game. I promise
B0083SBMBM|1.0|Short and sweet...ordered the movie. It came in cracked and when I tried to return it online there was no way I could. So I will trash the one I got on here then head on base to buy one I can actually watch and return if there are issues.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|The God delusion brings many things into perspective. It explores religions all too encompassing effect on humanity, its impossibility, and negative influence. Dawkins is a voice worth hearing.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I read this book last year and couldn't put it down as it was absolutely mesmerizing!  When I received a Kindle for my birthday Sarah's Key was the first Kindle book I ordered because I wanted to have my own copy and reread it multiple times.  The story takes a little known fact about France and their part in rounding up the Jews during WWII and placing them into concentration camps in France.  From this historical event, which has largely been overlooked as the French were so ashamed of what they did, is woven a fictional tale of such anguish,despair, loss and horror that everyone involved undergoes a major change in their lives.  We had to study WWII in school and I thought I pretty much knew all about it but I had no idea that France had their own concentration camps for the Jewish people and that they were tortured and brutalized in French concentration camps as  as well as the German ones.  This was certainly an eye opener for me.  I think Sarah's Key is a book that will make anyone interested in WWII and who is unfamiliar with this event want to learn more about it. The fictional story line is both original and interesting and will hold your interest till the very end.  This is a wonderful book and a real must read.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|I loved the Maze Runner trilogy. I was excited to see a prequal book, unfortunetely Mr. Dashner failed in this book. The plot was hard to follow (even though I new what followed) and the storyline didn't seem to flow very well an he never devolped the charactors very well.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This product is great. I used to lug around my sleep machine, now it's small and compact!<br />Anyone who needs sleep, or just relax this is the way to go.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A book that keeps your interest and is a quick read. Not Grisham's best but better than most other authors offers.
030758836X|1.0|While this book was very easy to read, it was disturbing. The story was very unnerving. The writing was simple and the plot just kept getting more and more unbelievable. I do not recommend it.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The sound, and durability were better than expected. The programability of the g buttons is also excellent, it's easy to map commands (there are even some built in for popular games). The battery life so far is also great, I plug it in at night, and it lasts me all day.<br /><br />But- there is one major problem: The drivers are simply defective when it comes to sound. After a few weeks certain sounds come out garbled, so while playing a game it sounds fine until this certain sfx that comes out like a computer's cough, or a bug in your ear, and sounds terrible. The only way to fix this reliably is to uninstall the fancy drivers... which means those buttons on the side are useless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />great sound<br />easy button mapping<br />durability<br />battery<br /><br />Cons:<br />terrible sound drivers<br />very quiet white noise from mic 24/7<br />squeaky pleather with glasses
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. The imagination alone keeps you turning the page for what's next<br /> Action packed. Heart breaking<br />One of the best reads in a very long time
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've played the game in it's entirety. Took about 3 weeks, wonderful graphics, never lagged, never force-closed. Great time-waster! Thanks Playrix.
1616960922|5.0|I got this book this morning and read it in two sittings(I had made plans to go to a matinee with my son), BS is one of my favorite authors, he never seems to let you down even with a limited number of pages you feel like you get a good story, which this one was.  Makes you want more.
0062127241|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Who however, my favorite band member has always been Pete Townshend.  I love that he shared his personal story of being a sexual abuse survivor as I am one too.  I love his personal stories of ups and downs and most of all his survival.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this in three days.  Heart-bounding, tear-wrenching and overwhelming. A story that paints a vivid and graphic picture.Can‘t wait to read the next.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Thought it was a good movie, maybe not action packed but a thrill a minute. Not Liam's best but he' s still great in it. Worth watching.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|How much Dinah was already the rage with the night people<br /> when I moved to Los Angeles in 1958! This collection draws me back to all the friends, places and events of the time.

B0064T6LV8|2.0|this is the most boring game ever there is no challenge and there are tons of promote ads and not all of them are appropriate for all growers.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|the game is not worth $2.99 because it is easy only a couple of levels you have to wait for the locked level to open. its like space angry birds.
1449410243|5.0|Many great comics not seen online<br />Useful working knowledge of cat tendencies toward death<br />Excellent full size poster inside<br />Enjoyed by everyone with a sense of humor<br />Highly Recommended as gift or for personal collection<br />Author note:<br />--Inman has done multiple fundraisers for charity and the sciences. Quality guy.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Love this book, as I do all of Mitch Albom's books!  Fast, easy read.  It really makes you think about what time really means to the human population.  It put in perspective some of the way I live my life and it has been on my mind since I finished reading it.  Definitely would recommend this book!
B00000K0E5|5.0|My favorite Bond movie. Great villians, Nice balance action and plot, Brosnan great in this.  Recommended for any Bond fan

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This went above and beyond expectations! I absolutely love the sing along blog and now having all the extras makes it even more fun! Plus Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion are absolutely hilarious :)
B002RHGYOA|5.0|This book is the second in a trilogy by Stieg Larsson. These three books are so unbelievably excellent that it is imperative that they be read in sequence. The first is \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". I have been reading books of all sorts to 60 years and have never been so impressed with a story. It is unforgettable and I was not able to put them down. It give this trilogy a score of 100% without any doubt and I have not met anyone who has read them who has not given an equal score. Do yourself a favour.
B0026IQFS0|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, which combines excitement and good fun with solid writing, research and character development.<br /><br />Master and Commander is the story of Jack Aubrey, a newly-appointed captain in the British navy, and his newfound friend Steven Maturin, who soon becomes the ship's surgeon. It's 1800 and they sail the Mediterranean having various adventures, between run-ins with superiors on shore. A plot summary makes the book sound a bit like a thriller, but it never gets bogged down in cheap drama; instead it provides a complete immersion in the time period and the lives of the characters, weaving meticulous research into a compelling story.<br /><br />The character development is strong, and the three main characters feel three-dimensional and believable, although the supporting cast is not as vivid and it took me awhile to sort them out. The writing is good. And the extraordinary detail with which the setting is brought to life is beyond impressive. Not for a moment did I have reason to doubt the authenticity of O'Brian's portrayal of the time period, even though the book was written in the 1960s; the early 19th century comes to life in all its contradictions. Gallantry and brutality are equally accepted and expected parts of life, as are rigid social hierarchies and rules of conduct that would be completely foreign to us today. It's a rare author who's both willing to make his characters entirely of their times and yet able to make us root for them, and O'Brian pulls this off with aplomb.<br /><br />My biggest reservation is the sheer amount of naval jargon and other obscure words and references. It's great that the text isn't dumbed down, but it desperately needs a few diagrams, a glossary and maybe an introductory note with some background on the British navy--I relied heavily on the internet to understand sections of this book, but Wikipedia can only do so much (and sailors explaining things to Maturin by pointing at something and saying \\"that there is the foretopgallantyard\\" isn't especially helpful to a reader). There's a particularly rough spot about 100 pages in where I started to doubt the book; it got better once I realized I didn't need to understand all the seafaring terms to enjoy the story.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent work of historical fiction, including both adventure and human relationships and complexities in good measure. Not sure I'm up for another 19 of them, but I plan to pick up the second book at least, and recommend this one.at there is the foretopgallantyard\\" isn't especially helpful to a reader).

1451638450|5.0|Yes, we all cheer for Ivan, but I also liked reading about By the Vor-town-clown-ImSec-weasel. We also get a bit more of a look at Lady Alys and Simon, so all good there. While some have argued that it is was not a 'seat of your chair' suspense filled book, I beg to differ. I received the book yesterday late, and finished it at 5:30 this morning. It was a joy to read about characters we all love, who while having problems were NOT in mortal peril. Well at least not too much. :)<br /><br />It is fun and definitely re-readable. And will definitely be finding a new home come Christmas, after I carefully re-read it a few times,  so I can get the more portable paperback edition when it comes out.<br /><br />The last chapter is a howl.  Overall, I'd say it's a keeper.

0333903374|5.0|This is one of the few books that I can honestly say I have never gotten tired of reading, even when my son asked to read it every night for a week.  That should speak for itself.  A fun clever little book that has a halloween theme but is still fun for anytime of year.  My son now knows it by heart and we will take turns reading lines, he likes to say the line: \\"Woosh!  They were gone!\\"  We absolutely love this book.
B00979CS50|5.0|I don't know about anyone else but I have never felt so many emotions as when I listen to PP....how can this new album surpass anything that has gone before and there certainly has been others of Neil's that I emphasise with..\\"OTB\\", TTN & TFA & TRANS\\" but PP just seems to be even more poignant than all of them put together...or thats what I feel about it at this point in time!<br />The most powerful lyrics are in \\"Ramada Inn\\", \\"Holding on to what they've done\\", these 6 little words tell a whole story, so emotional, so hopeful and yet they convey the saddness of past, tough times, days when you only just made it through, always just holding on, hopeful of improvement.. this is how the words speak to me! Ramada Inn is such a beautiful haunting song that you can drown yourself in the lyrics and feel the pain of it all!<br />The whole album is a Killer..every song provokes a different sentiment, happy, sad, good and bad memories, humour and despair....a whole plethora of human emotions just in 8 tracks, that is so friggin amazing and so powerful...I am at a loss to know of no other album I have in my collection that covers all this on one full album beacuse most albums tend to stick to one theme at a time. There is so much diversity on PP and yet it is all set down to a few familiar repeated chords and notes which have been arranged in a way to deliver a whole new sound!!! How unbelievable is this, nothing but pure fkn plain and simple genius, imho of course!<br />Neil Young and Crazy Horse together are formidable. This album is every bit as good, if not greater than Ragged Gory, Sleeps with Angels and Zuma because the songs portray Neil's personal journey through his many years of highs and lows. The album is a must if you are a Neil Young and Crazy Horse fan and it's becoming one of my most favourites. When I actually got to see the Alchemy Tour a couple of weeks ago in LA, the songs from the album took on a whole new life, the pure raw power of the music was insanelygood. Neil's voice has never sounded better, Crazy Horse's thundering beat never wavered and stayed with Neil the whole way and even the whistling in the song \\"Walk Like A Giant\\", was incredible and just added so much more to the song's arrangement. This latest tour displays some of the tighest musical collaboration that you will ever hear with Neil and the Horse and it certainly has left a lasting impression! To hear the songs live sounding better that even the album delivers is amazing! Long live Neil Young and saddle up that Crazy Horse and get the ride of your life!

0307592731|3.0|Living in POrtland, Oregon has its share of ups and downs - mostly ups.  Mostly legal.  But some down, and some not so legal.  It strikes me as not coincidental that the author lives in Portland.  The book, the city, and the trip described have much in common - some wet spots and some dry spots, people living outside the societal norm but being affected by society, wanting to be free yet needing things that only money can buy - like food, water, and shelter.<br /><br />I could really relate to the author's roller coaster emotions after losing her mother, and glad that she took us along for her trip of healing. The book is very interesting and fun to read - what will happen next?  will her feet hold up?  Will she make it to the next supply drop? But don't read this book if you are an organized, rational, planning, Type A personality.  The author's lack of preparation and poor decisions (lifestyle, hiking preparations, money, etc.) will make you crazy.
B003DT194G|5.0|Once Upon A Time in the West was a movie I remember from first release and had a haunting quality I'll never forget.  Beautiful setting and story that was probably closer to that time period than a lot of movies.  Love, greed, sacrifice, and strength all in one.  You don't forget this one.  Leave it to Amazon to have all the great movies available.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I really loved this app, I was at first skeptical about this app but when I downloaded the game I reggretted nothing. This app is simply amazing, the graphics are just like angry birds yet the gameplay is much different. In Bad Piggies you build vehicles varying from small carts to airplanes in attempt to reach the end of the level. I love this app and have been playing non-stop for days.  This app in my opinion is much better than angry birds because it allows you to use your imagination instead of just launching birds at pigs in forts which only recquires tragectory and good aim. I reccomend this app for all ages, even elders!

B00B19DMUE|3.0|The film opens with the &#34;based on a true story&#34; claim. It follows this claim with a man coming home to find his mom possessed by a demon. Yes, I remember mom being possessed by demons. I warned her about burning those black candles, drinking goat's blood, and opening strange ancient boxes with Hebrew letters.<br /><br />After the credits, the story then moves on to Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the almost big time basketball coach, his divorced wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick), and two adorable daughters he has for the weekend in his new home on Always Dreary Lane. Em (Natasha Calis) the younger, more adorable, and better actor of his two daughters buys a box at a yard sale and the next thing you know the movie transforms itself into a mediocre Jewish exorcism film.<br /><br />The highlight for me was the MRI scene. I would like to see Natasha Calis get smacked around er ah star in more horror films. You can keep the rest of that lot. I found myself getting bored during some of the better scenes. At 92 minutes, it seemed like 2 hours. Dialogue lacked decent hooks. Oh wait. That's because this was &#34;based on a true story.&#34;<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. No moths were harmed in the filming of this movie.

B0037QGS0A|3.0|As with \\"Where the Truth Lies\\" (2005) Atom Egoyan's other recent, well-funded and half-convincing outing with Big Names (Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon, there), here he again tries his hand at a commercial hit. With \\"Chloe\\" (2009) he turns out a movie that's well-acted, often easy on the eye, and never inept, yet one that's marred by often absent direction and a poorly realized story.<br /><br />Discomfiting, hidden passions are something of an Egoyan specialty, with highly charged child-women a near fixation. This outing is true to form. He also manages fairly well here with soft-core titillation - in a scene between Julianne Moore and the waif-like yet sensuous Amanda Seyfried. Still (as is also true of \\"WTL\\"), sharp, dramatic pacing is sorely absent - a major flaw in a suspense film. It's easy to imagine a couple of crux scenes that Egoyan sleepwalks through in \\"Chloe\\" faring so much better in the crafty hands of a Hitchcock. (My advice, Atom? Do like DePalma: copy the master till your own way takes shape!)<br /><br />The plot is also incompletely developed: [spoiler alert to come: be warned] there's simply no plausible reason in the film for the way Seyfried's character behaves, for the fixation at the root of her elaborate construct of lies. Had she been directed to glance furtively at Moore as she spins out her stories, or had Moore been shown as anything beyond hurt, jealous, puzzled, yet always plain ordinary, things might fit in place so much better. Had it been Monica Belluci in the Moore part; or if something, anything, had been infused into the script to show that mortals trip over themselves for a glance as she, the Moore character, passes - this, too, might have done. In any case, we are left to fill in this key void, since Egoyan does not ...yet not in any way that intrigues.<br /><br />Some musical prodigies who launch too early, without a full array of chops, often turn out seductive, yet only middling successes and watch their promising careers slowly fizzle out. (A still-youngish Canadian cellist who was recording and being highly praised in the `70s/80s comes readily to mind) Both of Egoyan's mentioned movies convey something along such lines. His wunderkind, albeit quirky successes (Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter) recommend him as a safe bet for producers. And much, in fact, does work well in his movies: they can't rightly be called unpolished, unimaginative or less than professional. But the mentioned gaps lurk beneath this veneer, hinting at that incomplete palette and an apprenticeship terminated a bit soon. Perhaps Egoyan would have gained from directing a string of TV police shows, or with some commercial-making under his belt, before trying his hand at these two recent dramas. (No put-down intended: Sam Peckinpah created and directed TV's The Rifleman; Norman Jewison directed TV fare through the 1950s; FF Coppola apprenticed under Roger Corman, the king of cheapo cult films).<br /><br />Seyfried's eerie beauty has a Bette Davis-like magnetism, and who knows if even her talent. Still, we'll have to wait for a better vehicle to bring them out. Meantime, her name may just possibly come to naught while her looks, and her stunning stare, are exploited in slick but flawed fare like this.<br /><br />[PS: Mick LaSalle's thought-provoking book [[ASIN:0804768544 The Beauty of the Real: What Hollywood Can Learn from Contemporary French Actresses]] (see my review) has since brought to my attention (44f) that 'Chloe' is a remake of a French film, 'Nathalie' (2003).

I very much enjoyed this movie and think it's one of the better straight-to-DVD animated films I've seen.  Not for younger viewers, however.

0374203032|5.0|If you were raised watching The Simpsons, you likely remember the episode Lisa's Wedding, in which a fortune teller shows Lisa the world in 2010. Granted, not all of the predictions came true, but at least one did - the use of commercial products to teach children arithmetic. Sandel's copious use of footnotes only adds to the growing unease that anyone should feel while reading this book. For me at least, the anxiety, fear and trepidation peaked when he mentioned the Pentagon's proposed betting pool on terrorist acts and assassinations. Anyone who isn't shaken to their core is either completely jaded, or a sociopath. That being said, William Lane Craig could probably read this book without batting an eyelid. He does approve of infanticide as it sends children to heaven. But that's an aside.<br /><br />Sanders makes a powerful and moving case for keeping some things in the public sphere, under the control and influence of all. Chief among these is charity; this was shown to be more effective when students were not bribed to raise more money, but were simply collecting money because they wished to help others. A similar case was proven when a nuclear waste site had to be found, and residents of a small (2000) town were polled about this. Monetary incentives reduced public support in this instance, and piling on more gold to the bribe did not change the community's attitudes.<br /><br />I was particularly taken aback by the history of life insurance (which also covered the old and ghoulish practice of sailors and investors gambling on the failure of trade ships). After reading this portion of the book, though, I found that it made perfect sense. Life insurance is essentially betting on your own death, or that of your family (or in modern times, corporations gambling on the mortality of their employees). Insurance companies make more money the longer the insured lives (and hence, continues to pay the premiums). But when a corporation purchases life insurance of the sick, frail and old, they have a vested interest in the polar opposite. Medical advances such as anti-viral drugs threw a wrench into their plans when AIDS was no longer a death sentence. The logical follow-up of this viatical industry would be the unctuous practice of paying medical researchers to NOT look for cures and vaccines for malaria, Ebola, cancer, etc. It would not be surprising if they bought insurance policies on the poor and indigent communities in Africa, India and China for a pittance (relative to the payout they would receive) if they were able to do so. And the more desperate countries, communities and government service providers become, the more likely they are to give in to corporate sponsorship (which is not a far cry from servility to corporate avarice).<br /><br />Sandel also mentions hunting black rhinos for exorbitant sums. Most would find this a step up on the moral ladder from illicit poaching, which benefits no one except the hunters. Although it is brutal to raise animals simply to kill them for sport, there is evidence that the black rhino population has risen to sustainable levels, this indicates the moral compromises that must be taken when economic anarchy clashes head-on with morality and empathy. This tale is followed by the instance of Canadian Inuits selling their right to slaughter harmless walruses. Psychologists would quite rightly be worried that this act would damage the empathy and compassion of those who engage in such acts. Empirical research has already established that children who torture animals are more inclined to sociopathy later in life.<br /><br />But this is not the only risk of unfettered market activities in Sandel's well-articulated dissertation. Not by a long shot. Parents desperate for cash have rented advertising space on their houses and bodies. This necessarily demeans them and tells their neighbours (and perhaps the world, via the Internet) that they are poor, one of the &#34;have-nots.&#34; But perhaps one of the most pernicious conclusions that economists have come to (aside from assuming that turning goods into commodities to be bought and sold does not affect their nature. This is at best, only partially true) is the unwarranted assumption that generosity and charity are akin to fossil fuels - once we use them up, they are gone forever. This is clearly utter nonsense. The more one practices altruism, the more one is likely to be altruistic, compassionate and generous in the future.<br /><br />Now on to how commoditisation changes products. Kidneys and livers have a well-deserved reputation as pernicious black-market goods. Once the organs are in the hands of the unscrupulous slavers/people smugglers/exploitative individuals, and the money has changed hands, they have no incentive to look after the supplier of the organ or the recipient.<br /><br />This book should be read by anyone who believes that the &#34;invisible hand&#34; of markets will remain invisible or benign. It shines a light into the dark recesses of economic consequences that few have dared to penetrate.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Movie was really good. Just a lot of action and not much of a story... The plot did help though.
144472889X|5.0|I refer to both the three Theo books and this in particular in my summary.<br /><br />While the first two books deal with murder and kidnapping, these crimes are mentioned only in passing. Grisham does not go into heavy detail (which is understandable, as these books are targeted towards young adults, and I do not fault him for this). The Accused, however, gives us a taste at the dark underside of Marcella's world (which will clearly encourage readers to search for case studies of their own), and also every parent's nightmare that lurks just beneath the surface of every school. Here, Theodore is shown to be far from a perfect lawyer-in-training who will liberate the oppressed, hold corrupt politicians and corporations accountable, or otherwise work miracles. To do so would turn him into a cookie-cutter Gary Stu, a character so boring as to ruin an entire franchise.<br /><br />Fortunately, this is far from the case. As Theo matures and gains insights through his own experiences and wisdom from the paralegals, his parents and friends at school, he develops to a very well-rounded character by the mid-point of this book. Not only is this an excellent way to end the initial Theodore Boone trilogy, but it does not sacrifice character development for fast paced action or a throng of minor characters that would be forgotten by the time the next chapter rolls around.<br /><br />The ubiquitous Animal Court stories are still in place, and I certainly look forward to what Mr. Grisham has in store for us in The Activist.

Yes, she's oh-so-exploitedly been introduced, seeking revenge on the resident Joseph Mengele-esque doctor of the Sanitarium. Oh, and hold your breath, it's almost episode four and Chloë Sevigny is about to come out of the closet.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I received a review copy in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton wrote this novella as a companion journal to the Forever Girl series. It offers a glimpse into the life of a minor character who saves the day in the Forever Girl (Book One). Hamilton's smooth writing voice submerges you into the story after just the first couple pages, and you don't ever feel the need to come up for air. Fans of the series should definitely take the detour and read this novella.<br /><br />I think this story needed to be told, because a criticism of mine for the first book was that this character, Ophelia, really comes out of nowhere in The Forever Girl. It's neat to get a peek into her life, but also, you uncover secrets about the villain that I'm sure will come into play later. Even cooler, you see glimpses of other characters who appear in The Forever Girl. It gives you a broader view of the world Hamilton created with her series, and it was a fun, short read.<br /><br />The plot flowed believably, and the forbidden love that develops between Ophelia and her certain sexy someone intrigued me. The ending wrapped everything up nicely, and I feel better established and ready to read the second book now that I've read this novella. Sometimes novellas can come off as a money grab, but Her Sweetest Downfall works wonders for Hamilton's world.<br /><br />Fans of the Forever Girl series should definitely take the detour to Her Sweetest Downfall while they wait for book two in the full series...which I'm itching to read now that Hamilton has been feeding me bits of the story. She's such a tease.

My personal opinion,  Ashton has that all around good guy personality that complimented the storyline.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is so easy to use. I can access the program from any computer. kindle fire, or my smart phone. I can clip and save pages from the web. It lets me organize, make use of, and save information, to do lists,and more.  Plus it is easy to clear out the stuff that is no longer needed.  I have used it to make charts, keep track of blood sugars, and to interface with other apps such as My Fitness Program, and Fit Bit activity tracked. I love it!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend everyone buys and watches this movie and keeps it for generations. This Movie will give both children and adults greats memories of Christmas.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors is a record unforgetable in many aspects, first for most of it's themes (Light my Fire, The End, Alabama Song, etc, etc), also for the voice of Jim Morrisson and the performance of other players and, last, for the use it was given to some of it's themes (eg, The End, in Apocalipse Now).
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I'm a huge Lego Star Wars fan.<br />This set looks awesome next to me my other UCS sets. Fun to build and very strong for how long it is. Cool mini figs too.<br />Everyone has to haw Vaders' personal ship. (If you can throw out $400 for a Lego). Lego did over price this one.
B009IQ1HBI|2.0|I expected more from this album as her previous album was fairly good (3 - 4 stars imo). This album is rather un-imaginative and repetitive. It feels more like a highly polished b side album to Lights.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|The best angry birds yet. It combines all the previous aspects and mixes it in with star wars. How could it be bad?
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Very vulgar movie.<br />Not a movie for families. Even the parents swear with their children. This is a very bad british movie. But what can you expect from them? Only in America, the Christmas movies are mostly actually not objectionable.<br />All the characters are stupid. Colin Firth adores a woman who cheats on him with his own brother, how stupid is that? A woman who just got married is the object of love for another man, how inspiring is that? A widower talks about his fantasy date with a slizzy model at his wife funeral ...<br />The only redeeming part : weirdly enough it's Billy Nighly!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|don't get me wrong the game looks great but I cant install it! I saw other reviews with the same problem but of corse I was one of the people that was unlucky
0064440346|5.0|My daughter was totally mesmerized by the adorable Owl - so was I :)<br />This book is a treasure just like Frog and Toad . Very simple and heartwarming - Arnold Lobel's insight into children's world is spot on!<br />Highly recommend for all ages -this is a gem.

B0039HV3P2|5.0|I am in love with this movie and have been since I was 4 when it came out.  It came with great quality and minimal loading time so that I had a seamless viewing experience.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use and great information display including radar maps daily and horly forecast.the 3D grafh are great. I love it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|After hearing the song \\"Some Nights\\" on the radio, I was hooked on the catchy beat.  Almost appears to sound a little militant with the powerful drum beats, but gets your toe tapping.  Fearing that I would only like the one track, I waited a little and sought out other songs that were on the CD.  Impressed with what I was listening to, I ordered the CD and waited for its arrival.<br /><br />I have to admit, there are very few albums or CD's that I can honestly say I like every song on it, but this one is definitely enjoyable from beginning to end.  I am not really sure what genre this really is, but it is different, the music is catchy, and it is pretty darn good music to listen to.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the series, especially book three.  The story evolved to something I had hoped could happen with the young couple. It was well worth it.
031618201X|4.0|I was fond of the novel version of Soulless first, but I enjoy manga so I picked up a copy. The manga is true to the plot of the novel and the various characters. However, like most graphical mediums, it doesn't quite have the rich details of the novel. Some of the intricate Victorian quirks didn't quite transfer through. In addition, the lavish details in the book for scene where moved to the background, where they rightly belong. This doesn't diminish from manga, just a quirk.<br /><br />I loved how the characters are drawn. Even the alpha not being \\"quite as bulky\\" as I imagined in the book still had the proper sense of size comparison. It helps to be familiar with manga in general since that graphical language is carried through this manga. It makes a wonderful mixture of the story and graphics, one that I enjoyed greatly.<br /><br />The plot flowed very quickly through the story and I enjoyed it greatly. I felt that reading the novel gave more depth to the scenes, though, and I would recommended both for anyone who really enjoys the manga version. The length and graphics makes it harder to pack in all those wonderful details. Regardless, I still loved reading and have re-read it multiple times.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Very good movie.  Violence with alot of killings.[[ASIN:B002BI6SMI Taken]]<br />The stars played their rolls very well. See this movie before seeing TakenII.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|There are many different assessment tools available for people who want to learn more about their personality types, attitudes, behavior, and/or leadership styles.  These include, for example, tests and inventories that measure individual qualities and abilities and those that relate these competencies to the interaction with other people. Over the years, I have used numerous assessment tools either offered at work or in graduate-level courses. These include, for example, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI) and various leadership questionnaires for skills, styles, culture, interaction, and many others. I found all of these assessments interesting and helpful for my development, yet none of them alone would have been sufficient to give me a comprehensive understanding of myself in order to use my abilities most effectively. In other words, I found that the combination of several assessment tools ultimately helped me to understand myself as a person and my behavior towards peers at work, friends, and family members.<br /><br />Strengths Finder 2.0 is an approach by scientists of The Gallup Organization to provide users with a tool to identify their strengths, or more precisely, their talents. Tom Rath explained it as follows: \\"We were tired of living in a world that revolved around fixing our weaknesses [and ...] we had discovered that people have several times more potential for growth when they invest energy in developing their strengths instead of correcting their deficiencies.\\" When I read this, I thought this is an interesting and powerful way to look at personal characteristics. I was anxious to use this Strengths Finder 2.0.<br /><br />Tom Rath guided me well through the book and the online test, which allowed me to discover my top five talents out of the 34 common talent themes compiled by the Gallup scientists. The combination of the interpretations of these talents and the development of an action plan for the future was excellent. Rath described that TALENT (i.e., a natural way of thinking, feeling, or behaving) times INVESTMENT (i.e., the time spent practicing, skill developing, and knowledge-base building) equals STRENGTH, which he defines as \\"the ability to consistently provide near-perfect performance.\\" This means that knowing your talents is only the beginning of growth - the rest is up to you (i.e., to use and further develop the areas where a person has the greatest potential to develop strengths).<br /><br />It is important to mention that Rath recognizes that it is helpful to also know the areas of \\"lesser talent\\" because they can lead to weakness and can become a hazard in a person's career. I agree with his opinion that the key to success is to be aware of both your potential and your limitations.<br /><br />In conclusion, I consider Strengths Finder 2.0 a valuable book in that it can help individuals to discover talents and more effectively use them. There is no doubt that this book helped me in my professional and private life, and I believe it can help others as well. I highly recommend this book to all people who want to learn more about themselves and see how far they can go with this knowledge in their lives.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Read it better than all of the series.put together you will want to read it over and over again.  Five star
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love any of John Grisham books, have all of them in hardback or on my kindle and have seen all his books that have put to movies. He is the best!!!!!!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|The idea for the movie was good and it could have been a much better movie but it was so long and drawn out or maybe it just fel that way.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great & really easy to use to check out different versions of the bible.  It also connects to some great devotionals.<br />The only problem with it is it only works with wifi so when you travel you still need a kindle version bible downloaded if you want to have a bible.  It would also be nice if I could adjust the font size.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love how easy this app was to download and start using on my new &#34;cheap&#34; little Polaroid tablet.  It's  wonderful to be able to travel and just take a little tablet instead of my huge bag of books I would normally take.  That said, I would still like to own the Kindle reader at some point because of the page reading quality and battery life.  In the meantime, this app gives me an inexpensive way to keep current on technology and reading. Yea!  No wonder I love Amazon.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I highly recommend Alarm Clock Xtreme Free because it allows the user to setup multiple alarms, and the user also gets to select to wake up to either an alarm sound or a song of their choice.  This app is worth it!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Wanted to watch HBO to go, but iPad does not support HDMI out for this program. Works with Netflix and You Tube. Good Apple product.

B001EC2ISA|4.0|This is a great halloween movie fit for the whole family though younger kids might have some problems with some scenes.  Michaal Keaton, Gina Davis and Alex Baldwin are talented performers with a very good supporting cast.  Burton puts just the right spin on the story.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|was disapointed with this movie was quite a let down 3 d effects were okay but the story sucked and the whole movie was set in dark tones not much in the wat of color depressing
0345529057|5.0|These books are absolutely amazing.  I started watching the series before reading these book(which I dont recommend) the books are so much better than the tv series. Be ready to be addicted to these books, they have kept me up long nights and have not been able to put them down.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|watchable but I found it quite stupid and not in a fun way maybe it appeals to younger people but lame to me
B006OITIQE|5.0|My kids and I LOVE to sing and dance to this cd.  It's a fun sound.  Can't wait for their next cd.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|I have been a fan of the pie movies for years and they did good with this I think it is quite funny, The charactors meshed really well after the years great job
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read every Grisham book and I think this rates one of the best!  Thank goodness Mr. Grisham isn‘t a crook, because with him mind he would keep the authorities guessing for years!  I'm glad he sticks to writing instead.  I couldn't put this one down and finished at 4 o'clock am.
B008M34INW|4.0|What's to say it's Mel, He has made this movie for 30 years just in a different package. If you like Mel and acton you will like this

B003Y3BMFW|3.0|I thought the sound could be better sounds like there in a garage on some tracks studio cds are better
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford and Sons are amazing! Sigh No More is a perfect album. There is not a single song that feels out of place. I've had this album on replay for the last week and I'm still not tired of listening to it!
B007X4ECLY|3.0|same old hashed out story line they seem to be churning out one after another now a days. if you like outerspace sci fi you will like this
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I could not set this book down! It was amazing, I will most definitely be reading this book again! Such a page turner; I truly have fallen in love with this book.
B004LWZW6U|3.0|I thought the first one was way better and for this type of b movie needs more tits!!!!! 3d is fun
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a very fun little game, once you understand how it works. Or, in my case, have your son show you how it works. It's entertaining, and habit-forming:)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just like solitaire on the computer. I enjoy playing this app and I haven't had any issues wih it yet.
B009VB97EY|2.0|This is absolute crap. There is no story line, no love story, no \\"i realized my mistakes and am changing my life story\\". It's Matthew Mcconahey *sp?* looking chiseled but OLLLLLLLDDD and kinda weird, and Channing Tatum looking great. But really? You can get the EXACT same effect by google'ing the stars names with the tag \\"shirtless\\" and it would be a MILLION times better. CRAP!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey has an amazing tale to tell, with a star studded line up of characters to get some insight to!  Bossypants is a good combination of funny and real life that I have really enjoyed!
0525952926|4.0|I'm determined to get a Kindle and stop spending money on books, but my husband wanted to read Winter of the World immediately and Amazon had a good deal so...<br />War is insanity and Ken Follett shows this clearly in Winter of the World and Fall of Giants. Nevertheless, I found the narrative engaging and enjoyed it as much as any of the dozens of books I've read this year. I especially liked that he interspersed dialogue and non-ballistic action in with battle scenes. I usually skim through the scenes of gore and bombs but, in Winter of the Worlds I read at an even pace. I enjoyed his female characters and appreciated that the idiotic war mongers were all male. The deadly foolishness of Stalin was particularly horrifying simply because it really happened. I look forward to the third book in the triology.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Sad to say \\"more truth than poetry \\"during those times! A period in our history defining it's growth by unnecessary moral behavior, forced labor and inhuman conditions.<br />However, reality aside the story was a beautiful read!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Well done Jude law and Downey junior play off each other well<br />Just forget about the old Holmes books. Good movies
1449410243|3.0|Yet, I am an asian reader from China, Actually I start notice this book because of the internet browsing, for me it's somehow pretty funny for the comic style and the content, but I really need some culture backgroud!<br />this is funny!
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Very childish manner and took away the grit of the book<br />Fund it very silly and no reason for the games given
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the walking dead I think anyone would like to watch it! in fact I got a friend to watch it and she love it. she barrowed my set.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|Not as good as previous too much violence without the good story running through<br />Would not watch again. That's it
B0075LQVC8|5.0|Good book. Had to read it sophomore year high school.Bought it so i could have a copy that i could write on and highlight.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Ridley Scott all over this very similar to alien movies and left wide open<br />For further movies.<br />That's all to say
B0085RQLXK|5.0|If you're the kind of Aerosmith fan who liked Permanent Vacation, Pump and Get a Grip, and thinks Aerosmith has only fallen off in recent times instead of 30 years ago you should enjoy this album. People saying that it's just more pop junk from Aerosmith are wrong. There is some quality rock n' roll on this album. And more over the whole thing was recorded analog, using reel to reel tape. They used a recently invented device called the CLASP system that connects a reel to reel tape machine to the Pro Tools recording program. So the music hits the tape first and the end digital product has the same sound as albums from the past, back when music was good. That is, before the late 90's and 2000s. This makes for a far superior sound than digital recording on it's own, so reviewers saying this is more of the same from Aerosmith are wrong. This is a newer and better direction. Actually it's an older and better direction. The reason why music from the past sounds so much better than recorded music from now is mostly because all that older stuff was done on tape. So when you listen to it on cd or mp3 you're listening to a transfer from analog to digital, not a purely digital product. Whereas most modern records are recorded digitally straight to the computer, with no tape in between, and the sound suffers greatly as a result.<br /><br />This album probably deserves 4 stars more than it does 5 because there are definitely some weak moments. It kind of reminds me of the Permanent Vacation album from 1987 which was the one where Aerosmith finally started to get their stride back but hadn't gotten it fully together again yet. Although some of the sounds do remind me of the Pump album, but this isn't quite as good as that. And despite what I said about their use of tape providing a higher quality sound, I think they may have overused some other very vintage gear that takes the fidelity of the sound down unnecessarily. I think they tried to go for the sound of a 1970's recordingwhereas I would have preferred a late 80's/early 90's sounding one. But compared to the rest of what passes for music today this album is a masterpiece. I'm personally excited to have a new good album come out in time for the holidays. It's something that really hasn't happened since I was a kid. When was the last time a good rock album came out from a great band like Aerosmith? Literally not since the mid 1990's if you ask me. Those who don't like this album because it's not Toys in the Attic are stuck in the 70's and missed out on two decades of awesome music that followed it. Culminating in the late 80's and early to mid 90's, my favorite era of music. That's what this album more or less reminds me of.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Definitely one of his best...simply couldnt put the book down...highly recommended to anyone looking for suspense and a great story
B007OWRBJK|1.0|I Was amazed when I heard Townsend on a talk show whining about his loss of hearing. He had only to listen to al the folks, experts, and the ring of common sense that said very very loud sounds cause cumulative loss of hearing. He acted as if such info was never available to him and whined.<br /><br />At least Neil Young, another artist the pursued loudness beyond all reason, doesn't whine about his hearing problems.<br /><br />Now he's written a book about a life whose purpose was apparently to perfect whining. Townsend is an SNL skit.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham is not writing them fast enough! \\"The Racketeers\\" is, in Mr. Grisham's own words, \\"a stretch.\\" However,it's always a joy to get lost in any of his novels. In this action filled story, I thought the lawyer ex-con was pulling off a con 1/2. None the less, the background into the protagonists family and work, his alarming conviction, and his strategy to destroy a cell mate, developed into a victorious climax. \\"The Racketeer\\" is a must read! Write, John Grisham, write.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this movie.  I expected it to be over the top and funny. While there is a little bit of that, I found that it was too serious to be a  funny movie and too funny to be taken seriously.  If that makes any sense.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I was very bored throughout the film. I felt like some of the actors were good but the film was boring. Not my preference.
B00338QENI|4.0|I learned a lot about cells and what they do with them.Plus having cancer myself made it very interesting to me. I thought it would be boring since it was about cells but it tells about Henrietta and her family. Great story.  The things they have cured with her cells like polio and many others was great.  I am only half way through for a book club and would recommend it to anyone. Enjoy! O.K. I have finished the book. Yes, I still think it was great.  Her family story was interesting.  The end was sad but that was life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This third book flowed perfectly from the previous two. Very fast paced and riveting. After living a life of horror and oppression for decades a solution of sorts is enacted. Then a coming of age, into a new age for all characters. A bittersweet ending - showing the strength of the human spirit to heal and move on in whatever fashion is tolerable.
034580404X|1.0|This story did NOT have to take three books to complete. If anything, it could have been completed in two volumes at most. I have a need to feel connected with a main character in a novel. But, instead of a love story, this book, in my opiniion was a LUST story. I mean, really....every other page? Just time out for a few meals and showers? lol.Who on the planet would believe that a BILLIONARE would marry a woman he barely met...without a pre-nuP? And she, repeatedly saying that she didn't want his money, but she still accepted the expensive clothes, cars and jewelry and even a CEO's position in a company she was working for as a novice straight out of college? The epilogue explained more about this story than the entire three books. Save your money if you haeven't already fell for the dribble on what a great author this is. Every time she called her fetus, BLIP, I cringed. In fact, there is no phrase that Anna did not repeat, over and over again, throughout.  What a waste of time and money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think calculator is good and I feel good when I am the only person in class with a kindle calculator. It is also easy anffun to use cause you can instead using the calculator you can play on the games instead of working I don't but I know people who do. So that is the review I ha e to give.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|whenever you die you go back to the beginning of the world when you did all that hard work. So I did all of the work for nothing.
0374214913|5.0|I've read a lot of books in my life but rarely have I been to smitten by a book that I felt the need to write a review or cyber stalk the author. I think this is the perfect opportunity to pop my Amazon book review cherry, because this book has taken up permanent residence in my heart.<br />  If you love books AND technology, if you struggle daily with whether or not to get an e-reader, if you simply love a great fantasy story; this book is for you.
B007704HO6|5.0|All pet owners will relate to the strong relationship of a pet and their owner - easy read would recommend
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Definitely worth watching and buying on Blu Ray. THis movie has you on the edge of the seat the entire time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an okay game. just sucks you cannot open the new games by beating the previous ones. some of the games are cool but some are really really stupid.
0141439513|5.0|What more can be said about one of the greatest works in the English language?  A life lived without reading this book must be deemed a complete failure on all counts.
B00979CS50|5.0|This album is a time machine for me.  It takes me to a place in time when Neil Young was the greatest singer with such heart felt lyrics.  His \\"Walk Like a Giant\\" runs about 16 1/2 minutes with the follow up guitar riff which never gets old.  I can listen to him jam on this track endlessly.  Perhaps it helps that I saw him at the Global Festival in Central Park last month playing this and \\"Born in Ontario\\" live.  He's still got it, BIG TIME !!!<br /><br />All other tracks are also excellent.  The title track \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" and the alternate mix track are both awesome.  There simply isn't a bad track on the two CDs.  Just throw it on in your car and you're driving your Mustang down to the beach and it's 1972 all over again.  Hey...can I dare to dream?
B003V1WTMM|2.0|If a book doesn't hold my interest within the first 100 pages, I'm ready to close it and move on to something else.  Such was the case with \\"Distant Hours,\\" but since I had read another book by Kate Morton, \\"The House at Riverton,\\" that was more interesting, I continued reading this book.  After reading 300-plus pages of \\"Distant Hours,\\" I felt mired down in the \\"Mud\\" of Kate Morton's story about the Blythe family, but at this point I was determined to finish the book.  Somewhere around 380 pages, the book began to reveal the mystery of what happened to Tom Caville.  Curiosity became my ONLY motivation to finish this incredibly boring and macabre writing.  I doubt I'll read another Kate Morton novel.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I was introduced to Gary by a mutual friend and one thing I know about this man is that he lives and breathes music. In anticipation if his first major debut, I counted down the days until its release and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Bright Lights,\\" \\"Things Are Changing,\\" and the title track \\"Blak and Blu,\\" effortlessly combine smooth rhythms, musicality, and soul with topics that resonate with his audience. \\"Next Door Neighbor Blues\\"  is classic in form and depth that originated with that genre of music. One of the most impressive things about Gary is how good he is on the axe. The cd balances a focus on lyrics alongside mesmorizing awe when he riffs on the guitar for 2 1/2 minutes on a track. The man is amazing and I see great things in his future. Like me, many fans will find this bittersweet: losing \\"our artist\\" that people didn't know about, but getting to watch him rise and get the recognition he and his talented hands deserve.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Yet another brilliant book from one of my favourite writers. The character gallery is fantastic thorugh out the book, as we follow Loll's search for her mothers history and an explanation for a horrendous happening she witnessed in her teens. The story is beautiful, painful and warm, and Morton has managed to create an unique story within a well used subject, our need to know our history and how our perception of our parents will always be tinted by how we first saw them through our childish eyes.  I must admit I anticipated the 'big reveal' in her mothers story, but it made it no less an enjoyable read. I loved it!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My very favorite!<br />Getting to know John Adams and what he did for our country and his wife,Abigail! My goodness, they were made for each other.<br />Most people like to read the book first.<br />I like to see the movie first then read the book.<br />Well I've seen the movie at least 2 times and I'm waiting for my sister to return it to me so I can watch it again.<br />ps Just Bought the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a MUST read.  What a great science fiction story!  I was taken in almost immediately, and could hardly put the &#34;book&#34; down.  It's great.  And, I went looking for other stories and books by this author.  Hugh Howey is now one of my Favorite authors.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was a pretty good book.  It seemed to drag on a little for my taste, lots of repetition.  But the story line was good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a story of an entire community living a life that has been practically mapped out for them where lifestyle choices are severely limited. It highlights the similarity between parallel situations that people on earth experience, through the medium of Science fiction.<br /><br />Characters are well developed and the reader is instantly drawn into their lives and experiences.  Hugh Howey has managed to change the reader's perceived perceptions of where the story is going time and time again. An absorbing plot designed to make the reader think.<br /><br />I found the book entertaining and thought provoking. I would recommend this book to all science fiction readers and would go so far as to challenge people who don't read SF to give it a go. I have no doubt that they will find the story a fascinating tale and that they will remain enthralled right up to the end and dare I say it, waiting for the next installment.
0385535147|2.0|This novel's plot is very similar to the author's first blockbuster novel, 'The Firm.' The protagonist in both novels is caught between cops on one side and crooks on the other and hatches an incredibly elaborate plot to play the two sides off against each other and escape with a fortune.  \\"Incredibly elaborate\\" isn't a strong enough term to describe his plot - it is so intricate and has so many moving parts that it would take a gang of geniuses to pull it off, and even they probably wouldn't make it.  The idea that the protagonist, a small-town lawyer who has spent his career handling small-town legal matters, would be able to devise and flawlessly execute such a plot is pretty ridiculous.  So if you like novels in which the things that happen are fairly plausible, you won't like this book.  I certainly didn't.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I realize that few movies are as good as the book and that movies can't be 100% like the book, but in this case, the movie just fell flat for me. I thought Twilight was a better movie representation of the book compare to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. The plot felt very discontinuous, as important events and people were absent. I was overall disappointed and was a little relieved when it ended. If its on TV one night, watch it. Don't spend any money on this.<br />**Read the book, though. I give that 5 stars!

B008JH5CVS|4.0|Lockout(released April/12)is a mindless,fun space romp with start to finish action,that would give a Die Hard movie a good run for its money.It stars Guy Pearce as Marion Snow,Maggie Grace as Emilie Warnock,Peter Stormare(Fargo) as Scott Langral and others.The story is by the Fifth Element man himself,Luc Besson.<br />The film opens in 2079 as Snow(a CIA agent)is being interrogated about a briefcase.Snow is a terminal smart butt,who just cannot resist a funny comeback under any circumstances.In a flashback we see the briefcase was thrown on board a subway car to a friend,but Snow has no idea where it is now.Snow in turn had gotten the suitcase from a friend who was murdered and who Snow is now being charged with murdering.Snow is sentenced without a court appearance to 30 years in cryo-stasis on the Earth's newest penal facility;an orbiting space station called M(aximum)S(ecurity)-1.<br />In tandem with this plot thread is another which involves the president's daughter Emilie,who is visiting the penal facility to inspect it.She has suspicions that the process of actual stasis has much more flaws to it than has been disclosed,especially since much of the money to build and run the station comes from private companies.On one side of a glass partition sits a deranged Irish prisoner,with a guard on either side.On the other side sits Emilie ,with the Warden,who asks about his general condition.When one of the guards gets heavy with the prisoner for being rude,the prisoner grabs a gun from him,which should NOT have been on his person and which he deliberately held from security.This is the pivotal moment,the pebble drop in the pond,and the rest of the film is the wave outwards.<br />From here the prisoner kills the guards and heads towards the control room,the very place Emilie has fled to.He gets all the cryo-tubes opened and the prisoners start running riot in the cell blocks.It is not too long after they have total control of the facility and are making demands back on Earth.<br />Snow is released on the condition that he go to the station and rescue the president's daughter.He hitches a ride aboard a space shuttle which has a hostage negotiator aboard.But that soon goes south and Snow is forced to do his thing.The crazy Irish prisoner is soon joined by his brother who takes charge and tries to keep his brother in control,with limited success.After a time the prisoners realize the valuable cargo they have in Emilie and they attempt to fetch her.However Snow gets there first and from then on it is a chase through the station.Along the way the pair find out that indeed some of the prisoners are being used as Guinea pigs.Snow tries to get Emilie on a shuttle for one but she refuses to leave and stays by Snow.<br />Emilie is captured by the prisoners,and after the crazed Irishman kills all the hostages,and his own brother,he turns on Emilie.But Snow is there to save her and both flee to don two heavy duty space suits.The Earth forces have charged the station and have planted a bomb which is set to detonate within a few seconds.The two leap out of the station and the resultant explosion knocks Emilie unconscious.Falling through the Stratosphere and into the atmosphere Snow gets both of their suits off and he manages to glide them safely to a landing on the off ramp to a highway.<br />Emilie uses her pull to get Snow exonerated of all charges and the man who sent Snow on his mission and one of his best friends,was the one behind all the intrigue.He of course is arrested,Snow gets the girl,Emilie finds the suitcase which is empty but Snow finds a micro-chip inside a lighter his dead friend had given him with the secrets,and they both walk into the sunset.<br />From beginning to end an enjoyable romp which will not win an academy award,and which one shouldn't delve into too deeply,lest one see some cracks in the veneer.No,this is simply one of those\\"I've got a neat story to tell you,listen\\",so you sit back and let it tell its tale,whichis over before you know it.Well paced with a very likable scoundrel(Snow),Lockout is bound to please the lovers of action and

B009RI4FRU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. The first time I saw it, I left the theatre with a renewed belief in true love and scouting, even though I don't think I ever stopped believing in either. Wes Anderson is a unique director, but you can see his hand in every single shot of this film. It's artful, quirky, and lots of fun.
0440237688|1.0|Spoiler alert:<br /><br />There is more than one way to read a story; more than one level of interpretation, implied and/or inferred. There are different aspects of a story one can stress.<br />One might point to a story where the \\"Father\\" gives over his \\"son\\" to shoulder the sins of the world in order to save us so that we may live. Sounds like serious stuff until the story ends with the \\"son\\" arriving in the world via a red sleigh like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.<br />I had to giggle. It is a children's book after all.<br />I suppose I could be offended and take this story as seriously as many people do but just because the author values pride and individual choice above fairness, politeness, no war or hunger. . . well, that's up to her. But the fact that she feels the need to set up a society with faults that don't follow from any reason is troubling. One could suggest that pride and individualism (and the like) are right-wing values while being fair and polite (and the like) are left-wing values but few parents teach their children to be rude and unfair; values such as these are best left to dubious ideologies, as if larger society shouldn't be valued as highly as family. When all is said and done, there is not enough depth of religious or philosophical ideas for me to take it seriously . . . only a straw-man society that has flaws that are as unlikely as its strengths.<br />But wait, there's more . . .<br />One main rule for the main character is that he must not discuss with anybody including parents and elders, what goes on behind closed doors with the old man who is his trainer. What might go on in this room? Here's what we do know:<br />\\"Move to the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first\\" . . . \\"What are you going to do sir?\\" . . . . He placed his hands on Jonas's bare back.<br />Now, I was warned that there were some surprises, some of them disturbing, but this situation and language seems to pass right by people. This is a teachable moment but what might our children learn from the words as written?but what might our children learn from the words as written?
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Donald Fagen, both in his Steely Dan context and in his solo projects, is a unique contributor to the world of music. Decade after decade, he delivers his personal blend of pop, rock, funk, jazz, R&B, etc with great artistry, and Sunken Condos is no exception. Without being formulaic, this new album is loaded with with the same ingredients that made Nightfly, Kamakiriad, and Morph the Cat so compelling...<br /><br />1. Well constructed songs built on beautiful chords and catchy melodies<br />2. Smart lyrics that tell a story through the eyes of fallible characters in interesting situations<br />3. Dense arrangements featuring horns, vintage keyboards, and a lush vocal chorus<br />4. Virtuoso solos by the best session players<br />5. Flawless recording and polished production<br />6. That certain Ray Charles/Cannonball Adderley/Aretha Franklin kind of soul which is hard to define but you know it when you hear it<br /><br />I've been listening to this CD in my car for 3 weeks and appreciate it more each time I hear it. If I had to pick a favorite tune it would be \\"Miss Marlene\\" which in my opinion is a masterwork and ranks among his best recordings of all time. But there are no \\"filler\\" tracks here... just Fagen living up to his usual ridiculously high standards.<br /><br />Donald Fagen doesn't reinvent himself every few years, buying into the gimmick-du-jour of the music business, and I for one don't want him to. He has a unique sound, voice, and sensibility that results in great music... something the world needs more of.

B0090SI3ZW|4.0|RZA waited a long time to tell this story, this brainchild of his, inspired by untold hours of viewing kung-fu flicks during his formative years. The Shaw Brothers as baby sitters? Sure, why not. RZA grew up sort of a historian on kung fu pictures, this guy from Brooklyn who can go toe to toe, trivia for trivia, with Hong Kong action cinema experts like Bey Logan. And how does RZA's THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS stack up against classics like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN, MAD MONKEY KUNG FU, and THE FIVE DEADLY VENOMS?<br /><br />Okay, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS isn't the best martial arts film released stateside this year (That would be Iko Uwais's THE RAID: REDEMPTION). Whereas THE RAID: REDEMPTION grounded itself in vicious but realistic combat sequences, RZA's pet project is more steeped in the bizarre and the fanciful. A mythical element creeps in. In RZA's personal vision of wuxia, a fighter's flesh can transmutate into metal. A laborer, by dint of will power, can animate his prostheses. It's a fun show.<br /><br />In the 19th century, the freed slave Thaddeus Henry Smith (RZA) made his way to feudal China, and in the tiny Jungle Village has made a home. Thaddeus is a gifted blacksmith, a peaceful, quiet man. Except that the rough characters in Jungle Village frequently contract his metal-shaping services. And so the blacksmith reluctantly perverts the lessons he'd learned, and he forges jagged weapons of mayhem. Thaddeus's only haven lies in the arms of Lady Silk (Jamie Chung), a courtesan in the local brothel. He dreams of earning enough gold to buy out Lady Silk's contract from the brothel's madame (Lucy Liu). Then they'd go away together. So he keeps on making killing weapons. He turns a blind eye to his conscience.<br /><br />RZA's blacksmith is only one character in a plot that revolves around the Governor's gold shipment, and how all manner of hooligans go all out to obtain it. The central villain is the duplicitous Silver Lion (Byron Mann) of the Lion clan, him what just ruthlessly betrayed his leader, Gold Lion. Fast approaching is Zen Yi (Rick Yune), revenge-inclined son of Gold Lion and wearer of a suit of nasty blades. Today Silver Lion and his minions ride roughshod over Jungle Village. And is it a coincidence that Jungle Village is one of the stops in the gold shipment's itinerary? Does a bear crap in the woods? Is RZA fond of letters in caps?<br /><br />I admire RZA's efforts. Dude's a quadruple threat: he wrote, scored, directed, and acted in this movie. Those into martial arts movies may be aware of RZA's rep as a hardcore addict of kung fu cinema. RZA's been known to drop an audio commentary or two for past DVD releases (like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN). Don't be surprised when RZA manages to rep the Shaolin Temple in a flashback sequence. Me, I enjoyed THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS. I wish that RZA hadn't been so understated in his performance. As the prohibitive protagonist, the sleepy-eyed RZA needed to generate more energy, more life. Thankfully, Russell Crowe picks up the slack, provides the swagger and the big personality as the enigmatic (and amusingly lecherous) Englishman, Jack (or \\"Mr. Knife\\"). Jack Knife is shady, his motivations murky. All we know is that he loves women and that he always brings a gun to a knife fight. You're kept guessing until the third act just which side he'll fall on. THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is packed with amped-up wire-fu theatrics. The violence is brutal but so exaggerated it achieves an almost cartoonish vibe. Set your eyeballs on alert for cameos by Pam Grier and Hong Kong legend Gordon Liu. MMA fighter Cung Le has a supporting bit as Bronze Lion. As a bonus for the theater goer, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is presented by an onscreen Quentin Tarantino, after which he introduces a trailer for his upcoming DJANGO UNCHAINED.an, him what just ruthlessly betrayed his leader, Gold Lion.

1451638450|5.0|Captain Vorpatril's Alliance (2012) is the fifteenth SF novel in the Vorkosigan series, following [[ASIN:1451637500 Cryoburn]].  The initial work in this series is [[ASIN:0671655744 Shards of Honor]].<br /><br />In the previous volume, Miles was visiting the planet of Kibou-daim for a conference on Cryonics.  Roic was so bored that he is having trouble staying awake.  He was starting to believe the rumor that Lady Ekaterin and the empress have cooked up this job to get his master off planet.<br /><br />Then Miles disappeared one day and wouldn't talk about it until back in the hotel room.  After setting up the previously unused bug jammer, Miles mentioned that someone has tried to bribe him.  Apparently this break was important to his master.<br /><br />Then an anti-cryogenics organization took several hostages in the hotel.  Roic practically threw some conventioneers into the elevator and told them to flee.  But he was captured and taken away.<br /><br />The group had also captured Miles, but they used a soporific spray to which he is allergic.  He became manic and escaped his abductors.  But now he was lost in the cryo-storage tunnels under the city.<br /><br />In this novel, Ivan Xav Vorpatril is a Captain in the Imperial Service.  Unlike his cousin Miles, Ivan is tall, handsome and charming.  But he is not very ambitious.<br /><br />Byerly Votrrutyer is a Barrayaran civilian.  By is an acquaintance of Ivan, but not a close friend.<br /><br />Akuti Tejaswini Jyoti ghem Estif Arqua is a fugitive from a dynasty change in Jackson Whole.  Tej is working on Komarr under an assumed name.<br /><br />Lapis Lazuli is Tej's companion.  Rish has a blue skin.<br /><br />In this story, Ivan is visited by By and asked to pick up a woman for a date.  By shows him a picture of the woman and assures him that it is urgent.  The woman is working for a shipping firm, so Ivan buys a cheap vase and has the woman send it to Miles.<br /><br />Ivan asks her for a date, but she is not interested.  She and a fellow worker flee the scene while Ivan goes over to her house and sits on the front steps.  When the woman comes him, Ivan talks her into letting him come in.<br /><br />When Ivan enters the foyer, Rish stuns him lightly.  Both Tej and Rish strain to move him up to their apartment.  Ivan keeps talking to them.<br /><br />The women tie him to a kitchen chair and he keeps talking.  They turn out the light and go to bed.  Ivan keeps working on the bindings to get free.<br /><br />Then two men come into the apartment through the third floor window.  Ivan calls out to them and says that the women have fled.  Then Tej and Rish stun the intruders.<br /><br />Ivan convinces the women to go to his apartment to hide.  On the way, he calls in a complaint to the Dome police.  Then they take a bubble car to his place.<br /><br />Tej and Rish hide in the apartment while Ivan goes to work.  He is the aide de camp of General Desplain and handles many classified messages for the general.  When he starts to leave for the day, a clerk tells him that the local police want to talk to him.<br /><br />After lying to the police, Ivan goes home to his apartment with food.  He describes his day to Tej and Rish and feeds them.  They agree that they will stay a while longer.<br /><br />By comes to asks what happened with the woman that Ivan was supposed to date.  Ivan introduces him to Tej and Rish.  By decides that he likes the looks of Rish and they converse.<br /><br />This tale has Ivan marrying Tej and hiring Rish as a maid to protect them from the police and immigration officials.  Ivan and his new wife are returned to Barrayar.  Then Ivan is taken to face his mother.<br /><br />This story is funny and full of action.  The marriage was supposed to be temporary, but his mother is very pleased with it.  Count Vorpatril is so pleased at the marriage that he refuses to annul it.<br /><br />Ivan soon finds that he likes being married to Tej.  The next installment in thissequence has not yet been announced on Amazon.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Bujold fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of interstellar politics, military affairs, and true romance.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin

B007REV4T8|5.0|I've read more than few reviews declaring Skyfall the best Bond film of all time. So is it? It's probably the most well crafted Bond film just slightly ahead of Casino Royale. The film is much better than Quantum of Solace but is it better than a film like Goldfinger? Skyfall and Goldfinger are so dramatically different that it's like asking if Saving Private Ryan is better than Tropic Thunder. Skyfall has a very methodical pacing clocking it at 143 minutes (actually a minute shorter than Casino Royale) and the film might have benefited from a touch of pruning. Personally I preferred Casino Royale but Skyfall is an amazing film with perhaps the best casting of any in the series. This is the most serious Bond film among the 23 and Javier Bardem will undoubtedly go down as one of if not the best Bond villain ever. Every scene with Bardem is magic but you have to be patient because Bardem doesn't make an appearance until well into the film.<br /><br />As strange is it may sound Skyfall is more of a continuation of the Pierce Brosnan films than the two Daniel Craig movies. The World is Not Enough explored the idea of M putting the mission objective ahead of people and reaping the results. In Die Another Day after being released from 14 months of torture in North Korea Bond is treated in an absurdly callous manner by M. Given the fact that he had previously saved London from a disastrous EMP burst, prevented a nuclear explosion and stopped World War III she might want to cut him some slack. Skyfall's main plot is pretty much the same as the subplot of The World is Not Enough in that M's disregard of another's life comes back to haunt her. In some ways Bardem's Silva is almost a surrogate for Brosnan's Bond seeking revenge for the torture. The difference between Skyfall and the aforementioned films is that Skyfall is done a thousand times better.<br /><br />To my great delight Skyfall stops the horrible rapid cut action scenes of Quantum of Solace that hurt the film so badly. The action here is light years better. The plot on the other hand is best enjoyed if you don't consider it too deeply. I refer to the film plot but it could also apply to the villains plot. Bardem's goal of revenge is rather modest. In fact it's probably something achievable by just about anyone with a small amount of motivation. The only way it could be made into a film is because Bardem tries to achieve his goal in the most audaciously complicated way possible. It would be like trying to cross the road by spending years investing millions in research on a jet pack rather than just crossing when the light changes. Still, if you just accept things for what they are it's a heckuva thrill ride.<br /><br />I was so happy when Casino Royale came out proving that the Bond producers still had what it takes to stay relevant and produce a slam dunk but after Quantum of Solace I was concerned that Casino Royale might be to Daniel Craig what Goldeneye was to Pierce Brosnan, the only really good film of his tenure. Skyfall has shown that Casino Royale was no fluke. For the first time in 50 years Bond has gone beyond popcorn entertainment and entered the realm of great films and given the fact that the producers have plans to come out with a new movie every two years Bond fans may be in store for some tremendous excitement.dly.

B0053O89JM|1.0|My complaint is with Universal for using thin cheap dvds and putting them in a package designed to maximize profits rather than provide easy access in getting them out to play or protecting them from getting damaged.  It's not worth the trouble to send it back and wait for a replacement.  From now on if it says \\"Universal\\" on the box, I'm staying away.  I guess that Universal thinks because dvds are on their way out, why bother using good ones?
B0037KMHRY|4.0|A completely original sounding theme that reminds me of the scores produced for Terminator 2. The same forlorn feeling of being torn between two worlds of technological conflict. At the same time there's also a feeling of redemption too. I thought this awesome looking movie didn't have a great story. A bar scene? This \\"other\\" world is looking more and more like Earth! I will probably listen to the score often but not revisit the movie where the younger Flynn looked amazing in some scenes yet wooden (intentionally?) in others. Pick up the \\"R3CONFIGUR3D\\" disc for some great dance beats.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|The characters seem adolescent in their approach to life. There is just no complexity or dimension to the characters and it is difficult to believe this was written for an adult audience.

Is he not connected to his feelings or is this experience just a plot devise to set him in this bookstore so he can have this \\"Scooby-Doo\\" like experience?
0062060562|2.0|This is definitely a thriller but it's overly formulaic. It also has plot inconsistencies that a reasonably good editor could have cleared up, so I won't harp on them. What makes me less than enthusiastic about the book is that Watson does an unconvincing job of capturing Christine's mental state.<br /><br />On the plus side, reading this did raise questions that I'll go to non-fiction and documentary films to answer. At the end of his book, Watson says he was inspired by Deborah Wearing's [[ASIN:0385606265 Forever Today]], a non-fiction account of her husband's severe amnesia, so I ordered it from Amazon. Besides reading that, I'll check out the BBC documentary 'Man without a Memory.'<br /><br />Meanwhile, I got insights from several short clips about Clive Wearing on YouTube. Those videos only increased my sense that Watson failed to convey the mental state of a severe amnesiac. Worse, they suggested that the journaling device at the heart of his book was preposterous.<br /><br />While the thriller format succeeded in stimulating my adrenaline, I'd have preferred a narrative that elicited greater empathy. In other words, I wanted less of a page-turner and more of an understanding of Christine's inner life.

Is it still illegal to make my own digital copy even though I paid for one I couldn't receive?<br />They just need to make this important aspect of the disc clearer. I would have purchased another format if I had known. If downloading and streaming is the future, how about some consideration for this other popular platform...

It had a great beginning, a great middle and almost no ending, except the one you invent in your own head. Perhaps that was his goal, but it was not one that I liked.<br />Jim Hitch<br />Mountain Home, AR

B004UJAOLM|3.0|After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I thought I should continue in the same vein with Wuthering Heights, written by her sister Emily Bronte. But whereas Jane Eyre is a story of love rewarded and hopes fulfilled, Wuthering Heights so far is an unremittingly grim tale of cruelty and revenge in two related families.<br /><br />Structurally, the book is a frame tale within a frame tale: Mr. Lockwood, the narrator who introduces the story, is soon replaced by the voice of Nelly Dean, the faithful servant who relates to Mr. Lockwood the family history that has led to the current misery. To my view, Nelly is the strongest and most believable character. Most of the rest of the characters in the story seem overdrawn. They are also hard to keep straight, partly because names are shared between generations; sometimes I think a family tree might be helpful.<br /><br />Considering that Wuthering Heights was written about 1845, I was expecting more difficulty with language than I actually encountered. There are few speeches in a heavy Yorkshire dialect which are daunting, and apparently even the author at one point considered revising them to make them intelligible to a broader audience. And there are some isolated words which seem to have changed their meaning over the years; but for the most part the book is quite readable.<br /><br />I have so far read about two-thirds of the text. I am plodding through to the end, hoping that there may be some ray of light shed before the end of the book.

For someone who really likes the idea of keeping a diary to look back on, but doesn't want to write a long entry of your day; this is perfect! It is small which is nice for carrying, but this also causes it not to open very easily. It also would be nice if it had a ribbon book mark attached. (i actually just keep a ribbon in it to mark the page and it works fine) Other wise this is a great little journal to have, and an amazing gift for someone!!

B007Z9QWVK|4.0|The much maligned, brief theatrical film by Madonna - W.E. - fairs better on the small screen than it likely did in the movie houses. The stories are bifurcated, each one resembling a television creation - one a docudrama biopic, the other a contemporary soap opera. That Madonna, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Alek Keshishian, decided to mix the two stories is a bit daring but in some ways it works very well. In other ways the parallel stories seem like time traveling cars on the same highway that never quite travel at the same speed or quality.<br /><br />The film mixes the notorious affair between King Edward VIII and American divorc&eacute;e Wallis Simpson with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. The time is 1998 and at an auction of the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor unhappily married ex-Sotheby employee Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed by their historic love story. Her own marriage to womanizing, abusive psychiatrist William (Richard Coyle) undermines her feelings of worth and as she learns more about the sacrifices involved in the famous affair, she gains her own courage to find happiness.<br /><br />The film flips back and forth between the present and the 1930s and it is the historical aspect of the film that is almost flawless. We get to know Wallis Simpson (in a brilliant portrayal by Andrea Riseborough) and understand her failed first two marriages (at the time we meet her she is still married to Ernest Simpson played by David Harbour), and see the American sizzle that made her the talk of England. When Wallis wrangles her way to meet Prince Edward, better known as David, (James D'Arcy) there is a chemistry that develops to the point of passion and ultimately leads to Wallis divorcing Ernest to marry Edward - a deed that leads to Edward's abdication of the throne for `the woman I love', which he had assumed when King George V (James Fox) dies, to his stammering brother Bertie (Laurence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer). The paparazzi make their life miserable and the couple is not allowed to return to England until Edward dies, with the faithful Wallis supportively by his side through 36 years of marriage.<br /><br />Wally - meanwhile - longs to be pregnant but sustains such abuse from William that she ultimately yields to the loving friendship the auction house Russian security guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac) and begins her life again. The two stories are connected by Wally's obsession with the royal couple's notorious affair and at auction's end she is given access to private letters between Wallis and Edward that have been in the possession of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Haluk Bilginer) - a tacked on ending that feels ill at ease and redundant.<br /><br />Everyone connected to the biopic angle of this film is excellent and Madonna shows that she knows how to direct affairs of the heart in a royal situation very well indeed. Both Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are superb and the costumes and music and cinematography of this historical portion are exceptionally well done. Though the idea of the contemporary sluggish story is reasonable, Abbie Cornish seems uncomfortable with the script: Oscar Isaac shines as her new love. In all the film, though spotty, has merit and it not a bad debut for Madonna as director. Grady Harp, November 12ce Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer).

1451638450|5.0|At last, Ivan Vorpatril gets his own adventure, instead of being Miles' donkey and occasional delivery boy of the deus ex machina. A lot of us have become fond of Ivan and wished more for him than the role of comic relief. This is, after all, the man who saved a lot of necks, not to mention other anatomical parts, during A Civil Campaign, and later arranged for the humping ice bunnies at Miles' wedding.<br />Ivan is on Komarr, working as a secretary to Admiral Desplains and helping perform an annual Fleet inspection. There is a suspicion of smuggling that may involve suborned Vor, so Ivan has redirected his sensitive nose from detecting occasions for dalliance to assessing threat levels in communiqu&eacute;s. His quiet, orderly existence gets derailed when none other than Byerly Vorrutyer shows up on his doorstep with an odd request. Naturally Ivan's first response id to say \\"No!\\" but By appeals to Ivan's sense of chivalry, and it turns out that Miles and Mark doe not have a genetic monopoly on that virtue.<br />When Ivan's intervention thwarts a double kidnapping, Ivan finds himself sheltering two extraordinary young women, Tej and Rish,  refugees of a Jackson's Whole Family coup that left them on the run, low on resources, and at the top of bounty hunters' lists across three systems.<br />Protecting them eventually involves relocating to Barrayar, where Ivan's mother, the formidable Lady Alys, and the disconcerting former head of Imperial Security, Simon Illyan, take an interest the young ladies' dilemma.<br />Miles shows up, albeit briefly, but he is too busy being a new da to steal Ivan's thunder - besides, Ivan is managing quite well on his own, until, that is, some unlooked for newcomers arrive on the scene, one of whom is actually making a long postponed return. What she knows about long buried secrets could change the landscape, political and otherwise, of Vorbarr Sultana.<br />Bujold works wonders with her unerring ability to find the right word, the perfect phrasing, and her sense of humor has strongly reasserted itself. Captain Vorpatril's Alliance is almost as much a Regency-style romance as A Civil Campaign, except that there are only two lines of romance, not the complex interweaving of four or more that made that earlier book such a masterpiece of the form. Politics of empires and familial interactions come to the fore, and several loose ends that were left dangling and flapping in previous stories get spliced in this volume.<br />Veiled Spoiler Alert!!!! Bujold also drops a bombshell. A single hyphenated word changes everything, and it  makes the most appalling sense. Stop reading if you don't want a pointed clue. You do? Okay.  It's in Chapter 10, page 155; find the hyphenated word, not the one for hair color, and ask yourself, \\"Where have I seen this word before earlier in this series?\\" Myself, I think my hair turned grey with shock. Nice work, Ms. Bujold. It fits, perfectly.sing, and her sense of humor has strongly reasserted itself.

B0016HPO70|3.0|Robert Chambers probably would not be remembered today without H. P. Lovecraft.<br /><br />The sole title he's is now recognized for is The King in Yellow. Like most literary works, it was drifting into the dark and cold zone of cultural oblivion. Then he was caught in the gravity well of that coalescing star of weird fiction, H. P. Lovecraft. And, once illuminated by Lovecraft's in his Supernatural Horror in Literature, this work became sort of a bright satellite beckoning Lovecraft fans to explore it.<br /><br />But Chambers' book is one of those moons with only one face of any interest.<br /><br />To be sure, there is the appearance, in several connected stories, of the sinister effects and reputation of the titular volume and its enigmatic references to the Pallid Mask and Carcosa and Hastur and the lake of Hali. And the notion of such a book definitely inspired Lovecraft to create his more famous book of blasphemy, the Necronomicon.<br /><br />But that's only half the book, five weird stories.  This group of stories is just connected enough to justify reading in order.<br /><br />\\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" first seems to be an unexpected piece of science fiction, the future world of 1920 as imagined in 1895 with attendant projections of Progressive-era politics, turn of the century American imperialism, and contemporary anti-Semitism. Taken on those terms alone, it's interesting, but we also get a plot about a mysterious Mr. Wilde who has allegedly built up, via social coercion and blackmail, a vast network of political control. Such a powerful network, in fact, that the artist protagonist of the story dreams of using it to usurp his cousin's place as heir to the Imperial Dynasty of America. Or maybe not. Not everything is as it seem,s and some of the clues to that are in later stories.<br /><br />\\"The Mask\\"'s plot - hinging on an artist who has discovered a way of petrifying living matter while preserving its most delicate structures - has little interest and kind of a sappy ending. However, the bits expanding Chambers' mythology and the mystery of the King in Yellow make it worth reading.<br /><br />\\"In the Court of the Dragon\\" is another slight story. After reading The King in Yellow, its hero encounters a menacing organist at a church service and begins to see the threatening man everywhere. As with \\"The Mask\\", the real interest is the tantalizing bits we get about \\"the towers of Carcosa\\".<br /><br />\\"The Yellow Sign\\" is justifiably the most anthologized of the stories here and the high point of the book.  Like most of the stories in the book, it involves an artist. Outside his studio, he sees a young man who reminds him of a \\"coffin-worm\\".  His favorite model, for whom he has great affection, tells him of a dream she had with the same man driving a hearse with the artist as its dead cargo. Chambers not only packs plenty of weirdness in, gives us the largest description of the contents of The King in Yellow of any story here, but also gives us an ending which I suspect influenced Lovecraft's work.<br /><br />\\"The Demoiselle D'Ys\\" eschews the usual Paris or New York City settings of the other stories, but it's a standard and predictable time-slip romance.<br /><br />And that's it for the book's interest as weird fiction. We then get a bunch of enigmatic vignettes and poems and then a batch of uninteresting and forgettable romantic stories of American artists in Paris. To be fair, though, there is one interesting part in \\"The Street of the First Shell\\" set, it seems, during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. There is an extended passage in part three when the hero joins a French army attempting a breakout.  It is an eerie account with a supernatural quality in its descriptions of the fog-shrouded battle, the confusion, and vivid bits of description.<br /><br />So, for those who are interested in Carcosa and the related bits of Chambers' mythology (actually some of it comes from Ambrose Bierce), the first half of this book is a must read. For those just looking for good quality weird fiction, just read \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" and \\"The Yellow Sign\\".
B008S80PCE|5.0|If you are struggling about buying the new Bill Withers box set released by Sony Europe having invested in re-issues of some of the CDs included in the set that are available elswhere on Columbia/Columbia Legacy, Reel Music, Raven and BBR - don't hesitate - especially with some sources selling it for around $23 (less than $3 a CD) on the Amazon site. The box brings remastered versions of \\"Watching You Watching Me\\" and \\"'Bout Love\\" on CD for the first time. The audio on the set is uniformly superb - although the 24 bit remasters by Bill Lacey on Reel Music/P & C of \\"Naked and Warm,\\" and \\"Making Music\\" may have a very slight sonic edge - and the cardboard sleeve reproductions - including the gatefold on \\"Live\\" and the fold out of \\"Still Bill\\" which are nice - are made such that the sleeve can bend slightly such that most of the CDs can be removed without touching the surface and inflicting irreparable damage as the effort to remove the disc results in it being flung across the room. Kudos to Sony Legacy Europe and Leo Sacks for these features and the 40-page booklet. This set has been in constant play since it arrived 3 days ago. I had forgotten just how really, really good Bill Withers's music is.<br />The music has always been unique - in terms of writing style, topics (\\"Grandma's Hands\\")  and Bill's voice - and difficult to characterize - as he has said \\"Too white for black radio, too black for white radio\\" - when such things were far more important than they are today. Since his last Columbia album \\"Watching You Watching Me\\" in 1985, Bill Withers has been conspicuously absent from the recording scene - but his music is an almost daily staple on XM Radio's \\"Soul Town\\" - a welcome relief to a diet overly rich in Motown since the demise of \\"Soul Street\\". He popped up on a duet with Jimmy Buffett in 2004 and demo'd some of his new work on the \\"Still Bill\\" DVD. I'm sure that a CD of new music would be welcomed by many of his fans. As one of the reviewers of the DVD noted, Mr. Withers is the music equivalent of comfort food - a great recommendation.<br />Limitations on this boxed set - none - except that a bonus CD (or a separate CD?) might have been in order that could have included Mr. Wither's vocals with Grover Washington, The Crusaders, Ralph McDonald and Bobby Womack (I'd pass on the duet with Jimmy Buffett), Better Days, The Gift of Giving, the Sunshine/Total Eclipse remixes from the 1990 CBS UK album - \\"Lovely Days\\"  and the long lost and great 45, \\"USA\\" on the 1981 Iran situation that is as relevant in 2012 as it was then. Go listen to it on You Tube - in fact listening to the \\"Live\\" album while writing this, another Withers' masterpiece, \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\" is as important and tragic today with Iraq/Afghanistan replacing Vietnam. Some things unfortunately do not change.<br />I'm hoping that Sony Europe's upcoming 15 CD box on Taj Mahal - including two rare CDs - does as good a job as this set. It is a gem.

1480054542|1.0|I'm disheartened to read that this author has been writing since she was 11 years old!! What schools did she attend?!? Or worse, who were her English teachers? The grammar, punctuation, and abundance of typos caused me to delete this book from my Kindle only 2% into the story! Here are some examples, taken verbatim from the beginning of the book:<br /><br />\\"A face that had the same light eyes as his sister.\\" (So the face has a sister?)<br /><br />\\"The Jordan's are your nearest neighbors...\\" (NO apostrophe to turn a noun to a plural!)<br /><br />\\"...his hair was longer than his sisters\\" (So either his sisters are ant-size, or there's a lost opportunity for an apostrophe here--where it's actually needed! And this implies more than one sister, but only one sister is mentioned)<br /><br />\\"His jaw was strong with the smallest of clefts in it, his lips...\\" (clefts are in the chin, not the jaw; and I won't mention the misuse of a comma here)<br /><br />\\"...men who where weather worn from years on fishing boats...\\" (is this supposed to be \\"were\\" instead of \\"where\\"? and if so, is it the men themselves who are weather worn, or their skin?! If the men themselves are weather worn, what would that mean exactly?)<br /><br />\\"She was use to crowds.\\" (USED)<br /><br />\\"Well now, if you change your mind, just let me know.\\" The Father said patting her hand one more time.\\" (One of my favorite consistent mishaps: the blatantly poor use of punctuation in dialogue.)<br /><br />Run on sentences; subject/verb disagreement: \\"Megan, this is my brother Iian, he's hearing impaired, we uses sign language to communicate, but he can also reads lips really well.\\" She said while continuing to sign. (Sigh...really?! Did anybody proofread this work?!?)<br /><br />Here's another, what would this be? Misspelled word, improper reference, or just lack of a clue? \\"He likes to ease-drop so be careful what you say while facing him.\\" (ease-drop?!?! EAVESDROP)<br /><br />The above reflect a fraction of thepoor writing I suffered through in just the first 2% of the book--small wonder I was disinclined to proceed any further. It's a shame, too, because the story line actually has potential, which is the only reason I read THAT far! That this book is part of an actual series is disturbing.<br /><br />Kindle: You really need to spring for editors!
B004SBX112|1.0|I had nearly beaten the entire angry birds seasons game. Then I got a message saying that this app needed new permissions. So I thought it would just be some updated pictures or some such thing. But no. The app got rid of seasons 2 and 3 and deleted all my progress on all the levels. This couldn't have been a mistake, because it shows an updated picture in the app store. I have also never known to have an update delete my progress. If this was intentional, then I am very upset with Rovio. Please fix this as soon as possible.

I truly feel that this is one of his better works, and it stands out as one of the most enjoyable of his books in decades.  Whether you are already a fan of his, or are just being introduced to him as an author, The Racketeer is a great read, and you will find yourself lost in the story and will harvey at how he weaves the tale from start to finish.

B006GHA9VQ|1.0|Okay, so I hate sequels on their very premise of existing, but I am a HUGE POTO fan, so I tried VERY hard to go at this with an open mind.  Epic fail.  I can tolerate what they did to Christine and MAYBE even to the Phantom (but seriously, Coney Island?  I'm an American and I still think that's dumb...which is saying a lot).  I cannot tolerate what he did to Meg, but the worst is what they did to the hero. This show butchers the role of Rauol, who's reduced to a drunkard and gambler (and I'm sorry, but after watching Hadley Fraser perfect that role, can anyone honestly see Rauol falling that far? Honestly??).  No way does he lose Christine to the Phantom in a bet, oh, spoiler I guess, but if you're still thinking about watching this crap, you deserve it.  No way, NO WAY, does Meg shoot Christine...ooops, spoiler again...seriously, don't watch this.  You'll hate yourself for wasting the 2.5 hours you could have spent watching netflix's 25 Anniversary POTO from Royal Albert Hall.<br /><br />Is it all bad...fine, to be fair there is one good song, and lucky for you, it's RIGHT AWAY AT THE BEGINNING.  The Phantom's opening song.  Once you've watched it, you can turn it off.  Seriously.  Turn it off.  It's the only thing that's redeeming about the film, and that's not saying much.<br /><br />Andrew: you didn't have my permission to truncate the show for Phantom Spectacular in Las Vegas (which is what they used eventually to make the film version--and again, props to Rauol for being AWESOME in that one too).  Anyway, you shouldn't have cut out critical scenes/songs for that and you CERTAINLY shouldn't have done a sequel.  It was a bad idea, a very VERY bad idea.  It's an insult to Gaston Lareoux, an insult to Sarah Brightman, a catastrophic insult to Steve Barton and Maria Bjornson, and a slap in the face of every POTO fan out there.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY DO NOT WATCH THIS: YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF.
B0038PPOAA|5.0|Great book.  A must read for all small business owners who are failing themselves and heading for disaster.  This book shows you how to take yourself from working in the business to working on the business.  Awesome!
B00A3OJ3CO|5.0|This is a great show!  Very action packed with a kick butt hero who is concerned with helping those who have nowhere else to turn (although it goes deeper than that because of his father).  This show really is a must see!
B0098VXE50|5.0|This blu-ray disc has some very interesting extras. I love the take on the story. The scenery along the seashore is lovely and the CGI effects are great.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Google KM-IPHONE-MIC (about $25) and you need that along with this mic to record quality video on your iPhone (works with 4 and 5).  I have tried several other adapters and they don't work.  The cable is very long, which is good but keeping it neat is challenging.  Overall very satisfied with the quality of audio and how much it costs.
B0017P520U|5.0|Saw Beowulf at the movies and was so intrigued by the important messages contained in the film about careless decisions in youth becoming a lifetime of regret at the end of one's life. It is a message I never tire of watching again.
0385344333|3.0|This was my first Jack Reacher book, and I was surprised to find it's 17th in the series!  I did enjoy it.  It sucked me in from the start, had me thinking and I wanted to keep reading to find out what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the fact that much of the first part of the story took place in the car. I found it intriguing and wanted to find out where they were going and why.  There was a lot of wonderful buildup, but then I felt that the last quarter of the book slowed.  Although it was in no way bad, it didn't have the sizzling ending I was expecting.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Much better than I thought it would be. Nothing like Transformer, more like Aliens. Streaming was flawless and purchase was very easy.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|The video stream would be all jumpy, audio/video out of sync a lot, blurry image half the time. This is why I go netflix and Hulu... amazon just doesn't compare.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was sorry it ended. I really enjoyed the plot<br />.it kept me interested from the beginning to the end<br /> A must read.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Could be one of the worst books I have ever read.  Overblown caricatures of characters, each more horrid, repulsive and unrealistic than the next. It's an effort to care what happens to these people.  Terribly melodramatic, obvious, overblown.  What a disappointment.  Do NOT purchase.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|After seeing this title pop up on my screen every time I opened Prime Instant videos, I reluctantly gave in and watched...only to be surprised at how hilarious this film is. Adult humor in an animated style with familiar voices made my adult friends and I continue watching finding increasing entertainment value. Worth your time. Very cool visuals.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellently written.  I will add this author to my list to read again.  This would be a great choice for any reader's group to dicuss!<br />So many topics within one written book!!  What a shocking ending!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Just started playing but I like it...I haven't. figured everything out yet but it is definitely action packed and full of different stuff!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great example of a Wes Anderson film. Heartwarming and funny. The film accomplishes being quirky and strange while also being grounded and real.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I read this in one day, as I couldn't put it down. It's as thought provoking for life today as it was when written.
8498381495|5.0|The book is just what I ordered.  My Spanish 4 and 5 classes will be reading it.  It has always been one of my favorite books.  I have read it in 3 languages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game.  An everyday thing as soon as I get home to unwind & relax before starting supper and housework.
1856697525|5.0|Livro que conta toda a história do designer Saul Bass, texto de primeira qualidade, imagens de trabalhos consagrados e inéditos.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love this game!  I really like that we can each have our own profile. It's a great way to pass time. great graphics too!
B00785P2QC|3.0|SOOOOOO.....SLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWWW.  IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET ANYWHERE.  i'd play all day long if it were for the energy requirements for everything.  not too mention the cost do to anything.  takes way to long to earn money.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I wish I didn't have to look things up. Each time, it turned out to be something in front of my face, but too small to see.  I wish I had an iPad.  :(
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this version of spider solitaire. don't need to think too hard. when I play something such as this it is to relax and be a little mindless,
B009KHBDUU|4.0|This may not be one of the memorable movies that critics praised, but as entertainment is not bad, I think a good combination of horror with humor. I'm really tired of horror films whose only tools are being increasingly bloody and show the most ugly faces possible.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Was a bit skeptical about this movie after reading a few comments but I rented it anyway.<br /><br />IT WAS AWESOME! Too cute and it made me cry multiple times along with making me laugh throughout the movie.<br /><br />Definitely one that I would buy now to watch every year.<br /><br />I watched it with our kids ages 2 and 4 and they were kinda tired so weren't completely in to it. They just cuddled with me for the most part and enjoyed the view (the stars, the ship, the reindeer, animals flying, outerspace, etc). Will be nice when they are a bit older. My 4-year-old, when I asked her at the end if she liked the movie, hugged me and said \\"I love you, Mommy!\\" and reminded me that she wanted a pink bike too like the girl got in the movie. :)<br /><br />(The only part I may fast forward through next time is when they are at the dinner table arguing or \\"discussing\\" who was going to be Santa in the board game)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|FINALLY!, Grisham has gotten his groove back with The Rackateer.  As a Grisham \\"addict\\" I've read every book he has written.  As a high school librarian, I pushed \\"A Time to Kill\\" into every kid's hand--not just for reading pleasure, but also as an example of the courts in today's society capabilities.  Grisham then went on to write several more great stories before a period of novels that read like they were being churned out for publishers to have best sellers.  In The Rackateer Grisham re-establishes himself as a gifted, knowledgeable writer.  Thanks so much and looking for future page-turners from him.
B004SBX112|3.0|worked perfectly until I updated last night and now all there is is season 2011 and only go green- hogs and kisses- seasons greetings- and trick or treat!! very dissappointed not only had I enjoyed season 2012 and the new season but I paid for this app!! please do an app fix soon!!!!
B000NM46PA|5.0|I've always wanted this, since it first came out.  This album introduced me to RUSH.  It's in great shape, no skips.  Came very quickly too.
0374531269|5.0|This is avery compelling book and is a must read!!.It is vey detailed and violent.At age 12 ishmael beahs home is overtaken by rebels when he is away with his friends at the city. And his life is turned and twisted in ways you can't even imagine. He is forced to join the african military and In the middle of the book after he has been on his own for awhile. He has been fighting for two years and is taken out by unicef to rehabilitation center and leads to forget the terrible things he did.this book is not for the light hearted and is very vivid in detail
B0033AGPFS|5.0|This is such a great album.  A real must for true fans of Hendrix.  On lp is way better than on cd.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|from Amazon. When I have to wait along time some place, I can alway's watch my movie. Sure make's the time go by faster.Beside's it 's cheaper than going to the movies......
0312330537|5.0|This novel is hardly in need of another gushing review, but I love this novel so much. It also has one of the best openings I've ever read. The thickness put me off from starting the novel, but I never felt the need to check \\"how long to the end?\\"<br /><br />I have met people who have seen me reading it, who stopped me to tell me how much they liked the book, we discuss it, and I've become friends with several of them!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is one of my favorite Tom Burton films. While make not ideal for younger children, it is a very entertaining and endearing story.
B005EI86JU|5.0|This book is well written and presents the material in a logical manner. Very focused on practical use and how to set up the camera for various situations. I bought the Kindle version and it is OK, but if I had it to do over I think I prefer a hard copy book for this kind of manual.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|The app wouldn't open the first couple of times after I installed it.  When it finally opened on the third try, I was able to play all the Tatooine levels and a bonus level.  Then the screen froze on one of the in-between levels story images.  The music played, but the image never went away.  I couldn't end the program, so I had to shut down the device altogether.  Not sure Amazon should be stating it's compatible with the Archos 43 when there are clearly issues.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Marvel fans will rejoice in this familiar yet entertaining comic-book spectacle. Director Josh Whedon never allows the CGI to overwhelm a deft mixture of humor, action and occasional reflection. Sincere performances further prevent the movie from lapsing into a live-action cartoon. Slightly overlong, \\"Marvel's The Avengers\\" provides agreeable escapism.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book because it opens your viewpoint to a whole other world that one might not be familiar with. It makes one see life different. It's very real and quite touchy.
B004WR125O|3.0|This wireless receiver always took a long time to connect to my wireless network, did not receive a good signal, and constantly cut out or had to rebuffer.  Then, all the sudden it died.  I am now working on getting it replaced.  Don't be cheap like me and just hard wire your ethernet into the receiver.<br /><br />Update:  Onkyo replaced this item at no cost, the new one is working well.
B0084I9QIW|4.0|This DVD is worth seeing as Michael is no longer with us. A great concert as always. Something to remember him by.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Solid Prequel, however, it just doesn't have that 'this has never been done before' panache that the original Alien did. Alien marked the first time a woman played the ballsey leading man role, a sort of female John Wayne. This movie also lacked that edge-of-your-seat suspense that Alien evoked so well. Cinematography ? A+, Casting ? Uninspiring to say the least. Watchable yes but also quite forgettable. Perhaps Ridley should have left well enough alone.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Not a bad season of Mad Men, def had its moments. And it still has that Mad Men feel. Worst part of the season is Megan (cute girl, but perhaps too free-spirited for Don?).
B000077VR3|5.0|Never had a chance to see it in the Theater and only recently got to see it on this DVD - it is spectacular. The editing is, at times dizzying to say the least and there are some great numbers that are voiced over by other cast but all in all it works. The plot is formulaic but with enough creative twists that it breathes life into the story line. Cinematography, casting & nearly every score are five stars. Who knew Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor could sing ? Passionate, entertaining and evocative-by-moral of a really amazing time in Parisian Theater.
B0018AJNH2|4.0|I love this type of movie.  I don't what it was classified as for sure, but I consider it to both horror and science fiction.  It has a plot even though it is disgustingly wonderful.  It contains blood, gore and weirdness which are expected in this genre.  You never know for sure what will happen next until it happens.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|At first I was annoyed with all the letters to \\"a friend\\" but then once I caught on that was how the whole book was going to be I got over it & actually enjoyed it.
B004LROMQG|5.0|My daughter talked me into watching a few episodes and after that I was a big fan of Merlin. I'm hoping the 4th season will be out soon for our region.<br />Thank You
B003LJRTXS|4.0|A light and easy read.  Perfect for a holiday novel. It painted a picture of life in those times with all it's falsities and cover-ups to \\" keep up appearances\\" of the \\"nobility\\"
B001LF347E|5.0|This is probably getting a little boring with me and my positive attitude on Merlin but believe me I would not have purchased all 3 seasons available if I was'nt sure it was a program I would watch more than once and lend to family members who also enjoy it.<br />Thank You
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was just Buying another app and it mad me start over. l was so mad .l yelled each out.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I want to recomend this &iacute;tem! All the song are excelllents! You have to have IT if you like fun and young music with &oacute;ptimistic lirycs!
B0013KTGAG|4.0|I really liked the movie the story line was some what easy to predict but I really enjoyed the acting from Cillian Murphy and Chris Evens. I would recommend this movie to someone who loves sci fi movies and suspense movies.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|note:tap this review to see full review<br />Angry Birds Star Wars is now way better than the old angry bird game (season's, Rio, space) now in star wars is a entirely new world! in my opinion, this is the best angry birds idea yet made! who doesent like star wars? almost no one... why not put it to a game? well now I jusr cannot believe my eyes! I never expected to see a world like path of the Jedi(I forgot how to spell it) in any game! But of course, everyone (like me) will like a game that is very popular put in with a movie that's is popular(am I right?). But as good as angry birds star wars is, I can't even describe it! I can't!  But I'm gonna tell the truth though I have only played lvl 1 to make a 5 star review but then I played on my best friends tablet to play a few more lvl's and better is this game! If your someone who likes angry bird games, then you will like angry birds star wars. Oh and before I forget, don't make a game like this one get a lower rating because of it's problems(if you encounter any),there's a button at the bottom of the games description that says report issue with app tell them what the problem is,  and if it is not fixed by 1 week,  then lower the rating. but I always like to make my reviews 5 star because there is always an effort made to make these games.And yes,  I do know I could have put paragraphs but I did not. note:if anyone from rovio reads this then please notice this is a idea that I think many angry birds fans will want: Angry birds wrestling
B007V65R54|5.0|so much for predictions!  An enjoyable read and not a book you speed read through.  Also now enjoy his times column
B00846REIS|5.0|Okay, so this book IS NOT Shades of Grey. There is only a hint of what Grey was into. What Grey hinted at, Gideon is.  I have to agree with other raters who praised the character development.  Since the story is mostly about a budding relationship, knowing the characters is crucial.  Everyone in this story is Human.  At times so raw and BARE, you want to turn away, but you become so invested in reading the story, you have to see what happens next. I'm not sure if I will read the next story. Although its a great romance, with the hottest, artfully erotic scenes I've read in some time, the trauma experience by the main characters may be a slight deterrent for further indulgence into the series.
B004SBX112|1.0|I love the games all of them but the updates need lots of work! I wouldn't care to pay more for an app if updates didn't destroy previous wins!!!
0385535147|4.0|It's not the best Grisham book I've read, but definitely worth reading.  Kept my attention, got through it in two nights.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagen is the master of groove. The Lord of aging hipness.  A musical genius.  In an age of music that sounds alike and that has little depth, this album (and every DF solo album and Steely Dan album) are musical nirvana for those who appreciate great grooves, sophisticated music that does not seem to be dense and snarky lyrics.  Love it!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was a great read and so, so funny! Tina Fey did a great job and I laughed my A off!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've read this book cover-to-cover again and again.  I'm a bit of a zombie nut, and have even planned some things out in the unlikely event such a scourge arrives on our earth.  Max's book has brought to light so many things that I never considered before about what that world might be like.  It is not something I look forward to, anymore.  This book humanizes the whole zombie genre like no film or Tv show has done before.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|maybe even more... as the headphone jack on my laptop died and the volume is zero.<br /><br />this event triggered my incursion into the audiophile's world, reading numerous reviews and getting to know all the hype that surrounds the topic. It was like falling on the rabbit's hole.<br />Finally, i got out with an e17 and some nice beyerdynamic headphones (250 ohms). The pairing is very good and i believe this is the best sounding combo i've ever heard, so i got out of the audiophile hole to enjoy some music and forget about the technicalities and the pursuit of the ultimate sound quality.<br /><br />for me, the e17 represents a huge improvement since im able again to listen to music from a laptop using headphones using this DAC/AMP which is connected to the laptop via USB port.<br /><br />for the people still in the hole, this is a 150 usd DAC/AMP and will sound to you as bad as a 150 USD DAC/AMP, far away from the 1000usd DAC paired with the 2000 usd AMP that makes you lose sleep at night.<br /><br />for any other folks, this is a nice device with built in battery, it can be used as a DAC and and AMP for high quality high impedance headphones (you don't need it if you don't even knowwhat impedance means or if you can hear your music loud enough). the build quality is very good, except the connectors (the metal ring around the line in connector is broken already, but works well), and most importantly, the sound quality of the device has no major problems.<br /><br />my recommendation is: buy an e17 ONLY if you need it (i.e if you need ALL its functions, otherwise, get an e7), save your money for better things, stay away from head fi forums, dont let yourself be brainwashed with snake oil and hype and you will enjoy more the music than the people from the hole.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another winner by DeMille. The plot is great as well as all the background in typical DeMille manner. The characters are well portrayed although the sarcasm from Corey is a bit much at times the book is well done.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I'll admit, I wanted to check out the book after being a happy Castle watcher, and I was reasonably impressed. The characters here, while not the same, are fun reflections of those in the show - and likewise are the strongest part of the narrative. The story grabbed my attention and held it pretty well, though my criticism would be that the conclusion felt rather abrupt. Still, I'm going to check out the next one.
030759565X|4.0|I've been following Smitten Kitchen's blog for over a year now, and everything I choose to make from it, always comes out well, which I can't say for many other cookbooks I've tried over the years.  Her highly anticipated cookbook has lots of those great recipes in it.  The only drawback is the section on sandwiches.  I'm not sure I would have taken up space in a cookbook on the sandwich.  While I love sandwiches, it just doesn't seem up to snuff with the rest of her wonderful recipes.  But minor detail compared with the other things she offers.  Looking forward to cooking up a storm with it.  I will say that her crunchy banana bread is a staple at my bed and breakfast and it's not in the book, so go to her blog to view that at [...]
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper offers just the right amount of intrigue to keep you turning those pages.  I like a book that offers different plot scenarios and keeps you guessing. I've read other books by Kate Morton and she does not disappoint.<br />This book is a keeper.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|I love this show, its not the typical \\"monster of the week \\" show. The dynamic between the brothers is believable. The supporting cast is always great but no one is safe or guaranteed to come back. But if you don't like fantasy where the dead can back to life this is not for you.
B007EECSFA|5.0|If you loved The Forgotten Garden, you will love this.  Completely different story, but told in the same way.  Going back and forth in time to unravel a mystery.  I was captivated until the very end.  I really felt that I had a much better understanding of what it must have been like during the London blitz of WWII.  Had no idea how terrifying and devastating it was.  I hope she's writing another.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I read it I finished it but it was not as good as her other books and I've read them all.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have not had a chance to read the book as yet. Ask me again after I have read it although John Grisham is one of my favorite authors.
B004NELBPC|1.0|On my Fire HD, this app did not work. I got what seemed to be a screenshot of the Huff Post homepage, with a note that looked like a link saying t<br />hey had a tablet version. If that link had been live I would have rated this higher, but it wasn't.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it I love playing Mario and when I found this I am like ok ill try it then I was like wow this is an awesome game I am so addicted to it
B009FBX5M0|4.0|Great soundtrack. Why are the songs presented in a different order than they occur in the film?! Otherwise, love the new direction.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen and, since my husband is German, we have seen LOTS of German - and foreign in general - films.  He assures me that the film - right down to the props used - are very authentic as far as what was going on in East Germany at that time (He even commented that he had a roommate at one time who wore a jacket exactly like the main character). Some of the reviews make it sound like this is just a historic film about the Stasi and the poor East Germans who had to endure their spying activities but it is so much more than that.  The film really shows what it was like mentally for people to deal with the constant surveillance, on both sides; those forced to spy on their neighbors and those being spied on.  The actors are top notch (we have seen the three main characters in quite a few other German movies) and the story line is gripping.  It is unusual for a movie about the GDR to be describable as \\"feel good\\" but this really is.  The ending is so awesome.  The last line in the movie, spoken by the main character, is so powerful it still makes me tear up every time I watch it.  We have loaned this out to quite a few people and they all loved it.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like this app to follow my bids or watch list but I prefer the full scale web page format on my PC.
B009FZFONO|4.0|The gore and the drama and thrills are awesome captured on film. You never know which<br />character may or may not make it through any given episode which keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />Fall in love with a favorite character and your setting yourself up for a hard fall when they go down with just one bite!<br />Great series!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. I get to listen to music, shows from around the world. I just pop in the plugs and rock away.  Sweet!!!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|If you liked 50 shades then this book is a must read! A love story with all the twists and turns that keep you gripped throughout. Can hardly wait for the next book, I need to read more about Eva and Giddeon. An intoxicating book that you will not want to put down but never want it to end! Must read ..... 5 stars
B003XRELEI|4.0|Breakfast of Champions is certainly Vonnegut's most difficult books to digest.  I believe that even he himself gave this book a C on his own grading scale, which tells you something.  However, I actually enjoyed this book, from page one you can tell that this book is going to be very sarcastic and satirical.  Perhaps the main problem here is that, unlike most of his novels, this one is not \\"timeless\\" meaning he uses language (especially the liberal use the the N word) that we find either distasteful, or just weird.  I think Vonnegut actually intended this novel to offend rather than entertain, so if you find it entertaining, then you may either be a disgusting human being, or perhaps just one that can laugh at anything.  I find myself in the latter category because I found this book rather amusing.  However, I don't think this book will appeal to most people, and if you are new to Vonnegut, I wouldn't start with this.  My only big gripe about this book is it lacks a functional ending.  I mean, I guess I assumed since Vonnegut tells you the ending on the first page, that there would somehow be more to it, or a resolution, or just an anecdote; however, there really is none of that, in fact, its as if Vonnegut just got tired of writing or ran out of paper in his typewriter.  Not for everyone, but for those select few, this book is amazing.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I love the extras on this DVD and the movie is the best comic live action movie made yet. This movie has it all in terms of action, laughs and the cgi is really well done.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I saw this and said OK, it is free. I remember when my kids played this game years ago. The program will keep you busy and the graphics are nice, but like all games available today, it is not truly \\"free\\". When you get into a problem it stops to allow you to \\"buy\\" (with real money) help to get you to the next level. Or you can wait for the timer to re-energize you. This can take quite a while. I usually turn it off at this point and go on to another game or program. It also did not come with instructions, so I have been doing a hit/miss trial and error to see if I can move forward. Some younger person would probably know what to push and when to push it, but I cannot solve it. It really eats up your battery life on the fire.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I love science fiction!  It took me 20 years to watch the first Alien movie because I was so afraid of it!  When I did finally see it, I covered my eyes when I knew a certain part was coming..  This was a different type of movie.  I wanted to know the &#34;engineers&#34; who made us and I was not disappointed. I saw the whole movie and loved it, but I still want to know more about them!  I DO love this story!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this to watch with my grandson.  We both enjoyed it!  We had seen Iron Man 1 & 2 and Captain American it was a very good storyline to bring them all together.
B0000VD04M|5.0|One of my favorite Tim Burton films.  The story about movie writer and director Ed Wood has all the eccentricities of a Burton movie but is moving and shot beautifully in black and white. Depp is wonderful, silly at times and irreverent.  He brings such depth to Wood that you root for him all through the film and want him to succeed at what he loves to do - making horror movies.  Martin Landau is extraordinary as Bella Lugosi and Wood and he form a wonderful friendship based on knowing the flaws in each other at the same time realizing their tremendous success as artists.
B009CG0102|5.0|Great Movie. This shows some of the spirit of the race to the Moon using 1960's technology and begs the question why we have not been back.
B000002H97|5.0|One of the all time great bands in the history of rock music, especially the harder rock, returns with what I think is their best, if not then definitely in their top 3, album that they have done.  Though I'm more of a hip-hop and R&B fan, I do like some rock, heavy metal, alternative music, and Metallica is one of the best out there, and this album solidifies that statement.  With 12 songs, there is no problem at all just hitting play and letting this one play all the way through; the only problem would be not replaying songs cause they're so good and next thing you know a few hours have passed and you still have only went through half of the album. No weak songs that are skippable material and loaded with Classic, near classics and at the worst, you'll get a good or real good song.  It has some of the bands best songs ever recorded (and there are many they have done over the years) for example: Mr. Sandman, The Unforgiven, Sad But True A must have album from an all time great band, period!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great fun though it did crash once and I had to reload it. still I get to do it all again
B00846REIS|4.0|I love love-stories with a long hard struggle to get and keep the heroes together.  Gideon and Eva are bound together but not at the expense of their independence and Therefore - lots of fun issues for the characters and reader.<br /><br />I noticed many similarities between this book and Fifty Shades of Gray.
0345541588|4.0|This one's hard to review because any little detail I reveal might turn out to spoil a surprise for someone. I will say this was an exciting, satisfying read. Much more like his earlier Reacher books that got us hooked. Once you get past a certain point in the book, there's no good stopping point. You just have to keep reading right on through. Don't expect perfect plausibility. It's a thriller, so let yourself go and enjoy. There are even a few good laughs along the way. The thing about the rubber gardening clogs had me cackling.<br /><br />Jack Reacher witnesses a late-night tragedy involving a woman on a New York subway. He is approached by various people who know he was a witness. They ask him questions that make no sense to him, and he decides to figure out why the woman did what she did on the subway. Stubborn and arrogant as ever, Reacher refuses to back off regardless of the danger level. It's an elaborate cat and mouse game through the streets and subways of New York City. Who's the cat and who's the mouse remains to be decided as the story progresses. There's only one small thing left unrevealed at the end that I really wanted to know. We can only hope it will be revealed in a future installment.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but if you're expecting a book similar to Enders Game, you may be disappointed. The war against the buggers is distant history for most, but Ender (thanks to age delay due to light speed travel) still remembers it well, and carries with him the burden of genocide. He is now an adult, and pioneer'd the role of speaker of the dead. Basically, he studies a persons life, and reports his honest findings to their community. Ender is called to speak the death of a couple on a distant planet. The only known planet that was already inhabited by a form of life called the piggies. Without dragging on, the plot is all about a secret from the past that could spell doom for the human colony, the relationship, and impact humans have with the natives. I thought it was great, but its definitely very different than Enders Game.
B005P06AAO|4.0|While its combination of almost surreal humor and real emotion can sometimes be... well... awkward, this is still among the<br />better and more honest series about teenagers I've seen.<br /><br />I'm a male over 50, so I'm certainly not the target audience for this MTV show about a blogging 15 year old girl dealing with<br />the confusions and absurdities of sex, love, high school social politics, and well meaning but humorously dysfunctional parents<br />and guidance counselors.<br /><br />But after friends recommended it I started watching and found I appreciated it's frankness, quirky characters and good natured humor.<br />I also liked how it dealt with issues like sex and drinking as simply a part of teenage life, neither preaching morality (kids have sex and<br />no one gets pregnant, they know to wear condoms, and they do sometimes get their hearts broken) nor striving to shock.<br /><br />The acting is all over the place, often cartoony, and a number of characters are little more than comic clich&eacute;s, but as the the show goes<br />along a surprising number of them reveal new sides and new depth.  If not quite great, Awkward season 1 is quite good and very easy<br />to enjoy... if you don't mind bringing back some of your own awkward memories as you realize the teen years really aren't so different now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is amazing and had me hooked from beginning to end. Orson Scott Card is at his best in this compelling story of a boy who was pretty much created to be earth's last hope. Ender's journey from child to leader pulls the reader in, and the plot twists are original. I highly recommend to anyone.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The ads are anoying unless you are a young person looking for someone every time you want to play the game, i don't fall into either one of those catagories. Do not recommend.
0152465073|5.0|I got this lovely book from an artist in New York City, before I left back home to Germany in September 1973.<br /><br />The gift was meant as a flight companion on my way back home. - Actually the ideas of the author together with his lovely illustrations accompanied me through the years. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote the book for his grandchildren during a crash in the Sahara dessert. Yet it easily can be enjoyed at any age up from 6 years old, I would suggest.<br /><br />The little prince travels through the universe and pays visits to several planets. What he will find there, beyong \\"his own small world\\" is stunning. The author lets us participate in all his thrilling adventures. Meanwhile I read the book at least twice and gave it away several times as a gift myself. This is a novel highly recommanded for everyone who loves fairy tales and is interested in the universe.
0143039431|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath has always been my favorite . Born in Oklahoma and my parents having gone through the Great Depression brings me an empathy for the story.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|One of the best new bands out there.  Not over engineered, a sound that is true to their roots.  Highly recommend this CD.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game very very fun awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! The dragons on this game are so cute! I'm already on level 8! Who thinks they can beat me?
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I thought there would have been some of the deleted scenes included in this release. I have the Panasonic 3D release of this movie, and this copy is exactly the same version!!<br />There is nothing different, rumour had it, that Cameron was going to put some of the added scenes in from the: \\"Deluxe 2 disc set\\" into this release for added pizzaz!<br /><br />I still love the movie (Huge Fan!!), and the 3D just brings the whole thing to life, don't know if I'll still be around when the releases of part 2 & 3 are to appear (apparently 2014 & 2015 respectively)??<br /><br />My suggestion for Mr.Cameron, release a version with the extra 6mins included (a 50Gb 3D Bluray disc is capable of taking the extra minutes).<br /><br />Irayo (Thank you)
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I read this book on my Kindle.  Got to 87% before it started to get interesting.  It's filled with words, but they don't seem to come together until the end.  I just didn't enjoy this one.  I had high expectations and was sorely disappointed because I usually love Patricia Cornwell's books.  The characters were all in the background and kay lacked her usual intensity and interest in her job.  sorry, just not a good read. I was glad to get to the end just so I could say I finished!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I couldn't drop the book until i finished...!!! It is a perfect example for new generations of americans who want to be in the military or simply be ready to defend our country and our freedoms all over the world.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I thought this was the best of the three I read from the Song of Ice and Fire. There is a lot of wandering in the Riverlands, which is confusing if you don't remember who is who or don't check on the wiki and have maps.  The book has a great ironic sense and I loved the fate of some of the most annoying characters
B008OOYALE|3.0|its okay but I'm not much of a dragon person the only reason why I got this app was to help me saith another apps not sure Which apps but apps like dragon story
B000VZYMDU|4.0|Too bad Roy is not still with us. Sweet Dreams with tear you apart. This music should be in everyone's collection. I always enjoy listening to it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|if anyone bats an eye because it isn't free, you would pay twice as much at a starbucks for horrible coffee that is gone in two minutes. this is the best two dollars I have ever spent.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great story line, and immaculate details. Love all the characters and how everything came together. The only thing I can ask for is for Stephenie to complete Nessie and Jacobs story.....
B000FC12Z0|3.0|The book is a bit dated, but the story line is still interesting. It makes a good read for bedtime and lazy afternoons.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I liked most of the songs on this album. Especially for the price it was a steal for 25 cents!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard you can get for Android. Blows swype away!!!! I have reduced my keystrokes dramatically since getting this keyboard. Well worth the 3.99. Great app. Keep up the support.
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|Great music one of my favorite albums from Led Zeppelin. Love all the songs on this album. Brings back memories.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I had no idea what I was going to be in for when I down loaded this game.. To my surprise, I got hooked from the start! Requires a little patience.. and I mean very little.. Overall .. great game!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It is well worth waiting for a new DeMille book. The Panther did not disappoint. It brought you to the middle east with all its cultural complexities. I really did not want the book to end. John Corey was prime as himself. I found myself laughing out loud at some of his great lines! Along with John's unique humor there were some very intense moments that will bring you to the edge of your seat. Super read!
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|Lana Del Rey is an amazing artist and I feel that her vinyl was up to par. I have listened to it many times but it also makes a great wall piece. Shipping was quick, nothing was bent. Good buy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always believed in God and this book written by a neurosurgeon about his near death experience gave me a peek into what is waiting for us on the other side.
B0018AM1ZS|5.0|I have all 3 CDs from the Trilogy. They are all wonderful. The Return of the King brings back some of the songs and evolves them. When the Hobbits are introduced, the pieces were lively and fun. By the end of the journey, it becomes strong and hauntingly beautiful. I want Grey Havens played at my funeral...(In about 50 years!!) I feel the emotions of the movie as I listen to it. That says a lot about a soundtrack!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|If they make you pay three dollars would it kill them to give us more than two levels?!?!?!? Really I payed for this and I only got two levels! But it is soooooo fun if you have the money!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|VERY DISAPPOINTING AND NOT UP TO GRISHAM'S EARLIER NOVELS. THE LATTER PART OF THE BOOK IN PARTICULAR WAS LIKE READING SCIENCE FICTION AND NOT ENJOYABLE. MAYBE TIME FOR OLD JOHN TO HANG IT UP LIKE OLD HILLARY.
B0086700CM|3.0|this app is very hard and I only got to use it once:( the next day I tried to open it but it did not open so I tried to delete it but it wont delete it said temple run deleted but the next day I turned my kindle on it was still there!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|awesome game the only thing I don't like is when u run out of coins and you have to sell all hour stuff. but it an awesome game lol
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Theres so much going on in the movie it's easy to miss details that get lost in the massiveness of the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was drawn in from begenning to end, which came quick for me unfortunately because I couldn't put it down! And now I'm soooo looking forward to walking disaster which will be told from the other point of view! Cant wait!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I tried it on my friends ipod touch 4 and I loved it so fun then I tried getting it on my kindle fire and would not download.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I loved the game I never had any problems with it but it only kept me trapped for a few days. I want a game that makes me never put it down and this isn't the game.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a fun game and slightly addicting but if I ran out if room for storage it would be one of the ones I wouldn't care to delete
B009SSGBOE|1.0|OK, a couple facts:<br /><br />i have been a steely dan fan since the first album<br /><br />also a fagen fan. i love nightfly<br /><br />i think their output has become steadily predictable and generally uninteresting<br /><br />i don't own this album - i read the 'rave reviews' and listened to the samples and it sounds like all the same stuff rehashed. same sonic palette<br /><br />i heard fagan do a solo piano version of 'home at last' that is WAY more interesting than anything since Aja.<br /><br />these guys/this guy should strip it all down and do an acoustic album and get the digital crap out of the way.
B00000IQW5|5.0|One of the best of the best. Just the right amount of comedy mixed with tragedy and done by fine actors.
B004I4M0A2|1.0|I searched by category, dept and by word but nothing found for almost anything.  No beds, no desks...almost nothing will come up in any category.

I cannot hear or see people on skype 75% of the time! also, for some reason, skype asks me to sign in A LOT even tho i already did. i had to install in about 3 times and i am VERY dissapointed! i hope they update skype. i cant even see who are my contacts anymore! i

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love it!!!  I have had no problems at all!!  I would totally recommend to all me family and friends!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A friend told me about the HBO series and suggested I read the book to catch up before the new season. Read the sample and was hooked from the start.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this version of angry birds is fun to play. i have enjoyed the product and would recommend it. the advertisements can be a bit irritating at times.
B009M8E3K4|5.0|I have heard Neil Young's music my whole life, but am just now getting into him at the age of 47!  I was completely blown away by the audio quality of this video.  OK, some of the close ups made me think of Yoda rockin' out.  But hey, there is nothing wrong with being a Jedi Master of rock n' roll.  I highly recommend this video for die hard fans, newbies like myself and especially to anyone who has ever picked up a guitar
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Gregory Porter is the best thing vocally to happen, since \\" Ole Blue Eyes. \\" His performance on \\" Be Good \\" is lyrical .  The CD is almost as good as the live performance that he delivered in Oakland ( at Yoshi's ).  That his CD is 6th on the Jazz chart is no surprise.  Porter is a Jazz force without limits.  He has earned his reputation with his soul, dedication to world travel and matchless delivery !
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome game but PLEASE have more updates but also try to make it more like the pc version!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sorry I bought this.<br />Doesn't do a thing for me.<br />It's boring. Not my kind of story.<br />I only got it because it was popular.<br />I regret buying it. It's Zzzzz.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I thought the. Idea for this book was pretty cool. I thought it was well written and easy to follow. I would like to see this adapted to a movie.<br />The only negative point I see about this is the ending.  I know the writer could have done so much better to end the story.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Wow....some very interesting research on habits.  I'm not done reading yet but it's really given me lots to think about.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My 3 year old is not that into the Cars series of toys. He loves the movie, but isn't that fussed about having toys to match.<br /><br />But this aeroplane really takes the cake! I have never seen him so excited to open a present before - and that excitement (3 weeks later) has barely worn off. He still wants it with him at all times - even bedtime.<br /><br />His 7 year old cousin loves it too and asked for one for Christmas, and nothing has even hinted at breaking yet. I don't know how people can call it fragile.<br /><br />Great toy for any boy who loves aeroplanes - gets used to carry everything from Hot Wheel cars to Duplo blocks!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought book 1 was good and now Fifty Shades Darker is even more spectacular. This is a story that is very sexual but also very sad and yet happy at the same time. Anna and Christian are perfect for each they balance each other well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This an excellent read. One of the best I've read in quite a while.<br />Very gripping, I had a hard time putting it down,grabbed me almost from the first page. Outstanding, HIGHLY recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book is a great book for drama queens and teen age soap opera lovers. It is badly written. I am sorry I read it. I don't understand why there are so many reviews.
B000YAA68C|4.0|P.S. I Love You is a good and well-thought out movie. I've never been a huge fan of Hilary Swank but I really enjoy her performance as recent widow, Holly. A lot of romantic comedies are pretty predictable but not this one. It has a happy beginning, a sad middle, and a hopeful ending. My only gripe with this movie is Harry Connick Jr. Seems like he is always being the jerk. I just can't relate to him and he tends to overact. P.S. I Love You will leave you pleasantly surprised, definitely one to watch!
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Never written a review before and this review will be pretty terse.<br />This light is very bright. Almost so bright it hurts your eyes. There are two power levels.<br />It is well made.<br />It also has a small led that blinks every 4 seconds (I presume it uses almost no battery) so you can find the light in the dark.
B000JML90Y|5.0|What a clever words-smith was Charles Darwin. His powerful use of English language is brilliant. I found myself re-reading phrases and paragraphs because it was just pure delight to read his impressive writings without the constant word-repetition found in many bodies of work. The data offered to the reader was never difficult to grasp and I found all of it interesting, occasionally bordering on the extraordinary. His broad, detailed knowledge of flora and fauna, insects, mammals and sea creatures was more than I had bargained for, and I could not help but admire his life dedication to the subject, information corroberated by many other world-renowned naturalists. This is an exceptional, beautifully written book and an excellent read.
B004SBX112|3.0|Like others have said, this \\"update\\" wipes out all progress from this and other seasons. It claims to be version 3.01, but clearly it's not. Play Store also said an update was available (I think because I originally installed the free version from them before getting the paid version here ... maybe, I'm not sure). Anyway, installed that update and restored a backup and looks like I'm back to where I started (I don't see anything newer than the last Halloween games). Totally confused.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is addicted<br />you dont want to put it down!!!<br />keep playing and see!<br />it is the real thing<br />just try and you will be hooked
B0089K7DGW|5.0|good, not dinky, flat yet round and rectangular in some places, world's finest, U.S.A.U.S.A.U.S.A. chanted non-stop in appreciation and amoral agony - all a's but quite unintentional the author assures the reader, adding that one wishes ones company would simply allow a one-to-five star rating without insisting one put down at least 20 words each and every [insert horribly vile curseword] time one buys something from ones company, can he get an amen. This frustration in no way reflects upon the product, which was neat.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|AmaZzzing ..Just when you think you have it all figured out ... The end ending will STUN you!! This book keeps you reading with all the twists and turns. The unconditional love that the parents show to their son Jacob who is presumed guilty is apparent when they find he is being accused of murder. What would you do to prove your child's innocence? The extremes that these parent's go through will show you the power of LOVE!
B0030DL3FU|5.0|perfecto todo como se esperaba satisfecho totalmente ... bien embalado sin problema y como estaba descrito .. me alegra hacer negocios asi
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very fast paced and a real challenge.  It is tricky, but a lot of fun.  Easy to get hooked on and has great visual effects.  I really enjoy playing it, though at times (like if I forget to jump on time)I can get frustrated, not with the game but with myself.  If you enjoy a challenge and are quick, this game is for you.
B008OOYALE|5.0|nice graphics.  cute dragons.  my grandkids love it.<br />the only thing I don't like is how much it costs to clear the land once you've already paid to expand.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I purchased this hoping to read PDF files and EPub books.  This app crashes every time I try to use it.  Don't waste your time or money.
B004SBX112|2.0|I just recently updated the Angry Birds Seasons ad free, because it said I needed to, and what this update did is removal of 2012, it deleted the new episode from 2013, and deleted all of my save data. I am highly upset with this fact because I paid 99 cents to not have ads in my Angry Birds Seasons. So it looks like I'm going to have to uninstall this and install the Google play version which works. The last review that I wrote Amazon pulled it off for reasons unknown. It was on that way out west game, I still have that review and I don't think there was anything wrong with it. The only thing that I said derogatory of it is that I was kind of shock that people could not figure out the training levels.<br />Amazon likes to censor what the reviewers say, which I feel is wrong and I think it violates our first amendment rights.  In my review I did not curse, I did not insult the dev, or any one person in any way. (Hence i did not break the rules) . They just pulled it off to censor me. I'm also going to say also that if Amazon removes this very truthful review of what their company did to my software which I paid for.<br /><br />, but they better be prepared to give me a refund on every app in which I paid for.  And that over 20 dollars worth. Because after all this morning my Angry Birds season work correctly, now I only have 4 episodes. So if my review get pulled off for telling the truth that says a lot about your company.
B0013ND30W|3.0|The seller did a good job , I got the DVD in time , it look barely used ... Now this is my last time to buy a Disney Movie ... The reason that is I have checked the Discs and they are not a Disney discs ... Excellent copies though ! What annoys me is why do I have to pay over $ 30 for a copy ? This is actually the third time and with different sellers ... Should I dare to say most Disney movies sold outside of distributors are non originals . Yes I have not return the disc ... Like I said the quality of the Blue- Ray was excellent and u can't find the original since Disney repossess their Classic movies , which I think causes this copies to be made ... My problem is why charge above the price of a original if not original . Other than that it's a beautiful story , I ve seen Sleeping Beauty years ago and I'm trying to recollect my favorite classic Disney in Blue Ray .
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is totally fun for you and your family! I TOTALLY RECOMEND IT. Plz excuse my name lol nothing else would work. but this game is awesome me and my little brother take turns playing it literally 24/7! this game is awesome!
0785163174|1.0|Avengers vs X-Men is the epitome of the old saying \\"too many cooks spoil the broth.\\"  There are four writers on this book with as many artists drawing it.  None of them seems to coordinate their efforts with any finesse and the book seems to quickly fall apart.  The artwork by Romita on the first fews issues is atrocious and the writer on those issues seems hamstrung by his inability to write believable or likable Marvel characters.<br /><br />The story quickly becomes an excuse to see Marvel \\"heroes\\" start a slugfest among themselves for a dozen issues.  I use the word \\"heroes\\" loosely, because I see a lack of it throughout the story.  You get none of the great hero versus villain stories that you will find in Marvel movies like the Avengers or Spider-Man, just a bunch of thugs slugging it out with people you thought were their friends before this storyline began.<br /><br />I rate this big Marvel event well below any other I've ever read, including: Secret Wars, Secret Wars 2, Civil War, House of M and even Secret Invasion.  The story might have been saved if it's writing chores had been assigned to a single writer like Michael Bendis, instead of letting so many others take their stab at it.<br /><br />I'll end this review by sharing my disappointment that this huge book has a glued-binding and NOT a sewn-binding as you might expect on such a long and very expensive book.  A sewn-binding is important for a fair number of reasons.  When reading a comic collection it is desirable to be able to see the art closet to the binding as easily as the rest of the page.  With this glued-binding the art is obscured, something that is less likely to occur if a slightly more expensive sewn-binding is employed. In addition, a glued-binding is less likely to withstand multiple readings.  My copy of Marvel's X-Men Schism hardcover has a glued-binding and developed loose pages after just one reading, a common complaint of that particular book judging by the feedback earlier this year when it was released.  It is unusual nowadays for a $75 Marvel comic to not have a sewn-binding and I hope it is not the direction they will be taking their books in the future.  I do not feel it is a good value for the customer, even when deeply discounted.  A $75 comic book is a luxary item and it ought to be built like it.
1451638450|4.0|Ivan's got his book, and it's a good one.<br /><br />We've seen lots of Ivan over the series, from the point of view of his more obsessive relations (\\"Ivan, you idiot!\\").  Ivan has always been the underachiever of the Vorkosagin clan and their allies. Sure, he's tall, handsome, athletic, bright, and competent, with a solid military career and success with the ladies, but unlike Miles, Mark, Aral, Cordelia, Gregor, Simon, Alys, et al, he has no particular desire for anything more than an enjoyable life with as little responsibility as possible.<br /><br />This is the book where we get inside Ivan's head. He's on an assignment on Komarr when an old \\"friend\\" Byerly (last seen in \\"A Civil Campaign\\") shows up with an urgent request to protect a contact, who happens to be a gorgeous woman. And before you can say \\"Impulsively brilliant actions run in the family\\", Ivan's up to his ears in Jacksonian politics, Cetagandan plots,  Barryaran secrets, and a romantic entanglement capable of  ensnaring even Ivan.<br /><br />It's a fun book - a fast paced mix of heist/caper and romantic comedy. Ivan finds love, and although she's not what I would have expected, she's a good match for him.  Simon Illyan plays a strong supporting roll, with good effect.<br /><br />A quick note - if you're not familiar with the Vorkosigan series, this might not be the best place to start, but it's more stand-alone than the last few books. Chronology wise, it's set between \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" and \\"Cyroburn\\". It's one of the lighter Vorkosigan books - the stakes are lower than the heavier books, and there's a good bit of humour. Think \\"A Civil Campaign\\" rather than \\"Memory\\".
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love Demille's character John Corey.  His attitude and humor make DeMille novels just one step above the other action characters out there.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Can't get enough of this show.  Wish it wasn't ending.  Jon Hamm is a terrific actor. Will watch him in other shows now.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The engineer is the hero.  If he thinks creatively AND gets the physics right, he lives. In spite of obstacles he can't anticipate, he creatively (and with a positive attitude) overcomes them.<br /><br />He is not a super-human. He is an engineer just like me, and maybe you too.
0439813786|5.0|I did not realize that the movie Hugo was based off of this book until just now. I've never seen the movie Hugo.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! I was at our local library looking through the Caldecott shelves and saw a very thick book that stuck out visually among all of the thin books. I flipped through a few pages and decided to check it out and see what it was all about. I've seen some of Selznick's other works and liked them.<br /><br />This book is 500+ pages, but only 26,159 words long (according to the book). This is because Selznick has told the story half through text and half through beautiful pencil drawings. This makes this book part picture book and part graphic novel with bits of film thrown in too. The great part about the pictures is that they tell as much of the story as the text does. There will be pages of pictures, then pages of text, then pages of pictures again, but the pictures extend the story and keep it moving. This book is also a bit of historical fiction because one of the main characters, Georges Melies, was a real person in the early 1900s. This book is set in Paris in 1931.<br /><br />I can see children of all ages enjoying this book. With the wonderful pictures, it could easily be a read-aloud book for elementary aged children to enjoy with an adult. Early teens or even a bit younger 10-12 could easily read this book on their own and enjoy it. Also, there are great vocabulary words, story parts, and historical pieces in this book that would make it great for teaching different concepts to teens.<br /><br />I'm a speech-language pathologist and can see myself making up some great lessons for my teenage students using this book.<br /><br />Excellent find, quick read, wonderful pictures.

B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzle game if you want something closer to a real jigsaw puzzle and not just blocks that form a picture, which most of the puzzle games available are. Works great on my kindle fire. Probably wouldn't be as good on a smaller screen. Free puzzles are available in addition to paid.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I'm going to still buy the dvd collection when it comes out. The show is great. You do not know what you are missing if you do not watch this series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love Pinterest!  I use it on my smartphone, Kindle Fire and the home computer.  Love that I can show my pins to my best friend when we are out shopping for ideas!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was quite graphic but still an enjoyable read. Fun story, ultimately a fantasy. Interesting that it has been so utterly popular. It must speak to the fact that we are sexual beings at the core.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The Racketeer is an interesting read. It is good to get away from straight 'I am a lawyer with issues' and the quite boring Theodore Boon stories. I am looking forward to the final outcome.
1469984202|5.0|I bought the Omnibus edition and couldnt put it down.  I kept trying to figure out what was the reason for the \\"silo\\".  Hugh Howey wrote believable characters in a great plot.  Each book has a well-timed cliffhanger or segway to a new plotline.  I felt like I was inside the silo, not just reading about it.  Again, I couldnt put it down.
1594203334|5.0|This book was very helpful and easy to understand. It was funny and a great read. It was shipped in a timely manner and was recieved in great condition.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|initially I thought....  how silly! but ive been diggin' this game for a week now!! just thoughtless fun! why not??? it actually reduces my stress just sitting here playing.
1440503257|5.0|OMG! This book was amazing and easy to use. It has SO many great recipes in it. It was shipped in a timely manner and was recieved in great condition.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game<br /> kids and family have lots of fun similar to farmville--- i will recommend it! reminds me of the game growing up
B005LFQRTC|5.0|There is nothing I can say that it is a great show never been other one like it and so many extras
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this is one of the best video game I have ever played...it reminds me of the old dragon's slayer game I played as a kid.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|this game is cool so far just started playing. I like the weapons so far an u find weapons fast also
B0065GC0BA|5.0|As we age and our bodies start to let us down we have to confront our own mortality and decide how we would like to spend the last years,months or perhaps days of our life. As a cancer patient this dilemma is ever-present in my mind and I was able to identify with the subject of this book albeit on a different level<br />So poignant and well written I hope everyone reads it and understands
B000FC13E0|4.0|page turner. i liked hiis other books. i uselly crush them im a day oor so. if yoou aare loooking for deep content and something the will take hours to analize not here.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great this works amazing. looks great and seems to be aquate. would recomed to others. better than the display in the top left.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Best show ever?  It's hilarious, we see actually character development and growth, and it's just plain fun! No, not every episode is going to be Gone With the Wind, but it still has the best writing of any recent TV show.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Although \\"Casino Royale\\" was a very good Bond movie, this one is better. The first 2 Daniel Craig Bond films placed him in unfamiliar settings with unfamiliar characters updating him to the 21st century and a lot of high tech heroics. On many levels, Bond goes back in time here.<br />There are several spoilers and I won't reveal any of them here as they should be enjoyed as they happen. The movie starts out as a successor to the first 2 Daniel Craig Bonds but as the plot progresses, the series reaches back and finds it origins.<br />Veteran fans of the series will love it as will those familiar with the Sean Connery Bond films. This is the 50th anniversary Bond movie and they succeed in establsihing that this is now the charcter played by Sean Connery working for the same organization. Very well done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest, love the app. easy to see my boards and I like having the websites open ans safe on my kindle the next time I use it
B005EGXTL2|5.0|A good story with many events comming out of left field which I do not often find. Great characters in ofter terrible siuation and not always coping well. I would have liked to have seen some of the characters saved - I'm sure they will be for the movie if it is made.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great Game!  Keeps you challenged as you have to get certain items to the bottom.  Similar to some other puzzle games, but far more challenging.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|This album is alot of fun to the open-minded Aerosmith fan.  There are some awesome gems from both the riff rock Aerosmith and the ballad-belting Aerosmith (namely Out Go the Lights and Another Last Goodbye respectively).<br /><br />I commend the group for creating such a youthful, and incredibly more diverse record than recent years.  As a criticism I wish the Carrie Underwood track was on her record and not on this one, but I think we can all just roll our eyes and click next if that's not our thing right!?<br /><br />In my mp3 ratings, this album includes (2) 5-star tracks, (2) 4-star tracks, (4) 3.5-star tracks, (4) 3-star tracks, (4) 2.5-star songs.  (This includes the 3 bonus tracks).<br /><br />There is nothing disappointing about this album despite some harsh reviews, in fact I would say its their best since Nine Lives, and with the classic Aero-sound laced throughout it is an incredibly enjoyable release.
B000053W01|5.0|I always look at the sellers small print,but the price was so good I had to order it.I later found out I ordered from zoverstock in which is from the U.K. I was hoping it would still play on my blu-ray player.Well it took a little bit longer to receive it,but the condition was great,it worked with my blu-ray and the price was great.It was worth the wait.I'm sorry if this was more of a hassel than it was worth,for those at zoverstock,but I also want to say thank you!  Jamie Romero
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As my knowledge of the judicial system in the United States is limited it is hard for me to judge the plausibility of the plot. But I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is funny, very entertaining and the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that the details about moving the stolen gold out of the country became a bit boring, although that part too was very cleverly devised.
0316228532|5.0|This book was fantastic from start to finish.  The insight into the personality and feelings of the characters was miraculous.  I kept thinking that somewhere in my life I have met each of these characters.  Most books have characters with 'created' feelings and reactions.  The people in this book have the real loves and hatreds and fears and insecurities that everyone lives with to some extent.  They are loving and protective, vicious and cruel, kind and sympathetic until threatened and then duplicitous and nasty.  The separation of class status and the hopelessness of the downtrodden and weak is brilliantly depicted.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This move wasted two hours of my life I'll never get back. I had read people thought Ridley Scott was loosing it. This movie removes all doubt. P.U.
B008ELUEQC|2.0|I found Rod's voice to be severely lacking in this CD.  I am a huge fan, so I was somewhat disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am in love with coin dozer! The game is super addicting and I play it constantly. Coin dozer is my favorite game!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Pretty awesome. It does what its supposed to (extended  battery life). Good quality,  very sturdy. Highly recommended for any Canon 7D owner/user.
B00009RAJH|5.0|why there's so many comments about there being so much difference between this and their 2nd album is bizarre.if  all the tracks on this cd  and the tracks on rumors were put on a single cd,it would sound as it was intended to be that way.there's way more similaries than differences in the 2 albums.both are excellent cd's and are worthy!!
0385344333|2.0|I've been somewhat disappointed in the past few Reacher books; the theme is old and creaky, and somewhat implausible, more than usual. The FBI and CIA characters' actions don't come close to the probable acts of real agents in the same circumstances. In past Reacher books I have felt that some artistic license with the truth (concerning procedure) was warranted, but now it has gotten tired, repetitious and really over the top. The story-line is the same as past books with only different packaging. I believe that Mr Child has pretty much run this series dry.  He is a talented writer and hopefully can come up with something new. I hope so, but will continue to read future \\"Reacher\\" stories only through the local library.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is the cutest movie. I would highly recommend it. My children are grown my youngest 16 but we love Disney and this is just another great movie from Disney.
1449410243|2.0|Too short.<br />Deja vu.<br />Not as fun as &#34;How to punch a dolphin...&#34;.<br />Cats are that fun when the same jokes are coming back all the time.<br /><br />Ben
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Never read a DeMille novel that I didn't want to end and i've read them all.  The Panther is no exception.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|they keep charging you money and I think that's stupid and there only 2 levels I thought it would be a whole game but its not.
0525953728|5.0|This is an excellent book. I wish more active duty service members would turn to writing (it's not that hard, just get a legal opinion from your on-base law office). I read this from cover to cover as quickly as I could, and will read it again I'm sure. Meanwhile, top of page 286 in the hard cover caught my eye, because I had always attributed today's PTSD phenomenon to service members being constantly bombarded with bad things, blood and guts, so forth - i.e., namely the repetition portion forcing memory function). But now I'm thinking it may come from service members not knowing how to compartmentalize the mental images they bring back with them. I'm not implying the author has PTSD; he obviously does not. I'm just hoping a few PTSD experts read his book and pay attention. I've always been adept at compartmentalizing bad things in my life. Hopefully, it's a teachable topic.
B004OC07N0|4.0|Has done a balanced approach to many different types of leadership roles. I am applying some of the principles learnt in to me new role.
B00493E1GI|5.0|Great feel good movie.  Loved it.  The book was better but Julia Roberts does the part so well. A movie about life, divorce and finding yourself.
B004OC07F8|5.0|This has lots of wisdom that be applied to so many different types of situation, not just businesses that sell products, really continue to enjoy this great approach
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved, loved, loved season one of The Walking Dead. While I enjoyed season two I did find it a it slow, especially at certain times. This season however has been EPIC. I can't wait to see where the writers will take this series.
B007TK77QE|4.0|J K Rowling has shown us all what a versatile writer she is with this wonderfully crafted book. The characterisations are breathtaking. Having read some other, less favourable, reviews, I agree that this book doesn't have the page-turning qualities that the Harry Potter books have and the action is very slow to develop until the last quarter or so. Also, the sheer number of characters unfolded so<br />quickly at the beginning that they were confusing to follow at times, but perseverance was well worth the effort. A fine book, extremely well researched and beautifully penned.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I was all excited about this new Angry Birds game but it never opened:( What the heck guys will you guys try and fix it!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The book was good but I think the author should have been more graphic and unafraid to  say some things in a more X-rated fashion since she chose hat topic
B0007TKNII|5.0|I love this movie :) it came a reasonable time and it works just fine no scratches and the picture was clear
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Unless you are a HUGE fan of the Alien movies do not waste your time on Prometheus. Even then, be warned. Bad sets, special effects, and horrible writing mar what should have been a great start to the prequels. There are so many plot holes it will drive you insane. A huge disappointment.
0679746323|5.0|This is a cold-blooded look at Mao, revealing his pettiness and paranoia and running a death count on his tens of millions of victims.<br /><br />Loud and clear, it comes through that Mao was culpable for the destruction of China -- the cultural and historical destruction, the human destruction, the far-flung economic destruction.  Under his direct orders were the plans made and the brutality begun.<br /><br />The authors conducted what must have been ten years of gut-wrenching interviews to produce this book.  Again and again, as I read, I found myself wondering how on earth they found the people to give them these interviews.  Chang and Halliday have done the world a good service.<br /><br />All the conniving, the back-stabbing, the hedonism, the betrayal, and the cruelty of Mao became policy for the Chinese communists.<br /><br />This book gives you methodical, meticulous research.  But it doesn't give you the cries to heaven and the agony of the victims.  The authors report the massive death tolls among the peasantry, the intelligentsia, the artists, the educated, the skilled, the army, the cadres and their families -- and their families -- but it does not give the victims' perspective.  The boook shows the indescribable impoverishment in the villages and the decades of squalor on the early red bases, the enormous pblic works projects with astronomically high death tolls, and the moving forward -- the Great Leap -- the Cultural Revolution -- into unspeakable brutality.<br /><br />Mao was no good at production, but super-good at destruction.<br /><br />Tragic.<br /><br />For things from the perspective of the Chinese people, you may want to read<br />[[ASIN:0802145167 Life and Death in Shanghai]]<br />[[ASIN:0803293364 Gang of One: Memoirs of a Red Guard (American Lives)]]<br />[[ASIN:1566635217 Enemies of the State: Personal Stories from the Gulag]]
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was very pleasedans happy reading the second book. I cant wait for the third to come out. Only negative is that is sounded alot like the 50 Shades Trilogy. But i still couldn't stop reading it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love reading John Grisham. There are twists and turns and just when you think you have it figured out, he hits you with the big one. I have all his books.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|These two performers are just amazing. Their voices are just as fabulous as ever. The live performance recording was beautifully done. I recommend it highly for any fan.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Th novel is very thrilling and scientifically accurate which adds enjoyment for the techy people. Also, it describes very possible political and intelligence scenarios.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game. i play it every night. it is so addicting. this is great silly fun when you have had a stressfull day.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|High quality viewing. It has been beautiful restored.  Options:  color and black and white. B&W for me, Color for the children.
030758836X|5.0|Definitely my favorite book of 2012, possibly ever? A psychological thriller like no other. If you're on the fence at all, just do it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is very addictive. I am on level25 and I haven't spent any money on coins. sure at first it takes a little while to build coins but if you are online- they build pretty fast. just keep the prizes you win and you get rewards eventually.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|I love this show. The episodes are always fantastic and this one is no different. I would definitely recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book would appeal to the more scientifically minded reader, who seeks proof of something that must be taken on faith. It was a good book but not my favorite on this topic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game I ever played all the comments about the game closing it does not happen its a very good game I recommend it.
B006M4F67A|3.0|its ok... ive seen better<br />really what more do i need to say... the more you force me to type, the worse this review is going to get
B003H9MSPG|3.0|The main selling point on this nerf gun is the range. Unfortunately there are several nerf guns with longer range. The loading and firing mechanisms are slightly complicated for children, which is good in my opinion. It's not hard to learn but it requires attention to detail about the toy which would be easy to translate into teaching a child about paying attention to a real weapon. The lack of range means slower speed which also means the darts don't hurt as much as some others. They don't hurt at all in fact. Again for children (and parents caught in the crossfire) this would be an excellent choice but for anyone else it's just false advertising and a little disapointing.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|If you don't think that Groundhog Day deserves 5 stars there is something wrong with you. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen and I've see LOTS of comedies. I could go on and on. This is a GREAT movie. This is the only movie I've wanted to watch more than a few times and I've probably watched it 50 times and I can't wait to see it again.
B000VWPX3G|5.0|This is a classic, one of the Best Hip Hop Album of All Time,GZA is on Fire on this Album
1250007305|5.0|My 92-year young Mom highly recommended \\"Zero Day\\" to me, knowing that I love computer \\"stuff\\". Her assessments are usually 99% correct - this is definitely a 5-star novel!! From the first chapter to the last, the story contains all the ingredients of a great thriller - a world stage of colorful characters, a fast-moving plot, a very believable and frightening cyberterrorist element, and a couple of unexpected twists.  I am extremely happy to know there is a sequel, \\"Trojan Horse\\", because I am ready to again follow Daryl and Jeff in their quest to conquer cyber-crime!!  Thank you, Mark Russinovich, for writing a book for readers who love the world of computers!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are alright.. keeps you entertained if you r bored stiff . some games are quite stupid but the rest are fine
