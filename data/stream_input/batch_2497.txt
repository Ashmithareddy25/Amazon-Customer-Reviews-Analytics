B00BUT5I84|5.0|I can't deny that I've been very excited about this album. Also a little nervous. I am biased as I review it, I can't even imagine what this music might be like to a casual listener. What do they hear? I hear my life. I hear their lives. I hear a community of talent, art, joy, and pain; members far and wide. I hear drama, storms, epic battles, victorious triumphs, history, growth, development and rainbows.<br /> As I continue with my first listen on this one, I listen, listen hard. Don't forget: important music deserves your Full attention. I am truly moved by what I began to hear. Before I knew it I was going along with the saga I was hearing and loving every second of it. But I began to worry...this music was cinematic (and belongs as part of futuristic epic movie, obviously). This music was very dramatic...does that mean I'm in for it in the coming years? What will I need from this album to get me through the times to come? I feel it will launch forth into the deep with me upon a new journey...<br /> With me since inception, each of the last 3 albums by Thirty Seconds to Mars, holds a special place in my past. Each one coming along with me as I was experiencing extremely tumultuous events that would leave behind massive scars, or most blissful memories.  Upon my first listen I remembered where I was with each one past, the first listen, and then what happened during each albums span of years. The first: a terrible death, a relationship gone wrong, a miscarriage, a break-up, and a moving-on. The second: hospitalization, depression, my premature son, and then my joyous first years as a mother. The third: another tragic loss, a terrible fear, a long bed-rest, my daughter who struggled to survive, and then our victorious triumph, deep emotional scars resulting, but 4 beautiful lives striving for our dreams. I got a tattoo for that one.<br /> But on to the music now: Be prepared oh casual-listener-looking-for-new-tunes, this one is not to be taken lightly. I'm not a music expert, just your average audiophile. I find the multi-layered, insanely complex instrumentals, and vocals without comparison, to be some of the most satisfying sounds, and something that shoots straight to my heart and core. Don't be timid - join along with the raw, personal, touching, soul-bearing odyssey. I go on the ups of the powerful, joyous and triumphant waves that are in such songs as Up in the Air and Conquistador. I go on the downs, but there are a lot less of those this album. The head space this band was in, the story they are telling, is full of hope and the beauty of life and pleasure; and how you must fight tooth and nail to get there. Thirty Seconds to Mars always move in the direction our kind is headed, looking far out, and trying to open our eyes to what's happening around us.<br /> If you are a dedicated echelon and are feeling that all too common story of: this isn't my band, this is too different for me and I have to walk away. Well then, I guess you can't be apart of our art-loving forward-thinking family. Go sit in your old comfortable familiar stinky chair and listen to some pop country or some sad emo. But if you can actually hear the music and feel what they feel, and let it connect to your own life, then you might just be ready for this album.<br /> I can't wait to partake in the hive mind that is the concert experience. The joining of voices and body and souls that occurs at all of their live shows. I will be there, at every one I can manage.<br />Now: Jared, Shannon, Tomo: next move - you should make movie scores, these albums are too big to fit inside just a CD.

B00CS7ZIHI|2.0|I don't even know where to start on this album... It's bad... So very, very bad, in so many ways, that it's impossible to list them all in a review short enough that anyone would actually read... So, here are the worst aspects:<br /><br />1) If you're going to put out an album with 12 tracks... THREE (AND A HALF) should NOT be \\"Instrumentals\\" (and they're not even good \\"Instrumentals\\" either... It's like, \\"hey, look what I did on my new keyboard\\" type of crap).<br /><br />2) The music on most of this album is simply a 'vomit-session' of \\"everything AND the kitchen sink\\"... It's very disjointed, convoluted, and just erratic as Hell.<br />-- I have absolutely no problem with the type/style of music they tried to incorporate into this album; or the fact that they're trying new things & experimenting musically (as they usually do)...  But in this particular instance, they failed, miserably, at adapting and melding these styles into their own style; and the result is pure ear-bleed-abomination for the most part.<br /><br />3) The vocals on most of this album suffer the same problems as the music... Through over-processing and 'glitch-work' mainly; but even the majority of vocals not falling into those 2 categories, are just unbearable, considering the source (Jared) & what we all know he's capable of.<br />-- He's got an amazing voice & he's not shy about singing his heart out... and I love the bombastic singing he does; but here, all I hear is a disjointed vocalist who is way too road-weary. (i.e., It sounds like his heart isn't fully in it; and it's pretty freakin' obvious.  Perhaps a longer, well-deserved rest was in order, after their Guinness Record-setting tour.)<br /><br />4) (This is a 2-parter)  Some may find this nit-picky; but this album tells me that Jared (or all of them) think the fans are a bunch of brainless idiots.  The album title is direct & self-sufficient in relating to us what the music is going to be about... Plus, there's the actual lyrics, all ofwhich (if listened to even casually) the listener can glean which of the 4 each song is about.  In other words, each song makes it very clear what it's about.... So, why do the stupid, lame, and thrice redundant, female's voice, stating which \\"part\\" we're currently listening to?<br />4.5) It's not only thrice redundant, and therefore, insinuates we're all retarded & need it spelled out for us in crayon; but it gives the album an even more erratic feel to it... as strange as that may seem to one who's not yet heard the album.<br />-- example: Instead of listing the tracks in an order which would convey a clear (or ambiguous) \\"story-line\\" or \\"through-line\\", it's all jumbled, despite its \\"part-grouping\\" of \\"Love songs\\", \\"Lust songs\\", etc... Which ironically, was done for the exact opposite effect... Nevertheless, some of the songs would be better served in a non-grouped tracklisting, as each song tells part of a story/narrative, which was disregarded in favor of 'grouping' them together based on theme. (And yes, anyone can rearrange the tracklist on their own; but that's not the point I'm making here... Just commenting on the ironic, erratic feel it helped perpetuate throughout the album.)<br /><br />All in all, I'd say they went off the deep end while trying to make an album that sounds as if it were produced by Kanye West (who was featured on their last album's, \\"Hurricane 2.0\\").<br />Or, maybe their target audience has changed from teens & young adults, to pre-teens and tweeners, as evidenced by the over abundance of K.West/Lady-Gaga'esque music-style influences in this album.<br />-- Whatever the reason or cause... All I can judge is the end result... And this is (to me) a hugely disappointing album.<br /><br />For the record, so you know more of where I'm coming from, I would rate their albums as:<br />Self-Title Debut = 10/10  (a masterpiece, musically, lyrically, vocally, etc. - A rare gem from start to finish, with 1 exception.)<br />A Beautiful Lie = 7/10  (experimented & went a little too 'punk' on some of it for my taste; but otherwise very solid)<br />This Is War = 9/10  (started their experimentation w/ \\"Electronica\\" genre/style; and the end result was good)<br />L.L.F.+D. = 4/10  (way overboard w/ prior T.I.W. 'experimentation'... lacks quality, substance, and heart/emotion of past albums)<br />-- And honestly, my favorable bias for this band is the only reason I generously gave this 4/10.<br />-- If I were a new-comer, with no knowledge of their past works... I'm sure I'd have rated it a 2 or 3 (of 10) __ There's not a single song on this album I \\"love\\", or even \\"really like\\".<br />-- Sheer mediocrity, in all it's 'splendor'... And as another reviewer commented, WAY, WAY too much of the vocals are nauseatingly repeated \\"Oh\\" & \\"Whoa\\", which are inserted NOT because the song(s) called for it; but because Jared wants to hear his crowd(s) singing with him... or for him... which is either sheer laziness in writing; or pure, unadulterated arrogance (possibly both)... as if fans don't sing the ACTUAL song-lyrics with him already, as most crowds do during most live events, for most bands!... but again, going with the \\"retarded/crayon\\" feeling given by him/them, outlined above, apparently he/they think(s) ACTUAL lyrics are now, too complicated for fans to sing.)<br /><br />PS: Even the album art (if it can be called \\"art\\") is pathetic & underwhelming beyond words.  It's certainly deserving of the \\"Worst Album Art, Ever!\\" Award (if there were such a thing). __ This album, and even the \\"art\\", is absolutely puzzling --- I can't figure out if they just didn't give a damn, were way too tired from constant touring; or if they were on insane amounts of drugs while recording & while picking the album \\"art\\".(?) __ Hopefully, they'll make up for this junk-album on the next one.<br />--(though, if this is a result of being tired from constant touring... you'd think they'd have taken their sweet time with this album, if nothing else,than to delay the start of another album's tour!... which makes me seriously doubt that as a possibility for this monstrosity.)

B00CW665VI|5.0|Oh my God this book!!! Oh sweet Jesus Drew Evans!!!<br /><br />I swear to the Lord Emma Chase has a secret portal that leads directly to a guy's brain; she's a friggin genius! I absolutely loved every single thing about this book. I have never highlighted so much. Every word was hilarious, honest and heartfelt. The Thanksgiving scene nearly had me peeing myself, I laughed so hard. I rarely, if ever, laugh out loud while reading a book and believe me, I read a lot. And I rarely share my 'fantasy' book world with my hubs but this one had me sharing so much because it was just so good and too funny not to. This by far has been one of my favorite reads of 2013, if not ever. What a phenomenal debut, Emma Chase; anything and everything you write will be an instant one click for me! I can't wait!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I was searching for a neat little mystery game and came upon this one. Not a super action/thrill game but is great to pas time.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I had been putting off getting the all in one package. I'm glad I did. Had a lovely couple of days with my own version of a marathon. The extra disc is a must see for fans. Wish it was longer.
B00CPTUNBK|2.0|My daughters and I being big fans of the show, I thought this would be the perfect movie to get for them.  We already have the Canterlot Wedding episodes on DVD as well as several of their favorite episodes always on the DVR.<br /><br />I thought the R rating was a mistake, but because the cover looked a bit... grim and frightening, I decided to check it out first before I gave it to the girls.  All I can say is that I am SO GLAD I did!<br /><br />While it was a good (maybe even great) movie on its own, with really a surprisingly sophisticated and even sometimes unflinchingly harsh story, it is not suitable for kids.  The scenes of executions and mass graves went on for simply far too long, and the whole brutalization on Fluttershy thing (especially all of the pseudo-sexual stuff- ick!), I could have done without.  Even with the amazing story arc with Rainbow Dash bringing her back from the brink, I still thought it was really too much, but that's just me.  And I thought the Big Mac stuff could have been cut significantly.  It was really cool, but it didn't seem to advance the story that much.<br /><br />Great writing and stunning voice work, but just way too grown-up for my kids.  It will be going in our (my wife's and mine) personal collection till the girls get a lot older.<br /><br />PARENTS STEER CLEAR!
B00BESLHEA|4.0|I have read different reviews of this movie. If you are unfamiliar with this type of movie, you may find it hard to follow along with storyline, plots and characters. But if you just sit back and not over-think it, you would find it highly enjoyable.
B0091WL8TA|3.0|Even though I'm a fan of Elvis, I fell asleep half way through the movie.  It just didn't hold my interest.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|For some movie goers, some scenes will be very graphic. But overall, it gives the viewer a sense of the terror of that horrible event. Natural disasters are hard to comprehend for most of us, unless we were there. This movie takes you there in a safe manner. The devastation from this event will never be forgotten but also, the incredible stories of heroism and enduring strength of the people involved. A must see movie.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really enjoy the puzzle/monster slaying subgenre, and this game is no exception. Got it as the free app of the day, but would gladly pay for this little gem. The gameplay is original enough to me to make it feel fresh from the world of Bejeweled, etc. The RPG aspects are also a nice feature.
B0037RDPEG|5.0|This is my favourite book ever. So inspirational! It has helped me so many times to understand my life. Elizabeth Gilbert allows us to be a part of her amazing journey.
B00CRW2066|4.0|This album is very good, it feels like a continuation of their previous albums. The National never changes course or take risks, they always stick to their formula of making (great) sad songs. If you are looking for a album to brighten up your day look else where, if you are looking for a soundtrack to your pain, then this is it. Best tracks: Demons, Sea of Love, Graceless.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Since I first listened to Musique on a compilation disc in 1996 I've been a fan of their unique electronic sound.  There was just something about it, somewhat intangible, but clean and clear.  As they produced and released more music I found my musical taste evolving with them.  I wanted to like them almost as much as I did like them, if that makes sense.<br /><br />With the release of D.A.F.T. I became even more of a fan. The interesting and unique videos really complemented their sound and rounded them out.  Each new release really seemed to propel them, Discovery and its Pop appeal and of course Interstella 5555 was a unique pairing and it amazing how the music and story worked together.  Electroma and Human After All reinforced the humanity of their computer personas, all the while pushing the limits of their unique style while holding on to that intangible unmistakable sound.<br /><br />The Tron Legacy soundtrack and movie cameo was a high point for me, being a huge fan of the original Tron from the 80s and loving all the nostalgia of that time, something about the selection of Daft Punk for the sound track felt like two very significant threads being woven together.  Like something that was meant to be from inception but took time and commitment to get there.<br /><br />Random Access Memories similarly seems to be sewing together the evolution of electronic sound with its roots in Disco, this time kicking the clock back to the 70s.  Is it a formula?  Is Daft Punk weaving itself into our memories like a duo of time traveling robots rewriting history?  It certainly seems like it.<br /><br />I've listened to RAMs straight through 4 times so far and like it better each time, as was always the case with their releases.  I appreciate something new in every pass.  They again have broken new ground, in this case taking us back, but also still have their characteristic daft-hooks worked in here and there to remind you of their roots.<br /><br />I haven't touched on howDaft Punk has influenced the musical landscape with it can clearly be seen in the work of other artists for example Justice, Skrillex hell even Madonna.  I hope by taking us back to the 70s they can trend music in general back.  Disco was highly stigmatized and then abandoned, and despite how it lives on at the heart of House Music, I feel like there is something there that was left on the table.<br /><br />I think Daft Punk has helped to pick it back up, take us back to those days, all while heading toward our man-machine destiny.  In the fewest words, &#34;Digital Nostalgia&#34;.  The theme as I see it is this: as we push technological limits and get closer to becoming one with computers, Daft Punk reminds us to appreciate our organic origins and their artistic creations and our wonderful intangible humanity.<br /><br />I find it interesting that it took 2 pioneering robots-humans to show us this light, though it makes perfect sense.  Computers can access old memories as quickly as recent ones.  In fact they can replay and relive those memories feeling more like time travel than recollection.  I think that is the message of Random Access Memories.  Through the enlightenment of crossing over we will all better appreciate the past...<br /><br />Thank you Thomas and Guy-Manuel!  Digital Pioneers.

159463176X|5.0|Summary: Pari and Abdullah are as close as siblings can be. Abdullah loves his sister so much, she is almost his daughter. So when the powers that be tear them apart, both of their lives are irrevocably changed. Years down the road we meet friends, doctors, chauffeurs, people whose lives are changed through this one event. What unfolds is a story that crosses oceans, teaching us what it means to love and care.<br /><br />Review: Another hit from Khaled Hosseini! Truly, this man knows how to weave a story. And the Mountains Echoed is a less brutal novel than Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, but the story is no less meaningful nor less heartbreaking. Each chapter is written from the POV from a different character, and one chapter actually has two different POVs intertwined. Each POV is a different character's journey, but they are all related to each other.<br /><br />Unlike the other two novels, this book does not center around regional conflicts. Hosseini delicately tells us stories of individuals who are going through real life journeys. They love, they die. They acquire dream jobs, and real life illnesses. The story is about individuals and how they relate to one another. Sure, the Taliban and the Russians are mentioned but only as a part of the setting. And since the story takes place in four different countries, we see a vast array of settings that help give more richness to the story.<br /><br />One of the major themes of this novel is appearance vs. reality. The beautiful are empty, the morally repugnant are heroes. What may seem like a good idea at the time is actually the worst idea. The characters are also morally ambiguous, much like the main character in Kite Runner. One of the strength's of Hosseini is he sneaks characters into our hearts so that we may begin to understand their bad and ugly choices. You cannot hate the characters because they are only human.<br /><br />Hosseini does a fantastic job creating unique voices for each of the POVs. Dare I say, even better than GRRM?  The storytelling style even changes, from how a father tells his son a bedtime story, to how a woman gives an interview. It's quite remarkable.<br /><br />One little issue I had was Idris' chapter. Although touching, it had little to do with the larger story. Even Markos' chapter fit. But Idris' chapter wasn't quite like the rest; it fit lyrically, but not contextually. I cannot say more without giving the plot away.<br /><br />We already know Hosseini knows how to tell a story. But he has surprised us yet again by showing us that not only can he write one story, but he can create a novel quilted from the stories of nine different characters. Of course, my recommendation is READ!<br /><br />Sex:N/A<br />Violence: None, although mentioned peripherally.<br /><br />Rating: 5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Quote: Beauty is an enormous, unmerited gift given randomly, stupidly.re I say, even better than GRRM?

0393316041|3.0|This book contains about 40 short personal stories about the life of Richard Feynman as he told them to Ralph Leighton.  The stories generally trace his life from childhood and focus on his personal experiences, not his work as a physicist. The stories reveal Feynman to be socially inept, arrogant and generally not a nice person.  For example while a student at MIT he leaves a tip in a restaurant under an upside down glass filled with water.To get the tip the waitress has to spill the water all over the table. Feynman seems proud of himself for such tricks. He also tell how he opened the private safes and drawers of other people with the same smug attitude. Later in the book he tells about his efforts to seduce women.<br /><br />There are some interesting stories, for example about his time working on the atomic bomb, but all in all I was disgusted by this guy and barely skimmed through the last half of the book.

0880796863|1.0|this package has problems - the deck's colors are just too murky for my taste  - there are no blues, but greens instead, and most of these are a sort of dead grass green, to give you an idea - the universal rider waite or the radiant rider waite, or hanson roberts (my personal favorite) have much better stronger colors which i feel makes these decks easier to read - the other problem is the book \\"the key to the tarot\\" by a.e. waite - this is identical to \\"the pictorial key to the tarot\\" by a.e. waite but without the pictures - not having the pictures in the book, and having murky colored cards detract from the access to the book - waite gives a history of tarot where he accuses past tarot writers of using veils to hide their meanings, but then commits the same error over and over - while none can doubt a.e.waite's contributions (most of the little white books that come with tarot decks are based on waite's keywords) and p.c.smith's contributions (fully illustrating the minor arcana) there are better decks and better books - leave this one alone - here is a comparison of five different Waite-Smith decks from Joan Bunning so you can judge for yourself - [...]
B0064NTZJO|4.0|When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie I said this is essentially the movie, \\"Thief\\". with James Caan,<br />Directed by Micheal Mann.  When I saw \\"Bronson\\" by Refn I thought \\"Clockwork Orange\\".  I love the older movies,<br />so naturally I like how Refn is recycling the look and feel of the older films. I like a movie, in general that<br />mixes the the cold with the warm of human nature. Then Refn is the one to watch. I highly recommend, if you like Refn to see \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", or \\"Thief\\", then you will know exactly where I'm coming from.
0316044695|3.0|Amazing story.  Movingly written.  I would also recommend American Sniper as a great book.<br /><br />Btw I listened to this on audiobook. The reader is unbearable. It is totally inappropriate to read this book in an overacted, melodramatic manner that undercut the sincere, emotionally devastating parts of the book.  It was a terrible distraction.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Pros: Very comfortable, not too heavy. adjustable. blocks exterior sound completely. fits over my glasses without discomfort. mic is bendable to an extent. charge is very good. range is very good.<br />Cons: Headset is great, but the logitech gaming software doesn't work well with it. took a while to get it working correctly. in some programs it would only give sound in right side. other programs would be chalked full of bass. while some programs were extremely low.
B000I9U75G|2.0|Just silly.  Nothing made sense and there was no attempt to make it even plausible.  Actors mailed it in.  Totally predictable.  Without the French it would have been zero stars.

Every time when I fully charged my phone, I unplug the cord from the power bank, but the blue light on it is still on even I already pushed the on/off button, and next time when I want to use it, it need a recharge itself. Is it something wrong with my unit only?<br /><br />Update:<br />The shop contacted me right away and replaced my item. Very good customer service.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|Carlos Vives finally put an album after many years of absence.  His comeback is great.  He maintained the same infectiousness in his songs that makes you want to be happy and dance.
1401232590|5.0|&#34;The Long Halloween&#34; is awesome.  The subject matter is very dark and the ending is absolutely brilliant.  One can definitely see how this story inspired Christopher Nolan's Batman film trilogy.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This is definitely a homage to E.T. and Close Encountered of the Third Kind.  JJ Abrams is a genius and the new go to guy for Sci Fi movies.
B004GYY714|5.0|If you don't find something you like you're not looking hard enough. One of the best apps I have, use it every day.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the best Bond movie so far.  Javier Bardem is splendid as the villain, and M as the Bond girl is unforgettable.  Too bad she missed the shots she shot!  This was an awesome movie, and the Blu Ray is filled with goodies!
B00C5ZORES|3.0|This album is, unfortunately, a far cry from the snarky, bitter, and wonderful Fall Out Boy of the past. The first single (My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark) gave the album a positive start but every other song on the album lacks it's punch and flavor. While many of the songs are enjoyable, they fall painfully short of the standard set by earlier FOB albums.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing for me was the extreme drop in lyric quality. In previous albums, FOB lyrics were consistently full of artistic, arrogant, and fabulous word play. This album's lyrics read like a grab bag of bad poetry and Top 40 hooks. Also, the distorted voice effect that Patrick seems to be in love with is featured in far too many songs. I guess this weird effect is used in an attempt to sound edgy or fierce, but it does not achieve that goal. The only thing is does achieve is banality and, at worse, annoyance.<br /><br />I keep waiting for the album to grow on me but I have little to not hope of that happening. This is definitely not an album that hearkens back to any previous Fall Out Boy. I can only imagine that most of the good reviews for the album have a lot to do with the fact that we've all waited for so long for this album. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for it's mediocrity.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin did it again!<br /><br />Just like he did in all of the previous books on this series, he keeps the readers captives to the ever developing stories of all of the incredibly interesting characters.<br /><br />Cannot wait for the next one!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|OK, this is a good album.  The first two songs are heavy on driving percussion.  Stylistically, it's pretty much mostly all much of a muchness.  As she matures I imagine Adele will develop more range.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is just a great modern version to the classic original series.<br />Good effects and story to see how the crew got their start.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|Zaz's voice is a wee bit reminiscent of Piaf's, but her jazzy, quirky style and range go beyond that.  I really wish she were getting more press!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The story was fantastic and easy to follow.  Blake Crouch is a great writer!  I loved the story and read it in one day.  I could not put it down and can't wait for the sequel, which is coming out in September and is called Wayword!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|You can't go wrong with a classic! A super fun, silly book! My daughter loves it and asks me to read it again and again.
075669812X|5.0|My 7 year old wanted this book real bad at the school book fair.  I could not rationalize the $18.99 they were asking for it.  Got it here for just over $10 and he loves it.  The Lego encyclopedia's are a great picture book for him to look at before bed.  As he gets older he has started reading more about the characters in the book too.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|By far at the ending of the book when Percy and Annabeth fell into the tarterous was my favorite part because of its irony. Right when I thought the book was rapping up, a spectacular twist.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Excellent read. Love the characters and how they all evolved over time. Jeffrey Archer is one of my favorite authors and I look forward to his next book.
B000M341QE|5.0|Love this purchase-it's perfect, just what I wanted. Described perfectly-presentation is great and even better than expected.Would use this company again.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Stick with the free version. At least then you expect this kind of junk. The intrusive ads were the last straw for me.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I enjoy all the seasons of Supernatural and Season 3 is no exception. Especially in the first part of the series, the arc is interesting, amazing, at times scary, and always entertaining. Go Winchesters go!
B001NZREUA|5.0|haven't heard this album since I had the lp. it was great then and still is today. the Dregs were a terrific band and this is some of their best work...
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I saw the preview/trailer for this movie the other day and I thought &#34;This looks awesome, I have to read this book!&#34; However, it did not enthrall me as the trailer did. The writing is simplistic and full of simple similes and comparisons, and I'm so sorry, but I couldn't help but compare it to a mix of: Harry Potter, Twilight, with a dash of Supernatural mixed in. Kind of ho-hum. Not a terrible story but there were some sections where I felt it could've been spruced up a bit. I'll probably read the next one before I make my mind up about the whole series.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|We got one of these for a gift and had to buy more after seeing how well our granddaughter loved them.
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|I had these recordings years ago on LPs. Tragically, I sold my LP collection in the 90's as I thought everything was going to be released on CDs....and have never forgiven myself for that move...<br /><br />Over the years, Paavo Berglund revisited these works twice more, once with the Helsinki Philharmonic (also in an EMI box set that contains these recordings of the shorter works here in this set, Bournemouth Symphony) and in his late years with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. This, to me, was (and is) very interesting, to watch the differences brought to these works through a lifetime of interpretation and rethinking by Berglund. We seldom get a life-long tracery of an artist's thoughts like this in Complete Editions.<br /><br />I am a fan of all three traversals and for a completest like myself give them all kudos for their place. Rightly, though, this first adventuring by Berglund, just as he was truly hitting his stride and reaching great respect in the music world, comes in at first place for the freshness and daring he dislayed here in these pioneering recordings made in the 1970's with the Bournemouth Symphony. Greater thought would come later with the Helsinki, and deep reflection brought to his last set with the COE, but pride of place belongs here in this set.<br /><br />Waiting for what seemed forever for EMI to bring these recordings out, I finally \\"broke down\\" last summer and bought a 2nd hand set from a vendor in Europe of the release on Royal Classics (licensed from EMI) [[ASIN:B00000IGLH Sibelius: Complete Symphonies [Symphony 1-7]]] for over $100 and thought them not well mastered as I seemed to have remembered them from my LP's. Wouldn't you know it, just afterward, here comes EMI with their own Spectacularly Remastered Issue! After a couple conversations about this remastering by EMI with other folks here in the Classical music forums, I purchased this \\"duplication\\"....what a spectacular difference! Each work gains in sonic elevation that is remarkable from that previous released set, but particularly 1, 2, 5, and 7 really stand out through EMI's engineering gurus' efforts. If you want to see what jaw-dropping work can be done with 40+ year old analog recordings, this is definitely a great example! Strings are now opened up, no longer sounding 2-dimensional, brass has gained proper clear and toothy bite and increased depth, and basses are now clearly (and happily) improved dimensionally and no longer sounding \\"blanketed\\"--a revelation from the previous edition I mention above. The orchestra here, now, is represented with proper spaciality. Spectacular for sure, you will not believe these recordings were recorded in the 1960's and 1970's--they rival much more recent recordings and you would swear they are DDD era sessions.<br /><br />These tremendous old recordings have been discussed (here and elsewhere) deeply over the years, and have earned the great praise heaped upon them...my repeating of these thoughts again here is redundant, and so I simply will urge you to add this stand-out issue straightaway to your collection! The price certainly makes this box truly a GIFT to us from EMI!<br /><br />~operabruinarkable from that previous released set, but particularly 1, 2, 5, and 7 really stand out through EMI's engineering gurus' efforts.

1451695195|5.0|I see the hand of God all through the book, starting with God choosing a neurosurgeon to be the recipient of such a wonderful experience.  And after all the destruction of his brain, (which is usually either fatal of leaves the patient in a vegetative state), to return the man's ability to continue to perform such extraordinary surgery is a sign that Dr. Alexander was chosen and accompanied by God for the purpose of showing millions of us what lies ahead after our short journey here on earth.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I tried playing this game because I loved the movie and don't mind boxing games. I knew when I got this that it would be a simple robot boxing game. But the controls and UI seemed to fail for me. I couldn't get timing or any good combo or anything. I always lost the first fight I would be in.<br /><br />I probably shouldn't blame the game, but I have played plenty of games on PC, XBOX, and mobile. I simply couldn't get it and don't recommend it because of that.
030758836X|4.0|It was so refreshing to read a book where I had no idea which way the story was going. Because of that, I couldn't wait to get back to it. The story was about a husband who was framed so that it appeared he had killed his wife. Each chapter was written from the perspective of either the husband or the wife, which was an interesting way to present the story. It was like being in the head of one person or the other. You got both perspectives.<br /><br />My only complaint (which kept me from giving it 5 stars) was the disapointing ending. There were so many ways to end the story and the one that Ms. Flynn chose was unsatisfying.<br /><br />But, I look forward to reading another one of her books.

B00CATSONE|1.0|I expected this book to be a biography of Tesla, who apparently was a very inventive, brilliant individual.  Instead, this book turned out to be a method for the author to prevent his point of view on the creativeness and/or positive thinking (although the message is very mixed about just what he is trying to encourage), with a few pages thrown in about Tesla's life.  And most of those pages sounded like something taken straight out a history text, dry and factual, with no links between different stages of Tesla's life.  So, don't expect to learn anything about Tesla even if this is the title of the book.

B009LMTDL0|2.0|If women would get resonant with what they want and get rid of the guilt, we would change how we come across in the workplace. We can only change us. In changing us, men will be subtlety forced to react differently to us. Currently they are reacting to our guilt, our hesitancy, and our lack of self confidence. When this is gone, they will respond to us differently. Doing this is not a difficult process but a long process none the less. With an open mind and a lot of work this can be accomplished.  Having spent the past 6 yrs working this process, I can vouch for its effectiveness. My hope is that every woman will find her path to complete peace with who she is and the choices she makes.

B008220D5K|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Six years ago audiences everywhere were presented with Knocked Up. A film many probably went into expecting a raunchy comedy, but one that turned into a charming love story. Well now we're given This Is 40. The \\"sort-of sequel\\" that follows returning characters Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) as they cope with their upcoming 40th birthdays. To be completely honest I did find the overall experience to be a bit underwhelming, but I think most of that had to do with the fact that I can't really relate to their situation given my age.<br /><br />The film starts off with Debbie's birthday. She's having a hard time accepting her new age as the viewer sees her constantly deny the fact that she's 40. Normally Pete and Debbie throw a joint birthday party because both of their birthdays are close together, but Debbie says that she doesn't want a party for her and that it should just be for Pete. Well Pete, being a normal guy, doesn't really understand why she's making such a big deal about the whole thing, but he doesn't push her.<br /><br />While Debbie is having her little midlife crisis Pete is having his own personal issues as well. Pete owns a record company that is currently having a difficult time pushing big numbers, his most recent release only sold 600 copies. Pete keeps signing bands that he loves instead of trying to get artists that are more popular within the general public. Because of this he's having huge financial troubles and to top it off he has to lend money to his father because he's retired and recently had triplets. Mind you, Debbie doesn't know that business is bad and she thinks he stopped lending money to his father months ago. Add that to their two daughters (8 & 13) and you have two normal people with a very, very hectic life.<br /><br />That's where I think this film lost me and where it will probably lose many people. This Is 40 is a pretty raw tale of the difficulties that wemust face as we get older. Almost nothing goes according to plan and sometimes we really don't know how to explain to our significant other that we're having a hard time. This isn't necessarily a bad topic to address in a film, but most people who see this are probably in their 20's or in their late 30's/early 40's. The former group doesn't truly understand just how difficult it really is while the latter group doesn't want to be reminded of their own, probably similar, problems.<br /><br />Most of the laughs that can be found throughout This Is 40 aren't necessarily \\"laugh out loud\\" material because of the content, but you're laughing because it's relatable. Whether you're the older audience understanding the little quarrels that are had between Debbie and Pete or the younger audience who understands the rocky relationship between the younger and older siblings, it's bound to make you think of your own experiences and that's where This Is 40 is at its best. When it makes the viewer think back and go, \\"Yea I remember when I had a fight with my older sister.\\" or \\"Yea, I remember when I had a similar argument with my husband/boyfriend.\\" It's these moments where you can find that middle ground that's relatable to majority of the audience.<br /><br />It's no surprise that I enjoyed the casting in this film. Most of the characters in here are returning with their respective actors. I already mentioned Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, but Jason Segel also returns as Jason, Charlyne Yi returns as Jodi, Tim Bagley returns as Dr. Pellegrino, and Maude and Iris Apatow return as Sadie and Charlotte, respectively. I think it would have been nice to see Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl make an appearance, but sadly they were nowhere to be found. In terms of new characters, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd, Albert Brooks, and John Lithgow were all nice additions. It should be noted that none of these performances are ground breaking. They accomplish what they set out to do and in a movielike this that's all that matters.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - As I stated earlier I think most of my disappointment was due to my age. I think the core audience is those who are 40+ that can have an easier time relating to these characters and their struggles. Still, given the fact that I've seen Knocked Up multiple times it was nice to see a lot of the same characters again and that alone made the experience worthwhile. If you're even the least bit interested in checking this out then I would say give it a shot. It has a lot of charm and it's bound to make you reminisce regardless of your age.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend referred me to the Wool Omnibus edition that was available on kindle. I was first attracted because of the recommendation, then the star ratings and reviews on Amazon, and finally the exceptionally low price on kindle ($5.99). All the buildup was true. The characters are believable and well drawn. The storyline is well crafted, moving from one exciting, dramatic or thoughtful scene to the next. I just kept reading well into the night and I'm ready for more. Just finished this book and went looking for more. I just purchased The Shift omnibus. I hope I get some sleep this week.  -  PS: Mr Howey, I only had one technical question as I read Wool. How is it that the executive hidey hole, under the grate, is maintained for centuries since only the exec or his shadow can go down there? Do they run the silo and maintain all the equipment down there; do they bring in technicians and them have them killed; or did I miss something regarding what equipment was where?
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Note: I saw this film in HD via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is first-rate, and the drama is very well sustained. Nicole Kidman & Jude Law do very credible American accents, and Renee Zellweger rightly won Best Supporting Actress. There are other good actors in smaller roles here as well, including future Oscar winner Natalie Portman. The cinematography is beautiful, and the score by Gabriel Yared is lovely.<br /><br />Sadly, there is one profane use of God's Name, and that's 30 minutes towards the end of the picture. Why do film-makers feel the need to profane God's Name in a movie? \\"Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.\\" That is the only fly in the ointment for me concerning this otherwise swear-free motion picture.<br /><br />Rated R (graphic violence, moderate profanity, one profane use of God's Name, some nudity and a sex scene with nudity).

B0093OGBL6|4.0|My heartfelt thanks to Karen Moriarty for making her book available to Michael Jackson fans who are so sick of reading rubbish biographies about their (my) hero.  I bought the Kindle version of \\"Defending A King\\" knowing that it included some of the material that Michael's former body guards had promised us in their TV interviews.  But Karen does not restrict herself to their testimony, since there are plenty of other good sources on the life and artistry of the King of Pop, and she has made good use of them here.  It's a big book, but as a digital download, takes up no space at all, and delivery is instant!  I doubt there will ever be a definitive account of Michael's life and legend... besides, it keeps growing.  But \\"Defending A King:\\" comes from a place of love - and that's by far the best place to start.  (Thank you, Karen.)

B007TNQ7EY|4.0|haven't played for very long. it is fun to play AFTER I got used to the driving controls. It reminds me of a game... hmmm?  short missions, driving is cool, easy gun action. maybe too much cussing. nobody talks like that unless they're d-bags. gave it a 4/5.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun driving game. Where most driving games are about speeding around a track this game offers more of a challenge. You must control your speed over various hills and obstacles to avoid flipping your car and hurting your driver.  So far I have not had to spend real absurd amounts of money (in fact none) but I like the driving and am patient to work for it. Granted I have yet to pass the first track but I have had it over a week and I still enjoy it (that is saying something, I get bored very fast). The graphics are cartoony but to me it adds to the fun.  I highly recommend you give it a shot. It's free if you don't like it uninstall it but I think most everyone will get a smile from it.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I loved the story, the music, the dancing and the acting.  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are electric together.  I have watched it several times.  It is also nice to have the Bonus footage.

B009VA1FN6|4.0|This is written in the now and then format which at times became a bit laborious, the plot kept me guessing and wondering just where it was going to go.  I found it a bit slow at times but an easy read and always good to have such a book when you are travelling as I was.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Well, that's it... it's over. *sigh* I really loved this series and I'm kinda sad to say goodbye to everyone. Of course, I can still catch up with them on HBO via TrueBlood, but it's not the same. Which brings me to a very valid point, it's not the same because the characters aren't the same. Sure, they have the same names and a lot of the same characteristics, but they aren't the same. I like them both in different ways for what they are, but doing side by side comparisons to them is just not fair. Even though the TV series is based on the books (the key word here is `based') they were essentially created by different people. There's HBO's version and Charlaine Harris' version and other than some obvious similarities they went their separate ways. That became fairly obvious when Lafayette survived beyond the first season. I love the fact that the writers decided that he should stick around. It was a perfect step in turning the TrueBlood world into an alternate world inching away from the books. That's just my opinion, so take it for what it's worth, but I do think that the fact that I kept the two separate helped in my acceptance of the course the book series ultimately took. That and the fact that I never really was `team' anyone. I usually don't pick `teams.' I'd rather go with the journey that the author takes me on and enjoy the ride. That's not to say I don't sometimes question decisions that characters make, but I question decisions that people in my real life make all the time. Just because I disagree doesn't make the decision wrong. It just means that I wouldn't have made the same decision they did. (For instance.. I have no doubt that Bella made the right decision when she chose Edward. However, if it were me making the same decision I would have chosen Jacob. Her decision wasn't wrong, it just wasn't the one that I would have made  ) Okay, enough with the soap box...<br /><br />So what did I think of Dead Ever After and do I think it was a fitting end toa series I've followed since the beginning? All in all, I was pretty happy with the story in general. There was mystery, danger, some really happy moments and some really heart breaking ones too. A couple of the characters had to make some really hard decisions and they pretty much stayed true to who they were when they made them. I know that I'm in the minority here, but like I said, it's my opinion. I'm not exactly sure where all the anger is coming from because there were some pretty big clues along the way that pretty much left few choices as to where things were going. I will not be one of those reviewers that gives anything away. Even though I was pretty certain where the story was headed, I was still a little surprised by the decision that Sookie made. Not disappointed though. Not at all.<br /><br />I'm going to miss Bon Temps and the characters that I've grown to love (and sometimes hate) but I think it was time to say goodbye. The great thing about the books though is that I can start the journey all over again if I want. Sure I know what happens, but I always pick up on something new every time I reread a book. It'll be fun to see how many clues I missed along the way.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Don't judge  a game by its title.<br />There's a lot more to this game than what  it says.<br />The new Update 5 makes this the most advanced Mobile Simulator I've seen on the Kindle Fire.<br />As far as accuracy, it's exceptional. Not as good as X-plane but it's good.<br />I'd highly recommend this game!<br /><br />(I'm a student pilot)

B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|If you can overlook some of the sillier production decisions, this film is one not soon to be forgotten.  After viewing it, I was unable to move it out of my thoughts for days.  Very inspiring and thoughtful ideas and problems are raised, sometimes with solutions suggested, and sometimes without.<br /><br />The makeup was distracting, pure and simple.  I personally would have loved to see those characters played by other actors (and connected by some other means), but at the very least, I am able to appreciate what they were attempting to explore and communicate the way they did it.<br /><br />It's not often that a movie jumps out and resonates so completely, but I'm happy to say that this one succeeded with that for me.  Some have mentioned that the film was confusing to them, but I didn't have that experience in the slightest.  Everything was simply expressed and laid out.  Some of the ideas were subtle, but even in their subtleties, there was very little that I perceived as difficult to follow or digest.  I personally was happy to see a theatrical film speak up to its audience rather than down like so many sheeple, but I'm just one drop in the ocean, to use an idea expressed in the film.<br /><br />For all of its shortcomings, I would still say that this film has been and likely will continue to be one of a handful of films that have affected me so deeply and that have stayed with me as completely.  Does a film need to be devoid of any imperfections to be considered a \\"masterpiece?\\"  If so, then Odin help us, because there are none to be found under that definition.  If, on the other hand, a masterpiece can be defined by its ability to communicate ideas, hopes, dreams, and fears, and by its ability to resonate with its viewers, then Cloud Atlas might just have the muster to shine as one.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I first read AMERICAN SNIPER,  NO EASY DAY, and then LONE SURVIVER.  Latrell's description of Hell Week was<br />so much more intense and, I think more accurate.

My heart felt gratitude<br />to those who have defended  and continue to defend our great nation.

B005DD7H50|5.0|This film deals with a subject that hasn't often been addressed in films.  What if there was a drug that could enhance your intelligence and give you superior ability?  Would it be worthwhile to take it?  What would be the consequences to your livelihood, your relationships, your personality, your character?<br /><br />All of these issues are explored by the film and in a very realistic way.  The character development, in Eddie's case, is excellent.  Bradley Cooper(Eddie) does an outstanding job of going from a frumpy, down-and-out, aspiriring writer to a slick and competent human being. Then the crash he experiences when he goes through withdrawal from the drug is quite realistic.  I would also say that the script is excellent. I like the way it explores some of the more personal aspects of psychoactive drug use, like \\"Am I really ME when I'm on the drug or am I someone else?\\". The various scenarios (ie. Eddie and his girlfriend, Eddie and a Russian loan shark, Eddie in a day trading firm, Eddie and the corporate big wigs) all come across quite credibly and smoothly.  You know that this is the way that people act and talk.<br /><br />The film does have some plot holes, like<br /><br />1)  The police certainly would have searched Eddie's person and found the money and the stash of pills when they came to<br />  the apartment.  That probably would have ended the story right there.<br /><br />2)  It's doubtful that someone would have framed Eddie for murder just so that they could get the pills.  Why would they think<br />  that it would work?<br /><br />3)  It's not likely that a person as smart as Eddie would not have paid back the loan shark, knowing that his life depended<br />  on it.<br /><br />4)  Why would Eddie even bother going to a loan shark at all?  With his enhanced abilities he could have made millions without that kind of help.<br /><br />These are just a few holes in the story but I'm sure there are others.<br /><br />What concerns me more is how themedication affected Eddie.  I'm concerned that he wasn't more upset about the murdered woman and the role (even unknowingly) he might have played in it.  I'm concerned that he didn't have more compassion for Hank Atwood and didn't try to save his life.  I'm concerned that while vacationing in the Carribean, he comes up with a \\"vision\\" for his life, but his \\"vision\\" basically involves making millions in day trading.  I'm wondering if this is actually part the cautionary tale and that one of the effects of enhanced ability is a lack of concern for others and for the betterment of society.  Does enhanced ability just turn a self-absorbed person into a more successful and adaptable self-absorbed person?  What are the consequences of that?  Maybe that gives some credence to him not paying the loan shark.  Perhaps he was so intoxicated with himself and his new abilities that he neglected to pay.<br /><br />What makes this subject interesting is that a certain class of this type of drug already exists.  They're called amphetamines.  Back in the early twentieth century when amphetamines were first introduced they were considered the wonder drugs of the century.  People who struggled with fatigue, depression, timidity and poor self image took these drugs and experienced an immediate turn-a-round.  They became more productive and successful at work.  They were able to work longer hours without fatigue.  They became more socially engaging and self-assured.  Their family lives became more stable.  But there was a price.  We eventually discovered that these drugs were highly addictive and that users had to keep upping the dose to get the desired effect.  We also discovered that if too much were taken it could cause psychosis.  The wonder drugs turned out to be not so wonderful.<br /><br />I suspect this is the case with most if not all performance enhancing drugs.  Sooner or later, there's going to be a reckoning to pay.  That's why I really didn't like the ending of the film.Eddie's lab perfects the pill to such a degree that he doesn't have to take it any more.  The enhancing effects of the drug are now permanent and his life is now happy ever after.  Oh please!  Wouldn't it be better to have him come down off the meds and learn to cope with his natural imperfections?  I don't know.  I don't know what the ending should be, but I don't think it should be \\"NZT solved all of my problems\\".<br /><br />Unless, of course, there's going to be a Limitless 2.  Hmm.......
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|\\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\"<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed seeing this in the theater... Not as much as the first J.J. Abrams reboot movie, which was just so dynamic and clean, but still a lot. I like what these guys are doing with the characters, with the ground-level view of the formative years of the Federation, and in particular with the concept of this being an alternate-reality Star Trek universe.<br /><br />The concept was introduced at the end of the first film, and even though I knew this, and consciously reminded myself of it before going into this second film, I still found myself halfway through the movie thinking, \\"oh, thus-and-such can't happen, since it doesn't fit the continuity\\" or \\"I wonder how they're going to change that back so it'll fit in with what we know happens later...\\" and it wasn't until way, way far in that I realized that this version of Star Trek is going to be a lot different than the \\"reality\\" we already know. It's a really profound divergence, and they are having a lot of fun with it. Me, too.<br /><br />We all left the theater psyched and ready for more: if the movie theater production schedule proves too ponderous, I sure hope they'll consider keeping this cast and crew together for a TV series. They're all doing great work, with a special shout-out to Zachary Quinto, who has definitively made the new-universe Spock his own. Great stuff. Bring on Number Three!

B00669MFA2|3.0|The finale in the Harry Potter series of films is about on par with its predecessors. Our familiar fiends and friends clash in their ultimate showdown and do so in thrilling fashion. But I am not a reader of the books, so I can't make a comparison.<br /><br />On another note, we rented the HD version and initially streamed it from Amazon Instant Video app on Xbox 360. It will be a long time before I attend that method again; the resolution was comparable to VHS at best. AND we regularly pull 30 Mbps from our ISP. It was disappointing; however, downloading it to our TiVO did give us the true HD resolution we were expecting.
0811879542|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I can see how a parent might spend an hour reading and rereading this story to their child.  Each page is filled with magical dots which move around the pages with each direction followed.  You press dots, blow on pages and shake the book to get the dots to 'move' around.  I absolutely loved this book!

B00499QUK2|5.0|Not sure how to put into words how much I enjoy this series.  As an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes from watching the old black and white movies on Sunday mornings with Basil Rathbone, to Elementary with Johnny Lee Miller, I think this series is great.  I appreciate that even though the series has been modernized, he atmospher, storys, locations and characters are maintained. Benedict and Martin bring a great modern twist to the two beloved characters of Holmes and Watson.  I highly recommend this to anyone that has ever enjoyed the shows.
159562015X|1.0|I read all the great reviews about this \\"book\\" but all it basically is,is a link to a web site where you do a survey.It is 33 pages describing the survey, and then they get you to do an online survey, probably for their own benefit as much as yours -you then get 5 strengths based on your survey-the website describes those strengths which you can print and how to use them etc. So the rest of the book is a waste. As it discusses all the strengths. Of which only 5 are relavent to you. Its a marketing tool for a website!

I use it for everything from journaling to travel check lists.

1608193381|5.0|Award-winning economist Ha-Joon Chang uncovers 23 false premises upon which free-market capitalism is built. Chang supports capitalism. His book is a critique of free-market capitalism. He contends that the free-market policies that have dominated in most countries over the last three decades have resulted in slower growth, rising inequality, and heightened instability culminating in the recent economic meltdown. Chang hopes his book will inform the layperson so we all may become active economic citizens. Otherwise, we will always be victims of those in power.<br /><br />Chang addresses each premise separately. He briefly outlines what free-market capitalists tell us and then reveals what we are not told. He writes in a style that is easily understood by those unfamiliar with economic theory. He concludes his book with eight principles for redesigning the economic system.<br /><br />This is a book those in power would rather you not read. It is imperative, though, that we all understand the assumptions underlying our economy if we are to be responsible citizens. Reading this book may make you uncomfortable, but that is a small price to pay to avoid a repeat of our recent economic disaster. We need to get uncomfortable.
B0000942HV|2.0|Yet another Tubular Bells album! With so many of them out there it's good to know what you are getting before you buy it so I thought I'd try and help out.<br /><br />Tubular Bells 2003 is a note for note re-recording of the 1973 original. In doing so Oldfield utilized nearly all of the original instruments but used modern studio technology. Oldfield was always dis-satisfied with the results first time round complaining he didn't even have time to tune the instruments.<br /><br />So what about the results? Well for me Tubular Bells 2003 sounds far too smooth and clean, the charm and youthful innocence of the original is missing. Sure, the original was a bit rough around the edges but we all loved the character that gave it, it was shot from the hip, not too deliberated, genuine.I was left with the feeling that this was a missed opportunity for a new hand played piece of work that TB2003 hinted Mike could still deliver if he really wanted to.<br /><br />There are two redeeming features for me; Latin is just great, there is a depth that perhaps Mike just couldn't achieve back in '73. Also the appearance of John Cleese as Master of Ceremonies; I always thought there was a touch of Python in Tubular Bells. His announcement of mandolin is inspired! But......Oldfield was obviously so keen on Cleese's delivery he repeats it a few seconds later, utterly pointless and totally irritating.<br /><br />I'm guessing many Oldfield fans will have purchased this release desperate for anything even remotely new from the maestro, my recommendation is to instead invest in the 2010 remastering of the original 1973 Tubular Bells; nothing messed around with, just a much better audio experience. A further recommendation is to find an album called Mohribold by Andrew Taylor. Google it, I downloaded from a site called bandcamp. Mohribold will delight the ears of those who loved Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn and Amarok, it will do me until Oldfield rediscovers his mojo.
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|Watch out for spoilers - best thing to say about this one is that it's a delicious noir thriller/mystery and, as others have commented, very reminiscent of Hitchcock. I gave it a 5 for being so very elegantly what it is - clever, tense, twisty, gripping (after a slightly slow start) and terrifically performed. Hitchcock loved themes around madness and the frightening power of psychiatry - I love this effective and very timely contemporary take on that. Responding to some reviews here I'd argue that plausibility in any nitpicky precise sense isn't a requirement of the genre. Double-turns, escalating spookiness, and intriguing surprises are. That it's so quietly beautiful to look at is a bonus.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was a good book and I recommend every one to read it. So do it right now today Don't wait.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|As a casual viewer, I don't dare nitpick or overanalyze anything related to the Star Trek universe. I enjoy it for what it is, and I am completely hooked. I was in love with the reboot when it came out in 2009 and this sequel was so worth the wait. As far as I know it still takes place in the alternate time-line so liberties were taken and new events can take place because of it. This is a fast-paced action film, but it is also a film about friendship, and forging bonds. It really is all about Spock and Kirk and they couldn't have done it better than this. Zachary Quinto is simply extraordinary in this. He stays perfectly in character, no matter the situation. His professional relationship with Kirk is just amusing to witness simply for the fact that they are polar opposites. They bicker, disagree on almost everything and yet you can see the evolvement of both their character's throughout the movie. When they are on screen together, you know you are in for a treat, even when the unexpected happens and the most subtle scene becomes the most poignant. The rest of the cast is top-notch as well, with a few characters getting less screen time than the first, but understandable for this particular film. However, it is Benedict Cumberbatch that absolutely steals the film. You can't take your eyes off of him. His voice, so dark and full of promise, so elegant, with a touch of crazy. He is perfect and I hope to see much more from him in future films.<br /><br />Let's talk about the score. It's fantastic. Very rarely do I lose concentration during a fight scene to admire the music, but here it happens quite often. Just a great, effective musical score. The special effects/CGI are all done to perfection. As somone who IS picky about that, I can say I don't have any complaints regarding the production value of Into Darkness. I can't wait for the Blue-ray. If it looked that great on the big screen, I look forward to seeing how it looks with perfect clarity in my living room. Star Trek Into Darkness is a great film for those not really into Star Trek. I didn't think I would care much for the reboot, as I'm not a huge sci-fi fan. But I was hooked from the first scenes, and now, I am completely open to watching the original films as well. If I'm right, I think there are alot of other people thinking the same thing.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|The story of this famous racehorse and his underdog owner is made every bit as exciting and endearing as it should be in this phenomenal film.<br /><br />Penny Chenery Tweety (Diane Lane) is devestated by the loss of her mother, and even more upset when she learns that her family's horse farm is in trouble. She has fond memories of her life there as a child and she knows how important the success of their horses is to her ailing father (Scott Glenn). Her husband and her brother are not thrilled when Penny unexpectedly takes up the reins of the family business, gambling all of their futures on an unborn colt. When Secretariat is born he steals Penny's heart and she spends the next 3 years of her life working with trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich), groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) and her father's secretary Miss Ham (Margo Martindale) building him into the champion racehorse she knows he can be. We're as much rooting for Penny to hold her family together as we are for Secretariat to win each race as we walk with her in this journey from housewife to horse owner extraordinairre. Secretariat was and is the star of the show, a horse who broke records and trampled expectations and who possessed every bit as much heart as his beloved owner.<br /><br />Special features on the Blu Ray are pretty standard, but good, and I like that this is a combo-pack.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I'm a 34 year old mom and grandmom reading a book that is for young adults,but it's that I've always been obsessed with Greek mythology and Roman mythology,so when I found out about Rick Riordan' s books about Egyptian God's I had to read them,they are so good I even made a movie in my head while reading it,so my advise read these books they have true history in them as well,you'll learn about different cultures and Gods,obj and adventures too ;)

Honestly, This product seems more for the skateboarding scene than any other purpose. i've seen people mount this on a tripod which i understand it's what it's for as well but it looks pretty funny.. other than that this is a great product. Another reviewer had said it's very flexible. Yeah sure it is, but that's when you shake it around like he's doing. This is an inexpensive handle for the beginner, and that's not even saying it shouldn't be for the veteran cinematographers out there either. the grip on it is comfy and doesn't irritate, the screw to tighten is great i don't know what the other reviewer was talking about.<br /><br />I'd recommend this no prob! get this in red though, it looks gnarly. :P
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have thus been a huge fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series... until now. After reading the book I felt dumped by Charlene Harris by post-it. She literally wrote the book in the shower I believe. The book does wrap up all the stories but in such a way we no longer care. No matter who Sookie ended up with (which by the way made NO sense since she examined this in earlier books) the book was a complete and total let down that I really wish never happened. I'm pretty sure I would rather have made up my own ending and saved the fifteen bucks I wasted.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I like this book a lot and am excited to read the next! I was recommended this series by a friend, because of my enthusiasm about the divergent series...what a great recommendation!
B0007TKNII|5.0|Eat your heart out Shakespeare. This musical/movie has great acting and singing. The musical scores are hauntingly delicious. No play can rival the movie.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Such a good series.  Excellent acting and story line.  Would highly recommend this series.  All of the actors are so talented.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|i love this movie.  it is bittersweet and heartwarming at the same time.<br />have watched it many times with my grand daughter
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show is so good we cannot wait to see what happens next.  Bryan Cranston is so talented.  Best show on tv.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|It is a great processor I love it.  I have had it since September of 2012.  Never needed to overclock it but today I did.  To 4hz.  The only con to that is even with a great heatsink (not stock)  the temperature rose to 51c.  But that's pretty good being that that was with crisis 3Maxed.  I see a lot of hosh posh about processors for gaming.  Yes there are higher end ones but come on.....witg over clock or not its 6cores.  And even before I overclocked everything ran well.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is a great movie that's even better due to it being in 3D. If you like the Jurassic Park movies then you will love this in 3D. Get one of your own now!
0061733199|5.0|bought this for my husbands birthday and he is very happy. Being an avid reader of similar subjects he said this has a good amount of useful information. well worth the price.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The more you read, the more you want to read.  I can't wait to read what happens next.  Onto book 2....
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I was reading some negative review of this movie cmparing it to Knocked up.<br />I have seen both and the Knocked up was such a bore comparing to this one.<br />The wittines, the real humor in real life situations and impecable<br />acting make this movie an awsome weekend movie. We were laughing our bellies<br />off all the time. I don't remember laughing so hard in a long time.<br />It is prefect for a seasoned couple with young kids who need a little<br />laughter at themselves as it shows very probable real life situations.<br /><br />Three thumbs up!
B00A11AN6O|3.0|This is a great idea, however I find it not as easy to use as described.  I am almost 70 yrs old, so that may be a deciding factor.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it, love it.  Full of interesting things,  The photography is tops!<br />Pass it on to all my friends, they enjoy it, too!
B0058SNKNS|5.0|Second attempt to get size right - product sizing seems to very according to region when manufactured.  When I finally got right size - all hassle free through Amazon, was completely satisified.  Comfortable, light weight, and look good.  Would definitely buy again.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game. After playing the first germ I bought both the worm virus and zombie virus. Very challenging and fun to replay and try out different way to kill humans. ONLY complain is that recently it will lag and at times restart my system. Needs to be fixed before I buy anything extra.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish! I could not put it down! A cute weekend read! Highly recommend!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer, as usual, takes you on a wonderful ride with The Clfton Chronicles.  He has a great writing style and an ability to intertwine the beautiful characters he creates.  The reader gets to go on a magnificient journey.  I have a hard time putting his books down, yet I am so sorry when I finish each book.  I must always give myself a break from reading just to savor what I just read.  Thank You Jeffrey.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|I ordered this movie because it had Allan Alda in it , I had very little idea as to what the full story was about , and I found myself surprised. I am pleased that the dvd was in Exelent shape and arrived sooner than expected .Overall good experience in every way!  I plan to use use this source again !
B00007BH3Y|4.0|He has a very, very unique style that gets repetitive. In fact, that is an important element of his style combining rhythmic intricacies with repetitious harmonies. At least that is how I would describe it.<br /><br />Whenever I'm listening to my play list and anything from \\"The Hours\\" comes on I am always transported. However, I couldn't sit down and listen to the whole album at one shot and enjoy it like that.<br /><br />I've always felt that way about everything Mr. Glass does. Still, I love his music.

1400052173|5.0|This book is so riveting that you will find it so hard to put down; and you will attempt to read it in one sitting.<br /><br />This is the history of the HeLa cells....the first cancer cells that were able to be  kept growing outside of the human body. It provided the foundation for understanding the spread and growth of cancer cells. With them, new medicines and treatments were able to be developed because doctors finally had a common cancer base to test things on.<br /><br />This, above all, though, is the story and life of Henrietta Lacks, her legacy of 'immortal' cancer cells, her family and descendants and the legal ramifications of hospitals and doctors 'harvesting' cells for testing and then profiting from patients.<br /><br />This is a book that has to be read. Because it is important for anyone and everyone to understand how this woman and her manner  and cause of death allowed the medical industry to find a way for others to live longer and continue the fight against cancer. It is also a tale that resonates through the years because of the legal and moral aspects of this.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was so amazing it is very touching and explains that you have to treat others with respect an find out there true identity before judging them by rumors.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was surprised by the astounding plot and the many twists and turns of this novel. I did not want it to end!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game operates smoothly and has great graphics. I use the iPhone version of this game and it also works great. I would gladly pay for a version of this game with no ads, but the ads are not obtrusive and can be quickly dismissed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app helps me to see what the weather will be for the day at a touch. Future weather is questionable but no one can really predict the weather ahead of time. but this is updated when that day comes around and I can see it very easily without having to wait for the weather report on the TV.
B009OINFH4|4.0|Not what I'd call ground breaking but does a great job of bringing common sense ideas together in a way that can be used in everyday life.
0465011047|5.0|I read this book while visiting North Korea in 2012. I really enjoyed it and i couldnt put it down.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|They don't make like this anymore. No cheesy effects. Great dialogue. Great plot. Great all around. Reminds me of an old Steve McQueen film. Has a very real quality. Great film all around.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Just began to use this with a wireless for the speaker and the two built in mics for the audience. Sounds terrific! Amazingly clear and high quality sound. You could not do better that this product!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It is easy to use and access to most any book you want. I have used this app for awhile and found it a great resource.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|Of the four bands from the Big 4 show dvd- Anthrax to me stole the show! And for whatever reason- the band seems to be on high since then. The momentum trickles over to this gem of a cd Worship Music. I really can't say enough good things about it. It's nice to see Belladonna back in the line up- with all due respect to John Bush, Joe's voice defines what Anthrax is. Among the Living & Persistence of Time are two landmarks of the band- add this to that list of landmark recordings. Everything is top notch- songwriting- check, production- check, musicianship check- it's all there. Favorite tracks: \\"In The End\\" , \\"fight em' til you can't\\"...the whole cd just rocks.
0765350386|4.0|I guess I can understand why some people rated this book so low. It has a lot of the standard fantasy cliches and sometimes the plot is a bit of a stretch.  But this book is so well executed that I had no problem looking past many of the flaws.<br /><br />It was a fun and easy read. It had just enough novel themes and plots to make it feel fresh.  Also, (like most others have stated), the magic system is great.  It is simple but it has depth.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Found nothing in protagonist to like or dislike. None of the characters clicked with me. Never go involved. Not his best book.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I really enjoyed the tv show Smash, looking forward to seeing season 2 when it is available.  I use amazon instant video quite a bit.
B000Y90VO2|5.0|An all time Val Kilmer classic.. Hysterical and entertaining. Will highly recommend to anyone to watch who enjoys Val Kilmer or a classic comedy or anyone who wants to watch it again!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's  great because you can set numerous times and then just tap the time you want,  It's so convienient.  and I love the soft ring tones.<br />.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|It really surprised me how much i absolutely loved the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is a superstar and her academy award is well deserved and i cant wait to see more movies from her. Easily one of the best movies in the last few years and also great soundtrack as well!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This game is very good if you like something that keeps you busy but you don't want to think too much lol
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series ... period. There were a couple episodes that were a little boring,  but over all the season was great.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Common sense information that is understandable for couples to follow.  I feel this book will strengthen you marriage!  There is hope for couples having marital problems
B004QJGF46|5.0|Megamind is one of my family's favorite movies. Definitely recommended as a good family movie or just to add to your collection of great kid movies.
B00BQUUH7E|3.0|Got this for my kindle fire and didn't see any multiplayer option on the title screen. All it gave was single player  an  the options. Help
B006LSZECO|1.0|Knowing nothing about this book, I purchased it as a Book Club read. What a waste. I'll give the author credit for some clever writing, but that's about it. It was a total waste of money to purchase it (not available at library) and of time to read.
1600595871|4.0|A very comprehensive book .but not always easy to follow the diagrams,however iam sure iwill use it more when I become more proficient .
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|An odd man, horrible circumstances, hilarious happenings and characters! I would just laugh out loud at some of the writing. I loved the country Irish!!!<br /><br />It's a wonderful and believable story...well worth the time. Christina McKenna is a superb writer. I can't wait to read another story. Thanks go to husband for downloading it on my Kindle!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|For the most part, I liked this, but not as much as the first two.  This one was harder to follow.  It left some things unanswered.  Decent way to sum up such an awesome trilogy though.  Amazing visuals of battle scenes.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great fun fun for you and you and everyone who has been the most important thing in the world of games
1476715904|1.0|This boook is for pre teens. I was very disappointed with it and I think it should have said so somewhere on the cover.
0399226907|4.0|My grandkids loved this book and it's fun to read to them. A friend bought this because of Eric Carle's work and she's a retired Kindergarten teacher.
B000BNI90O|2.0|The CD's where great with the complete sound track. How ever the with the DVD some tracks would play and others would skip and others no music at all. I have order this set twice now and both times had problems with the DVD,so be careful when ordering this set. The DVD should be in a sleeve of it's own!!!!!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|stop. this app is bad just like this review.  you cant use it like you would expect. just don't download.
B009O07NDY|5.0|You get the complete sound track of the movie and some extra music,but not sure where they are suppose to be in<br />the movie,unless they are in the extended edition???
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was looking for a break from the grand space operas I've been reading lately and Wool fit the bill. Really enjoyed this book. The pacing was near perfect and I had a hard time putting it down. Highly recommend.
193700788X|1.0|I feel cheated out of a spectacular ending, it could have been so much more.  For all the years I've been reading, this book was such a let down.
0553801473|5.0|hoyt mcguyer<br /><br />This being &#34;the last&#34; book, I wish to say here and now, &#34;I want more!!!&#34;.<br />It took me 2 months to work my way through the first 4. I drug my feet on this one knowing the story ends here.<br />As far as I'm concerened, thats the only down side to the collection. It ends.
B0015AARJI|2.0|The joystick was Brocken and it had these wierd little spaz attacks where it would press a bunch of random buttons
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My husband and I saw them in concert a few nights ago and immediately bought the CD. They are truly inspiring. They are talented and love music and it shows. They have fun while playing and some of the mashes they come up with are amazing. Love them!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|One of the best apps ever. I completed it in 5 hours but this one isn't getting deleted. Hooray for Indies devs who don't use microtransactions!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love this from a guy's point of view.  It's hilarious ans so true.  You just can't beat a good love story.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|This movie is pure action cheese and I love it. Its over the top stupid and Arnie still has got it. I loved every minute of this piece of awesomeness!
B009NY43NY|2.0|This was by far one of the worst books I've read! And I read every day!  All of our favorite characters came back for a cameo but none of them were acting themselves!  There was no substance!  Stuff happened, and then the book ended!  I won't divulge spoilers but if I could have been spared reading this and just made up my own ending I would have been much happier.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My whole family is crazy about this app.  My kids (7 and 4) LOVE it!  Even the 4 year old really gets into it and is pretty good.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|dont ever get attached to a character from this series!!  you'll have your heart ripped out, stomped on, and mailed back to you in pieces if you do!  cant wait for the next installment!
B002OR0RP0|1.0|it took forever to download, seemed like a dumb pointless game, i took it off my device before my kids ever saw it....
B007PVHMCG|5.0|the kiddos love them.  It's nice for them to put the xbox controller down and do some good ole manual minecraft :)
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My kids love this app - I originally had the free app and the ads really annoyed them.  This solved that problem.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Very smooth interface and new take on fraction input. I reported a minor error in one button and developer replied back and fixed in a matter of minutes.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This app is perfect for playing the game - no issues there - but the ads are just so annoying and intrusive that I finally gave up and bought the ad free version.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Amazing game it put you in action just like the movie.  I love this<br />game and will continue to play to see where it takes me
B007EQGTX0|5.0|The 180gm vinyl has a pressing problem in which the last four tracks on side 2 periodically distort!!<br />I'm on my third pressing and the problem is still there. I contacted Dramatico and they gave me a free pressing saying it was good but it isn't.<br />Played this album at my local upmarket HIFI store - problem still there!! I'm quite devastated about this as most vinyl purists would know, how dare this happen to such a brilliant album??<br />Anyway, I still rate this LP 5 stars. How could you not? It really is that good. Katie's voice, orchestra and sound quality are simply mesmerising and I now listen to the last four tracks on CD (almost as good).<br />One can only hope these pressing issues will be sorted out on Katie's next album.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|The right words for the right times. Excellent words for business and to live by. I will read this multiple times.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I used these tips for conversations at business meetings, interviews and stressful times.  Good information on questions to ask others.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|We're all accustomed to &#34;goodie two-shoes&#34; Star Trek crews fixing problems all over the galaxy, but this is the journey of a &#34;newbie&#34; crew, pretty much untested, on a long mission into the truly unknown, trying to save Earth. Sure, they start out all &#34;nice-guy&#34; but pretty soon we see some of the darker side of humanity as the mission becomes more complex. I especially like how the mission morphs from merely saving Earth into something larger and even more meaningful.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works very well with my Kindle Fire. I have not had to use it very much, but completely satisfied with this product.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This book put secrets of success and happiness Into a new light.  I've learned to steer away from spirituality because of my belief in science.  This helped me understand a new way to be spiritual.  Laws of attraction make a lot of sense.
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|I know that if you can't say anything nice you shouldn't say anything at all. But... I loved the premise, but there are no instructions anywhere on how the game is played. How do you make the guy run? How do you make him fight? The character is cute, looks like a little Lego person, but on the match 3 part I couldn't tell what was what, because they look like little Lego accessories.<br /><br />Good try, A for effort, sorry, not keeping this game.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I started out on the series because of my love for the HBO show, but boy was I amazed how much better the books were. Don't get me wrong they practically took each of his books and made a script out of it (word-for-word,) so they still Rock. But of course compared to the indepth character stories in the books, my mind was so enthralled I couldn't read fast enough!! My most favorite part of his writing is that each chapter follows a different POV so you never get bored or have a hard time sticking with it. The worst part is they are so long. I'm a fast reader and it still took me 2-3 weeks each book. He does also take a VERY long time releasing the next book so anyone just starting on this series should remember that and not rush like me. But over all one the best and greatest series I ever read!!! I have character withdrawal I love this book series so much!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game and I love to pop bubbles.  I love all the colors and the helps are great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sometimes you just need to read something a little out of your normal genre of books and this would be it! I liked that the female lead was a strong, determined woman not afraid to stand up to anyone! A little more sci-if and violent than I'm used to but I loved the characters and story!! Good trilogy!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love to slice the fruit and this game makes me want to try and try again to get higher and higher scores.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can not get enough of Eva and Gideon!! Their love story and scorching hot scenes are just so enthralling I can never get enough! I have re-read this series 4 times already just waiting for the 3rd book to be released! I love how they are so relatable and the erotica isn't pushed to far to be uncomfortable!! HOT series that you do not want to miss especially if your a fan of 50 shades!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|After reading the previous 2 books in the series, this much anticipated sequal was a disappointment .<br />For the longest time, nothing happened. Then suddenly there is an interesting story and boom a sudden cliff- hanger so that you must buy the next book to find out what happened. I felt scammed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great romance book from Nicholas sparks. A little slow in the beginning and the darkness of it was kind of too dark for me. Overall I liked it as much as any other Sparks book. The ending was a surprise to me which made it so unexpected. One of the only books I can say is as good as the movie though!
020530902X|5.0|This book is a must for any writer, amateur or not. It is easy to understand and even if this book is small, it is jammed packed with useful information that will make us learn and improve our writing again and again.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another winner for Preston and Child, and I couldn't put it down once I got started.  As with any series involving a finite set of characters, some of the Pendergast adventures have been better than others - but this one had definite echoes of the first, thrilling trip into Pendergast-land, &#34;Relic.&#34;  Yeah, yeah - his physical prowess seems almost super-human and his mental abilities are often beyond belief as well - but when reading fiction, there are just certain things you have to accept to allow the author to tell his or her story.  The plot twists were amazing - Helen's rescue and demise, finding out Agent P has kids, and pulling in the ever-popular Nazi bad guy angle combined to make this book one of the best. A few small quibbles - and I'll try to write this so as not to be too much of a spoiler - include the fillial love exhibited during the crucial battle scene stretched even my ultra-willingness to suspend my disbelief.  Also, breaking up with someone with a LETTER???  Oh come on - that's just tasteless and cruel, and I really don't think Agent P would be that cowardly.  But those are small things - definitely a great, exciting story and one I would recommend to anyone who has followed this detective over the years.

1623420148|5.0|Oh wow...  I have so much to say about this book that I just don't know where to begin... I giggled and smiled through the entire book. Reading this from Drew's POV was very entertaining. It was an education for all of us ladies on what men really think and want.  Some of Drew's inner dialogue had me rolling my eyes, laughing out loud and sometimes thinking hey, that is spot on.  Whether we like it or not...  the truth is the truth right??<br /><br />Drew has the flu...  Why does he have the flu??  Well, this is why:<br /><br />\\"Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away.<br />We crawl.\\"  (from the mind of Drew)<br /><br /> Awe...  feeling sorry for him??  Well don't...  Drew is a womanizer and Drew did this to himself!<br /> But, it's a whole lot of fun watching this guy go to great lengths to win his woman back.  The things that these two do to each other might walk a fine line of ...  are you crazy??  Yep...  crazy for love.<br /><br />The following quote is one of my absolute favorites from this book.  One of Drew's friends is trying to help him get over his flu.  And, when you read it you have to do it out loud so you can practice your Scottish accent.  That makes it even funnier...  do it, do it, just do it!<br /><br />\\"In times like this, I always ask myself, \\"What would William Wallace do?\\"  His eyes are serious.  Stirring.  Then his voice takes on a Scottish accent he doesn't have.  \\"Aye...  run, and you won't get rejected... but years from now, would you be willin' to trade all the days from now to then for a chance - just one chance- to go back and tell Kate she can take your balls and hang them from the rearview mirror of her car, but she can never take...  your freedom!<br /><br /> So many great characters... so many great quotes... so many that it would take several pages to list them all out and you know, it would ruin the story if too many of them were revealed.<br /> The best way to read this book is part of a buddy read.  My friend and I are still laughing about this book and all of the quotes even a week later.  I keep going back and re-reading quotes and smiling.<br /><br /> I will reveal one more quote...  just because it's my other all time favorite and it is so true...  it really is...  more of Drew's wisdom that you can appreciate:<br /><br />\\"For God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break!\\"<br /><br />If you are a fan of books like Wallbanger and Beautiful Bastard... romances that require a sense of humor... then you really need to buy this book.

B00AKO93JK|1.0|Since I downloaded Daily workouts, I have yet to get the App to even load which stinks because I was super excited about it.
0385366752|1.0|Warning - this review contains a spoiler about the ending.<br /><br />Gosh, I really hated this book!  I really hated the characters, Nick is a dunce who turns into a sociopath, Amy is a brilliant spoiled rich sociopath, Margo (Go, Nick's sister) is vapish, Amy's parents are pretentious, rich, psychologists who lose their fortune and have to take back Amy's trust fund to bail themselves out. The only likable characters are Nick's poor Mom dying from cancer and Nick's poor Dad living with Alzheimers, who is also miserable, but it's the disease's fault.  Plus, this book is sooooo long! 19 hours!  The first half is just listening to Amy & Nick whine.  I only finished this because I needed to find out why everyone else thinks this book is so brilliant.  Obviously, I don't appreciate good fiction.  While, it turns into a psuedo-thriller with a few surprises, it's pretty predictable. The ending is horrible!  These 2 miscreant sociopaths should not be allowed to have a child!  That poor child will need therapy for it's entire life! All I can say is that I would not have finished this book if I was reading it, I endured it because I listened to it in my car, usually while in traffic.

B00006LPER|1.0|this is a masterpiece of boring inane junk posing as an existential treatise on love and sex. how anyone could find it remotely interesting is totally incomprehensible. don't waste your time.
1451673442|5.0|If you liked the 'Secret&#34; you will enjoy this, interesting day by day program, good insights, nice exercises (and they work)
193700788X|1.0|Wow. and not in a good way. This novel felt forced and choppy from beginning to end. Foreshadowing of Sam's strange behavior that never really morphed into anything remotely interesting. Actually, it felt like the author was forced at gunpoint to write this book, that she either didn't want to write it, or was not prepared to come up with any plausible material. The conclusion of the Eric/Sookie storyline was abysmal and completely unsatisfying. I think I will just pretend Harris never wrote this book at all.

B007ZXK08C|2.0|This is the first book I have read by Gillian Flynn and found it a hard read as the story kept swaping between Nick and Amys version of what happend, several times I was going to give up but I persisted hoping it would get better. Just when you think its getting interesting its the end and I have to say its the crappiest ending I have ever read. Maybe there is or will be a sequel to finish it!
B004RJMUJO|2.0|This is definitely not up to date. I have the full version on my iPod and it has way more features like STARFRUIT. I counted and there are like 5 missing blades! This is no way worth 99&cent;. Besides the missing features this app is pretty good. Runs fast on my kindle fire.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Wonderful movie, better than I had expected it to be.  The story was very moving, did not get bogged down in the typical hollywood melodrama, soapy tangents that so often destroy these type of movies. The acting by all was great. A good movie that reminds you what is important in life and not to draw conclusions by what you first see in  people.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|This is my first wireless connection to transfer memory to my iPad, and I was intrigued to try it out.<br /><br />First of all, I want to focus on what you do to set this up.<br />1) You charge it. :-) Easy - it has a USB charging cord - pretty standard<br />2) You download the App from the App Store (I am using an iPad in this case)<br />3) You turn it on (even if it is still charging), and connect your iPad or phone to the device.<br />4) You go into settings in the device and set it up on your local WiFi. It now acts as its own WiFi repeater so that you can both access it and the internet concurrently.<br />5) You insert a flash drive or SD card (it has an adapter for a mini), and you can access the SD Card or Flash Drive. You go through the menu and access the items.<br /><br />So if you wish to carry movies or photos, you can carry them on an SD card and not store them directly on your tablet or phone.<br /><br />It will also act as a battery backup in case you need \\"just a bit more power.\\"<br /><br />That is all in the directions.<br /><br />Here are some points that are not included:<br /><br />I have been able to open Word, PDF and photos off of the SD card.<br /><br />It claims you can transfer files between an SD card and Flash Drive, but gives no documentation on how to do it.<br /><br />Since it creates its own hotspot, you can access your files using WiFi instead of bluetooth giving a much faster connection.<br /><br />I have also been able to save each of these documents to my iPad using the \\"open in\\" feature and opening them in the application that can support them. In my case, I have \\"Pages\\" and \\"Adobe Reader.\\"<br /><br />What I can't do is the reverse. This is intended strictly as a READER when it comes to your mobile devices, at least for IOS devices.<br /><br />I am giving it four stars, because it is a wonderful device and allows you to access SD cards directly from your device. However, the lack of instructions on the software and the fact it does not allow a save from the mobile device makes this just a bit short of perfection.<br /><br />Very interesting ... I wonder where technology will take us next!es not allow a save from the mobile device makes this just a bit short of perfection.<br /><br />Very interesting ...

1932100660|5.0|We are what we eat.  An apple a day... etc... clearly the 'idea' of eating well permeates our culture.  But generally speaking people are confussed about what are the good foods.  Perhaps this is by due to pure happenstance.  Or perhaps,  there are forces out there that want to create confusion so that they can grab a bigger piece of the FOOD market.  The omnipresent confusion that carbs are BAD leads people to eat more animal products?  Hmmm.... I wonder what subset of the food industry might have planted such thoughts into our collective psyche?<br /><br />In this monumental work, T Colin Campbell examines the possible consequences of our food choices.  And the implication is quite simple:  We make the most important decision about our health and well being THREE times a day.  People might go to the doctor once or twice a year... but they eat on average 1000 times per year.  I wonder where we REALLY should be putting our money!<br /><br />So, since what we put in our body is the probably most important decision we make 1,000 times a year, don't we owe it to ourselves (and to our families) to make an INFORMED decision?<br /><br />Read this book.  It rules out geneitic considerations by looking at a largely homogenous population.  In the end, it doesn't paint a pretty picture for the animal agriculture industries, and this is something people are deeply invested in psychically and monetarily.  Consequently, there is not nearly as much PUSH to follow Cambels suggestions in our culture, in our schools, in our politics.  What a shame!  Another case of an inconvenient truth.<br /><br />It is one of the most relevant and monumenat pieces of non-fiction centered around the most important topic facing ALL of us daily.  \\"What to eat\\".  Read it and join the discussion.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This my first Nelson DeMille book and I intend to read the rest of his novels. The characters are well developed. The primary character, John Corey is his best character. He is arrogant. He is funny with his sarcasm but very likeable. The other characters, including the minor ones, are defined enough to feel like you know them.<br /><br />First of all, the setting of this book is an area I am familiar with since I have friends there. DeMille describes a very charming section of east Long Island. As readers, we receive an interesting, accurate portrayal of the quaint beach villages, the local flavor, and the snooty wine growers. DeMille also gives the reader a dose of the history of the area describing the early times when pirates landed on its shores. The storyline, which deals with the murder of two employees of Plum Island, where work is done with hazardous biological materials, including anthrax, under the US Department of Agriculture.<br /><br />I only fault I found was with DeMille's decision to let Corey figure out who the criminal was midway through the book and then spending the rest of the book showing how he gets this person. It would have been nice if he threw in a plot twist to shake things up and add some suspense, but it's a good book. That is why I only gave it four stars but it is definitely worth reading.
141694737X|5.0|Maybe not the best pick for the destructive types, as it has lots of flaps and pulls to tear, but it is still a wonderfully fun book for little kids!
B001EN71CW|4.0|Love the show and the series is pleasantly priced! Now I can watch the entire series at my leisure and take my time to enjoy the characters! Fell in love with the show after seeing the movie Serenity.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|This is a very fun game, but it kept pausing itself. The pausing got too much to deal with eventually.
B00CTT9646|5.0|People are over analyzing &#34;the science&#34; and comparing it to the old way to harshly. I have been watching Star Trek since the original airing in the '60s. It is a good sci-fi, action film that is well made. If you want to analyze it and compare it start with this... It is a different timeline and all the characters lives were shaped differently and everything else, from Starfleet to the Klingons is different. THERE IS NO COMPARISON. Science dictates that in an alternate timeline different choices would be made thereby changing that reality and thus affecting everything in it. Look at it with a fresh prospective and enjoy it.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Am happy with Fraction Calculator. It would be nice if it also works with decimal points. Anyway am happy with it.

B00BI73CVI|3.0|This movie was OK, but I think the 1998 version was much better (a lot less singing and better acting).

B00CATSONE|5.0|The book on Nikola Tesla was indeed a wonderful read! I have been looking for more information about Tesla and his experiments, and got much more than I thought would be in the book, it was a GREAT read! Very easy to get through, engaging, informative, and very much what I was looking for regarding this subject. It made me feel terrible that he never got the full recognition that he deserved, but I was so glad to read about him tearing up his royalty contract with Westinghouse, just another example of how civic-minded, unselfish, and fair Tesla was. This short book offered some amazing insights into the life, struggles, and times in which he lived. It kind of reminded me of the Scripture, \\"A prophet is never welcome in his own town\\" (or time in Tesla's case!) I wish he had been able to obtain the support he deserved in his lifetime, but the real lesson of the book is that we should never stop believing in our dreams. The author is to be commended for offering this engaging read for free, just like Tesla offered his ideas to mankind, read this book!<br />Steve Lucasi
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|I generally enjoy Matching games that give rewards but this game is terrible. The \\"retro\\" graphics look like they were created by a four-year-old and I didn't even figure out what many of them were meant to be. I downloaded it as a FAOTD , but even free was too much for this waste of time and space. Why would anyone actually pay for it? I gave it two stars because I think it works as intended.<br /><br />For a really decent, retro matching game, try War Games WOPR. I also enjoyed Wonderlines, in which you journey to the next stage, and Heroes of Kalevala, in which you win coins to buy dwellings and artifacts to build villages. With all of these, I played until I made achieved all the goals.

B0045HCJT4|4.0|This movie is from 1998 and stars Kurt Russell. It's also rated R. It's an action movie about Galactic warriors who become outdated and are replaced by 'superior' fighters.

B001DDBCUA|5.0|I met this dynamic foursome of ladies in re-runs and it took me a while to get past the 'male bashing' of my first impressions. By the time this movie came out I couldn't wait to see 'the girls' again and rushed to the theatre with a girl friend, of course. It met all expectations and more! The story lines of the series carried through and the characters stayed true to their original incarnations. A must-see . . . I can't imagine who hasn't already seen it, but, if by chance someone didn't watch the HBO series, un-cut and real, they may not quite grasp the appeal of the movie. Excellent supporting cast too. Just have to say I'm a country girl who lives in jeans but Sex and the City made a fashionista out of me!

B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Huge LOTR fan, and I loved The Hobbit. However I am disappointed with the Blu-Ray 3D release. I have an LG Cinema 3D TV and have been thrilled with it's performance. The 3D has pretty much been flawless. Not with this release though. This is the first movie I watched in 3D that I had to stop for a few because it made my eyes hurt. Whenever there is too much action onscreen the images separate or blur. Lots of \\"ghosting\\".  Terrible way to release such a great movie.  When the 3D is better on Resident Evil than on The Hobbit, something is wrong.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|I do love to zone out playing this game. Problem is, it crashes most of the time when I try to use the lightning hammer or bomb. I'm going to take a break from the current version and wait for the next to see if it still crashes.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I Was lucky enough to find the Wheel of Time series a few years back at age 35, and I only had to wait a year for the final novel to be written and released.  My heart aches for you loyal followers who patiently waited through the decades.  That said, I have a  counter to the negative reviews here on Amazon.  First, the idea that you would purchase this book without reading its predecessors is ridiculous, which means that any readers of this book are already familiar with the story.  When I read negative reviews of this final chapter in the saga, I believe they are a freudian projection of your feelings about your life.  I pity the people who cannot immerse themselves in this story so utterly that (based upon their words) they must read each line and then run it through a personal approval filter.<br /><br />&#34;She wouldn't have said it that way&#34;  -  &#34;You forgot to mention this tidbit&#34;  -  &#34;It would have been a better line if...&#34;  etc.<br /><br />This book is the conclusion of an epic journey that only the heartless could read and not be moved to tears in a few spots.  If you look at life through the lens of judgement, and can find fault in all things, then you will find fault in this book as well.  If you read Wheel of Time because honor and magic and adventure are three of your heartstrings, then your biggest regret when you finish will be not having read it more slowly.<br /><br />It is an excellent ending to the third age, and I think Mr. Jordan would be satisfied, even proud.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is really cute and entertaining.  It has an awesome cast who all play really interesting characters.  I can't imagine why someone wouldn't like this movie.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|Argo was a mediocre movie.  I walked away thinking it was decent but I still couldn't understand how it won an academy award.  I think there were much more deserving flicks.  I would have liked it better had they focused more on character development of the hostages.

1451695195|1.0|I gave up reading this book, before even reaching the end and tried to skim faster trough the parts which discusses the earth life part.<br />It is badly written. Instead of paying attention to what exactly happened to him when he was out of his body, he is paying attention to what was happening  or what had happened in earth. I would say 15% of this book is about the other dimensions r heaven and the rest are just his personal life and random stuff on earth !!! All the information about his phenomenon experience could have been summarized in maximum 5 pages. There are way better books out there - real, story or fantasy - which at least have some thing to say about the after life. One of the reason he himself got so much attention along with his book is probably that he is a neurosurgeon. I do not recommend this book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is more than a simple hidden object game like so many adventure games are today.  This game actually requires you to find artifacts needed to solve puzzles in other areas.

1609981804|4.0|This book is not a great literary work, but it is entertaining and well-crafted. The audiobook reader, Tony Britton, did an exceptional job portraying the different characters.<br /><br />I ripped these CDs into ITunes and downloaded them to my iPod Nano so I could listen during my walks. There were at least a dozen places where the tracks skipped or looped, although these never lasted more than a minute or two. I never experience similar skips or loops when I rip my music CDs into iTunes.

Franky is a very nice dog, it remains my own dog George. He likes to play and bark. It is friendly and nice. I watched this movie on 3d, and is so great, emotionally and divine. Your kids and friends would love it. Get it now. It has the Disney firm, and it deserves to be part of the Disney legacy forever.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This is not an easy read, however it was wonderful to read what she went through. Reading it and &#34;seeing it&#34; through her eyes was amazing. Well worth the read.
B003PAXONC|5.0|you probably know that this movie is 5 stars, the acting and performance are really good. The Ultimate collector's editon is really something you need to get, it contains pictures of the film and some collectibles.  So do not hesitate to get it. If you have the standard versión of the blu ray, let me tell you that you have nothing, so just get it before becomes to expensive.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books, however this is completely different for her. It's not terrible just different.
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|If you try to compare this film with toy story, you can see a huge gap between them. Toy story is a classic even part 2 and 3, but this one doesn't deserves to be part of Disney's productions. I mean, quality is good, 3d efects are fine, but the story itself is pretty poor in terms of action and friendship, I do not want to tell you more, because probably you think that I am getting a different information about the film, but you know, an adult that is a friend of a girl seems to me weird and the way in which he sees her, make me feels a Little bit unconfortable. I know probably I am so purintan and I got the wrong idea about the film...however, the film brings back some nostalgic memories about old video games and that is a good point in favor. Oh, I forgot to tell you that some people got sleep during the presentation, and kids obviously started to play and ran.  So, Disney has to be supervised by the old men and women that use to write, paint, and create fimls like cinderella, sleeping beauty and so on in order to have a future success. I read other comments about this film and I do not understand why I do not like the way in which Ralph has a relationship with the Little girl, there is a scene in which she invited him to her cave (or something like that) or place, and well, she is Little girl and he is an adult, probably I have to think that he is her father or uncle because our society make us to pollute our maind and sometimes things make us to have the wrong idea. Anyway, still is a cartoon and the 3d version of the film is just fine.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Read the book and saw the movie, I hate that they do not keep it completely the same.  The book is ok but not great.
B00BQI4AU6|1.0|I had high expectations for the solo debut from the singer of Cinderella. After all, they were one of the least trashy of the 80's hair metal period. They showed a definite Stones and AC/DC influence, so you got the impression that their association with the Poisons & Warrants of the world had more to do with hair, clothes, and marketing than actual music. A solo album from the singer/lead guitarist? I imagined either a stripped down acoustic blues thing, or maybe a more \\"sensitive guy\\" singer/songwriter showcase with Beatle-influeced tunes that didn't sit right with the old crew. Should be at least a 3-star affair, right?<br /><br />But then came the actual album... and it's a mess. It has little in common with Cinderella's classic rock. This sounds more like a man trying to sneak into the mainstream via some Nashville/American Idol backdoor or something. Does it really sound like country? No, but 90% of \\"country music\\" these days doesn't either. So, stylistically, the album's kind of a baffler. Even when Keif does try to rock, it sounds forced and affected; like he's throwing a bone to the old fans. The production's crappy, too. It sounds like it was pieced together in ProTools hell; no reverb or sonic depth. You just have everything trying to slap you at once. Also, can we turn down the female background singers a bit?<br /><br />But all of this might be forgivable if the songs were there. You know, at the end of the day it's OK for a dude to chase a paycheck; just make sure you got some memorable hooks. But he doesn't. In fact, he sounds like he has songwriter amnesia. Seriously, a lot of choruses and verses that don't seem to belong together. I expect more from the man who wrote \\"Gypsy Road\\". Hell, I'd expect more from a hack like Bret Michaels- at least he'll put you on his reality show before he bones you!<br /><br />The bottom line is disappointment. Save your cheddar for something better.
1594484805|4.0|As I began to read this very interesting and intriguing book, I realized that I had to forget everything I thought I knew about how to motivate people--at work, at school, or at home. As Daniel Pink explains in this paradigm-shattering text, the secret to high performance and even satisfaction is the human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. In other words, according to Pink, people are best motivated not by the old, supposedly reliable carrot-and-stick incentives but by \\"intrinsic motivation,\\" wherein the performance of the task is its own reward...when work doesn't feel like work.<br /><br />Based on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In this book, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:<br /><br />*Autonomy--the desire to direct our own lives<br />*Mastery--the urge to get better and better at something that matters<br />*Purpose--the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves<br /><br />All through the book he describes companies that are employing new approaches to motivation and he introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are taking us down a new road.<br /><br />The third section of the book is a toolkit which has the dual purpose of providing specific ways to implement the principles in the book in a real life setting -- everything from educating your children to managing your exercise schedule.<br /><br />It is difficult to think about a world void of crude incentives. Some may think his assertions are simple or utopian in nature. However, I think this book is full of big ideas that are applicable to the business world, the healthcare world, the educational arena,and even our personal lives. It is a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys thinking outside of the box and wants to make the world a better place.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and I do recommend it unless you get offended by the F and C words. It's a fun read!

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game kept me up all night! I couldn't put it down! I soul recommend it to everyone! A little creepy on the story line but worth the money! I will be playing it again!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm sad that it is over. It's been a fun journey and I enjoyed it all. I wish there was more.
B003ZHVJFK|5.0|First of all I would like to say that this is one of the best KOMBAT movies I missed watching for quite a long time. TEKKEN has all the brutal fights that makes the gladiators more exhilarating. I purchased this dvd in a blockbuster close-out sale for just $2.50 and boy I'm so lucky that I bought the last copy. After I watched this movie, I told myself that this was the best choice I made out of a thousand used dvd's. WHAT A GREAT DEAL!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great fun bingo and slot game! Has a fun daily tournament and good pay outs! Highly recommended this game as way to pass the time!! Just wish u could trade coins for bingo coins would love to play more bingo.
0140557741|4.0|Provides a hands-on activity for educational presentations.  Can be used to illustrate several points.  The only problem I had with it was the fact that the instructions and ideas did not come with the books.  I had to find them online.  Should have ways to use, instructions with the books.
0425263916|5.0|This sequel had me on a roller coaster of ups and downs! I was just as enthralled as I was with the first book. This one had me holding my breath at times, yelling at Gideon as well as Eva and falling hard for Gideon all over again! Thank goodness the next one is due out in less than 2 weeks!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Game graphics and puzzles were great however, it's a VERY short playing experience. After reading a lot of reviews I figured I would spend the money and give it a try. I finished after playing a little over an hour.<br /><br />The $1.99 price made me think there would be more.... Overall, I loved the gameplay I just wish there was more of it!
B00000IL1K|5.0|Beautiful voice and great range.  I liked the music on this CD and often play it over and over again.
B00902S0IS|5.0|My favorite classic sci-fi movie. Amazing considering the 1956 technology used to make it. Unlike today the movie isn't dominated by computer graphics and has lots of actual acting as a major strength of the production.
0061990477|5.0|If you've seen the movie, you picture Richard Chamberlin as Ralph.  Outback frontier life is similar in hardships to US frontier life.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This is the third in this series, and if you are hooked on the series, as I am, this book will further satisfy your addiction.  The characters remain compelling.  Unfortunately there is more politics, fighting and senseless cruelty, and less character development as found in the first two books.  This gets a bit tedious at times.  But each chapter ends with you wanting to go on to find out what happens.
076115678X|5.0|My beautician told me about this book for curly hair and how to tame and love your curls. It's great it gives you wonderful tips on putting moisture back in your curls. Tips on stop using shampoo which damages curly hair and learning how to use condition as a wash instead of shampoo. I have seen the difference in by curls and would recommend this book for all types of curly hair.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As always, Archer is an engaging story teller. I couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I like it a lot. But it would be a thousand times better if the story or outcome of the missions change according to what objects you manifest.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I wish I could zoom in a bit more. Also wish for more puzzles and less HO scenes. Overall though, well executed game.
0783225970|3.0|I bought this movie to replace my movie that turned up missing, however....it's not the same edition.....I was looking for the one in the SILVER AND BLACK CASE as opposed to the WHITE AND BLACK CASE
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I find it so interesting on how quick I was able to point out which love language each family member and friend of mine had.  It makes it so much more easy to understand and communitcate with them better.  I'm glad to see that all of us are so different in the body of Christ but that those differences make us &#34;one&#34; and it's really a great thing:)  This book makes you look at each and every relationship different and makes you more open to other peoples heart.  Loved it!!!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Really love it. Love the suspense, the story,,,  I couldn't put it down!!! I hope it continues like this. Waiting for more
1594746168|4.0|I got a copy of this book to review from Quirk Books in exchange for an honest review.  It was a very creative and well done fictional biography of Dr. Spencer Black.  The drawings in it are fantastic and the story itself comes off as absolutely believable, fascinating, and disturbing.<br /><br />This book is actually two books in one.  The first book is called The Life and Writings of Dr. Spencer Black.  This is a biography of the fictional Dr. Spencer Black.  It starts with his childhood as the son of a brilliant surgeon, proceeds to tell of his own early successes as a surgeon, and then finishes with his increasingly disturbing ravings and experiments.  The second book is The Codex Extinct Animalia.  This book covers Dr. Black's notes of various fantastic species and includes incredibly detailed diagrams of their musculature and bone structure.<br /><br />This is a very well put together book.  The quality is amazing, the pages are thick and high quality, the drawings within are amazingly detailed.<br /><br />This book reads as an incredibly convincing biography of Dr. Black.  Dr. Black starts out on a quest to cure human deformities.  This story is told from a narrator's perspective but also includes large sections of excerpts from Dr. Black's journal.  It is a fascinating story that is fairly believable.<br /><br />I was impressed that the author comes up with a very reasonable theory on why Dr.  Black descends into to the madness he does.  It is an absolutely engaging and very persuasive argument for the theory of human evolution.  Of course the whole thing has a bit of a fantasy twist to it.  The book also gets fairly disturbing as Dr. Black descends into madness and reminds a bit of The Island of Dr. Moreau.<br /><br />The Codex Extinct Animalia has brief, yet well done, summaries of the various fantastic animals Dr. Black supposedly found.  The drawings are stunningly detailed and beautiful.  The diagrams of bone and muscle just as intricate with scientific naming of all of the bones and muscles included.<br /><br />Overall this was a fascinating and unique book.  I enjoyed the story of Dr. Black and found it to be engaging and engrossing.  The Codex was full of amazingly detailed drawings that were fascinating to look at.  This book is one of those wonderful curiosities and would make an excellent coffee table book.  I will definitely be checking out future works by Hudspeth.naming of all of the bones and muscles included.<br /><br />Overall this was a fascinating and unique book.

B003MC5N28|5.0|it was really good I would definitely recommend this book very well written it was weird but good so good
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Lots of battlel, blood, raping, pillaging, etc.  Gotta keep the masses watching.  I would enjoy more true historical info.  This show has gotten me to research more about what the Vikings were about so I guess thats a good thing.  Regardless of how hisotrically accurate this show is the story about Power and vying for power is good.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Story line could use more dialog but great game need to make clues harder to get to so now I guess the rats can take over since they can swim interesting ending
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I can understand what they were trying to do here but nothing ever made any sense. Having big name stars and a crappy script does sell and this movie is proof positive of that. Please know that I look for the best in any movie but this one just does not deliver anything. Save your money.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|its so big, but i like it.<br />by the way, its thick and its belt isnot leather.<br />invicta is your almost good choice
B008XKSW7M|3.0|There were some funny parts of this but I'm glad it was free on amazon prime.  I would not have paid extra to watch it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nothing bad to say about it! awesome app.. if your looking for a great app for solitaire,  don't look any farther you have one right here :)
B009IUH1N2|2.0|I guess I don't get the fun with this game, or I'm too impatient to learn the controls properly.<br />Super mario brothers on speed. Just jump and sprint over obstacles before you fall in pits or get caught by the moving screen. eh.
B005D5FK02|4.0|This is a totally unique and thouroughly entertaining story. Visit future ancient Bangkok after the collapse of a society that grew fat on abundant energy and food supplies. Follow a sexy post human on a heroic journey and discover a hidden treasure. Well written both in narrative and dialog. A great read.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Eric does an album that is out of his normal comfort zone but does so with some of his buddies. Easy to listen to. He doesw not stay in the accousical rock and roll or blues but heads out into the folk genre as well.
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|This is a lost gem.  I'm glad Jeff Lynne decided to release it again.  While the 2 cover versions in this album are nothing really special (he did a far better job with covers his new album Long Wave), the original material is fantastic.  Now Your Gone is masterpiece and a song a really like - I understand that Jeff came up with this one after going to a Ravi Shankar concert with George Harrison.  New bonus track Forecast is really nice and has that heavy beautiful Lynne production.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I saw the movie in at the theater, but  bought the DVD because I knew my husband could not sit through the entire movie.  We spend a perfect rainy Sunday watching this great film.  Can't wait until part II is released.
B000005AYL|3.0|Great album, but the album packaging isn't what you see in the picture. It's a black label album, which means it's a simple black jacket with a sticker with that the picture on it and a list of the songs. Makes me wonder how this got printed. Plays great, great turn around in receiving and hey, it was only $6. Erykah's awesome regardless.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As always Baldaccis ability to entertain is superb. I always feel like Im watching a movie. A fast paced novel, this is a good read if you like character sagas and look to be immersed in the story while you  read. I now feel like I know Robie,I look forward to hi  next novel.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Incredible movie, great music, great story, I cried a couple times through it but man is it ever long. I didn't think it was ever going to end.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great series... really enjoying it.  Love the characters, especially Felicia... she is great!  I will keep watching to get caught up to the present!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works like most Solitaire games I have played - nothing fancy, just an enjoyable game. Has ads but I have no problem with that - the game is free so they have to make money somehow.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hate the ending to season 3 but love love love Downton Abbey!  I can't wait for Season 4!  Loved Thomas' story line!
B000002OVJ|5.0|This is the Who! Live, raw, talented beyond belief.In 1970 they were unbeatable. If anyone wonders why they were considered a super group, here's your answer. Moon's drumming is way over the top. Some of the best he ever had recorded.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun in all but sometimes is really boring and dull and there ate to many adds about buying games
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz can do no wrong, but this one is a master from the master! Memphis is one that you can put on and listen to all day. It's like a pair of comfortable old shoes, you say to yourself, awww yes, there he is again, where ya been Boz? This is the old Boz we've been missing for so long! Corrina, Corrina , Rainy Night in Georgia, Love on a Two Way Street, these are all songs you can put in your cd changer and just leave there, because they are classics you want to listen to and share with friends...sit back and have a brew or glass of wine with and enjoy! KUDOS Boz!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pocket edition. It is great. This is my favorite app everrrrrr!! I play it like 24/7.I am serious. It is great. So worth the money :) :) :) :) :)
B00B23O96A|1.0|Sorry but I just can't get into this one, it is an old sock! Don't quite understand this one, maybe I need to listen another time or two, when I get the time.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I chose it because someone told me it was a very good movie.  It was an adult movie and that is a fact that I like very much.  It told an excellent story.  ie: &#34;A Beautiful Mind&#34;.<br />It had perfect casting.  Each person was excellent in their role.<br />I wish they made more movies like that,
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie, a great movie for the whole family. I hope this helps all to watch movie. I loved it
B003Y5H574|5.0|Hilarious movie. Great for a night at home when you want a good laugh or a date night with your honey.
B00992CF6W|5.0|even though this game is 6dollars it is so worth it I mean its awesome! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! who could not Ps people who don't like this game totally have a promblem
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I liked this book better than previous from the author.<br /><br />Story was faster and with far more action! Looking forward 2nd part....
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is one of my favorite writers. This series is no different, never know where the next twist or turn will be. Can't wait for his next project.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Haven't used it with any other game yet, ordered it last minute in time for the weekend so I could better play Monster Hunter. Was super happy it shipped via Prime, rather than having to order it from Nintendo.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|I must say the first movie with Tom Cruise I thought was very boring. I didn't read the books and they may be better but for me this one is a big no. Long drawn out scenes, conversations that are plain blahhh and too much Tom Cruise in the character which doesn't fit here.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|it monitors the battery but agrevates the Crap out of me by popping up at inopertune times during use while charging
B006RXQ3T6|5.0|I see many reviews complaining about how the picture looks and what is edited and what not, but I have only one thing to say: This is Roger Rabbit and it is just plain fun!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the best game i have ever played so other people should play it too so they can have as much fun as I'm getting
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|The movie promotes homosexuality, denigrates capitalism, blames oil companies and industrial companies as being the cause of all mankind's woes all the while taking not so veiled shots at religion and conservatism by equating same to slave holding and abuse of every imaginable kind.  I thought by the description that this movie would be an intricate and entertaining tale of science fiction.  Hanks et al have very likely gotten the last of my money and certainly no more of my time or attention....but that's just me..and I'm ok with that!!!  A poor B movie at best!!!  Waste of money and time...
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I was playing trying to get 1000 points thinking I was going to get something cool, but I was just rewarded with a FREE AD!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Landay does a nice job of keeping the reader interested in the outcomes.  Chapter by chapter he keeps one focused on links between characters and events.  The story gives you a lot of moral issues to ponder and consider.  Worth reading.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I suspect that the story may be true, but it is very graphic and quite depressing.  I was not able to finish the book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Let's face it, you either like the movie or you don't.  The video is of great quality and it's a bonus having all the different copies together.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|This is a very smooth read, great for le Carre novices. It is not an all time classic of his, but he displays what makes him great. He has adapted his stories to modern issues very nicely in newer books and this is no exception.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great story, well written, great humour, very captivating.  Fascinating, great science, lovable characters. I really enjoyed reading this. 10 fingers up.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Who knew that this little app could help calculate script revision page counts on the fly.  We measure each inch of a page in 1/8th of a page so trying to figure out the page count without the scheduling software in a matter of minutes is frustrating.  Thanks for making my day easier!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Maybe I went into this book with too great an expectation, but I found this book to be both depressing and unrealistic.  I probably heard too many over the top reviews; that may have been the problem!?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an avid reader and I was pleasantly surprised to find this book to be as good as it is. It is very well written, creative and left me yearning for more.  I will definitely be looking for more to read by Hugh Howey.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I must say I had my doubts about this book in the beginning. It was quite tedious but then the action appeared. I found myself truly loving and hating the characters at different times while reading. It definitely became intriguing in the middle.<br /><br />I don't like the way it ended. I hate feeling like I've been left hanging.
0316776963|4.0|Entertaining stories of a man who is from a different school of thought then most of the world.  His dad eats old leather shoes, can you blame him for being a little different?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Nature or nurture...what is the greatest influence on a child?  I never had children and am forever in awe watching my friends through the years who perhaps have one child who grows into well-adjusted adulthood and another who is has major life adjustment issues (maybe even criminal) as an adult.  The parents are constantly questioning themselves...&#34;Where did he/she learn that bad behavior? They were both raised by us.&#34;  Clearly the answers are complicated.  Thought provoking novel and a real page turner...
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|really liked the movie. good love story. like josh know hin<br />m from jas vegas series drt real guys a worg miniun
B0018QQQK8|5.0|anything that Nicholas Sparks writes is great reading.  He is my favorite author and I try to read anything that he writes
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was a great movie, just added so much more to the seares. left the end open so more could be on the way. great filming of the land where it was filmed. good effects, good story, great actors
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Really good game. I've only been through the first 3 Time periods but it has been doable and enjoyable. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't completely wow me and get me addicted to where I couldn't put it down.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000IDEQTK A Good Woman]] A lovely surprise ending to this movie.  There is  more than  one love story in this movie.  Love belongs to all who are willing to trust, for the young as well as the more mature.  Happy viewing.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie contains real Navy Seal Team members as the actors portrayed in a &#34;based on true accounts&#34; storyline. It commemorates those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom and is loaded with non-stop action! You will come away with a better understanding of the relentless duty taken by our nation's best to keep our borders secure.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|Huh?  All I could do was sit with my wife and try and understand what the movie was trying to say.  The characters are unique and the acting is superb, but the story is a jumbled mess.  It's far too slow, and the implied importance of every minute detail is exhausting.  There is just no clear story or plot.<br /><br />I love art house films but this was one I can easily say you'll want to see once, but you won't care about watching it a second time.
B000000OEI|4.0|The CD, I must admit, was in excellent condition, BUT the CD inserts looked as though water or some sort of liquid seeped in and made it to where I couldn't view the cover insert; very disheartening. Overall I was please with the purchase simply because of the quality of the CD, but next time don't put &#34;Like New&#34; if the overall package isn't as so. Thanks.
B00258SS72|5.0|I use this in my class to show clustering of ethnicities in cities, the decomposition of the industrial city in Detroit, and just general prejudicial thoughts and ideas.  I love this movie with all my heart, and my students absolutely love it too!
B004KBSQOW|3.0|I thought that this rendition o f&#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; was the one with &#34;What A Wonderful World&#34; as part of composition - it's not and so I had to order another DVD - Facing Future - with preferred song combo.  Despite disappointment, this is a good recording.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|This movie looks great from the DVD the bluray looks much cleaner n sharper I would say own it on bluray u will be happy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|TEMLLE RUN 2 is so much better than the first! It is much more interesting and once you start playing... I guarantee you will not be able to put it down!
0316228532|2.0|I read about 40% of the book, and it was plain boring.  There are lots of characters, they do various things, and all this does not connect to a single plot.  Maybe the book would be more interesting later, but I don't want to waste hours reading a boring stuff.
B008EKMB82|4.0|I couldn't really say enough in praise of this extraordinary vision of time and its folding relationship between past and present, but I will admit that a restaurant (as described) that works hard to &#34;refine the palettes of their Campbell River neighbors&#34; is one that's more familiar with the art of painting than the art of food. Does the copy editor not know the difference between &#34;palette&#34; and &#34;palate&#34;?<br /><br />And while the tech guys and gals are extremely clever to engineer a jump to a footnote that's almost automatic (cursor up to the line with the footnote and it usually lands Right On the Footnote rather than at the head or foot of the line - remarkable!), why are the Roman renderings of kanji (Japanese) characters 1/4 the size of the main text and, if a letter with a diacritical mark is included (for example, the &auml; in Obachama - except the &#34;a&#34; should have a straight line above it rather than an umlaut - it doesn't seem to exist in my letter sets), that letter is 1/4 the size of the other letters in the word. That's consistent in the text and in the footnotes. Bummer!<br /><br />I tried increasing the size of the text, but the weird smaller-sized lettering persisted no matter the general text size.<br /><br />Still, I'm not giving up on this free-flowing representation of a teenage Japanese girl with a suicidal father (at times herself suicidal, but not really) who's writing about her experiences in a down economy - at least for her family - and the writer on the coast of Canada who's found the teen's diary in a zip-lock bag on the shore, an apparent piece of flotsam after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.<br /><br />The &#34;palette&#34; vs. &#34;palate&#34; question would usually be enough for me to immediately say &#34;Feh!&#34; and return the book for credit, but I'm giving this one more of a chance.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|hill climb racing is amazing. my friend had it on his ipod and I player it a lot. now its on aneroid I'm so happy.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Enjoyable read.  I liked the way that the author developed the story and plots.  I am looking forward to her next book.
B0006LZPLM|5.0|Keen shoes are great for hiking and boating.  The stitching at heel does give way after extended wear, but this is the third pair bought.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|For the most part I'm not a fan of \\"live\\" CDs but in Bob Seger's case I actually prefer his two live efforts over his studio releases. It often seems that all of the praise is aimed at the excellent [[ASIN:B004VMX5ZK Live Bullet]] to the exclusion of \\"Nine Tonight\\".  However if you're like me then you became familiar with Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band through the hits from the trio of blockbuster LPs: [[ASIN:B000038A23 Night Moves]], [[ASIN:B00005OAE6 Stranger in Town]] and [[ASIN:B00009QGDD Against the Wind]]. Those three albums contain the majority of Seger's commercial hits and just about all of them are captured in high energy performances on \\"Nine Tonight\\", Seger's 2nd live set and the one I find myself listening to more often.<br /><br />Again, just about all of the hits are here:<br />From \\"Night Moves\\" - Mainstreet, Rock And Roll Never Forgets, The Fire Down Below, and the title track.<br />From \\"Stranger In Town\\" - Hollywood Nights, Old Time Rock & Roll, We've Got Tonight, and Feel Like a Number.<br />From \\"Against the Wind\\" - Her Strut, You'll Accomp'ny Me, Fire Lake, Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight, and the title track.<br /><br />The only hit from this period missing is \\"Still the Same\\". (Obviously later hits like \\"Like a Rock\\" or \\"Shame on the Moon\\" are not included.) As others have mentioned this live CD actually does a better job of collecting Seger's big hits than the single-disc Greatest Hits collection does. And while Seger and the Silver Bullet Band tend to stick closer to the studio versions of the songs here than they did on \\"Live Bullet\\", there is still plenty of energy and drive behind these performances. To me the sound is better than on Live Bullet and this may be your best bet if you want a good introduction that includes the hits.<br /><br />Ideally, Seger is best heard live and you should have this AND \\"Live Bullet\\" in your collection. And don't worry about duplication: only one selection, \\"Let It Rock\\", is performed on both live sets. All of the tracks from \\"Live Bullet\\" predate \\"Night Moves\\" which is the earliest LP from which the material on \\"Nine Tonight\\" is pulled.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|bought this for a family member hope she likes it as much as I do.....very habit forming and relaxing, love it
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|I have never had such a bizarre love/hate relationship with any film composer as I do with Michael Giacchino. There are times when I listen to his music and my jaw goes slack because it's so breathtaking... and then there are times when I grit my teeth and go: \\"What on earth is this idiotic racket?\\" I was willing to completely write him off (something I hardly ever am willing to do with ANY composer, simply because I understand the demands of the job) - that is, until his entries for the '09 \\"Star Trek\\" film proved he can write some tremendous themes, and his scores for \\"John Carter\\" and \\"Super 8\\" proved that he found the 'on' switch somewhere back there.<br /><br />The score for the 2009 \\"Star Trek\\" film was a very dichotomous mixture of insanely good themes (\\"Enterprising Young Men,\\" etc.) and his - as I call it - 'exploding circus' action music (aka, \\"Nailing The Kelvin\\") which is very irritating to listen to on its own, and does not capture the 'organic' action music feel of many other composers. Because music is such a huge part of the Star Trek franchise - remember 1982's \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" was Horner's first big break, and he did wonderful work there, or remember Jerry Goldsmith and Cliff Eidelman's entries - I was somewhat disappointed with the first score, while simultaneously being enthralled with certain elements.  As a Star Trek fan and a film score buff, I was very, very curious to see what Giacchino did with the new score.<br /><br />First things first: the label's plan to do a double-release of the score (first on digital mp3, before the movie opened, and then on CD yesterday) was profoundly irritating. I like to pick up film scores before I see the movies they go to, and this 'forced' me to buy it twice (!!!) in order to listen to it before I saw this movie. Epic fail (although I'm sure they're very happy to get the money twice).<br /><br />Now for an in-depth review of the actual tracks on the CD, to help understand what I liked and what I did not like. Some of it is personal preference, but it should help some choose whether or not to buy the disc for themselves, if they're torn... I try not to give any spoilers for the film away, but I can't guarantee it, so read carefully, please! :)<br /><br />1. \\"Logos / Pranking The Natives\\" - The Grade-A theme from the '09 movie returns, with a less irritating 'tension-buildup' over the \\"Bad Robot\\" Logos than the previous iteration. The \\"Pranking The Natives\\" portion is a fun, fast-tempo roll through the orchestra. (****)<br /><br />2. \\"Spock Drops, Kirk Jumps\\" - This builds off the main theme in the beginning to a strong percussive beat, and then pushes forward into a rather scatterred, non-melodic bit of tempo-keeping music, which then pulls back together only in the final few seconds into something musically fascinating. (***)<br /><br />3. \\"Sub Prime Directive\\" - A hero/victory piece based on the main themes from the '09 film, brilliantly built upon and thoroughly engaging. Also contains the main Star Trek theme by Alexander Courage. (*****)<br /><br />4. \\"London Calling\\" - A delicate start on the piano, with backbuilding strings building tension steadily to a hair-raising crescendo at the end. Some of the best 2 1/2 minutes of music ever written. I can not give this piece enough credit. 10 stars out of five. (*****)<br /><br />5. \\"Meld-Merized\\" - A sad opening, which then builds tension rather ingeniously before backing off to sad music again. Nicely, nicely done! (*****)<br /><br />6. \\"The Kronos Wartet\\" - Begins with strong percussive and banging sounds backed by a chanting chorus. The most idiotic piece of Klingon music ever, ever written. No Jerry Goldsmith (\\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" [1979], \\"Klingon Battle\\"), James Horner (\\"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock\\" [1984], \\"Klingons\\"), or Cliff Eidelman (\\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\") comparisons possible here. This is literally the worst Star Trek music I've heard -- ever. The chorus sounds like a bunch of apes grunting at the beginning. Might as well be listening to Worf's hideous Klingon opera; Jerry Goldsmith is rolling over in his grave... Then the piece fades from the banging, stupid, ape-chanting sounds and turns introspective on the strings for a moderately interesting ending. The ending boosts the rating to a single star from none. (*)<br /><br />7. \\"Brigadoom\\" - Very interesting theme for the Cumberbatch villain. Starts delicately and then builds militaristically to a very interesting conclusion. I wish that the 'buildup' lasted for a little longer, as just when the foot starts tapping to it it ends; still, it's very nice. (****)<br /><br />8. \\"Ship To Ship\\" - High tension piece; fortunately not as 'exploding circus' as some of Giacchino's previous action music (such as his \\"Mission Impossible III\\" lunacy, or \\"Nailing The Kelvin\\" on the '09 Star Trek CD). The ending of the piece is a very nice building crescendo. (***)<br /><br />9. \\"Earthbound And Down\\" - This is an interesting piece that works very well in the film for building the tension; much of it is not very 'musical' when listened to as a standalone piece, being more of a jarring 'tumble through the orchestra', but again we are fortunately spared the infamous 'exploding circus' sound. (***)<br /><br />10. \\"Warp Core Values\\" - A militaristic start on the drums indicating someone's on a 'mission' turns into a hero piece that is very engaging... all in the first minute. This is followed by twenty seconds of 'tension-building' before turning into 'tragic' music that is extremely effective and enjoyable. (*****)<br /><br />11. \\"Buying The Space Farm\\" - A very sad piece which is based in large part on \\"Labor of Love\\" from the previous film (which also happened to be one of the best segments of music in that movie). At 2:43, the music begins to turn completely into something fast-tempo and 'angry' ... perfect for the scene. (****)<br /><br />12. \\"The San Fran Hustle\\" - A largely fast-tempo chase cue, with some slower music interspersed between bursts of kinetic energy. Most of this action music is not very musically interesting when listened to apart from the film on the CD (it actually starts to get annoying on its own about three minutes in), but it does drive the tempo in the actual movie. I prefer a more organic approach to action music, but this is simply a matter of taste. At about 3:24, the piece actually gets very musically interesting, and remains that way until the end, even building off some of the themes from the first film. (***)<br /><br />13. \\"Kirk Enterprises\\" - A piece building nicely off some of the themes from the previous film, but changed up and made 'fresh' again. (****)<br /><br />14. \\"Star Trek Main Theme\\" - Overall, an excellent piece to conclude the score, building on the themes from the '09 film very appropriately. My one complaint (and it's a big one) is that the timing of the notes for the Alexander Courage \\"Star Trek\\" theme (about 3:00 minutes in) is absolutely butchered again, just as Giacchino did at the end of the previous film. I mean - it's tortured. Any Star Trek fan who pays attention to the music (like me) has to be all but tearing his hair out at this insistence on changing it up just to show it was changed. Overall, though, the piece is terrific. (****)<br /><br />15. \\"The Growl\\" (Digital bonus track not included on CD) - A club / dance song. Played in the scene where Scotty is in the bar in San Francisco. A mediocre addition to the score that seems very out of place compared to the orchestral music. (** for 'fit' with the score; *** or **** as a standalone song.)<br /><br />Overall score: 3.7 out of 5.<br /><br />To summarize, I feel that Giacchino did a nice job building off his themes from the 2009 movie, and most of his action music in this film is less jarring than his older 'exploding circus' sounds. This is the case even if it is not always as melodic or musically interesting as other music from the Star Trek universe by the Goldsmith or Horner.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was instantly sucked into this world and found myself reading the books much faster than I thought I would. The setting and characters are very unique and the story just seems to flow. It was not very predictable, which I enjoyed, but still had good pacing and excitement. If you're on the fence, buy the book. You'll definitely enjoy it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big Bang Theory is witty, funny, and well-written. The actors are amazing and work well together. I love the nerd characters! They're easy to relate to. This show always keeps me laughing and I look forward to watching this show each week.<br /><br />The product was received quickly and in perfect condition (no damage in transit).
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I have to admit it, I was a fan of the Farro Brothers.  The two brothers had such a distinctive sound with Josh's shimmering guitar tones and Zac's attacking approach to the drums.  And while that is missed on this album, Haley Williams and Company have plunged ahead with an enjoyable bag of treats, albeit a mixed bag at times.<br /><br />1. Fast In My Car (10/10): Starts out with a cool little guitar riff.  It's a fun song while at the same time it is a proclamation of who they are now as a band and their new outlook.  It's basically a song about moving on and their &#34;drive&#34; to do it.  It's Paramore at the their energetic best.<br /><br />2. Now (10/10): The first single from the new album shows you that Paramore is here to stay.  It has fuzzy guitars, killer vocals, and a mantra of &#34;If there's a future, we want it NOW.&#34;  It is song of rebirth that is full of hope and adrenaline.<br /><br />3. Grow Up (8/10): Very poppy and it makes me wonder if Haley is channeling her inner Gwen Stefani.  Is this a song a response to Eisley's &#34;Sad&#34; that is supposed to be about Haley dating Sherri Dupree's ex, New Found Glory's Chad Gilbert?  Some may think so but I see it as another song in a theme-filled album about maturing and moving on from the past.<br /><br />4. Daydreaming (10/10): As much as I love an energetic Paramore, this slow pop song gets me every time.  I love the music build up and Haley's vocals sound great.  Has a bit of an 80's feel, maybe even a little bit of a Blondie feel to it.<br /><br />5. Interlude: Moving On (7/10): As I mentioned before, there is a theme about maturing and moving on, so it is fitting to have a song called Moving On.  This is one of several interludes with Haley and an ukulele and this is the strongest one.  With lyrics like what follows, it seems clear that it is a song directed at the Farro brothers: &#34;Let 'em play their song, let 'em say what's right and wrong. Let 'em do their thing, cause it'll never be you and me. We got out own style, we got a way of living life. If they can't get down, well then we don't need them around. Well I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight and besides I'm moving on. I've counted to 10 and now I'm feeling all right. And besides I'm moving, yes I'm moving, besides I'm moving on.&#34;<br /><br />6. Ain't It Fun (10/10): An 80's sounding funky dance/pop song, this is another song that sounds different for Paramore and yet it works.  I love the sarcastic chorus of: &#34;Ain't it fun living in the real world?&#34;  A very cool bridge as well.  The highlight of the album.<br /><br />7. Part II (5/10): Part II is in reference to being a newly re-written version of &#34;Let The Flames Begin.&#34;  It is almost as if Paramore is saying we still have our Christian faith intact and that we still have the struggles as all Christians have.  As a fan of the original song, I have to say that I am less of a fan of this version.  It does make you miss the Farro brothers when you hear it.<br /><br />8. Last Hope (8/10): Part II does transition nicely into this song, a song about hope and faith.  I love the lines: &#34;It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going. And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing.&#34;  It's another slower song that builds nicely and the guitar tones are reminiscent of what Josh Farro would write.<br /><br />9. Still Into You (9/10): A nice love song.  Catchy and cutesy.  If the guitars were a little heavier, I think I would have enjoyed it a little more.  This is definitely a song that when you listen to it, you realized just how much Zac Farro's drumming is missed.<br /><br />10. Anklebiters (8/10): Paramore picks up the pace and that might be an understatement.  This song is a nice little punk tune about society's attack on people.  Haley is declaring that she is over all these &#34;anklebiters&#34; and is done trying to please everyone.  It goes along with the recurring theme of moving on as a band and as a person.<br /><br />11. Interlude: Holiday (3/10): Another interlude song about moving on and getting a deserved break.  It is short and seems like a filler track (though with 17 tracks total, it is hard to complain).<br /><br />12. Proof (8/10): This song has some cool guitar lines and cool drum beats with a lot of energy.  Seems like a song about long distance relationships which she has a lot of experience in.  About 2/3 of the way into, it gets a nice bouncy feel to the song.<br /><br />13. Hate To See Your Heart Break (9/10): A slower song that uses Haley's lower range.  This has the feel of a country pop song.  I could hear it being used as a country song on the TV show &#34;Nashville&#34; or hear a country artist do this song.  I like the emotion in Haley's voice during the chorus.  A very different sound for Paramore but for a group that maturing and moving on, I think it is great.  There is nothing better than a band that can excel at upbeat songs AND slower songs.<br /><br />14. (One Of Those) Crazy Girls (5/10): I'm not crazy about (One Of Those) Crazy Girls.  It does have an interesting slow start that speeds up, but not one of my favorites.<br /><br />15. Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore (3/10): Another song about Josh Farro?  At this point, we could all care less since I thought we were moving on.<br /><br />16. Be Alone (8/10): This is one of the more old-Paramore sounding songs.  Nice sounding drums and guitars and Haley's outstanding vocals. Both catchy and energetic, it comes at just the right time in the album.<br /><br />17. Future (7/10):  &#34;We don't talk about the past; we don't talk about the past now.&#34;  Well, I don't know if that is true but this is a decent ending to an above average album.  The song reminds of the way Anberlin likes to end albums except I wish Paramore had built it into this rocking, epic finale.  Even though the music ends and then they come back in, I feel like they could have and should have gone out a little bigger.<br /><br />In conclusion, I enjoyed this mixed bag of treats.  Sure, there were some lows but there were a lot of high moments.  One thing I did love is although I have been such a fan of Paramore's upbeat/energetic songs, there were some slower songs here that really stuck with me.  And whatever your opinion of Haley, you have to admit she has one of the best vocals out there and proves that she is not limited to a certain genre.  As far as her and the Farro brothers are concerned, I believe there are three sides to every story: hers, theirs, and the truth somewhere in the middle.  We can wonder why Haley was signed before the rest of the band, but at the end of day, Haley chosen then and NOW that she longs to be in a band and not a solo artist.  And I am grateful for that choice.g on and getting a deserved break.  It is short and seems like a filler track (though with 17 tracks total, it is hard to complain).<br /><br />12.

This has the feel of a country pop song.  I could hear it being used as a country song on the TV show \\"Nashville\\" or hear a country artist do this song.  I like the emotion in Haley's voice during the chorus.  A very different sound for Paramore but for a group that maturing and moving on, I think it is great.

1594746168|3.0|I love the idea of this book, an anatomy of mythical creatures, but the execution does live up to the promise.  The surrounding story is rather dull, and the illustrations, while well executed, are fairly bland.  Not a total disappointment, but nowhere near what it could have been.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is SUCH a great movie for my kids! My 3 1/2 year old boy and my 2 year old girl both love it :)

B007SGM084|5.0|Just keeps u wanting more. I can't wait for the movie and I recommend it was a man. I will love to see what's next for E L James.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show i have seen in a long time. It is great that the story keeps developing with new charecters and new places, it shows progression and moving forward, which is something alot of shows, if not all, are lacking, therefore the reason I lose interest.  Walking dead keeps me interested every single week.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|A man comes to grips about his wife in a coma and it is compounded by the fact that she was having an affair. He becomes obsessed with finding out who her lover is, and after finding out, he takes the high road and lets it drop.  Beautifully told with comic highlights. Enjoyable.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|The Complete Studio Albums Collection is excellent!  A great group of CD's representing Leonard Cohen's wonderful songs over the years. To have them all together in one complete album is a treat. I am enjoying them all!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A good look at the lives of two classes of people, the haves and havenots this story shows a slice of life that is little talked about, but known. I loved the courage of the ones involved and giggled at the funny spots. Very entertaining.
B000089CJI|5.0|What else is there to say!  Love this group and this album.  It's very upbeat and makes me smile every time I listen to it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Having seen most of this series on TV, I knew I had to have it in my collection The film stories and colors were spectacular, awesome, breathtaking. Kudos to the hard working film crews and editors and everyone else involved in this project. It is absolutely wonderful.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I was unsure of this app as Majong always seemed beyond me, but oh how wrong was I ! I left the game I had only seen a few times behind and now this is my number one game, something I really never expected. The graphics are gorgeous, the different games amazing and the challenges never-ending.
B002XXNSF6|1.0|we stopped watching it after about 30 min.  the plot was pretty bad, I didn't care about the characters.  not worth the time.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Everyone on Goodreads was squeeing about this book that I HAD to read it.  Well now I'm squeeing along with them.  This book had me ROTFL!  Told from the male pov, I wonder how Emma Chase came up with this s***!  I just loved it!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I'm 30 and have not seen every bond film. Out of the bond films I have seen, I liked this one the most.
B0053O89WY|1.0|TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes \\"come out of the charecters.\\" I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how \\"geeky\\" they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Everyone writes like they are an expert critic. I will not write a novel on what I think about the movie. The bottom line is: I wanted to be entertained, and this accomplished that task. I would watch again, and I would recommend others watch it.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|The shows talent cast, witty dialogue,  no intrest to gain any viewers, and constant pop culture references is what made this show such a huge hit! I highly reccomend this show to anyone who likes comedy
0316044695|2.0|\\"The Taliban are very smart and very dangerous\\".  That's the kind of language used throughout this book, and bearing in mind it's written by someone within the special forces, it's incredible to note how poorly educated the author is on the differences between the tribes, Al Qaeda, Taliban etc.  His education appears to have been through Fox news and growing up in small town Texas, as he repeatedly bashes the liberal class and US media throughout his book, making it rather bothersome and repetitive after a while.  (For foreign readers, the book can come across as a bit \\"red, white and blue\\" to say the least, so for those looking for more of an international read, be warned).<br /><br />The combat narrative is excellent, the story unreal to the point at times of being almost unbelievable, however the combat piece represents actually the smaller portion of the book.  The training to become a Seal is an important part of the book, but also an pretty large piece of it, making the whole title a bit misleading.  Yes, the book is about a Lone Survivor, but you wont be reading about the combat mission until about half way through the book.<br /><br />I continue to refer people to Outlaw Platoon as the most interesting combat narrative for Afghanistan, and honestly nothing yet has come close to it in my pov.
B00AMHFMIG|3.0|This seasons stars out ok... But by the middle of it they realized that they have a hilarious cast and that they should put them all together in one scene! And that's when it starts to get funny
B005NS0VNU|4.0|Theft is the only reason I bought this album. I had REM's IRS and later works on 2 different CD collections. Somehow they mysteriously disappeared from my living room. I suspicion my son or one of his worthless, hoodlum friends... but I've no difinative proof. So I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone and buy this compilation, which combines both the early and the late in one neat package. I feel the production and remastering has been well done and I picked up some songs along the way.  I'm happy... real, happy. I've also ripped these disks to my HardDrive so now I can place these disks in the vault, under lock and key... so no more pillage can occur. Great band, great music... they will be missed.<br /><br />Worf
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|The first season was OK.. But this season has had the shows success mess with the cast and crews creative minds. Every thing is unpredictable and unrealistic.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Really like this movie.  The characters are so engaging.  Forgot about the twist at the end.  Love seeing the fun costumes.
B0053O8AQE|1.0|This show is what's wrong with telivison these days. The shows acting seems forced and it's just plain out not funny!
B0086700CM|3.0|So my toddler really likes this game, but has yet to master turns.<br />I DON'T like that he was able to instantly buy more coins for $20 that was instantly charged to my Amazon account.  That feature needs to be harder to access.<br /><br />:(
B001DJLCRC|5.0|After I completed watching The Sopranos I was in need for a new show to watch. Multiple friends, coworkers, and family members of mine Reccomended this too me, because I'm a fan of Bryan Cranston I thought id give it a try. I ordered it on a Tuesday and it was here by Thursday! I got a chance to watch the first episode of it on Friday, I started watching the show at 7:00pm, the pilot was good, so I watched the next, the next, the next, I looked at the clock, it was 12:30am!  I watched the whole 7 episode season in one night! I just finished watching all seasons and im currently waiting for the final 8 episodes in August 2013. If you thought this seasons wasn't that good, still stick with it because each season gets more darker and better.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it.  Could do it for hours but keep running out of coins and have to wait for regeneration.  Trying not to have to pay for more coins.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This season picks up where last season picked up.... Walt and Jesse are in a tight position... Skyler is still trying to find out what Walts hiding... And Hank still has no idea what Walts true identy is....

B0056BU3I2|4.0|The fifth installment of this series proves if something is well done it can last. Best thing was to keep Vin Diesel in the mix. Love the fact he invests his own money as a producer into this movie as well as the oncoming Fast Six due 5/24/13 (this Friday). Its been said this movie takes the action up a notch from simply a driving action movie to a more serious heist movie. I enjoy all elements. For me, the fight scenes between the Rock and Vin Diesel was worth the wait. Not to mention the first 10 minutes was worth the admission, I had to get it for my collection after seeing it in theaters. If you love the series, this is another MUST HAVE.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I would have given it five stars but I thought they could have added some more functionality for converting back and forth between fractions and decimals.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I got this app as the Free App of the Day so I'm probably a little biased in my opinion. However, it is truly an addicting game! I'm not a huge fan of the bejeweled type of game play but when you combine leveling up and being able to purchase upgrades (in-game money not real money) to help make the game-play easier it is like a drug! I don't play too many games on my phone (even though I have a lot of games) but this one I have linked on my main homescreen!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Always Know What To Say Easy Ways To Approach And Talk To Anyone. This book is very interesting, but I'm not sure I can live like that. It was fun reading it.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The cast was great and the acting was flawless (once you get over Jeremy Irons trying to have a southern accent). However, reading the book had ruined the movie for me. Even still, not the worst movie adaptation I've ever seen. I gave it 4 stars because, independently, it was a decent work. The story line was pretty sweet, the emotions and reactions etc. were believable. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anybody who has not read the book and those that have, but only if they are open-minded enough to accept the same story being told differently.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|First book I've ever picked up and couldn't put down. Even a good husband can be a better husband. This is a great guide to start.

B000BB1MI2|1.0|I bought Willy Wonka for my kids and we love it.  Gene Wilder is insane, strong and nothing stops him.  This movie Depp is soft an cooky and looks like he could fall if you sneeze in front of him, the kind of guy that walks with antibacterial gel. The kids of the original look more real. On this one they are forgettable.  Oompa loompa songs are catchy and by the end you have your own version. On this one I just wanted the songs to end.  Too much cgi.  There is a scene where dolls faces are melting and Depp is loving it, pathetically trying to tell the audience Wonka is loony. Wilder accomplishes tha same by having a strong face, walking with a cane and falling. Horrible movie.
0062502174|5.0|Well written book. I enjoyed it immensely as I traveled with the shepherd in his journey. Sometimes our journey in life can take us around the world and then back where we came from.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is the first HO game I've played on my kindle fire, and I enjoyed it a lot. Free actually means free trial, b/c you eventually will have to pay to unlock the full version. I decided to take a chance and was pleased w/ the game. The storyline was interesting and engaging, and long enough that I played for a few days. The only problem I had was that I often got confused where to look for clues b/c there were so many locations to search. The hint button was very helpful for that. Even though I had to pay, in the end I didn't mind b/c I really had fun w/ it.
B008MM9630|5.0|So far I am liking this game. Easy to play and understand. A fun game with decent graphics. A plus
0316010669|5.0|Excellent book, and enjoyable to read as well as full of fascinating information.  I would recommend it to everyone without hesitation.
B000FC1KGG|5.0|I had been told for many years to read David Almond's work, and I finally decided to download &#34;Skellig&#34; when finding some books for my new Kindle.  I can't believe I didn't read this sooner.  I guess this book had been marketed toward younger people, and the story is definitely accessible for older children, but it really is great for anyone of any age.<br />&#34;Skellig&#34; is dreamlike and mysterious, thoughtful, both visceral and philosophical, beautiful and concise prose.  I made myself stretch it out over a few days, but I could see this novel being devoured in just an hour or two.  The day after I finished I went and got a hard copy of &#34;My Name is Mina&#34;, the &#34;prequel&#34; from the library, and it was equally as excellent.<br />I recommend this if you like semi-surreal fiction, if you're looking for a book that ponders knowledge and purpose, or if you simply appreciate lovely writing.  I feel this is also one of those books that you should read a few different times in your life because can read it differently each time.  So if you like it, keep it in your collection!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|It was boring!  It should have been good because all of the components were there, but it failed to entertain. I kept stopping it to do other things and coming back to watch.  I have to finish a movie once I start it (the same with books), or else I would have stopped it for good less than 1/2 way in.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|As a fan of the show, I was excited to get this for my kindle. Its a great read, & I always pull it out to end disputes between my guy friends. The writers deliver an s few great laughs every few pages & make it a must-have for HIMYM fans
B008BU75IQ|1.0|Jeffrey Archer should be ashamed of himself for allowing this to go to the publisher.  He has either become lazy, arrogant or ignorant by putting this out there and expecting his readers to endure it.  There are too many good books out there to have to put up with this poorly written drivvle
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|This is quite simply the best album I have had the pleasure to buy and listen to in the last twenty years. I am a fan and love each and every album the band, their individual members and the spin off bands release. I loved Rapture of the Deep and was hoping the new album would be as good as it and Purpendicular.<br />I am honestly astounded by how amazing this album sounds.<br />It surprises from the outset. It's complex, it's intelligent, and it's full of musical flights of fancy. Deep Purple are officially a prog band again! They also out-metal whatever defines metal these days. And joy of joy, they out camp/gore Alice and Ozzy in one fell swoop.<br />I have never been so proud to identify myself as a Deep Purple fan. If you are buying I would suggest getting the regular cd. The 'bonus' song falls below the standard of the album proper in my opinion.<br />If you are a fan of rock and are looking for something more than the usual three cord trick or aging Poodle Rockers regurgitating their radio friendly easily forgotten three minute canticles, then look no further. An album by musicians in the prime of their careers.<br />Now What?! Deep Purple, unbelievably brilliant!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This was on an adult's wish list for Christmas, so it was a pleasure to order and get it for  him.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game.  I really enjoy the challenges it presents.  I am sad that I don't have an immediate sequel to go into.  Please , please bring out a new one soon.  This worked great on my kindle fire HD.
B0007W0MTA|5.0|Rarely do I find an album I like more than one song as of late, so when I like almost half, that means something in my eyes!<br /><br />They are a wonderful group that almost, if not exceeds my love of Bob Marley although their music sounds very different with inspiration from the 50's and 60's.<br /><br />You can't go wrong purchasing this CD.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I don't have to tell anyone what a great movie this is.  it speakes for itself.  Very well acted and great job on special affects
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|It worked at first but then it stopped. I couldn't get it to work again so I uninstalled it. Disappointing.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Great movie but i did not expect anything less from Tom Cruise.  He never dissapoints and this movie was no different.  He is such an amazing actor.  Will watch again for sure..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a fast reading book with many interesting themes. At the end one could still debate the guilt or innocence of Jacob since there is no concrete proof. It is interesting to compare the father's determination to defend Jacob throughout the book and the mother's increasing doubt.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|What can I say!!! Cruise and Hoffman are both so great in this movie..  I had this in the VHS version and i think i wore it out watching it so it was time replace it on DVD.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The actual message of the story is good but the voice of the main character was really annoying. I felt like I was reading about a child not a 30 year old man. Hope the movie is better
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Love you Denzel but was SO VERY dissapointed in the beginning of this movie.  What's with all the nudity!!!! That was so uncalled for!!!! you took this movie away from so many younger kids.  This could have been a great family night movie but NO!!!!! we have to put un-necessary nudity in this movie.  Shame on you Denzel!!!!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|A gift for a friend, he absolutely loved it! So much detail and looks wonderful after it is put together!
0307730697|5.0|This book is a must read. It's a very real and very gritty story told by people who knew Adam Brown personally. Read this book.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|Everyone should read this book!  At least twice!!! Life changer for me and many others.  Puts your life in perspective and helps you see past the negativity in life and go for everything you deserve.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I ordered this collection and was surprised to receive a totally different item in the mail.  I received the British version instead of the American.  I guess they're fine.  We're extremely nonconfrontational people, so we're not returning the item.  We're playing the first one now.  It seems to play.  I just want to warn you -- you will NOT receive the item you ordered if you order this item here.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a great game and one I'm pleased that I stumbled upon. It was very detailed and visually amazing. It brought back memories of old games I loved. I would highly recommend this game.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Please fix CUBE ATTACK MODE, everything else works fine. The game is very entertaining and I&lsquo;m always competing against my score.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|can be fun, good for some down time. does freeze up every once in awhile. playing too much can make it feel you are doing the same thing over and over.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is the RPG/Puzzle game I would have made if I had the ability to make games. Fun, challenging, addictive, and NO ADS OR SPYWARE. I got this game as the free app of the day, but I am going to buy it full price to support this developer: the game is that fun.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I thought this book was a good read. I love Sophie Kinsella! I really liked reading from both perspectives.  However, there were parts that drug out and I found myself skimming over. She is a great writer in my book!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Great photography, music, acting, storyline, even social/political/religious commentary. A movie that a wide age range of people can enjoy. Recommended.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I remember watching these movies when I was younger - I always thought that they were great. I got them all in one package on blu-ray so I can show it to my son who is fascinated with dinosaurs. As expected he liked the show and was excited to be able to watch it over and over again.<br />Some parts seem a little bit cheesy now since it's quite an old move but I still think that it's a good show.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages to play.<br />Fast delivery, easy to learn, and it grants endless hours of entertainment.<br />Overall I'm very happy with this product.<br />=]
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Moonrise kingdom is a movie which dares to be different, an indie film with A-listers all over it.<br /><br />As the title implies, the story has an almost fairy-tale like charm, and the story develops with a fascinating pace<br /><br />It's a quirky coming-of-age story, but with more dignity and gravity than Napoleon Dynamite or Scott Pilgrim. I'd put this movie up there with Secondhand Lions or E.T.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|It was fast paced, good special affects, and the story was interesting. If you want to watch something entertaining, I would recommend watching Mission Impossible
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an epic game about horses. In my opinion it is the best game I have ever played. In this game you get to enter it in competitions,dress it up and lots more. Get it today and start mingling with your horse. Just to let you know as well as all this it is free.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Recycled a LOT of footage from LTR.  No barrowwights--scenes swapped to CGI trolls, instead, no Tom Bombadil, and Rasagast as a stoner.  Peeks of Smaug look like a Saturday morning cartoon, and the dwarves look all like rock stars--not to mention the teaser cliffhanger put where those of us who've read it know there's a long hiatus in the action.  Very disappointing.  I wish I'd just have rented it.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Pitch perfect was a great movie. I've currently seen it seven times and loved it each time!!!!!! This might be a good movie to make a sequel for!!!!! (Hint,hint!!!!)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is epic everyone should have this game my friend Brylie showed men this game and I love it I give 5 stars!!
0634049011|5.0|This is another GREAT book for study!! I bought this book to expand my knowledge, and it did not disappoint!! I would recommend other books by this author as well...
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I have loved  Michael Buble's style and voice from the first time I saw him.  I have almost all of his CD's.  Much to my surprise, my granddaughter (23 years old) was going through my collection one day and became so excited to see my collection of Michael Buble.  She also loves him.  She borrows some of my Michael Buble collection but I make sure she returns them.  There's a generation gap but one of the many things we agree on is our love for Michael Buble!!!!!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I'll say up front: There are spoilers in this review. If you haven't seen the movie yet and plan to, don't read any further.<br /><br />Those who don't mind extra background info before they go to the theater, read on:<br /><br />\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" is not a perfect film. But for pure viewing enjoyment it's still, in my opinion, the third-best of the 12 films in the series, up there with \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" and \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan.\\" Given the spotty track record of the series overall, you can take that comment as you will.<br /><br />What's good:<br />* The first 20 minutes are among the best opening of any ST film.<br />* The interaction among the ensemble clearly carries the film and keeps it from bogging down. It's obvious that this cast really gets along and has looked forward to doing another movie together.<br />* Benedict Cumberbatch's villain, \\"John Harrison\\" (a.k.a. the legendary \\"Khan\\"), is a perfect foil for Kirk -- and later, Spock. Peter Weller's Admiral Marcus gets a good runner-up award.<br />* Zoe Saldana has become THE Uhura. Nichelle Nichols must be asking herself, \\"What if...?\\"<br />* There's a good interweaving of the original Star Trek series episode \\"Space Seed,\\" and \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan,\\" with a touch of \\"Star Trek 6: The Undiscovered Country,\\" and the 1986 Diane Carey ST novel \\"Dreadnought!\\"<br />* Various references to events and characters from the original series, sprinkled throughout the film in an almost \\"Where's Waldo?\\" motion for fans.<br />* Seeing Kirk being called on the carpet by Admiral Pike for his recklessness, and watching him grow up on screen as events unfold. Nice work, Chris Pine.<br /><br />What's not so good:<br />* Timeline continuity issues, such as the crew's journey to the Klingon world of Kronos, where you see a partially destroyed moon orbiting the planet. The accident that caused this destruction took place in Star Trek 6, about 25 years after the \\"Space Seed\\" episode. Or the references to the tribbles and the \\"Mudd incident,\\" which took place in the series a year or two after this film's present time.<br />* Believability: The Enterprise underwater like a giant sub? Spock in an all-out brawl with Khan, and emerging without a scratch (Kirk, on the other hand, has quite a few scrapes he carries through the entire film)? A space station orbiting Jupiter that no one sees? And no one, other than the original Spock, has any memory or knowledge of who Khan is/was?<br />* Numerous plot holes, some big enough to drive a starship through. Among the biggest offenders: handheld communicators that can call from the Neutral Zone all the way to Earth (a feat not even possible in the \\"Next Generation\\" series about 80 years later), but can't reach the orbiting Enterprise during a volcanic explosion; Dr. McCoy's statement about needing Khan's blood to save Kirk's life, when he has 72 other persons with the same blood in his medical lab; the same Dr. McCoy saying that he can't remove someone from a cryotube without killing him, but later taking someone out of one of those tubes and telling his assistants to just \\"keep him in a medically induced coma\\"; Khan getting stunned once with a phaser and going down, unconscious, but later getting hit several times point blank and he's not even dazed; Carol Marcus has a British accent, while dad Admiral Marcus doesn't; a tribble sitting on Dr. McCoy's desk, that somehow doesn't move despite the fact the Enterprise has been tossed around like a rag doll; a security officer who doesn't know what a communicator is, or what a countdown is (\\"10, 9, 8...\\")...I could go on, but you get the idea.<br />* The Federation, thanks to the original Mr. Spock in the last movie, has the technology for long-distance teleportation. Yet the Enterprise isn't using it; but the villains are.<br />* The Enterprise has obviously had an upgrade: In some respects, it's more technologically advanced than the Enterprise of the Next Generationseries and movies.<br /><br />Judgment call:<br />* Replaying the ST2 death scene between Kirk and Spock, with the roles reversed: Kirk dying in the radiation chamber after saving the ship; Spock on the outside, in anguish. I thought it was a fine homage to the original; others may consider the word-for-word scene remake is merely lazy scriptwriting.<br />* Reviving Kirk about 20 minutes after his death. This is a universe with an alternate timeline. Imagine what could have been from this point with Spock (or someone else) permanently in the captain's chair?<br />* The \\"gratuitous\\" scenes of Dr. Marcus and Captain Kirk in their underwear (at different times), which do nothing to forward the plot (but obviously kept certain people interested).<br /><br />Overall: A worthwhile film, if you look past the flaws. You just wonder what they're going to do now that the crew is officially on its \\"five year mission to go where no one has gone before.\\" Maybe...the Mirror Universe?
B000088E6D|5.0|I have read numerous of your reviews on Michael Buble and while some are critical of this or that, they aren't  much help to me because I am a Michael Buble lover!  I have loved his choice of music and his \\"Frank Sinatra\\" style for years.  Of course, I love some CD's more than others but I still love them all.  He has become very popular with older people as well as younger ones.  My reviews for Michael will always be 5 stars!!!!!
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|If you have ever wondered why people don't change when presented with information that shows that it would be in their best interest to do so, this book will tell you why. It's filled not only with easy to understand principles but with lots of excellent examples and practical advice. It makes you want to start changing!
B0091LS07E|5.0|From the moment I first heard Alicia Keys I though she was really talented. I have been disappointed with some of her recent material including what is on this album. Still when I saw her on the Grammys doing Girl on Fire I was sold. Happy to see she is back on top. Here voice is really sounding good.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This show was AWESOME! I had my grandkids watch it also because August remided me of my grandson.<br />He loved the show and even got his guitar out of his closet and plays it again
B00138KE2C|5.0|If you love the Foo Fighters, then you'll love Skin and Bones. For that is what it is, the Skin and Bones of all their best songs - the pure essence of the song. I could listen to it over and over.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This movie has action and plenty of that, it has humor and plenty of that and especially a trick that if you are not paying attention, you will MISS out!! and not be able to figure out...HOW'D they do that?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First I'll say that I HATE science fiction. But when I read the description of Wool, I thought of Ray Bradbury`s All Summer in a Day. And although I read that over 30 yrs ago and keep meaning to re-read it,it has always been a story that stuck with me.<br />WOOL is Bradbury meets Orwell. Very well written.<br />Did I mention I also HATE long books? I couldn't put this one down.<br />Thank you Mr. Howey. More please.
1596438274|3.0|I am not a comic book fan, but this is certainly a different type of biography.  If you haven't read Feynman's non-technical books about himself (such as \\"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!  Adventures of a curious character\\"), you will have trouble following the story.  I had trouble even having read them.<br />You will like this book if you have read his autobiographical books.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have to say I absolutely loved this book!  Funny, sexy, great characters, wonderful story line and snappy dialogue.  What a treat!  I hated it to end.  There were just a couple of minor typos.  If I had one wish, it would be for a soul-satisfying epilogue.  However, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we will see these characters again.  I would love to know their future.  Emma Chase, you are a wonderful author!  Can't wait to see what you will do next.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Just saw this last night, and out of all the superhero movies I've seen, this is the best so far.  Robert Downey, Jr. is simply perfect, the CGI is astounding, the plot is tight and the 3D experience is fantastic.  It's a blockbuster in the truest sense of the word.  When superhero movies come out every other month nowadays, it's hard to find one that is truly, consistently great all the way through.  Iron Man 3 is that movie; it's twenty times better than the first two, and even makes the Avengers film look tame.  If you think you want to see it, go now!
B0045XGRQE|2.0|Just watched this in order to be caught up when going to see Iron Man 3. Now I don't know if I even want to see #3.  Quality of the HD stream is flawless, almost too much so. I felt like I was watching the filming of the movie on set, as opposed to post production. I could actually see the lighting on set.  Couple that with the horrible story line and lack of truly memorable dialogue, and you have a pretty disappointing sequel to a decent original Iron Man.  If there was a highlight, it was Scarlet Johansson's action sequences.  Otherwise, this movie was completely forgettable.
0385349947|2.0|The book does have some good advice for women and thought-provoking ideas about careers and work, but as a woman in her 40s who has chosen not to get married or have children, I find this book to be very dated. So much of the book focuses on parenting, mothers and husbands/male partners and I wonder if, yet again, women and feminists are forgetting the women who choose other paths. So many people in business and the government think if they always focus on programs for children they are addressing \\"women's issues.\\" I know so many women in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s who have decided not to have children, and they are all pursuing amazing, interesting paths and careers. Some are married, many are not, but I see each of them as being happy and fulfilled. And we all have always spoken our minds and fought for things that others may not have given us otherwise. I probably should have read more about the book before buying it as I have skipped lots of chapters, finding nothing in them that pertains to me.<br /><br />I'm glad this book resonates with so many women and I hope they get something out of it. My sister with a Ph.D. dropped out of a prestigious science career to raise two boys because her partner refuses to do \\"women's work.\\" I think I will send this book to her.
1439152802|5.0|Loved this book.  After witnessing a horrific event in the summer of her 16th year, Laurel, 50 years later, begins to investigate the motive behind it as her mom lies dying in the hospital. Morton weaves the reader between the lives of several women; WWII and present day are the main timeframes. You fall in love with characters, and learn to dislike others, but along the way, you are submerged into the life and times of the London blitz. Plot twists until the very end has the reader surprised time and again.
B009K86D86|5.0|I rated this movie highly because I thought it was very well made following extensive research and investigation into a serious problem in the U.S. food industry.  I wish the people responsible for not only creating this problem, but also the people who could actually do something about fixing it were interested enough to watch it and act upon the information in it.  Great job in producing this movie.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|If you love the comic book heroes - you will love this=we did
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love watching this show&#62; I do not have cable so being able to get it here helps me keep up with whats going on.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|First Lee Child book I've read, and am hooked!  I've read Tom Clancy, Robert Jordan, Nora Roberts.  Lee Child's style hooks you quickly with this kind of hero.  Jack is the kind of man every woman hopes to hook!  He's strong, decisive, no-nonsense!  He protects the innocent, but the evil, the bad, beware!  Couldn't put it down!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I bought 'Searching for Sugar Man' after having watched it twice already (on Netflix). I had to own this film so that I could return to it often when I need to be moved to my core. The fact that this a Documentary and not Fiction is mindboggling. The story is both sorrowful as well as absolutely triumphant! The &#34;hero&#34; is the embodiment of humility the likes of which I have never seen before and may never see again in our &#34;I, Me, Mine&#34; world. I love Rodriguez and love this movie. Don't miss this as you might miss the most important film experience of your lifetime. It rates way up there in mine.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Highly recommended! Should have won many Oscars--especially BEST PICTURE. Thought-provoking. Entertaining. Spell-binding. Well worth owning--should be in any true lover of cinema's film collection. Roger Ebert (RIP) was right!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love this book! Definitely worth the read. Pick it up.... you definitely won't be disappointed!! I bought the digital version and saved a few bucks and had it in a matter of seconds on my phone!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love this - how they got together =etc. = good story=  acting the best= action you will love= one scene I didn't like = but won't reveal what it was=HA!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft Pocket addition is very cool but you don't get 0.6.2.I know because I have 0.6.1 and it din&quot;nt give me my UPDATE.But I really enjoyed it .AND I KNOW YOU WILL TO.
B0061S073A|5.0|My 99 year old mother loves to play solitaire on my Kindle; however, she sometimes gets confused by the ads when starting a new game, presses the wrong icons and has managed to unregister my Kindle twice! Now that I have KId's Place, I can restrict the apps she has access to and she can no longer get into &#34;Settings&#34; for my Kindle. She can still change settings for the solitaire app, but that is not a big problem.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a girl and I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and even though it was a biography it was still interesting and full of action
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this really helps me know how much time I have till my kindle dies, great app and I hoe everyone out there gets to enjoy this app on their kindle fire
1423140591|4.0|I found the multiple main characters a bit stretched in this one.  It's a bit hard to stay fully engaged with all of them--especially Jason, who we just don't know that well yet...
B0034G4P80|5.0|What a cutie pi and great action movie
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app does what it says and is very well thought out. The simplicity is what I like the most.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It works. I look forward to trying it out on trips. Easy to set location and the various settings for the alarm.
B00BUJ3R1Y|5.0|Writing in this is far above average and acting seems able to keep up.  Look for this to continue for at least two more seasons before going stale.  Highly recommend buying season 1 as it will be a difficult one to pass.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This series is as engaging and entertaining as promised. I'm sure I'll enjoy it many times over! This set was nicely put together.
B000I9U75G|4.0|This movie was fun to watch with my 13 year old son.  The first half builds anticipation.  Has a lot of action and adventure.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|We were very surprised about this movie - at first I didn't want to watch thought it was like the transformers movies (don't care for them) ( this movie was a gift to my Honey) I have now seen it 3 times= see it if you like action and good acting =etc
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game I have a friend that rides my bus and it is on her I pad mini and I loved it
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is a great movie! My whole family loves it, especially the little guy! He already has a healthy respect for retro gaming...
B00386EZJU|5.0|I just love it so much I had to buy it, if nothing else then for the track of  &#34;Forbidden Friendship&#34; it's just beautiful,<br />I exercise to this music and love it! Especially on the elliptical since it makes me feel like I'm flying :D
B00902S0IS|3.0|This has the early feel of classic Si Fi from a historical perspective it has a simple plot and special effects and gives the viewer a glimpse into the mind of the director struggling to tell a story with a limited budget in an age before modern technology. It is an interesting object to contrast how far modern movies with their mega budget have come.
B0099114WO|4.0|Loved this movie and it was very well done.  Loved Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones in their roles.<br />More mature audiences will love this movie.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting characters and storyline are just the beginning of the fun. I catch myself thinking about the story and just can't imagine what will happen next. Surprises at every twist and turn of the page.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is really fun!!! If you lost a loved one or someone you knew by their neack cracking in a car acsident then be carefull because it makes the sound of it so just mute your device. this app is a great time passer for all ages
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Not the feel good film of the year, but a very interesting viewpoint. I am glad that I watched this film...
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 10 year old son loves this game!  He loves to create characters and makes up things.  Very kid-friendly and spurs the imagination.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I enjoyed the Album Passione very much.  Some songs I really enjoyed and a few I felt didn't belong on the track,  they were not in keeping with the mood.  I was surprised to hear  La Vie En Rose duet sung  by Bocelli and in excerpts performed by Edith Piaf. It put a smile on my face. Edith is one of my favorites. It was the first time I heard Jennifer Lopez sing in duet with Andrea Bocelli and simply loved her singing Quizas, Quizas, Quizas.  I would love more songs with Jennifer and Bocelli.<br /><br />The quality of sound recording in this album was exceptional. I would purchase more of this type of music which is sentimental  of my era.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Good action but unrealistic to a point.  This is one reason why I do not fly.<br />Good entertainment movie for all.
076115678X|3.0|I give this book five stars on one hand: the author/stylist calls the beauty-product industry (and our culture) into question for the non-so-subtle insistence that ALL hair should be straight. I LOVED how she points out that stylists are *trained* to straighten hair, something I'd never realized before. No wonder they never seem to know how to cut or style my hair (or understand why I don't want them to flatten it!) I also love the idea that it really could have been harsh chemicals in shampoo that made my hair look like crap all these years.<br /><br />So I started following the advice in the book. And for at least a month, I was planning to get on here and say \\"the whole things's a scam!\\" But I was still holding out hope, so I broke down and shelled out for the Deva Curl products from this same stylist's line, which are PRICEY, and I will say, I definitely notice my curls looking softer, springier, and more enhanced. I'm still not entirely positive that it isn't just the fact that it's getting more humid where I live. But I do think there has been some improvement in the texture of my curls.<br /><br />My one main complaint (since I still think it's fair to give my hair a few more weeks or even months to this system and see if it keeps adjusting to no-poo) is that the book and the video do NOT come with clear enough \\"how-to\\" visuals. Particularly with the clipping technique, for example-- the tutorial on the CD shows you a tutorial of how to do it that lasts, oh, two seconds? It makes me think I might be able to find better tutorials for free on YouTube.<br /><br />So, overall, if you can afford this book, get it. If you can't, borrow it from a friend or the library. Or look up curly-hair advice on YouTube, and save your money for the DevaCurl no-poo and conditioner.

B000FA675C|5.0|I love reading Dan Brown novels.  The Da Vinci Code does not disappoint.  It fills in a lot of the holes from the movie.  The novel pulls you in and keeps you interested.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Almost every Blu-Ray looks great, but what Disney is able to do is pack it full of beyond just a good picture and sound.  The bonus features on this make it worth whatever price it's charged now that it's back in the Vault.  Buy this if you're a fan.  This is one of the most beautiful Blu Rays in my collection!
B00BUT5I84|1.0|I just listened to a good bit of the new album, \\"Love, Lust, Faith + Dreams\\" and couldn't be more underwhelmed.  I say `a good bit' because I honestly couldn't make it through most of the songs and kept skipping to the next track and the next track, waiting for it to get better, but it just... it just didn't.  It just kept getting worse.  And, no, I'm not going to try listening again.  I'm not listening to that album ever again. In fact, I'm quite sanguine at the thought of simply pretending it doesn't even exist.<br /><br />This is War was already straining my genre credulity as it was.  But this is like This is War with the brakes off, downhill in Seattle at 120mph.  There's no coherent through-line, no uniting concepts (beyond `some random bird did me wrong and, oh, I'm just so sad').  This album has NO SOUL TO IT.<br /><br />Seriously.  Listen to \\"Buddha for Mary\\" and then listen to \\"Up in the Air\\". If you don't feel the wrongness like a punch in the gut, then you're beyond help.<br /><br />I mean, seriously -- don't get me wrong -- I'm a fan.  A long time fan, actually.  Beautiful Lie was instrumental for me to come to some very intense personal realizations and being okay with those and nevermind anyone who had a problem with it.  It helped me to be strong and then I listened to the first album and I was rapturous.  Intelligent, thought-provoking, CHALLENGING music.<br /><br />This album?  Seriously makes me question my life choices and makes me question whether or not I even want to consider myself a fan anymore.  Because fans keep up with what bands are doing next and I don't think I even wanna know what they're doing next, if more of THIS is what I'm going to get.  Because this band isn't the band I came to know and love.  This isn't the band I traveled all the way up to Seattle to go and see, and it was one of the finest, best nights of my life.  I wouldn't go and see the band on this album.  I wouldn't pay for a ticket to go see this band.  I wouldn't ride on a bus for three hours each way to go and see this band.<br /><br />This album is shallow, hollow, soulless and everything that's wrong with music these days. I mean, god, it's not even that they've gone pop - it's that **I listen to pop music with more passion and creativity, coherence and heart than this on a regular basis**.<br /><br />Do not buy this.  It's a rushed, commercial hunk of rubbish that lacks basically everything you ever even once might have liked about 30STM as a group.e on a bus for three hours each way to go and see this band.<br /><br />This album is shallow, hollow, soulless and everything that's wrong with music these days.

0812993845|3.0|This book has an interesting story line...basically portraying a girl in long relationships with guys that don't want to commit to marriage. So she meets an old fling as a rebound and they decide to marry quickly. As you can guess, the spontaneity leads to problems. Another part of the story line includes an interfering sister who is recently divorced. The sister end ups on her own relationship journey. Even though the book has girly charm, the actual writing is a bit boring and somewhat painful at times. Somehow it doesn't flow well. I've enjoyed other books by this author as light, fun reading, but I would not recommend this book.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|this is the type of film that proves you do not have to spend a fortune on special effects to tell a powerful story. This film speaks to many evils of society, but it also shows how people can change once they get to know what they fear or hate. A very good film from Clint Eastwood.

B000HZD168|4.0|I believe the Wrath of Khan was the best of the original Star Trek franchise movies. Ricardo Montalban makes for a fantastic villain. This may have been his best movie role. The development of the friendship between Kirk and Spock is a strong theme, as is midlife renewal and the value of sacrificing for others. The special effects are very good for 1982 and the drama is superb.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I wanted the entire set of the Harry Potter DVDs and my kids and I really enjoy them.  This one is one of my favorites.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian surprised me on several levels.<br /><br />From the title I expected a space-alien story. Instead, I was treated to a very human tale about the fear of abandonment and the gritty determination to survive against all odds. Instead of a novel focused solely on the psychological ruminations of someone in dire circumstances or a story about the physical efforts to stay alive in a hostile environment, the author managed to incorporate both while keeping his novel entertaining and engaging. Instead of a story involving fantastic and futuristic inventions the lead (and nearly sole) character in The Martian uses extant technology and current science to solve his problems. Not being an exo-technologist I can't say for sure that 100% of the science in this novel is accurate or plausible, but it's presented so realistically that it's easy to take it as such. Instead of a novel with an extremely capable protagonist who never makes mistakes and succeeds with every effort we're given a very human character with whom we all can empathize and identify.<br /><br />All in all, it's a pleasantly and surprisingly good novel. I thank my friends on Google+ who recommended I read it. I think it would make a gripping movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|A great game to play while waiting in line for the deli or in the doctor's office.  Fun and easy!

B005O242D0|4.0|As a progressive, pro-labor, left leaning, Socialist sympathizer (if not an out and out &#34;fellow traveler&#34; on both economic and political issues, I can only say that Hitler is an individual that I wish to God had never been born.  I despise his racial ideas and &#34;uber&#34; nationalism (which American right wingers camouflage as &#34;patriotism&#34; much the way us left wingers use &#34;progressive&#34; in lieu of &#34;liberal&#34; in order to give the most favorable connotation to our position).  His analytical thinking however astounded me, especially since the book was written in the 20s, when American textbooks and revisionists would have us believe that he was merely a maniacal, &#34;paper hanger&#34; (remember that one?) when in fact he was quite intelligent, quite talented, and, as stated earlier brilliant, especially in understanding the Prussian influence on the population of Germany in so far as the propensity toward militarism.  To my knowledge he was the first right wing fascist to incorporate a somewhat leftist view toward the bourgeoisie and proletariat struggle.  Thus the name National SOCIALIST LABOR Party (acronym = NAZI in German).  Basically he told the business and management group that they must provide decent wages, good working conditions, health and welfare benefits etc., THEN he told the labor movement that since they now had what they wanted, there was no need for direct action in the form of strikes, unrest etc., THEN he demanded unswerving loyalty to the State from both the bourgeoisie and proletariat and THEN he set about to create with this tremendous support he developed among all economic classes a huge military built upon the ingenious technological German mind, and the ingrained Prussian military mindset, and voila, a small, humiliated  country was turned overnight into the most efficient society and military ever created by man.  Paper hanger indeed!  It must be remembered that he was most of all an opportunist.  Hitler knew that in the Great War Germany was winning.  Hitler knew that the Kaiser (cousin to the Czar, the Queen, and the Emperors of Austria and Spain) was no fanatic on either the left or right-he was purely just a monarchist) had offered England a &#34;cessation of hostilities&#34;, which meant basically, &#34;OK enough of this.  Let's stop fighting.  Nobody wins or loses.  We'll all go home and forget we ever got involved in this nonsense&#34;, but forces within England convinced England to reject the offer, promising to get the USA into the conflict.  EVERYBODY knew that if the USA got involved Germany was toast.  How did the USA get involved when President Wilson was elected on a platform of &#34;he kept us out of war&#34;?  Well all you have to do is load up the Lusitania with arms for England, leak the info to German intelligence and wait for the torpedoes.  Then fake an invasion of Texas by Mexico via the fraudulent &#34;Zimmerman Note&#34; (it helped that Emperor Maximilian of Mexico was also related to the European Royals) and then have European Bankers tie up J.P. Morgan's investments in England, France etc., and then have old J.P. threaten to have Wall Street create a depression if Wilson did not go along, and again, voila, America is going &#34;over there&#34;!  This is what Hitler described as the &#34;stab in the back&#34;, blaming collaboration by Germany's Jewish population, which fueled the &#34;Aryan Supremacy&#34; doctrine and challenged the loyalty of Jews and other &#34;non-Aryans&#34;.  And he played it to the hilt.  He was the most dangerous type of demagogue there is-one who is brilliant, and therefore able to turn the economic manipulations of the world wide upper class bankers and commerce peddlers into his own private Cause Celebre.  As much as I hate the memory of this guy, I have to admit that 1) He did have the support of the right wing in England, and the USA.  2) His attempt to exterminate the Jews brought that support to an end, as Jews (like other immigrants) had become such a fabric of life in England and the USA that human decency would not allow the extermination to continue.  And 3)  He committed the dumbest fumble that any military commander ever could do in the history of Western civilization by invading Russia.  If you ever want to know why the USA became so paranoiac about &#34;Communism&#34; after WWII, with McCarthyism and the Red Scare just read what effect on America's military the awesome might and destruction wrought by the Red Army and Stalin's program of Total War had.  It's really why we used the A Bomb on Japan, to warn the Russians that we had it.  Hitler, like Napoleon learned what Tony Soprano meant when he told his sister Janice:  &#34;Don't f*** with the Russians&#34;.  Read Marx, then read Hitler.  Then look at Wall Street, and the &#34;Tea Party&#34;, and our growing militarism and CIA intervention in the affairs of all the countries of the world.  You'll soon learn that another Hitler can sprout up at any time.

B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|&#34;Meddle&#34; is the sound of Pink Floyd moving from the psychedelic sounds of early albums like &#34;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&#34; to the more progressive, bluesy sound of later works like &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; or &#34;Wish You Were Here.&#34; In its six tracks, the album showcases both sides of Pink Floyd.<br /><br />&#34;One of These Days&#34; is a psychedelically-tinged blues jam featuring great slide guitar from David Gilmour and a double-tracked bass from Gilmour and full-time bassist Roger Waters. Bonus: Drummer Nick Mason's distorted voice yelling &#34;One of these days I'm going to cut you up into little pieces!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;A Pillow of Winds&#34; is one of the relatively few love songs Pink Floyd ever wrote, but its soothing melody and lyrics about going to sleep calm the listener. Ringing acoustic and slide guitars keep the track interesting, and the slide adds a slightly disconcerting bluesy feel.<br /><br />&#34;Fearless&#34; is a slow soft-rock song, again with ringing guitars. Bonus: A recording of a crowd singing Rodgers' and Hammerstein's &#34;You'll Never Walk Alone&#34; is played in the background, and as the &#34;Fearless&#34; theme fades out the chanting voices are left, providing an uplifting finale to the song.<br /><br />&#34;San Tropez&#34; and &#34;Seamus&#34; close side one of the album. They are weaker than the other three tracks on side one, but they are certainly not bad. &#34;Tropez&#34; is the only song sung by Roger Waters in the album. It is jazzy, with a piano solo by keyboard player Richard Wright. &#34;Seamus&#34; is a slow acoustic blues, which features a dog barking in the background along with the music. The dog, Seamus (the song was named after him), belonged to Steve Marriott of the Small Faces and Humble Pie.<br /><br />And finally, &#34;Echoes.&#34; &#34;Echoes,&#34; at over 23 minutes in length, provides the astonishing climax to the album. The verses are sung in a haunting duet by David Gilmour and Richard Wright. After the main verses, a slow, fuzzy guitar solo by Gilmour builds up to a funky section which features Waters and Wright playing chunky fills on each of their instruments, while a mournful guitar wails over the top. This section fades out, and the &#34;seagull section&#34; begins (the distinctive screeching sound is Gilmour playing his guitar through a wah-wah pedal and probably a slide), after which a section with just guitar and organ begins. After this, more verses are sung, and the rest of the track progresses similarly to the first seven minutes. A white noise concludes the song and the album.<br /><br />After this album, Pink Floyd finally found their spot in rock history after confused albums such as &#34;Ummagumma&#34; and &#34;Atom Heart Mother.&#34; Soon afterward, they stopped writing film scores, and concentrated all of their energy on the landmark albums yet to come.Richard Wright.

B00CRW2066|5.0|I keep waiting for the National to falter.  With \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\", the group shows no sign of slowing down. Rather than replicating their formula for success, Trouble stretches the groups musical boundaries a bit, all the while remaining true to their core. They pay subtle homages to songs from Alligator, Boxer and High Violet throughout the album, while creating a relatively new footprint.  For example, Demons contains clear elmements of the brooding melancholy of Boxer's Apartment Story and  \\"Heavenfaced\\" is the musical cousin of Boxer's \\"Gospel\\".  Other songs on Trouble, like \\"This is the Last Time\\", are more standard, coming as close to U2-esque music as The National will ever get.  But throughout the album, the group maintain their identity.  They remain unapologetic about their brainy brand of alternative rock.  In my opinion, they are the best group in music today.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Made me want to pull the novel out again as I was reminded of the romance and beauty of the story.  Amanda Root's depiction of Anne is spot on--intially the plain, beaten down and resigned spinster who evolves into a spirited, lovely woman as her heart is rekindled by the possibility of regaining her long lost love who she was so foolishly persuaded to reject as a young woman.  Ciaran Hinds is an absolutely dashing Captain Wentworth.  Resentful but powerless to be drawn once again to the woman who rejected him some eight and a half years ago.

B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|A new Vampire Weekend record works on me like a virus. It hooks into my body with the bold, catchy brashness of &#34;Diane Young&#34; and then lingers with &#34;Step&#34; and &#34;Obvious Bicycle&#34;. By the time I get to &#34;Ya Hey&#34; I'm sick with love for this album. The band's move from an Afrobeat / Graceland aesthetic to one more rooted in Bach and classic piano melodies is a wonderful change.<br /><br />My only hesitation is their choice to include some spoken words sections on two of the songs. However, they are short and the rest of the album is so good that it's still 5 stars.<br /><br />There's still plenty to dance to here and if you liked Contra, I think you'll love this. It's my favorite album of the year so far and it makes me happy that these guys are young enough to produce many more delightful albums in the coming decades.<br /><br />I highly recommend the All Songs Considered Podcast where Rostam and Ezra explain their process and influences: http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/04/29/179854416/vampire-weekend-on-new-york-souls-of-mischief-and-the-secrets-of-its-new-album

B000002MG1|5.0|This and &#34;Out of Time&#34; were probably REM's greatest recordings.  It turned REM in the UK from an obscure garage band with a small but dedicated following amongst the 1980s / 1990s &#34;new wave&#34; crowd into mainstays of the pop / light rock scene.  Their acoustic sets for the BBC and their tours hammered this home.  I saw them at Murrayfield (Edingburgh, Scotland) with friends in 1995 and it was quite a show.  Even 18 years on I still remember it...

Frankly, the film hasn't looked and sounded this good since its original big screen incarnation. If any musical of the past 40 years deserves such a deluxe treatment, it is &#34;Cabaret&#34;.<br />Giving the performances of their lives, both Liza Minnelli, as the self-deluded but highly ambitious anti-heroine Sally Bowles, and Joel Grey, as the Mephistophelean M.C., transport us to the tawdry ambience of the 1931 Weimar Republic, where sexual identity is fluid and everything and everyone is for sale (the contemporary club scene, anyone?). The &#34;Money Money&#34; number about the erotic attraction of wealth could be successfully placed into the soundtrack of &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;(2013).<br />Under the sure and certain control of choreographer/director Bob Fosse, &#34;Cabaret&#34; the film solves the traditional problem of the musical play and the musical film. Since every number, save one, in the surprisingly contemporary score takes place in the seedy Kit Kat Klub in Berlin, where corpulent businessmen mingle with uniformed Nazi thugs and prostitutes, the element of realism can be planted and nurtured. Characters don't suddenly erupt in song. Every Kit Kat number comments on what is going on in the alleys, on the streets and in the boardinghouses: the brutal tactics of the surging National Socialist Party, the increasingly lethal rise of anti-Semitism (also reflected in the doomed love story between the secondary characters Natasha and Fritz), the nostalgia for the old order which Sally's landlady harbors.<br />&#34;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&#34;, the sole number set outside amidst the natural beauty of the German countryside and the Gemutlichkeit of the German biergarten, is also the perfect combination of music and political commentary. As a scout-uniformed, perfect Aryan boy begins to sing what will become a Nazi anthem embraced by a multi-class, multi-generational audience, the camera slowly pans down from his angelic face to the swastika prominently displayed on his uniform. When Brian and Max , bisexual lovers who form a sexual triangle with Sally, leave the scene in a limousine, Fosse inserts a knowingly sardonic shot of the smiling M.C.<br />The film opens and closes with distorted funhouse mirror images of the audience at the Kit Kat Klub, slowly melding from black and white to color at the beginning and finishing with shots of a predominately Nazi  audience. When a mirror was used onstage in the musical play, the audience could see itself. Geoffrey Unsworth's Oscar winning cinematography, rendered here with solid blacks and the subtly shifting quality of stage lighting, puts us there. Though the Weimar era was 80 years ago, (think Dietrich in &#34;The Blue Angel&#34; (1931), Fosse, Minnelli and Grey took us there 40 years ago and continue to do so to this day. The hypnotic spell of &#34;Cabaret&#34; lives and breathes on this splendid disc.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This was a great remake of a classic.  I liked it better than the older version and have watched it several times since I got it.  The character really comes across as strong but the ending needed a little more work regarding his partner.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|This is on my desk at school and the kids LOVE it.  They think it's hilarious their teacher plays with Minecraft AND Legos, but that's part of the fun.  The kit comes in pieces, so you have full control over what your final product will turn out to be.<br /><br />I highly recommend for anyone who likes Minecraft and LEGO products.  Once put together, there isn't much to do as far as play goes, but it is fun to tear it all down and start again.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|This is a feel good movie that fills the bill.  Lots of over- used catch phrases ..&#34;I don't even buy green bananas&#34;...but they fit the older folks quite well.  All players did a good job filling their parts.  Judi Dench brightens  any film in which she stars.  The movie did not live up to the hype used to introduce it on it's first run some time back but it worked.....although I did not see the first run I bought the movie based on that hype. This is not a movie I'll put in my library to see again but it was well worth a one-time view.  My opinion may not be your opinion.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Once I started I couldn't put it down! A twist on Bejeweled-like gameplay (to prevent lock, you drag tiles up/down/sideways) with RPG elements (Gain experience to be spent on bonuses, collect gold to upgrade weapons and armor, and collect wood and stone to upgrade stores.) and &quot;quests&quot; to complete for each rank. This game is incredibly entertaining. And despite having freed the little guy, I'm sure I'm not finished playing.<br /><br />So if you like Bejeweled and RPG-style grinding, definitely a fun time.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|No little green men here. This is an American astronaut stranded on Mars when his crew inadvertently leave him behind. It's not as stupid a scenario as it sounds, but what ensues is an epic survival story of how the hero exists on what little has been left behind by the Mars mission. No palm trees or fish laden seas for this castaway, just barren rock and dust. The book is basically his log, which is written in a folksy and irreverent style, with great humour and pathos. There is a fair bit of techno-speak to give the book authenticity and it really is quite believable. You start to identify with him and root for him to survive. Meanwhile in Houston Texas, Mission Control has realised with a mixture of horror and joy that there is a survivor, one albeit balanced precariously between survival and untimely demise. They set about to try to bring him home and this naturally becomes the most watched event in history world-wide.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It has lots of dark humour, suspense and enough of a story to keep me turning the pages. The interaction between the Martian and Houston is very funny at times and has the kind of dialogue which you could imagine happening if this was a real life scenario. His journal relates his day to day activities, some of them routine but many of them ground breaking as he adapts to his predicament with stoic humour and extraordinary ingenuity. There are plenty of setbacks along the way. Most of us would have given up and taken the red pill long before the end.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book highly to anyone who wants something completely different from the routine survivor novel. It is really quite ingenious. I wish I had written it. The plot and story line have real credibility which makes the book much more than a sci-fi novel. In the end you have to love the guy. The actual book ending is a bit of an anti-climax, well it was for me anyway, but long before that, I was fully engaged and can forgive the author anything. I am glad I read it and I am sure I will read it again. I hope they make a movie out of it to be honest.
B007WPM7SO|4.0|I realized that I had seen this before, but even then I kept watching it.  It is well done, the war scenes are too detailed for my taste, but the emotional immaturity of the wife and then girlfriend is beautifully acted.
B002ZG976U|5.0|saw this for the first time on one of the 8pm movie channels. had to see it again and own it. anything with cher in it is a winner to me, love her acting (great in Mask). and christina aguilera is a good actor, shell get there eventually. her singing talent, tho, priceless. and shes beautiful. GREAT DANCING! great story about about a girl who lives in Iowa who needs change and has this talent and nowhere to go with it, so she skips town and starts over in LA. she started out as the ugly duckling and worked her way up to be the beautiful swan. good acting, good story, good lookin people. good stuff all around. i recommend!

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|i laughed pretty much 3/4 of this movie. funny that it came from the tv series from over 20 years ago with johnny depp and richard grieco, but anyone younger than 30 probs wouldnt know that. theres a 'cameo' from one of the original characters from the show. two, actually. anyhoo, i love everything about it - from beginning to end. great comedy/partial-drama about kids in highschool that werent exactly on the same sides and then going to a police academy some time later and becoming friends bc each one needed something from the other and they learn that friendship is important no matter what.. omg, thinking about it now make me smile. totally gonna watch this over and over again! :)
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I have seen this game and was glad to see it was the free app of the day. However, I was VERY disappointed when I realized there is NO HELP menu, instructions, etc. There is a game board with the available pieces and little dots to show where you can place something, but only certain pieces can fit in certain ways. Pop up hints or tips would be EXTREMELY helpful. I have deleted this app because it was not fun to learn as you go and never really understand strategy or even what the point is.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie NEVER gets old. It's a classic and always will be. A movie that shouldn't be missed.<br />The movie came in a matter of days.

B00O1SHMN0|5.0|I was in highschool when I first watched this movie. I had expected this to be one of the typical &#34;anime&#34; movies. Boy, was I caught off guard! I ended up with a miserable maldigestion - I wasn't intellectually mature enough at that time to understand the true implication of this movie. After I studied life science at a university, I have felt that the greatest feature of this movie is the dynamic imagination based on the essential understanding of &#34;life&#34;.<br /><br />The keyword of this movie is &#34;ghost&#34;, which is a synonym for the &#34;mind&#34;. In the world depicted in this movie, where the majority of the population has some parts of their body replaced by a machine, possessing a &#34;ghost&#34; is equivalent to being alive. In this movie, a &#34;ghost&#34; is born in the ocean of aggregated digital data. I do not find this part terribly outrageous, because even the modern science is completely incapable of answering &#34;the hard problem of consciousness (raised by David Chalmers etc.)&#34;, i.e., &#34;where does the mind come from?&#34;. The majority of the neuroscientists, actually, have abandoned the hope of answering this question.<br /><br />The human being can be regarded as an information processing system which is composed of two major subsystems - a nervous system and a genetic system. It is noteworthy to point out that the information processed by both systems consists of digital data. In the world created in this movie, people are capable of storing their own memory outside their brain in the form of digital data, which led to the protagonists' crisis regarding their own identity.<br /><br />The essence of sexual reproduction is the generation of a novel data sequence by shuffling the DNA code provided by a male and a female. This type of work is suited for computers rather than organisms, and that is exactly what happens at the end of this movie. At the museum, where the final battle takes place, the &#34;evolutionary tree&#34;depicted on a slate is torn by bullets, which leaves the word &#34;hominis(human)&#34;. I was amazed by the effectiveness of this scene, which portends an evolution of life at an unprecedented level. Life, at which pinnacle lies the human being, &#34;shifts to an even higher level&#34;. The grandiosity of this consummation is truly mind-blowing.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie will never become obsolete. To the contrary, it is probably in the future world, where many people have various parts of their body replaced by inanimate objects, where the true implications of this movie are truly understood by the viewers.
1932907009|1.0|To be honest, I couldn't finish this book. My eyes rolling around to the back of my brain wouldn't let me. Sure this man has \\"sold\\" spec screenplays, but this was also in a time when studios had more cash to just throw around at whatever ridiculous idea they found charming. Now they pinch their pockets and suffer from the chronic Sequelitis Syndrome. Snyder's only two produced screenplays? \\"Blank Check\\" and \\"Stop! Or my mom will shoot.\\" The latter having won the award for the WORST SCREENPLAY OF THE YEAR at the annual film mockery awards, the Razzies. I mean, come on people! Would you take any sort of lesson from anybody in any field who has won an award as the WORST on that subject? Might as well take a directing seminar by Uwe Boll. Their collaboration together would surely create a film that would have brought on the apocalypse. And this is also the moron that says \\"screw Memento!\\" at one point. Right, because would would Christopher Nolan know about writing screenplays? His career (which was kick-started by this film) have only gone on to make over 2 billion dollars worldwide, in only a decade. What's the combined gross of \\"Black Check\\" and \\"Stop! Or my Mom will shoot\\"? Embarrassing. He could only sell screenplays because his daddy had a name in the industry, and networked his way into convincing morons to buy his junk, ala used car salesman tactics.<br /> Oh, and \\"Save the Cat\\", an idea that Snyder so obnoxiously has coined as his own \\"original\\" creation, has been around for years as a \\"Pet the Dog\\" moment, as any of you 5 star reviewers would know had you bothered to spend any time researching classic story structure books and technique. If there is anything to blame for the decline of the art of cinema, it is belief in books like this absolute garbage, best used as kindling to start your next camping fire. I'd rather struggle 20 years to create something meaningful (which Snyder refers to as 'artistic vision' and, of course, rejects since it's clear he neverhad any of his own) than strangle my career with this \\"screenwriter's\\" advice. If in fact studios and Hollywood are determining this book as their be-all-end-all on screenplay writing, then I will gladly stay the course in Independent film and continue to create stories designed to move people, not guiltily shove handfuls of cash in my pockets as I sneak out the back door with my tail between my legs, ashamed of adding to the mountain of hack films we currently squirm through in the multiplexes. If your fine with doing this, then I suppose you might find \\"success\\", but everybody I know who truly loves movies for their stories and moral complexity, define \\"success\\" rather differently. Film is art, and this book, is the antithesis.
B00BY8DC2A|5.0|If something can be said for the Brand New Heavies its that personally I feel their funk style has grown,expanded and developed in time. While their first couple of albums in the early 80's had their moments,they were honestly a bit overrated as full on concepts. Some may debate that. Still the bands ambitions to introduce the musically collective live band spirit of funk/soul/dance music to a generation saturated with pre-programmed New Jack Swing. With such a noble musical statement of intent,how could any artist fully live up to it at such an early stage? Luckily time has been kind to them. Even the more pre-programmed music of today tends to veer in rhythmic intent to what the Acid Jazz era funk revivalists like BNH did in the early 90's. So an appreciation for what they do is very much in the air at this particular musical moment. So after seven years in the wilderness, Brand New Heavies have returned. And interestingly enough so has N'Dea Davenport.<br /><br />  Now the opening title song,\\"Sunlight\\",\\"On The One\\",N'Dea's marvelous performance on \\"Addicted\\" as well as \\"Turn The Music Up\\" and \\"Heaven\\" are all high octane, highly crafted horn packed bass/guitar oriented late 70's type funk-very much the love child of Earth Wind & Fire and Chic,meaning an explosively powerful combination with their own electric piano based jazzier spirit too.  \\"Do You Remember\\" is however my personal favorite here. Its in that same vein. But something about the way the melodies,bass lines and keyboards all overlap in this churning,pulsing harmonies hits exactly the right spot for this approach to the funk groove. The instrumental \\"Itzine\\",\\"The Way It Goes\\" and \\"Lights\\" go more for the high stepping,foot stomping end of funk. Still there's still that sleekness there with a strong Crusaders type vibe which is much appreciated. \\"Spice Of Life\\" is a well played attempt perhaps at fusing electronica based acid jazz with dub/reggae,but it is not my personal favorite here and probably not the strongest number on the album. \\"One More For The Road\\" ends the album with another strong funk groove-fusing the more high stepping with the high crafted.<br /><br />  There's an overall impression here that the Brand New Heavies are not going to be away quite so long this time around. In all honesty I haven't consistently followed up with every single one of their albums-especially those released after the new millennium rang in. For one,a couple of them were never released stateside. From what I have heard,there were attempts to re-up with new lead singers and on at least one occasion an attempt at a more guitar rock oriented type of sound. At the same time they kept returning to their roots,kept returning to the funk. And it can't be stated enough that they not only looked to improve their own take on the funk,but the progression of the genre as well. It is this sort of album that creates the overall impression that a strong funk revival of the type that originally bought the Brand New Heavies into existence might just be ascendant within this decade. This is a musical generation that needs to understand what funk is about instrumentally,the musical challenges and resulting joys it brings and provides. And if albums like this are to be part of that understanding,so much the better!the strongest number on the album. \\"One More For The Road\\" ends the album with another strong funk groove-fusing the more high stepping with the high crafted.<br /><br />  There's an overall impression here that the Brand New Heavies are not going to be away quite so long this time around.

B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk first came to my attention when I heard the song \\"Voyager\\" from their [[ASIN:B000059MEK Discovery]] album on a local community radio station. Compared to some of the very beige colored pop of that era and beyond,this type of new music had heart. It had a musical and rhythmic truth. And it was as much the funk as one could live! For a DJ duo whose sound of the time was built on densely layered samples I got this impression the entire \\"french house\\" movement served a similar function as Acid Jazz had before it: disguised terms for funk music. Of course Daft Punk made it clear on their first album that people such as George Clinton were significant inspirations to their musical vision. Of course any DJ/electronica artist could easily embrace Bernie Worrell's \\"video game\\" synthesizer sound and have. Daft Punk understand more. They understand the song craft, subtleties of harmony and thrill of innovation-getting their listeners to stretch their ears. And most of all they understand rhythm. After producing live and soundtrack work and remixes Daft Punk are back with a full on studio album. And the all the way live instrumental style of funk has finally arrived in their musical lives!<br /><br />  \\"Give Life Back To Music\\" is a creamy dance/funk number,right out of the bass/guitar mode of Chic of course yet done so well and not only that but puts a strong manifesto,even just by the title alone,to the function of funkiness in music as a positive force. \\"The Game Of Love\\",Within\\"-with its beautiful piano intro and \\"Beyond\\" really fascinate me because the vocals are still handled with genuine vocorders-NOT autotune. That means there's a strong sense of human harmony and range behind the electronic tones and,with that slinky jazzy smooth groove slower sound behind them make a nod at Herbie Hancock's very neglected 1980-1981 style of slower funk. \\"Giorgio By Mororder\\" is a true magnum opus. Starting with Giorgio himself being interviewed about his career as essentially an EDM innovator with an ear for strong rhythms and grooves over some scintillating funky dance music,this 8+ minute number explores everything from jazz Fender Rhodes piano solos to swelling synthesized funk/disco-dance/70's electronica type sound scapes-often at the same time. \\"Instant Crush\\" brings in Julian Casablancas for an in the pocket rock n soul type number-something I never really heard them do before. \\"Love Yourself To Dance\\" is a thick,grinding,stomping,out and out funk groove with Pharrell Williams. Of course he's right back with them on the first hit from this album \\"Get Lucky\\"-a great choice as its one of the (if not the one) strongest number here.<br /><br />  \\"Touch\\" is a very compelling number-melding Daft Punk's own melding of both the funk and polka ends of the disco-dance experience with Paul Williams' honky tonk/bar room pop sound for a musical hybrid that ends up grooving thickly as Heatwave's \\"The Groove Line\\",only with somewhat more of a swinging bounce. \\"Motherboard\\" and \\"Fragments Of Time\\" leap right out as heavy duty and explorative jazz/funk odyssey's of the highest order-combining complex electronic and live percussion with these broadly played electric piano and bass/guitar lines. \\"Doin' It Right\\" brings in singer Panda Bear for a layered drum machine boogie funk style-expanding even on their \\"french house\\" roots. The album end with \\"Contact\\",a loose ended combination of 70's funk with 90's drum n bass effects. With guest musicals Paul Jackson,Omar Hakim along with a massive symphony orchestra this album basically pulls together into the epiphany of Daft Punk's entire musical journey so far. I am unsure what electronica/house/DJ or even modern dance music lovers will make of this album. In it's most basic sense it is a full on funk and dance/groove/disco styled album-based fully in live instrumentation or electronics used in an organic fashion. But really that's the very fruit of Daft Punk's entire musical tree. To me,this is likelythe best album they've released so far. And exactly the type of music,being so based in funk's strong instrumental ethic, that the pop radio and charts need at the moment.the best album they've released so far.

B009NY43NY|1.0|Like many others, I have loved and cherished this series. Like many others, the last couple books gave me concern in how they felt somewhat rushed and of less quality than the first 9 or so. And like many others, I hoped that this last installment would make up for it with a spectacular ending with the richness of the earlier parts of the series.<br /><br />Like many others, I was hopelessly crushed and disappointed. I regret buying this. If you loved this series, do yourself a favor - leave this in the garbage and make up your own ending.<br /><br />I don't care about who Sookie ended up with in this - to be honest I was rooting for this pairing all along, but found most of the strong male characters to be acceptable as potential HEA material as well.  So don't think I'm whining because my \\"team\\" lost.<br /><br />This felt even more rushed than the last few, but worse - it felt like a completely different writer and universe. The style is suddenly changed from the previous books, and it did not work at all. The plot is weak and haphazardly put together, seeming more of just a collection of the major loose ends tied together poorly. The characters fall flat and behave bizarrely different than their personalities have been presented before. Some even offer direct contradictions to their former selves. It fails to ever engage the reader, and barely even engages the universe it was constructed in. It bends and breaks previously established facts and rules with little or no explanation. There is almost no character development at all - if anything I'd call it character regression, as if they unlearned valuable lessons they previously cherished.<br /><br />I had so much hope for this series. It spoke of tolerance and acceptance of those different than yourself, and had the potential to truly teach a lesson... And then this book took that and burned all hope to ashes. Tolerance and acceptance are thrown out the window. In the end, nothing is accomplished, nothing learned, nothing gained. You end up where you began with no meaning to the journey at all.<br /><br />Save yourself this smack in the face. Save your money. Do not buy this book.  Do not ruin the journey you began with this disgrace of a collection of words that dares to call itself a member of the Sookie universe. It does not belong, and should never have been published.nothing gained. You end up where you began with no meaning to the journey at all.<br /><br />Save yourself this smack in the face.

While this is about her experiences she inspires us to choose what is best for each of us and to empower others to do the same. She is a truth teller. I'm very proud of her focus on building coalitions of men and women to create change for both genders and break the old stereotypes that still exist. I co- facilitate GUTSY Women Retreats about speaking out to be heard and this is an excellent resource for participants.
081297381X|5.0|This book challenges your common sense. All the fallacies and biased view points that we have when analyzing risks.This book will take everything you know about statistics and rip them apart. I would highly recommend it for anyone who wishes to enter the financial or risk management not to give this book a miss.
B00985E3UG|5.0|didn't know you were being watched, manipulated and influenced by people whose only real interest in you is your dollars spent on their product? Why and how they do it is revealed in this book, and it was one I couldn't put down.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Just a classic &#34;feel good&#34; movie from the 80's complete with big hair and sweet kids. Good moral lesson to boot!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Easily accessible, fun and quick game that has unlock ables. Could use some sharper graphics, but I feel it is on purpose.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Excellent!!
B000F8O35U|1.0|I received a bad copy. The condition of the dvd is fine. It's horrible, a few of the scenes are actually out of sequence. I've never bought a movie where the scenes were out of order. How did that even happen? ?????
B005I7G3EM|5.0|I showed this movie to my daughter when she was five years old -- she STILL watches this movie at least 5-6 times/yr.  Great film for the kids watching an African game company catch animals for the zoos of the world.  The smoking and drinking were a bit much, but other than that a great film.

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was brilliant. I just loved the male pov. Drew...Drew...Drew! Damn you are a mess. I really enjoyed everything about this book. The early banter between Drew and Kate, his friends, family, the tender moments, a little bit of angst. Oh and let's not forget the steam factor in this book was ah-mazing! I really loved how this author actually had the hero speak to the readers, you totally felt like you were right there with these characters! Way to go Emma Chase! I will be re-reading this one!
B001HOF8AA|5.0|Imelda May is such a talent: with her tight group, her musical voice, passion, and energy are simply thrilling. If you haven't heard her version of rockabilly, this exceptional recording is the right place to start. And, believe me, it will be just a start: May is fantastic.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I recently decided to give this whole reading business a shot, and I must say Treasure Island was an enjoyable read. A bit slow and full of nautical terms I'd never heard and were hard to picture without running to Google, but overall, a welcomed escape to an island of good versus bad. It was interesting to see how much of today's ideas about pirates come straight from this book, and also how the characters seemingly change allegiance and blur the line between friend and enemy. I'm glad I read it!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert I cannot rate this book highly enough.  It is life changing, and should be considered by EVERYONE.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|[[ASIN:B00894K248 Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Blue 16GB (Sprint)]] I want that cell phone so much in my heart.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game takes me back to my youth! I loved popping quarters into the machine and playing for hours.<br />Buy it!
B000NDMRCS|5.0|We purchased the DVD The Day After Tomorrow for our library collection.  It is a wonderful addition.  Thank you so much
B00004T9UF|5.0|an album about what it takes to make or break a relationship that undergoes daily public scrutiny. the album faces the challenges of any famous couple and the ambiguity people feel towards each other once the media has done its worst.

B00BWYX2MG|3.0|Not a bad product but you need to use several coats on quality gloves. I reco 4-5 coats and you should also make sure the glove fits well. In other words if your finger isn't directly behind the part of the glove touching the screen it will not work....test it out fully before experiencing this at highway speeds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this website  so much in my Herat an  I won't have to go on Google because I have y'all all the time.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I thought this was intended to be a trilogy.  I was shocked when I got to the end & found another cliffhanger.<br />The book held my attention- I loved the first two- but was not as good as the others.  Too many sub- plots that were too difficult to believe.  But I'm hooked so, if and when #4 comes out, I will probably buy that too.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|We purchased the DVD Food, Inc for our library DVD collection.  It is a wonderful addition. Thank you so much
B00006690G|5.0|the album confronts the role of family in holding back or pushing forward the career of an artist; it tackles the set backs and the triumphs while being center stage, in the spotlight. it also takes on the emotional drain of being a leader and leading a life away from loved ones; the very people you try to impress might end up being the ones you let down. the role of an artist in compensating for emotional needs is explored and the various possible addictions that usually result are dealt with head on.
B005I7G3EM|4.0|Like most all of his stuff, have most of it as well, over 123 videos in all...like every one of them ...
B0037UUZQY|5.0|Bought this for my daughter as she loves the movie Entangled.  It's a beautiful doll, and my 5-year-old daughter loved it.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a great book I enjoyed all the books each in their own way. They all have something different to offer you while you're reading them!!!!

B001BR5NH6|5.0|We purchased the DVD Weird Science for our library.  It is a wonderful addition to DVD collection.  Thank you so much
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I don't generally play games on my phone, much less pay for mobile games. This happened to be free (yesterday 5-23-2013) and recommended by a website I frequent. Its a simple little game, but be warned, its highly addictive. I stayed up until 1AM playing it. If I went back in time and the game was $2.00, I would purchase it.<br /><br />On a sidenote I used to have a Windows phone. Minesweeper and Spider Solitaire came pre-installed. Those were a great deal of fun. If only those EXACT games were available on Android.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I don't know what I expected, but it was too noisey and the constant fighting became boring.  Wouldn't let my 9 yr old see it.
B005LAII12|5.0|hilarious. Mark Wahlberg & the beautiful Mila Kunis fit the bill and Ted (a true stoner) was so funny. I honestly didn't think I would like it having an animated Teddy Bear...count me wrong. Well worth the purchase...have watched it several times.
0765325950|5.0|brandon sanderson did an real great job taking over for robert jordan. i was very pleased to finally finish a story i started to read in 1995
0307200477|5.0|I thought this would be a great idea for my granddaughter's 1st birthday; and this book came within two days.  Unfortunately she just put it in her mouth
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I didn't know much about this book going into it, but I read it for book club and I loved it.  I don't want to give any spoilers (because I think the fun of this book is experiencing the book with &#34;surprises&#34; in tact), but this book reminded me of a fun, twenty-something DaVinci Code.  I am recommending this fun read to as many people as I can.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I gave it a 5 because I have all of the seasons and love this one just as much.  A must see!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is the basic Solitaire game. Easy to play and quick in Pace. Enjoy playing it for hours every day.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|especially the Dave Robicheaux Novels set in lower LA. I was surprised to see that he had 2 movies on DVD. The only reason I didn't rate it higher was the cinematography. If you enjoy his Robicheaux books you will enjoy the movies. Since the cities (New Iberia, Jeanerette etc) and landmarks (various streets, Bayou Teche, police/sheriffs office, the bridge etc) are not fictional its neat to bring them up on google maps and google images. Good cast with Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, & Ned Beatty.
0307744434|5.0|This is one of those rare books that you immediately fall in love with. Erin Morganstern has created a  fantastic world that the reader feels that they can actually become a part of.  The vivid descriptions of the circus make it feel mysterious and exciting. I have recommended this book to several of my peers as well as the other members of my book club. It truly is worthy of all Five Stars! The characters each are very distinct and build of one another to create a truly captivating and intricate plot. I could not put this book down, and have already read it through twice.
B004UPANGM|4.0|If you like Bruce Campbell type of humor then you HAVE to watch this.  Fun, enjoyable and very entertaining to watch!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Love Michael Buble, have all of his CDs, just had higher expectations. Let's just say I LOVE half of it and like the rest. Still going to see him in concert in September though! :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Keeps you busy try<br />ing to figure out an inventive way of knocking crates and other things down.  Very addictive trying to master next level
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I purchased this game for a grandson. He enjoys playing it when he visits. He has the game at home and can enjoy it when he sees me.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good app. Fun and entertaining. Like this game. Good graphics. Good music. Easy to play. Fun for all ages. Can't stop playing.
B001EBWITA|5.0|great movie watch it over and over. one of his best ever. also check out street kings another great keanu movie.
B00BR9UKVC|5.0|Though when i received the book, it wasn't hardcover. It was only paper-back...<br />But I've been wanting to read this book for a while, so i don't mind it... :)
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Bought it for my son and he kept insisting that the album was good. Actually, only one song is good. What a waste of my money. After a few days, I took the entire album on my iPhone and I started to like the song. I guess I just had to listen to all of them.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Amazing, but I finished an epic creation, and there isn't much to do, I was thinking that maybe you could add a save creation option, so that we can permanently have our greatest machines still with us, also, maybe a battle mode, where you battle the birds, while it gets harder as you progress...
B007IK44CK|5.0|Tom Cruise delivers a good performance, good supporting cast, great plot, well filmed. What more can you want from an action movie?
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I first saw this movie on PPV and I have to say this is the first movie that made me jump since I was a kid its about time. I went to the store and bought it and lent it to friends they all loved it good movie....
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|For all of u guys out there scared of getting this on tablet don't be scared it's worth the money
1909313033|5.0|I absolutely love this book, pugs are just great!!! I am sure that I will be reading it again and again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that it is really helpful in building and you can build really cool structures. It is awesome because you can join other people's game
B008XKSW7M|4.0|i watched the movie and the clarity was very good.  i enjoyed the comedy and i think others will as well
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|easy to use online and good story line but really an adult only item<br />nudity and blood warning. Have fun
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I read the book before seeing the movie and I have rarely found a movie better than the book that inspired it.  The action here is well done as are the special effects.  I was surprised at how small the role of Stephen Douglas was as compared to the book, But overall, it was enjoyable.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I have been wanting this cd for a really long time. Its really good. I listen to it almost everyday.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I find the game fun to play and like the options.  It is a solid game and easy to play
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One level builds on another makes it interesting<br />Couldn't stop playing till each level was done unless I had not.  Addictive!  Fun
B00882R744|5.0|highly recommend this album.  a must for any neil young fan.  especially a must for any vinyl collection as well.
B002PE0HCU|5.0|I've always liked this movie and was happy to see it again.  After seeing it as a child, it made me afraid of birds for several years. I have read the Daphne Du Maurier short story it was based upon and other than the title, there is little in common except birds attacking for no stated reason.  BUT the movie is well made, with wonderful actors: Tippi Hendrin, Rod Taylor, Angela Cartwright, Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Phleshette.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a fun game to play, very silly. It's a little hard for me, but just because I'm not that fast.
B005HSGB6W|3.0|It is a bit confusing in the first few chapters, but after chapter four or even after part 2, the story gets really good :)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Good read, just a little predictable but that doesn't bother me. I will be reading the next Will Robie story.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't wait for the next book in this series. There are both characters you love and those you hate in this book and you follow their lives over several years. Even though its fiction, I learned a lot about WW2  and that time period. Make sure you read these books in the right order.
B0078N2T8I|5.0|Splendid performances, eerie and disturbing but highly intelligent psycho-drama with an almost metaphysical tilt. Not to be missed. As fine a film as you may see this year.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I gave it a four because you cant use the app is you have no Internet but other than that, its great!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Is a excellent film, and to watch in your 3D Tv is just perfect, The colors, the histry, everything is awesome
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|My wife and I have had this camera for 5 years, and we wanted to get a larger memory card. This one works perfectly. No complaints.
B009R659L8|4.0|Very enjoyable, quick read! Not sure if she had written in a long time, but had read all her books fifteen or twenty years ago.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Install on my computer was fairly simple.  Only thing that I goofed on at first was syncing it with my google account... still not sure how google ties into it... but I guess google is everywhere after all.  Anywho - just remember that you'll need to go to your google account and create unique device/program passwords.<br /><br />Best part of all is the ability to remote from my phone into my computer which in turn can then remote into my work computer.  Granted, writing Java isn't too efficient from a Galaxy S3 touch screen... but still cool!
B00BESNKB8|1.0|Plot line is severely lacking, the acting (done by well known A-listers) is also severely lacking, the coreography is terrible and even the blood-n-guts doesn't look good. This is a travesty of martial arts movies, don't bother, its not worth a rental or even seeing it free. Plenty of better stuff out there...look elsewhere!
B003NTSBUG|3.0|Got good reviews on this from friends but I found it a bit long and hard to follow and never made it to the end.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|If you love Ben Stiller and have enjoyed all of his stuff to date you will love this movie.  The bad guy isn’t very deep but mean enough to not like him and even a bit surprised later to find you can like him less as the movie progresses, kudos to Alan Alda.  The rest of the ensemble do a good job of playing their characters without trying to steal the show and it is nice to see them doing good work still.  It is a good movie, not great and not a stinker but not sure I’d watch it more than once, a good rental to see actors you used to know doing their stuff.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the game is very good I like the selection of armors from the movie the only thing is bad for me is the hard way to get money but that dosent change it the game is good
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|IT feels like a combination of both Temple Run and Fruit Ninja. A great game indeed and very addicting would reccomend to anyone.
0553103547|5.0|epic storyline, easy to get into it. i was hooked from the first few chapters. i would recommend it to anyone who can handle this amazing storyline as well as the series
B005LAII62|4.0|This was one of those movies with a really cute trailer, the little boy with all the zombie stuff in his room, posters, clocks, lights, etc.  Turns out he is a boy that can see and talk to the dead and it doesn’t freak him out as much as those around him, even the ghosts are not freaking out they can be seen.  The animation is good through a bit gross, slimy, gooey and floppy corpse tongue, if you have a kid or wife that doesn’t like that sort of thing you might want to warn them.  The story was good and more original then some of the things that are out there lately, though the twist was easy to see coming (and I am often surprised in movie’s) so I would say it is a bit more of a kids flick than some of the other animation out there.
B002Z5FM74|5.0|I only ever get transcend jet flash thumb drives. It seems like any time I try another kind, it breaks or loses my files. I had one that even scrambled the words on my word documents. This types I have three of. It has yet to mess up on me. They hold a lot of stuff. They are a good cost and I even love the black and purple. It has a nice blue indicator light when it is plugged in so I know for sure when it has been ejected. This makes me feel safer about removing it. I keep one on my key chain which I have found to be handy. You never know when you might need to save something. It is a great thumb drive for sure.
B00CHILW64|4.0|I really liked the movie.  it was much better than expected.  The trailers did not do it justice.  The acting was magnificent and the story line kept me absorbed and in suspense.  Excellent movie!
0385349947|5.0|Good advice on work, homemaking, child care & self-evaluating from a successful young woman to others. Makes a great gift.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a work of magic she makes you feel like your really there .It's intense and electrifying .
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is great if you love challenge/step by step games<br />Most of my friends have this game.<br />It is also a great way to teach kids to follow directions.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't think I have laughed out loud during a book than I had with this one.  I could totally see this as a movie.  It was very Bridget Jones but from a male perspective.  Loved it!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is assume like every marvel game it's fighting and Spider-Man don't play games he will knock out thugs.<br />.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I thought I was ordering a movie level DVD.  I received a pirated version with MADE IN MEXICO ON THE BACK.  The picture on the TV screen was a match box size.  I would never buy anything again from these folks.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|great relationship between mother and son, I didn't get it at the start but it got  very interesting enjoy the read
B00425S1H8|5.0|Thanks works Great. Seems like it is going to hold up quite well.Very sturdy, very well builts.<br />wish it had a carrying bag but hey
B000FA675C|5.0|As wonderful as you might expect it would be.  Dan Brown really knows how to weave a mystery and move the action along in a riveting and totally engaging manner.  I believe I have read all his novels now, and I enjoyed every single one.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|How many times can you see a film and still love it....I don't know what the limit yet, believe I've viewed it at least five times over the years and still find it engaging.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely amazing book. To the teens that have something troubling them, or don't know where there place is. This book will help. I know it helped me. Please read!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie with a little humor mixed in for a good measure. Can't wait for the next movie to hit theaters because I know it will be awesome.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|I missed the movie in theaters, but picked it up on Blu-ray.  Excellent movie.  This is almost equivalent to The Expendables type action (Arnold is by himself though).  The story is basic, but the movie seems to flow well and the action is top notch.  \\"Small town\\" sheriff and his crew take on an FBI fugitive along the border.  Good way to bring Arnold back to the big screen.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I got this as a gift for a person who just adores Diana Krall's music she was thrilled to receive it.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I picked this up when it was the FAOTD, and I love it. I can log into my desktop from my Nexus 7, which allows me to access files and programs that aren't available for Android. I also need to access an Internet Explorer website for work, and there's no way to do that on Android except to use a program like this.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you can't rotate the screen, it's stuck in portrait view. I would just like to be able to view my screen in landscape view.
B005C0DHEY|2.0|I could do without the shaky camera while driving around.  This is a 30 minute documentary stretched out over a 2 hour period.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I waited in anticipation for this movie to be released on DVD.  It was just OK.  It was not scary and &#34;Mama&#34; was a being similar to what you'd find in a movie like &#34;The Grudge&#34;.  Strange plot holes.  The girls lived on cherries for five years?  Where did they find clothes?  Never left the &#34;Mama&#34; cabin and became feral.  Why was the doctor so sketchy?  Sad and illogical ending.  The acting was not bad.
B002NVELDQ|1.0|This glamourization of a sex driven ad agency culture glosses over the real damagè experienced by the participants in favor of an amoral tawdriness strictly designed to titillate.
0345529057|5.0|These paperback books retail at $9.99 each, and you're getting 4 of them for $20, so you're basically getting 2 books for free. The box is nice, featuring characters and scenes from the HBO series. I didn't have an issue with the type size either.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is just plain SILLY. I had to buy it because at Christmas time, I love watching it, but sometimes miss when it's on TV. Simple solution, just own the DVD and watch it whenever.
193700788X|3.0|It has been apparent, after reading the two Sookie Stackhouse books published previously to this one, that the author has no longer put much effort into the series.  Perhaps she was trapped in a contract and was rebelling by putting in minimum effort.  Perhaps the pressure of turning out one novel a year was too much.  Perhaps it is due to sheer arrogance.  Either way, it has been a disservice to her faithful readers.<br /><br />This book was okay.  It kept my interest and was a little longer than the rest.  Honestly, it felt as if the author paraded most of the past characters, most with brief walk-on roles, about just for old-time's sake.  The plot was bland and the \\"twist\\" was silly.  It was sad to see such a bland ending to a once great series.  Honestly, if I were not from the area where the books are based, I would have quit the series three books ago.<br /><br />Borrow from a friend or library.  Do not pay full price for this book.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|its a good game but I have not been Abel to save it. besides that its a great game and has a nice history
0812993845|3.0|The book was told from essentially 2 sisters' perspective. The sisters were not as likeable as previous characters from the author. The romance was...meh. The humor was...meh. The excitement...meh.<br /><br />Overall, this book ought to be purchased at a huge discounted price. Not worth full price. Previous books by the author are better!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I am by no means a \\"Daft Punk expert\\" or a huge fan of electronic/dance music, but I've liked some of the Daft Punk's more recognizable singles over the years.  Fans of Daft Punk were disappointed by some of their recent work, but I'm a fan of this new album.  The length and format of many of the songs on the album might not lend well to single format, but there are a couple of tracks that standout, particularly \\"Get Lucky\\" and \\"Lose Yourself to Dance\\", which feature Pharrell Williams.  Julian Casablancas of The Strokes fame also appears on \\"Instant Crush\\".<br /><br />The word that comes to mind to describe this album is \\"funky\\".  I really liked the retro use of guitar, as opposed to constant electronica.  I've seen a few reviews referring to the album as \\"disappointing\\", but again, I didn't really have any expectations going into it.  There might also be a generational difference in how it's perceived - there are a lot of musical call-backs to the 60's and 70's, which was before many listeners (myself included) were even born.  But we've seen other groups use electronica to explore past eras of music (Cut Copy and the 1980's comes to mind), so it's a welcome effort.<br /><br />If you view it as fun experience from start to finish, as opposed to worrying about genres and radio singles, I think you'll really enjoy \\"Random Access Memories\\".
B0052AC8C6|4.0|It was a cool movie to watch on a lazy sunday. The stoyline is cool and cute at the same time
B0085RZAZA|2.0|Pages and pages of description - not much dialogue, not much action. I was disappointed. The concept was interesting, but the execution less so.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was awesome! All of the kids in our class loved it. It was one of the best books we've ever read. It was an unusual book. We would like to read it again.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn writes about the current state of spywork and complications the FBI and CIA get into.  His descriptions and story lines are so current that it seems like I am reading what is actually going on in our world.
B00CAUH7UE|4.0|I'll be honest, I had a hard time getting into this book. But once I did, I was not disappointed that I read it.<br /><br />Give and Take looks at who are the most successful people in the world: givers, takers or matchers. What he found from all walks of life, those that are givers are more successful than takers or simply matchers. This is counter-intuitive and what makes the book so good. This book seeks to answer this question: Every time we interact with another person we have a choice to make: do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?<br /><br />While our culture tends to shun givers at the beginning, in the long run according to Grant, \\"Those who give first are best positioned for success later.\\"<br /><br />So what are givers? They are what Grant calls Otherish: \\"If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests. Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give.\\"<br /><br />I particularly found the chapter on why givers burnout very relevant to pastors. Here's what Grant said: \\"Principle of giver burnout: it has less to do with the amount of giving and more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving. Givers don't burn out when they devote too much time and energy to giving. They burnout when they're working with people in need but are unable to help effectively. Givers burnout not because they are giving too much but because they don't feel like their giving is making a difference.\\"<br /><br />Here are a few more things that jumped out:<br /><br />-When takers and matchers network, they tend to focus on who can help them in the near future, and this dictates what, where, and how they give. Their actions tend to exploit a common practice in nearly all societies around the world, in which people typically subscribe to a  norm of reciprocity: you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. If you help me, I'm indebted to you, and I feel obligated to repay.<br />-People are more likely to benefit from weak ties.<br />-You should be willing to do something that will take you five minutes or less for anybody.<br />-Takers have a knack for generating creative ideas and championing them in the face of opposition. Because they have supreme confidence in their own opinions, they feel free of the shackles of social approval that constrict the imaginations of many people.<br />-Here's the definite feature of how givers collaborate: They take on the tasks that are in the group's best interest, not necessarily their own personal interests.<br />-Even when people are well intentioned, they tend to overvalue their own contributions and undervalue those of others.<br />-Success doesn't measure a human being, effort does.<br />-Interest precedes the development of talent. It turns out that motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place.<br />-In roles as leaders and mentors, givers resist the temptation to search for talent first. By recognizing that anyone can be a bloomer, givers focus their attention on motivation.<br />-Givers focus on gritty people.<br />-When our audiences are skeptical, the more we try to dominate them, the more they resist.<br />-In teams and service relationships, powerless speech is actually more influential than powerful speech.<br />-Successful givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers.<br />-Takers tend to care more about benefitting personally form their jobs, givers care deeply about doing jobs that benefit other people.<br />-The perception of impact serves as a buffer against stress, enabling employees to avoid burnout and maintain their motivation and performance.<br />-Research shows that if people start volunteering two hours a week, their happiness and satisfaction, and self-esteem goes up a year later (Pastors, use this the next time you vision cast about serving at your church).<br />-People who initially give things away for self reasons begin to care about the people they're helping.<br />-Common ground is a major influence on giving behaviors (Pastors, use this idea when vision casting about giving and fundraising).<br />-People often take because they don't realize that they're deviating from the norm.<br />-When we try to predict other's reactions, we focus on the cost of saying yes, overlooking the cost of saying no (This has enormous implications on next steps in preaching).<br />-If many people believe in giving, but assume others don't, the whole norm in a group or company can shift away from giving (How a church becomes more giving).<br /><br />I saved this last quote because it has enormous implications on preaching, discipleship and next steps: \\"According to a study led by NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, people who went public with their intentions to engage in an identity relevant behavior were significantly less likely to engage in the behavior than people who kept their intentions private. When people made their identity plans known to others, they were able to claim identity without actually following through on the behavior.\\"<br /><br />I found this book particularly helpful because many of the people who are pastors, work in ministry or volunteer at a church are givers. Grant lays out what characteristics givers have, how to encourage them to reach their potential and not burnout. A helpful book for any pastor.

When you buy the physical cd you get the autorip feature, where you get the mp3s automatically...and they mail you the cd. So don't quickly click download; buy the disc and then download. You can throw the cd away if you want and save two bucks.

B00CRS88IO|4.0|Mr. Stevenson has written a extremely fast paced book in this one. So VERY different from the first one I read \\"Solstice \\".  It actually read just like a \\"Bond, James Bond\\" rip roaring tale.  The author fleshes out his characters right down to their suspenders. He doesn't miss a trick in what everyone is wearing and every uniform with every stripe in place. Just doing the research for it must have taken up a lot of time.The only thing I saw missing was the \\"shaken not stirred \\" Bond comment. His hero IS  Ian Fleming and he plays a true James Bond here. Although it won't give you much in the way of any \\"reality\\" , that's what a lot of books are out there for. This is one of those. All kinds of improbable scenarios  , death defying happenings, oh and yes, a woman.. wild red haired woman after this spy's heart and his gold.  Every plane, boat, ship, tank  and car... painted in living color on the pages. It was a lot of fun to read. I will be happy to read anymore in this venue Damian!<br /> I saw one comment about this is a book looking to be a movie... it is very much written that way and I think it could be one. A movie that is.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This was a bit macabre. A little hard to believe, especially the end. Read Girl Gone too...also a bit strange.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I read this in one sitting until 4am. Why? It was that good. Funny and sweet, it was so perfect in all the truths it told. Drew's POV is refreshing and unapologetic. And he's delicious in a very naughty way. I cheered for Kate who caught his heart.
0765348276|4.0|I wouldn't say there was anything particularly mindblowing or groundbreaking in this novel, but overall it was a very fun read.  He keeps a good pace throughout and the main characters were likable.  A great book for summer reading.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|What more needs to be said about this film?  Eight Academy Award nominations including Best Director and Best Film with all four lead actors receiving critical accolades: Bradley Cooper (best performance of his career), Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver and JENNIFER LAWRENCE.  Yes, I purposely put her name in ALL CAPS.<br /><br />I'll address the movie albeit in a short-shifted manner.  You want to know more about the film?  At this writing, you've got almost 700 (and growing!) perspectives on this Amazon site.  Pick one.  Enjoy!  Most of my review, however, will deal with the phenomenon that is Ms. Lawrence.<br /><br />\\"...Playbook\\" Director David O. Russell calls her, \\"an extraordinarily gifted, young, scary actress\\" who is<br />\\"wise beyond her years.\\"  One of the film's producers, Donna Gigliotti, says Lawrence is, \\"absolutely the most staggering talent I have seen come along in Hollywood in a very long time.\\"<br /><br />In the role of \\"Tiffany\\", a psychologically-damaged and sexually-addicted young widow, Lawrences juxtaposes subtle nuances of facial expressions and physical adroitnes with varied concoctions of emotional tones ranging from vulnerable to impulsive violence.  Her character is sometimes completely devoid of any civilized social skill.<br /><br />Lawrence's uber-consummate and creative on-camera professionalism is no surprise when you view her expeditious acting evolution from TV's Bill Engvall Show at age 16 to critically-praised films such as \\"The Poker House,\\" \\"The Burning Plain,\\" \\"Winter's Bone,\\" and \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  (I'll skip \\"Like Crazy.\\"  Her acting as that of a twice-dumped, passive girlfriend was surprisingly pedestrian.)<br /><br />Lawrence's physical beauty is unique and flawed.  She is<br />not stereotypically skinny and, quite frankly, looks like<br />she could kick the butts of some dudes.  She can look gorgeous or unintentionally-dorky depending on the lighting, tilt of her head or smile.  The best part of her body?  Her neck which appears longer than the norm giving her a regal appearance.  Don't forget great posture.  Seriously.  That's an important part in creating her disarming figure.<br /><br />And her voice? Breathy, without being overtly sexual, sometimes mildly grating, often accusatory in tone and occasionally a growling shriek of sorts will sneak in there.  From time to time, all four vocal characteristics meld together which creates an exclamation point on the most mundane dialogue.<br /><br />Saving the best for last.  Her off-screen persona is<br />spontaneously unbrideled and nonconformist.  She is less pretentious and politically correct than her peers.  Lawrence must be a nightmare for studio sycophants who wish to contain her ingenuous and candid observations about...well...seemingly anything.<br /><br />She flips people off, uses taboo words in public and openly despises the parasitic paparazzi.  After a Dior fashion shoot which was excessively photoshopped to make her appear unrealistically thin, Lawrence simply said, \\"real people don't look like that.\\"<br /><br />Charmingly charismatic, talented, beautiful, humorous and refreshing with her usual unfiltered honestly.  Keep being yourself, Jennifer.  Seems to be working.<br /><br />Oh, the movie she was just in, \\"Silver Linings Playbook.\\"<br />It was great.  Buy the movie from Amazon.  Buy two!  Give one to a friend!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Well written characters that will stick with you after you finish the book.<br /><br />Would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of y.a.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was so relieved that this Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor comes in a box that looks nearly identical to a Tampon box. When selecting a processor, the most important criterion is whether or not the box makes you want to jam the product within into your own box. As a woman, I can without a doubt say, that although the packaging is subtle, it certainly made me feel comfortable not only jamming it in my box, but going on long horseback rides and wearing white yoga pants while leaping from boulder to boulder.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It for a works great for checks for all my favorite places and destinations.It is very easy to use . thank you
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I bought the album for the songs 'Clown' and 'Next To Me'.  After playing the entire album, I realized that it's an instant classic.  Emeli's voice commands attention to the lyrics.  The music production suits her perfectly.  Just let the album play from start to finish...rinse, wash and repeat.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My 5 year old daughter, my husband and myself all love this game. It has become a great learning tool as well. Bella, only 5 in April, can name over 60 dinos,can sound our the names of the ones appearing in this game, and has become quite good at judging greater and less than equations. It is kind of a drag you have to have WiFi (which is why I rated it a 4 and not 5) to play but other than that totally worth it!

B009AMANBA|4.0|Clearly, this will go down as a great film through the subject matter, production and acting.  The exposé of Lincoln as a politician has been well analysed.<br /><br />For me, the film went on too long.  Everyone knows Lincoln was assassinated and I would have ended the film as he goes out of the door to go to the theatre, which would have increased the film's dramatic impact.  The epilogue of the final speech could still have been there, though for the international audience its preachiness was a bit over the top; the point had already been made in the film.

B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|My wife watched it to the end and was very intrigued. She gives it 5 stars. I was very bored, but continued watching about 75% of the way through just because it had so many good actors in it and they played so many rolls so well. But, I just didn't find it interesting enough to watch to the end.

0671449028|5.0|I bought this book for my son for his second birthday. We read it every night before he goes to bed. I love the way it rhymes and the story about the bedtime routine of the animals on a ship. It helps my son settle down for the night.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Anyone who has a dog they have adopted or raised from puppy can relate to this film story. Do we adopt them or do they adopt us.<br />I believe we are the adopted and we get to experience unconditional love and gratitude from our pets. We adopted Chad, our<br /> Golden/Yellow Lab mix and I can not recall a dog ever showing me so much love. I've adopted two other labs and they were very loving and close but Chad is beyond everything I've ever known with a Dog, Very much like Hachi. The story of Hachi brought tears to my eyes. I woud recommend this to every dog owner.
B00CRMWMZ0|1.0|I can't believe that I wasted $12 on this. There is not a single original song in this album. It sounds like something my grandmaa would listen to.
1594746168|4.0|This book captivated me when I saw its cover... and continued to do so during the entire, fairly-short read. It cleverly mimics an actual compilation of lost writings and is very convincing. As someone who frequently does read actual books about lost writings (such as Manly P. Hall's excellent short work on Paracelsus:[[ASIN:0893148083 Paracelsus, His Mystical and Medical Philosophy]]), there were times where I had to stop myself from running to the computer to Google an idea or person that I wanted to learn more about! Alas, the only shortcoming of the story part of this book (told with light narrative and \\"found\\" clippings from writings) is that it is fairly short and a little unfulfilling. In its defense, that is pretty much the norm with these things in real life!<br /><br />The second part of the book is composed of gorgeous anatomical illustrations that are really stunning. This is the coffee-table portion of the book and part of me wants these made into a poster. Mermaids, Minotaurs, and even a Sphinx--it's quite remarkable to look at these mythological creatures rendered anatomically; Hudspeth has outdone himself here.<br /><br />In all, this is such a cool, quirky book, exactly what I would stumble upon and buy at a real world bookstore in the days before Amazon. I liked it a lot and now want some more.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It doesn't get better than this!  Once again the old adage has been proved -truth is stranger than fiction.  And better.  Humans are amazing and to paraphrase a movie line - we are at our best when things are at their worst.  A great story, beautifully told.
0345803485|3.0|This type of book is never going to be great from a literary perspective but it's genious from a \\"know your target market\\" perspective. It strikes a cord with young women that more educated books don't and that's okay. Let girls have their badly written mommy porn. It's not Champagne but it's got a kick!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Some people forget how important sound is in a game. Not these folks! Very fun game that reminds me of Galaga, Galaxia, and Space Invaders. Nice, entertaining way to pass a little time, when you don't want to think too much or get too involved in a long story.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Many thanks to Charlaine Harris for a great ride throughout her Southern Vampire Series.  Although all of her fans wish it could go on, she brings Sookie to a satisfying place to end her story.  I purposely took my time reading this one - knowing it would be the last, and savoring it all the more.<br /><br />Although I'd guessed some of the outcome, I was glad that I managed to avoid the &#34;spoilers&#34; on the Internet since just before it's release.  I allowed myself to be pleasantly surprised at how neatly Ms. Harris tied everything up!  Three cheers and 5 stars for an awesome book!
B00003Q43A|5.0|I've always loved this movie and have had it since it was available.  However, I was at my neices house and saw this edition and it had extra scenes in it that my didn't, so I wanted this copy.  The shipping was great, the product in great condition and a wonderful price!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Had to replace the pads after 2 years of mild use. Have amazing sound quality and did fit comfortably.<br />Would not recommend for those who would want to exercise with these, due to weight, loose fitting and poor cooling.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|We use this all the time. I LOVE the Volume Crescendo feature that makes the volume start very low, and gradually increase. No more being jarred awake. We use the &#34;Happy&#34; ringtone for a very pleasant waking up experience:)
B007EDYN36|5.0|Yes, Kiss is full of Ego fueled whining babies and no doubt Peter Criss is the whiniest of them all but make no bones about it this book is well worth reading. Chock full of wonderful things I never about the man and the band. Is any of it true? Who cares, it's Kiss and we love Kiss. Nuff said.....
B0018PH3L0|5.0|My husband and I have had the VHS series for a long time, but it had been watched so many times, that it was ruined.  So, when I found this Collectors Edition, at the price it was listed, I had to have it and we are very happy with it!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.  the scenery, casting, costumes, etc. were wonderful.  The plot had way too many long blood and guts scenes, and the movie ends half way through the unexpected journey.  Bummer:(
B0027MJU00|4.0|I usually read nonfiction so this was my first foray into fiction.  I was surprised I couldn't put it down.  It kept me coming back to find out what happened.  I found the climax to be a little too \\"perfect\\" or unnatural or something.  Nevertheless, it was a great read and I'm planning to read her other books.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|such an innovative idea for a movie!  the concept is mind blowing and the cast did a wonderful job pulling it off! very very cool movie!

B004RJMUJO|1.0|completely worthless!  Crashes on launch!  this program is entirely worthless!  that's right, running NOTHING is better than eating the space for this, as they both do the same thing - NOTHING!
B000W4KT64|5.0|I loved this movie. I loved how the girls where &#34;real sized&#34;. The actors where all great and very entertaining to watch.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|It's always refreshing to see an artist step out of their comfort zone and try something new. The great ones always do and it's with this ambitious spirit that Keane released this 2010 EP. Being a huge fan of the band's previous three records, I was hopeful that this would continue their streak of mixing gorgeous melodies with subtle experimental flourishes.<br /><br />Then I gave it a listen. Rapping. The Rocky theme. Singing in Japanese. An entire track of ambient noise. I'll give them this: those elements were certainly unexpected. They also feel incredibly forced and self-indulgent, something that you could never accuse the band of being before. Before this each album had shown signs of growth and branching out, yet they always complimented the songs and didn't feel tacked on. Unfortunately they add a level of cheese to Night Train that makes it hard to rally around. \\"My Shadow\\", \\"Stop for a Minute\\", and \\"Clear Skies\\" are all decent and sound much more natural; they're allowed breathing room and come off as taking the best of the band's previous work and melding it together. These are definitely the tracks to start with and should be easy for any listener to adjust to. Everything else is a gamble that you may or may not enjoy.<br /><br />Thankfully the band was able to use this EP to get these ideas out of their system, leaving them free to make Strangeland, which is a brilliant and resonant album that does everything right. I have to give them credit for trying something new but just because it's different doesn't automatically make it good. This step was unnecessary but thankfully there are a few salvageable tracks that save it from being a complete throwaway.
B000005RU2|4.0|First of all I am not a huge fan of Deep Purple! So this might not be a fair review. The remaster is OK, vinyl is still better. There are a few bonus tracks included on this Disc. Unless you're a die hard fan wanting to have this on disc I would not bother buying this. Listen to the Album!
B009J3K4MI|5.0|This is ridiculously good, especially now that it is well under $100.  Terrific music, disc after disc after disc, and at barley over $1 each.  It's insane. No one is going to like every one of these--it's a broad selection of many different types of music.  That's on purpose, of course.  I'm sure they hope you will find something new that you like and then buy more of that type of music.  If there's a disc you really hate, throw it out the window. Use it for a coaster, give it to your neighbor. There are plenty more you really will like.<br />  Anyway, the overall quality is fantastic, and I mean the material, the recordings, and the performers.  People who give this less than 4 stars...? No doubt if someone gave them the Hope diamond they would complain that it's too heavy, or the blue doesn't match their favorite blazer, or some such.  This is glorious music at a giveaway price (for how much you are getting).  The Phillips, Decca, Mercury boxes are also very good.  It's a good time to be a classical music fan!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I especially like the saving of Web pages and that it updates to all my devices.<br />I like the ability to have checklists.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I enjoyed the beginning season of the show, but eventually the story line became redundant and a lot less interesting.  Finally, it looked like the writers seemed to realize the show wasn't developing the characters and the story wasn't &#34;going anywhere&#34;, and it has improved greatly.  I have enjoyed the addition of Michael Fox.  His &#34;difficult&#34; and passive aggressive character has added to the story quite well.  I hope you will continue the series and working on the story line.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|We took our oldest daughter to the movie theater when this movie came out so we were waiting in anticipation for it when they released it on video. This particular DVD is the 3D version and so make sure your DVD player and TV support it, otherwise I absolutely recommend this movie.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|If a sweet and comedic movie about a mother and son going on a road trip sounds like something you would be interested in watching then you must watch Guilt Trip.. Two terrific comedic actors doing a great job entertaining in roles that we have enjoyed seeing them in before..  Good story line and plot, the writing is better than expected, and the chemistry between these two is spot on.  I'm really glad i rented this.
B005HSL626|5.0|So I have seen this in game rooms all over the place and have never played it before. But I figured &#34;what the heck&#34; and gave it a start. OMG!!! I tap the the title to start it and I might as well say forget the world because I will play for hours trying to get higher and higher scores. I went 3 hours one time without really stopping. Dang!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|didn't really like this game for at least a 4 year old. but it could be fun for and older child

B002VRZEYM|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie in pieces, hard to swallow all at once given the nature of the subject. it's certainly a must-watch for Americans.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|This ablum is amazing I have listen to the entire album atleast 12 times already I love how 30STM keeps changing up there style very uplifting and inspiring album cant wait til a live concert hearing only downer is that its 45 mins long :( still Bright lights, up in the air, do or die, city of angels are the best tracks on this album :) LOVE THIS BAND
B005AV93JI|4.0|Overall a very good read and an interesting albeit flattering account of what may have happened to Chris. A bit of back-tracking on the author's previous published accounts of what may have happened but he writes it well and takes full responsibility of previous mistakes. My own take is that from reading this and other accounts I wouldn't be so forgiving of Chris's actions and I really felt for his family although I would stop short of saying the author is forgiving of Chris' behaviour. I believe that each reader will have a different opinion and the author gives his own to enable the reader to think about the facts and come to their own conclusions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An awesome game it is kinda like temple run but you don't have to tilt your kindle I think it's awesome also because I just think it's cool
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|fun app. good images easy to follow instructions. can't wait to play the sequel. I recommend this game . epic adventures has good games
1427210241|5.0|This is book 14 in the series. Must ready or hear the others to fully get the best out of this reading. I love the narators and love that the same narators do the whole series.
B005IYNQAY|3.0|I really enjoyed Ender's Game and looked forward to reading this novel for quite some time. Overall the book was good, albeit a little out there with the subject matter. Author successfully creates an atmosphere where the reader is forced to deal with a lot of the themes from the first novel and presents similar situations in a different light. While I would say it is not what I expected, it does make you want to continue reading the series.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Is fun but I have to watch the cubes because it can make me a little seasick.  Fun tho. I freeze doing it and that runs up the time.

1250012570|3.0|What an intense first prologue. It really captures what the book is like. \\"Set over the course of one school year in 1986, Eleanor and Park is the story of two star-crossed misfits - smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.\\" Eleanor and Park didn't immediately draw me in; it's a book that starts slowly. You don't realize that you're absorbed until it's too late, just like Eleanor and Park don't realize how much they care for one another until it's too late.<br /><br />That said, contemporary romance is really not one of my favorite genres, and as I was reading Eleanor & Park I remembered why. It's a better romance than most, obviously, but it was still really sappy and unrealistic at times. It was kind of like insta-love. I could really see how Eleanor and Park might go from ignoring one another to being friends, but the romance, the central part of the story, just didn't work for me. How could they suddenly love each other so, so much after like two weeks? It all felt forced, and the construct of them reading comics together didn't feel real to me.<br /><br />I did like the contrast between Eleanor's home life and Park's home life. Park's family is basically perfect, except for some minor quarrels with his father, whereas Eleanor is living in a tiny home with her mother, siblings, and her horrible step-father. But the thing is, even that didn't feel right to me. Nothing about this realistic novel seemed realistic. There are fantasies that feel more realistic than Eleanor & Park, if that makes sense. The world created in some fantasy novels just works, but it didn't in this novel. I also didn't understand why Eleanor's mom put up with her second husband, who's clearly a jerk. The book isn't set in the 19th century; it's set in 1986. There's such a thing as a divorce, as the police.<br /><br />But the thing is, in some ways, I really liked Rainbow Rowell's writing style even though so many aspects of the novel didn't work for me. I think she has major potential, but this one just didn't work for me. But she is a good writer, and another book could be very good. She already has one other novel, Attachments.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting Eleanor & Park to be very good and very life-changing. It was neither of those.  What it was was full of cliches. The whole love-at-first sight thing can work sometimes, but it didn't work in Eleanor & Park. I got really annoyed with both of the main characters. Also, there seems to be a thing to set YA fiction in the late 80's and early 90's, so that you can have mix-tapes and Walkman's. As far as I can see, that and the music they were listening to was the only reason that Eleanor & Park is set in 1986. So the time period really didn't work for me either.<br /><br />(Sigh). I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't. At times it was even cringe-worthy, and I struggled with finishing it. It was a real disappointment to me, although I will say that it was very gripping and the later sections were a bit better. I also liked the way the book ended, and the second half redeemed itself a bit. For the type of book that it is, Eleanor & Park has a great ending, but overall it left me wanting something more. Thanks to St. Martin's for providing me with a review copy.<br /><br />www.novareviews.blogspot.com

193700788X|5.0|I know that the ending of this book will not set well with the diehard Sookie fans.  However, an author has the whole story line in mind when the books are written.  Charlaine Harris does not disappoint!  She takes the series to her logical conclusion and for that I give her a High Five.  As to her fans......put on your grown up panties and deal!!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|1st half or so of book contains survival techniques-some more useful and interesting than others. I mean, why I need explanations of using plate mail armor and old military grade flamethrowers as well as underwater combat seems a bit overkill but I suppose that's the point of a survival manual;) My real enjoyment came at the second half of book describing all the recorded attacks thru history. Perhaps that's where plate mail armor has its relevance if it was indeed used in Medieval Times?

B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely HILARIOUS!!! Loved the author's sense of humor throughout the entire story. OMG, I cannot tell you how many one liners I highlighted in my clippings...<br /><br />\\"Dr. Kevorkian was just trying to help his patients too. And we know how that all turned out.\\"<br /><br />There were so many others that were much funnier, but I cannot post them in good conscience as the educator in me worries that little eyes might accidentally find this!<br /><br />So, this is a story about a guy, Drew, who thinks he has it all...drop dead gorgeous looks, a high power job, money, friends, family and a different women each night of the week. Then he meets Kate and his world will never. be. the. same.<br /><br />The author did a great job with character development...And I loved all of the characters, Even Drew. Yes, he started out as a womanizer that was so full of himself it wasn't even funny (ok, yes, it was totally funny, but in the haha sort of way), but he did not make any excuses for himself and he was straight up honest about. It just took the right woman to show him the errors of his ways...<br /><br />\\"She's like a Rubric's Cube. So frustrating at times that you want to toss it out the g**d*m* window. But you don't. You can't. You're compelled to keep playing with it until you figure it out.\\"<br /><br />This book was totally engaging and had all the perfect ingredients to make a five star book!

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  For a movie with a 158 minute running time, I felt like I was just starting to get into it.  In a very good way.  A very deliberate film, there are no wasted moments.  David Fincher was born to direct mysteries/thrillers.<br /><br />If story starts and ends with characters, then actors play a vital role in the success of a film.  If we accept that premise, then Dragon Tattoo is a huge success.  Rooney Mara deserves all the credit in the world for this performance.  I had previously thought that Michelle Williams in My Week with Marilyn was the only choice for the Best Actress Oscar, but Ms. Mara has made me realize that she is an actress to watch going forward.  Every choice she makes never betrays the character.  I also think that's why the film needs the violence and brutality it has.<br /><br />At no point are any of the scenes gratuitous.  Yes, they may be uncomfortable for some, but in no way should they be done without.  In fact, without them, the character of Lisbeth Salander comes across as unrealistic and two-dimensional.  If movies are in fact to invoke the senses, which is in turn vital to any visceral experience with watching a movie, then the audience is in the best place to understand the character, which means they are in the best place for understanding the story.<br /><br />As I said before, David Fincher is born to direct these kinds of films.  Every clue we the audience need is available (like in Se7en).  He plays no cheap tricks, yet he doesn't offer up the clues easily.  If ever there were a movie that required you to be an active audience member, this is it.<br /><br />Don't even get me started with the technical aspects.  The cinematography is beautiful and the editing... let's just say there's a reason it won the Oscar.  Rarely have I been more confused, horrified, and moved by a movie, all the while loving every minute of it.<br /><br />This is definitely David Fincher'sbest work since Zodiac or Fight Club. The Social Network may have gotten all the attention the year before, but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deserved all it got and more.<br /><br />I certainly hope we get the follow-ups, with director and appropriate cast intact.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|The DVD quality was real good which surprised me since it was done in Mexico. Nothing against the Mexican people, but thought maybe it was a bootleg. But pleasantly surprised.
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|This is my favorite CCR album, and yes I also own Chronicles One but I don't care, I bought Cosmo's Factory anyway because that's how much I love this album. The 40th anniversary edition includes some bonus tracks that are not essential but worthy. The version of Travelin' Band is a live in the studio recording made after Cosmo's Factory was released. The liner notes indicate it may have been recorded for lip sync TV appearances. The live version of Up Around The Bend shows the power the band had on stage. The version of Born On the Bayou is a bit of an oddity. CCR are in the studio with Booker T & The MGs. It's not as incendiary as you might expect but it's more of an curiousity than an essential track. The bonus tracks are ones you will very likely listen to more than once. The booklet is OK but it's just the kind of self-laudatory text that unfortunately accompanies many of this kind of \\"anniversary\\" reissues. But this is about the music, and this is the best from one of the best bands of its time. I just love it!
B0000541AM|5.0|The directors cut adds animated cut scenes which piss most fans right off. DONT BUY THE DIRECTORS CUT DVD or BLU-RAY version.<br /><br />On the down side this version only contains a 2 channel mono soundtrack(which is still better than the rehashed cut scenes)<br /><br />The video has been remastered and looks flawless. The  films cinematography is astonishing, great angles and lighting.<br /><br />Come out to buyuuuy this version if the film, if you don't... you're crazy!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I probably can't expound upon or further illuminate anything you've already seen or heard about this film.<br /><br />But it's just such a fun film that I wanted to chime in with a positive review.<br /><br />It's great even if you haven't seen the individual films that led up to it.<br /><br />One of the great superhero movies!

B006BG7RI0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all-time. That said, I probably can't expound upon or illuminate further anything you've probably seen or heard about this film.<br /><br />But I wanted to take the time to comment upon the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />Many of the special features are holdovers from previous formats, but they are great for both first-time and repeat viewers.<br /><br />The box itself is a little cumbersome, but all it requires is some creative planning when it comes to organizing and displaying your movie collection.<br /><br />The video has never looked better. It's safe to say that detail is vastly improved from the DVD transfers. The image is cleaned up from damage and specks while maintaining the natural grain that should accompany the film. Watching it the first time on Blu-ray was like watching the movie for the first time. This is definitely the best the film has ever looked.<br /><br />I can't speak to the audio, as my set-up at home is not adequate.<br /><br />A pack like this or the 50th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition of Lawrence of Arabia will definitely be the crown jewel of your collection. It's only icing on the cake that Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all-time!

Clarity is at an all-time high for this movie and its formats over the years.<br /><br />As for the film itself, this is David Fincher at his best. Moody, gripping, well-acted, and beautifully shot, Se7en is a movie everyone should see before they die. I don't say that about many movies, but this is a one-of-a-kind film.<br /><br />Give this one a try ASAP.

B004T0XYM8|5.0|There are many good reviews that detail the film itself.<br /><br />I just wanted to take a brief moment to echo those and call attention to the Blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />I've owned this film in many formats, and I finally feel as if I'm watching it as it was intended. Clarity is vastly improved with natural grain intact. Colors are warm/cold, light/dark where necessary. The film's color schemes finally shine in their true glory.<br /><br />I don't have an adequate sound system to judge the audio, but I can tell you that dialogue that was muffled or overshadowed on my previous formats finally emerged. In particular, the scene at the farm picnic at the beginning of the film seemed brand new to me.<br /><br />So for those looking for some feedback on the Blu-ray edition, know you can purchase it with great confidence: the film has never looked better!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book was a bit slow. One of the features I really liked was the fact that the author created the story in format as a letter to an unknown character.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|Anybody that knows heavy metal music already knows the story behind Testament's \\"The Formation Of Damnation.\\" It is the group's ninth studio recording, but their first since \\"The Gathering\\" was released all the way back in 1999. It is also their first record of completely new material to feature original axe virtuoso Alex Skolnick and bassist Greg Christian since Testament's \\"Low\\" came out five years prior to the above-named release (in 1994).<br /><br />So that much is obvious. But what you might not have known is that \\"The Formation...\\" is a not just a spectacular comeback album, it is a spectacular album period. Easily one of the best \\"true blue\\" thrash releases of the new millennium, this fine effort is filled with great riffs and even greater solos. As such, metalheads everywhere should be found drooling when listening to \\"The Formation,\\" and agree with the fact  that it is a highly contagious and instantly memorable affair, and one that easily ranks alongside the group's all-time best material.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"For The Glory Of...,\\" an instrumental introductory piece that is thoroughly thunderous, except for its use of nifty melodic guitar leads near its end. Next comes \\"More Than Meets The Eye,\\"which,with its catchy gallop, fiery, chugging licks, steady, staccato bass lines, and rhythmically martial drum beat, just might be mistaken by some fans for being an Iron Maiden b-side if not for only frontman Chuck  Billy's visceral, and near death metal-worthy growls. And the song is also further  highlighted by a blistering melodic solo section, and a catchy  vocal refrain. (It is darn near impossible not to sing-along to its\\"ooh\\" and \\"woah\\" bits.) \\"The Evil Has Landed\\"sounds similar, augmenting a wealth of strong, crunching riffs with a soaring, wailing, and epically  twiddly guitar solo that rips the air like a serrated knife. The title track, then, stands out for quite possibly being \\"Formation\\"'s heaviest number. Its thunderous, pounding rhythms, blistering, machine-gun fast picking, and tight and precise double kick drumming attest to that. Another ripping, harmonic guitar solo is also included, here, as is a bunch of strong, bobbing hooks (produced by a galloping beat that interlocks with staccato guitar leads). And \\"Formation\\" (the song) also features a lengthy,strung-out,yet decisively non-hardcore mid-song breakdown.<br /><br />\\"Dangers Of TheFaithless\\" marries some catchy, \\"Enter Sandman\\"-era Metallica-reminiscent chugging with a hooky, Anthrax-style call-and-response shout and a funky-sounding bass line that snakes its way through the arrangements. And it is all capped off by the record's best guitar solo -- and what an amazing solo it is, too! It is of the epically epic, dive-bombing, and shred-happy variety, thus making it fifty-plus seconds in length. Although not quite as irresisitble as the above, the subsequent \\"The Persecuted Won't Forget\\" is another big standout track in that it allows Testament to really flex their brutal, old-school thrash muscle. Indeed, aside from some nice, Maiden-ish harmonies and pair of melodic solos around the song's mid-section (which are necessary in order to break up the  tune's monotony), this is one scorching, and very breakneck speedster from beginning to end. \\"Henchmen Ride,\\" then, continues in this same vein, as it is an Eighties-era thrasher that finds the guitarists continuing to crunch away at blazing speeds. (And it kicks off with a small-ish, but  nevertheless impressive  drum intro, too.)<br /><br />Next up, \\"Killing Season\\" might feature some more really memorable vocal patterns and instinctively infectious choruses. But again, it is the guitarists -- Skolnick and Eric Peterson -- that mainly run the show, here, by uncorking some big, fat, juicy riffs and positively air-guitar-able melodic soloing throughout. Then, following the hefty chug and churner that is \\"Afterlife,\\" comes \\"F.E.A.R.,\\" which overflows with more blistering thrash picking and surprisingly fast and brutal double bass blasts. Another excellent solo is included here,too, and so are some mid-tempo (and, again, non-hardcore), chugging breakdowns that, together with the inclusion of sing-songy vocals (and a catchy,shouted refrain of \\"Fear! Fear!\\"), make the track's choruses truly unforgettable and epic. The album then concludes with \\"Leave Me Forever,\\" a thoroughly mid-tempo and brooding number with an ominous, grumbling bass line.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that it maybe should not have taken nine years to make, but \\"Formation Of Damnation\\" is nonetheless an excellent album. It easily ranks amongst the top twenty metal albums released in 2008,and is also very likely the year's best comeback record. It might be said year's finest piece of pure/traditional/old-fashioned thrash metal, but it sure comes close to being that. (It does not usurp Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" for being the winner of  that category; but, then again, no album does.)isingly fast and brutal double bass blasts.

B0085RQLXK|4.0|With Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler moonlighting as a celebrity guest host (Simon Cowell's replacement) on you know which American reality show, and the band having not released an album of entirely new material in the better part of a decade, many music fans probably forgot about Aerosmith, or at least thought that they had run their course (and understandably so, too). But once Tyler bailed on the T.V. show, cries of \\"sell-out!\\" dimmed as the Blue Army immediately forgave him and looked forward to a new album and at least one tour from their favorite hard rock group.<br /><br />Poised to take the world by storm with one heckuva comeback, Tyler and the gang did just that with \\"Music From Another Dimension,\\" their first new studio record in over eight years. And this effort might not be quite what you were hoping for it to be, but hey, when an album undergoes as much pre-release hype as this one did, it is almost impossible to expect it to live up to it. But what \\"Music\\" DOES do, however, is feature all of the characteristics that the band has relied on since the early Seventies. Like saucy, sleazy guitar licks, exceptional solos, Tyler's trademark wail, fat bass, workmanlike drumming, and offensive lyricism. Hence, it is definitely a release that is all-but sure to please and satisfy all of Aerosmith's hungry fanbase.<br /><br /> \\"LUV XXX\\" is an insanely catchy album opener with a funky, hard-rockin' main guitar lick and some insanely hooky and memorable vocal patterns. And the song is further highlighted by a batch of good guitar soloing that is tacked on into the mix near the end. Next up comes the very, very Rolling Stones-esque rocker, \\"Oh Yeah,\\" which has some really catchy vocal patterns (including some wailing female backing vocals), a bluesy, and even borderline wailing solo, and some jazzy-sounding brass horn flourishes. Then, following the mostly unremarkable and forgettable \\"Beautiful\\" comes \\"Tell Me,\\" a bluegrass-flavored acoustic strummer with dramatic drum fills and Steven Tyler's wailing, upper-register vocals. A catchy, staccato guitar riff introduces the next song after that, \\"Out Go The Lights,\\" which leads the way, and flows into a cowbell-tinged groove, before uncorking a good, shredding guitar solo. Some more female vocals pepper the arrangements, as does some wailing harmonica soloing. And this number, while admittedly a bit on the overlong side, is a mightily catchy one, as it overflows with terrific hooks of all kinds.<br /><br />\\"Legendary Child\\" is one of the set's biggest highlights, as it sounds almost as if it could have been lifted wholesale off of a Led Zeppelin recording, except for the fact that it has some Ozzy Osbourne-influenced singing. Of the eight songs that remain, three are ballads. \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" is a lovely and soaring acoustic ditty; \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" might have an AC-DC-esque song title, but it is, in actuality, a southern rock-flavored duet with Carrie Underwood (the season four winner of \\"American Idol\\"); and \\"We All Fall Down\\" is a placid, piano-based number with soulful vocals. These three ballads are almost overshadowed, however, by tracks like \\"Street Jesus,\\" which is the album's epic centerpiece that clocks in at six-plus minutes in length. It is a surprisingly up-tempo piece that rocks harder than anything else on the record, and features a tasty, pyrotechnic-esque trade-off guitar solo section.<br /><br />And there is another handful of noteworthy mentions that round out the rest of the album. Track ten, \\"Lover A lot,\\" finds the aforementioned Led Zeppelin influence coming back as strong as ever, and boasts a John Bonham-approved drum intro followed by plenty of pronounced, dirty/grungy-sounding bass grumbles, and really catchy and addictive choruses. \\"Freedom Fighter\\" (which has guest backing vocals from Johnny Depp, of all people) is another feel-good, up-tempo rocker peppered with some jazzy, Jerry Lee Lewis-styled piano breaks. And, finally, there is \\"Something,\\" which has colorful slide guitar and organ runs amplified by some of Tom Hamilton's best, heaviest, and meatiest bass lines. It also boasts guest percussion work from the aforementioned frontman (Tyler).<br /><br />\\"Music From Another Dimension\\" comes up short of being 2012's best comeback album, and it isn't the year's best pure hard rock recording, either. (It ranks second in both of those categories to Soundgarden's \\"King Animal.\\") And plus, \\"Music\\" is not quite as heavy as this reviewer would have liked it to have been. But if any of this sounds like I am dissing on this album, I'm actually not. After all, it is irrefutable proof of the fact that If you like your hard rock raucous-yet-simultaneously-tuneful, rock-ready, energetic, infectiously hooky, meticulously well-crafted, and professionally played, it would be a huge mistake to write off and/or forget about Aerosmith just yet.s \\"Something,\\" which has colorful slide guitar and organ runs amplified by some of Tom Hamilton's best, heaviest, and meatiest bass lines.

B00BEJX8MS|5.0|This story was first published within the Thieves' World universe in 1982, published in altered form as part of Morris' novel,\\"Beyond Sanctuary\\" in 1985 and then again in 1987 in \\"Tempus,\\" introducing us to the first anthology of \\"The Sacred Band Of Stepsons\\" and the ever cursed Tempus.<br />  This is a pivotal tale and not to be missed. \\"Wizard Weather\\" would make for a great starting point for those who are newcomers to the series and is a treat for existing fans.<br />  As is typical for Janet Morris, she delivers an extremely well written story that is strong in plot and character and carries the reader along in her journey.<br />  Due to mature content, this should be considered an adult read. \\"Wizard Weather\\" is a gift for those who seek to immerse themselves within a carefully constructed universe that is unparalleled in its content and complexity.

I was expecting it to be awful given my opinion of director Baz Luhrmann's prior work, notably the insipid \\"[[ASIN:B000077VR3 Moulin Rouge!]]\\"<br /><br />Although there were considerable liberties and abridgements taken with the story, the core of it was definitely preserved and, more importantly, the contradictory but simultaneously elegaic and exuberant tone of the novel was preserved.<br /><br />Earlier adaptations, such as the [[ASIN:B00AEFY66U 1974 version with Robert Redford]], were so plodding as to be almost unwatchable. The 1974 movie makes the fatal mistake of being too realistic, reducing the whole affair to something like a Lifeiime television movie. That's exactly what you get from the novel if you distill the bare plot and characters but lose the tone, because the novel is ultimately structured as a nostalgic remembrance of lost hope. The deliberately unrealistic excitement of a period in time when anything seemed possible is the perfect environment for Baz Luhrmann.<br /><br />In the new version, the cinematography and costumes mesh well to convey the excitement of the Jazz Age at its peak.<br /><br />The music was surprisingly appropriate, the exact opposite of \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" with George Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" -- one of my all-time favorite pieces -- as a significant recurring motif. Even the new music, especially \\"Young and Beautiful,\\" fits in well.<br /><br />The movie is visually very impressive in a way that the novel cannot be, but it does conjure an imaginary and unrealistic world of grandiose excess that is worth seeing. The 3D gimmick is kind of pointless, but that is true for most movies.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, the opening credits begin in rough black and white with uneven lighting and flicker, very much like watching an old movie actually made in the 1920s, before the credits change to sharp and colorful gilded art deco designs. The effect is clever, making all of the flashy color that is the movie seem almost dreamlike, copying the elegaic tone of the novel. Eventually the closing credits reverse the effect back to fuzzy black and white.<br /><br />Gatsby is an archetypal character whose purity and single-mindedness are his defining elements, creating a kind of naivety that distinguishes him from everyone around him -- and which eventually destroys him at the hands of those more cynical. One of the main reasons why the novel has become what it is today is that it presciently in 1925 understood that the Roaring 20s were an unsustainable party that must come to an end, which we know now from hindsight would happen with a horrific crash and decade-long hangover of the Great Depression. F. Scott Fitzgerald's almost puritanical discomfort with the Jazz Age, despite being its most enthusiastic contemporaneous chronicler, proved to strike just the right chord. A very good book about the 1920s Paris expatriate community (of which Scott and Zelda were prominent members) borrows a quote from a less well known writer as its title: \\"[[ASIN:0767903706 Everybody Was So Young]].\\"<br /><br />The characters are all very dislikable, with the exception of Jay Gatsby himself. Nick Carraway is extremely self-critical, regarding himself as a failure. One of the most common criticisms of the novel is that Gatsby's interest in Daisy lacks credibility because she is something of a petulant child who needs to be taken care of, but of course she mirrors to some extent Scott's real-life wife Zelda and their co-dependent marriage. Regardless of the truth about Zelda, who was by all accounts a remarkably capable and intelligent woman, there can be no doubt that she was treated as someone who needed to be taken care of and eventually ended up confined to a mental hospital. I don't want to fall into the trap of misidentifying authors with their characters, but it seems clear that Scott intended Gatsby's interest is Daisy to be entirely credible, even if Gatsby's perception of her was idealized as a result of his naivety and boundless optimism.<br /><br />The original novel is unstinting in its portrayal of the mistreatment of servants, which is intended to be offensive. What Scott Fitzgerald fully intended to condemn in 1925 looks even worse to us now, but it is an important part of the story and is an essential literary device used repeatedly to illuminate the defects of Tom Buchanan's character and worldview. The novel draws explicit parallels between Gatsby, as what would then be disparaged as a \\"self-made man,\\" and the servants --- both of whom Tom believes are limited and inexorably predestined by their circumstances of birth. Indeed, one of the reasons Tom is so disgusted at being described as \\"the polo player\\" is because being known for what he does instead of how he was born degrades him, in his own view, to the level of competition with Gatsby and the servants.<br /><br />I should explain somewhat my comment about \\"liberties and abridgements.\\" There are a number of lines of narration and dialogue that, although quite widely known and remembered from the novel, are simply gone in the movie. The opening and closing text is preserved, as it had to be, but everything else was apparently up for challenge about inclusion.<br /><br />Almost all of the subplots are removed, which reduces some of the characters to very minor status, especially Jordan Baker who in the novel is an iconic representation of the independent \\"new woman\\" that we might today call a \\"feminist,\\" and is therefore a counterpart to narrator Nick Carraway who, although of respectable pedigree and a Yale alumnus, has to actually work for a living. The screenwriters were probably correct in thinking that this was of much less interest to the modern audience than it was when the novel was published. On the other hand, it makes some things incomprehensible, such as why Tom Buchanan gets so annoyed at being introduced as \\"the polo player.\\"<br /><br />The handling of the Meyer Wolfsheim character is outright bizarre, probably because there were fears of the portrayal being regarded as anti-Semitic despite the character unquestionably being based on the real-life Arnold Rothstein. For one thing, he is played by an actor whose ancestry is from India, a pretty extreme case of \\"funny, he doesn't look Jewish,\\" and who is the only actor who seems to have any identifiable ethnicity with a speaking role that is not a black waiter. Odd things are changed, such as his cufflinks made from human teeth turning into a tie-pin, possibly because the screenwriters were worried that the modern audience would be too confused as to what cufflinks are, but the cufflinks are significant because they are something that would not be noticed immediately but when noticed would pierce the veneer of civility -- a major theme in the novel.<br /><br />It's a vibrant, colorful movie that successfully evokes, if not the real Jazz Age, then our collective historical memory of it.
193700788X|1.0|Charlaine Harris, were you that sick of the series? Did you really have so little to give on this final book? I can't believe this is the same author of the books that had me up all night reading and rereading. It felt like she was sick of the series and squeezed out some junk to finish it off before a deadline. You think she would have tried a little harder for the fans and loyal readers that made her career. I don't think this was ghost written, I think it was just laziness. I feel a ghost writer would have had more enthusiasm for their work. Thanks CH for some good reads, it's a shame what happened to it in the end.

One of those synchronistic melodies that plays for you directly from the universe at exactly the time you need it.<br /><br />I've been on my spiritual journey as so many of us, and as I grow into my being and the more I open, the more these songs speak to me.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|Perhaps it is because I walked into this film with low expectations due to a lackluster second film but I was delightfully surprised with this third installment in Marvel's Iron Man franchise.<br /><br />Shane Black takes over the directorial role from Jon Favreau, who was in charge of the first two films, and he brings the fresh approach that this series needed.  After being bogged down by the suits, suits, and more suits approach of the second film, I was relieved to find that this installment (other than one, I'll admit, major plot point) pulls focus from that aspect.<br /><br />Here we see Tony Stark a mess after the \\"New York incident\\" (of The Avengers).  He's psychologically vulnerable, arguably more than we've seen since he was kidnapped in the original film.  We see Iron Man take the backseat and Tony take center stage.  He's put in the position where he must rely on his own tech-prowess; Tony is the underdog once again.  Seeing his human side was great but coupled with that was more of a spotlight on those individuals around him.  Walking out of the theater, I felt I had seen a movie in which Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan, and Lt. Col. Rhodes are heroes as much as Stark himself.<br /><br />In that regard, all of the actors involved here brought their A-game.  While I felt that Favreau's Happy got a bit too much screen time (likely due to his removal, willing or otherwise, from the director's chair), I was pleased to see Happy taken at least a bit more seriously as a character - and without taking away his role as comic relief.  Robert Downey Jr. really delivers the comedy here too.  In the second installment, it seemed as if he was hamming it up too much.  The comedy was physical but absurd and much too over the top.  Here, it's done with some more taste and to great effect.<br /><br />I've heard complaints about the somewhat controversial twist in the film but I didn't have any problems with it.  As far as I'm concerned, it kept things interesting.  I'm glad that they made changes from the original \\"Extremis\\" storyline, as it allowed even individuals who regularly read the comics to still be surprised and, hopefully, entertained.<br /><br />These are just my thoughts.  Some of the people I saw the film with were not as taken with it as I.  So really, the most important thing is for you to see it and decide for yourself.  At the very least, it's an improvement over the second.  In my mind, it rests somewhere very close to the top of the Marvel pile.  They'll have a tough time coming up with an equal to this.

B000PVAFT0|5.0|This was a very colorful and enjoyable movie.  It is great for all ages and worth viewing and should keep everyone entranced.
193700788X|3.0|When I first started reading the series I couldn't put them down. I would devour the books in 1 or 2 sittings and couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one. The last few books were not as engaging and seemed to be much more predictable. When I picked up DEA it took a lot longer to get interested in the story in part because of the unusual writing style at the beginning and then the slow start to the plot line.  Many reviewers complained about the ending of the book, and honestly I didn't like who Sookie ended up with, but I knew that it would more than likely end that way based on the events of the previous books. My main issue was actually the reference to so many characters and details that I didn't care about while Eric, a character that had been so strongly developed throughout most of the series, got completely written off. Overall, I am sad to see the series end but I can honestly say I wouldn't want to read another installment.

B009NY43NY|5.0|When I suspect there will be spoilers on the web, I hide until I have read/watched the product. So color me surprised when after I finished this book and found there was so much controversy around the series, especially the ending. I seem to be on the other side of the spectrum when it comes to my reaction of this book. My first realization that this book was going to be different is the opening chapters, finding myself in the head of a character other than Sookie Stackhouse herself, as the rest of the series is only from her perspective alone. We actually get a view of Sookie from other peoples perspectives! At first a little shocked but then very excited to see some different aspects to the story.<br />But of course the real controversy is over the romantic aspect and whom she ended up with. And all I can say to that is it's exactly how I would have written it, if I wrote fanfiction. The signs were all there, overall I am shocked that readers of the series took such an offense to such a fun and entertaining series. Yet passion, as a reader is what keeps me coming back, so I wouldn't blame any fan for wanting something different for Sookie. But overall it was her life, not mine. I was just along for the ride.<br />So excited to read the follow up book being released in October.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Love the game.  Bingos, slots, collectables, it has a great conglomeration of ways to amuse yourself.  The problem is when you get addicted, and you will get addicted, it can get extremely costly feeding money into it to get bingo credits and coin to keep playing.  I'm not talking a bit here or there, I'm talking about 100s of dollars without even realizing it.<br /><br />Plus, the group that just bought the company and whose app this is, is making it MUCH harder to win which makes it more expensive to play.  Basically the only thing free is the app.  To keep playing is very expensive.  All for virtual items you can only look at.  And when a room closes you don't even have that because it all disappears.<br /><br />I still play because I loved the game before it got hard and expensive.  And sadly I'm addicted to it now.

B00BLSJI80|3.0|Demi Lovato attempts to make the transition from being exclusively a teen-pop artist to being an artist who can straddle both adults and younger audiences.  Thoughout 2013's [[ASIN:B00BLSJI80 Demi]], Lovato often executes this balance well, making the effort an overall enjoyable one to listen to. Even so, Demi has its flaws at times, be it over-singing on Lovato's part, one too any ballads, or somewhat generic, indistinct songwriting.  The good news is that the 13-track affair has no gargantuan flubs and suits Lovato's purpose and highlights her continually growing pipes and artistry.<br /><br />Two 'home runs' establish Demi from the get-go. \\"Heart Attack\\" is catchy and well produced, finding Lovato infusing plenty of personality.  The modern pop cues that characterize music of the day are well at work with \\"Heart Attack\\" benefitting greatly from this conformity.  On \\"Made in the USA\\" she doesn't let down, commanding impressively with her big, 20 year old pipes. \\"No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know / I want you, and I won't have it any other way / no matter that we'll never break / cause our love was made, made in the USA...\\", Lovato sings enthusiastically on the chorus. The follow up to the album's chief juggernauts, \\"Without the Love\\" isn't too shabby, making nice use of acoustic guitars and strings within the production work. Lovato shines particularly on the bridge and generally throughout on her ad libs.<br /><br />\\"Neon Lights\\" is Lovato's dance-pop moment, contrasting the previous trio of cuts. The main rub is that \\"Neon Lights\\" sounds much like a host of similar sounding, generic danceable cuts. Lovato screams a bit on the peak of the chorus, showing her trying a bit too hard.  On \\"Two Pieces\\", the song literally has two different pieces fused together. The verse has more of a folksy, singer/songwriter vibe in six-eight time, while the chorus switches back to standard common time with an anthemic nature.  Ultimately, \\"Two Pieces\\" serves as a welcome contrast to \\"Neon Lights\\", but doesn't eclipse \\"Heart Attack\\" nor \\"Made in the USA\\". Continuing with balladry, Lovato has two nice moments with \\"Nightingale\\" and \\"In Case\\". Sometimes she grows overexcited (\\"Nightingale\\"), but it's hard to knock her effort. \\"In Case\\", an exposed, stripped cut, gives off an Adele \\"Someone Like You\\" vibe. It's not the same caliber mind you, but shows Lovato's potential if nothing else.<br /><br />\\"Really Don't Care\\" (featuring Cher Lloyd) arrives timely to propel the tempo after three consecutive slower cuts.  Peppy and definitely suited to Lovato's core base, \\"Really Don't Care\\" may be schmaltzy, but it is one of the best of the album.  \\"Fire Starter\\" benefits from keeping the tempo up, but feels as if it is missing an extra 'spark'. Sure she excites as she proclaims \\"I'm a fire starter / make your blood run faster / I melt hearts like water...\\", but the cut lacks the same amount of fun of \\"Really Don't Care\\". The teen-poppy \\"Something That We're Not\\" is arguably more fun while \\"Never Been Hurt\\" takes a back step with a few vocal imperfections (during a gimmicky tag at the end of the chorus).  \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" pulls back the tempo.  A bit boring, the cut grows and excites after a so-so start.  Closing cut \\"Warrior\\" is a powerful ballad.  The main rub? Having back to back ballads to close the effort may be excessive.<br /><br />Ultimately, [[ASIN:B00BLSJI80 Demi]] is a solid effort, not a perfect one. To her fan base, four and five star reviews will likely flood in, particularly those who have followed her career closely. But to the more casual pop listener, this is 'good' but not 'show-stopping'. No one will deny Lovato's potential; it is quite high. 3 stars.as a welcome contrast to \\"Neon Lights\\", but doesn't eclipse \\"Heart Attack\\" nor \\"Made in the USA\\".

B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow... I haven't read a book this funny for a longest time.  I needed it bad after reading quite a few depressing books lately.  It's quite tiring when you cry everytime you read a book because that's what I've been doing lately.  Reading stresses me out literally when it should be more enjoyable. Many new books were full of angst with serious issues such as rape and abuse. On top of that, a lot of them ended with cliffhangers. That also makes me cry and pissed off. Well, you definitely do not have to worry about \\"no ending\\" book with Tangled.  It's very entertaining, with many laugh outloud moments.  The sex scenes were very very steamy.  Reading it from Drew's POS is quite refreshing and entertaining.  Drew is such a douche bag and yet he's still lovable.  I couldn't bring myself to hate him when I should have.  It would be even better if this book has an epilogue.  I am curious to find out what happens in a year or two.  This is a must read.  I would love to read more books like Tangled in the future. I am already a fan of Ms. Chase!
B009NY43NY|5.0|As this was the last novel in the series, reading it I wanted to take my time and savor it. I don't want to give away too much but I enjoyed how nearly every character made an appearance in this book.

I have loved this series, not only for this other world she created but by how every book made me feel like I was right there in Louisiana with her. I could imagine the sweltering heat, the smell of the chicken fried steak and taste of the sweet tea. I'll miss my virtual trips to the South .and the supernatural . Thank you Ms Harris for creating those trips.

0767836286|1.0|This movie suggests that the FBI bungles routine operations and is almost completely ignorant of larger terrorist threats. It does this because otherwise the movie's plot would be laughable. It also says that a perception of truth could exist in which a respected senior female FBI agent is happily married for a long time to a guy who then turns out to be one of America's worst home-grown terrorists, and THE MEDIA WOULD NEVER QUESTION THIS. I think our media are often not what we need them to be, and have a lot to answer for, but this movie suggests all the best reporters and researchers are basically asleep!<br /><br />So this movie has no credibility, and yet it got made, and a majority of reviewers here give it 5 stars. What is going on?<br /><br />Answer : The screenwriter had an agenda that truth and logic got sacrificed to, the studio guy who approved it had no idea what he was doing, and the 5 star reviewers here either have agendas of their own, or (more likely) are simply not intelligent enough to think through the implications of the story. So my final question is : What are you and I doing reading these reviews?
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Three of my favorite worshippers (Darlene Zschech, Israel Houghton, and Kari Jobe) together for an awesome collaboration. I initially purchased the CD after hearing &#34;Victor's Crown&#34; at the 2012 Joyce Meyer's Conference and I was pleasantly surprised to have the DVD included; nice touch. I can't stop listening!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Five stars because it kept me involved - not a single dull page.  Could not have stopped after the first book and certainly not the second.  Interesting study of human nature.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great app to use to read news, blogs, articles, etc.  Seamlessly took over all my Google Reader feeds. Smooth interface and nice look.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in a week. I couldn't put it down. Would definitely recommend it to others. I bought the second and third book as well.

B00BLF9FOK|2.0|I have seen every movie Arnold has ever been in. I am a HUGE fan of his. However, this movie is not up to the standards that Arnold has set in the past. First of all, I dont mind Rated-R Movies, BUT the things that made this movie Rated-R felt so out of place. The blood shots looked faked and where not needed in the film. Plus the F Bombs where not needed. If you took those 2 things away and made the movie PG-13 alot more people would have went and seen it. However, that doesnt change the fact that the movie is just not that good as far as plot goes. Johnnie Knoxville is about the only good thing in this entire weak movie...Dont waste your money buying this. Worth a one time view as a rental and thats about it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Excellent graphics and fun to solve puzzles. Great story line.  Recommend this game to all who love mysteries and puzzles.
B00CITOS4A|4.0|This book is full of useful information and it's so easy to understand.  For those who bought the Kindle ebook and is having problems seeing the text or images inside the black boxes, please try to set your background to sepia or black.  If your background is set to white, you will not see anything inside the black boxes, not sure why.  I'll give it a 5-stars once they fixed the white background issue for black box.  Highly recommended.
B00414IXMS|5.0|Love this Album. I recommend buying this for any Prince Fan out there. Good music and great tracks. Love it!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I've watched this several times and totally enjoy the music and Adele.  This is almost as good as front row seats at one of her concerts plus I love her commentary throughout her show.  Definitely a must have for her fans.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am usually not a reader what got me started was the fifty shades of grey...i kept dribbling across the crossfire series but was to afraid i'd be disappointed with my choices... let me tell u I was not. This book is amazing stayed up late at night and rose early in the morning so I can keep reading. cant wait till the other books come out.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have always liked this kind of game and since Bejeweled wasn't working on my &#34;old&#34; Android this was a very worthy substitute!
B00008G114|5.0|Love it. Good songs for a soundtrack to a movie. I would recommend buying this if you're a Prince Fan.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie!  It showed how that the strength of one girl in the face of extraordinary obstacles because of the love she had for her sister whom she was protecting from having to go to the hunger games.  It showed her forgiveness toward a boy who was also chosen from her poor town (sector) after he teamed up with the rich group who had been chosen.  This movie brings many different emotions.

B009MO5ES8|4.0|It's not a complicated plot, but it was well done with plenty of action. If you want to see great cinematography as bicycle messengers weave in and out of NYC traffic, this one is for you.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Jack Ryan as president, chinese threat, Jack Jr. as a spook, good plot.  rushed a little at the end.  enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this is a great game..I cant stay off of it...it just take to long to get enough medals to buy things..
030758836X|1.0|I am so sorry I wasted my time with this book.  The ending made no sense.  It was readable enough but not something I couldn't put down.  I kept reading due to the high rating.  Wow, was that a mistake.  This book taught me to read the negative reviews before wasting my time.  There are too many good books out there to waste your time on this one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a beautiful game and the puzzles are not too easy or extremely difficult. The automatic hints on possible matches helps those that are new to the game or you just can't seem to find it. I'm looking at their other products to support them developing games like this.
