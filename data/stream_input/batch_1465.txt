B0084LQQ82|4.0|There are some SPOILERS ahead.<br /><br />Supernatural has struggled with the leviathan storyline this season giving us many filler episodes and then writing a lot of plot into the last three episodes of the season. The Season 7 finale opens with Crowley in a devil's trap of Dick Roman's devising, negotiating for his release, the country of Canada and the vial of blood that Sam and Dean need for the leviathan weapon. The potential for double, triple and quadruple crosses exists but there is little real tension as we don't expect Crowley to double-cross Sam and Dean. The threat of the leviathan is too great.<br /><br />Bobby continues to possess the hapless hotel maid, but finally comes to be at peace. In a pair of scenes that set up Season 8, the lead leviathan in the form of Dick Roman is dispatched but Sam is left to take care of the others...by himself as Cas and Dean have disappeared secondary to the killing of Dick and Crowley has taken Kevin Tran, the prophet for some nefarious purpose of his own. We find in the last scene that Dean and Cas are trapped in Purgatory and then Cas deserts Dean.<br /><br />I am on-board for Season 8 as long as Sam gets rid of the leviathan quickly and the storyline in Purgatory is interesting. I also have hopes that the new prophet and Crowley and the alpha vampire will make things interesting. These are all potentially great plot points - it just remains to be seen whether the writers exploit them properly or not. All in all an entertaining and promising end to a middling season. Recommended for fans. Newcomes should start with the earlier seasons.
B0063GORYU|4.0|at least harder than the windows version.  The screen is a little too responsive in terms of accidental moves but the back function works so all is good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|First review of an app I've ever done. Simply put: I use my Droid Bionic intensively for work. When I have a rare break, I like to relax and tease my brain a little. Spider does that better than anything else out there. And this is the best version of Spider I've seen on any platform.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Because it was a \\"best seller\\" I decided to read the \\"preview\\" on my Kindle, I wasn't to impressed with that, but I figured I needed to give it more time. I then purchased the book, what a waste of $10. This book is awful, how many times can you repeat the same scenario in 1 book. I did finish the 1st book with great effort(I always finish a book to give it the benefit of the doubt). It started to get a little more interesting so crazy me I bought the 2nd book, again very similar to the 1st, but a tad bit more interesting. I have since purchased the 3rd, I'm this far into it I have to finish the series, maybe the end will surprise me, and all my wasted time will no longer feel wasted. I have now been reading the 3rd book for almost 2 weeks(I usually finish a book in 2-4 days on average) I'm currently 15% through it. Don't get me wrong I read Twilight and loved the series, not so much the movies, but the books were great. I also read all of The Hunger Games and didn't care for them, they actually put me to sleep, but again I read them all because once I start something I have to finish it. Maybe this series will end up surprising me(god I hope so), but I have yet to see it. This book is one of those books you might borrow from a friend, but personally I recommend not to waste the $ like I did.
B00003CXXS|1.0|This was simply a disaster waiting to happen. Sam Neill, former star of JP1, and William Macy, who only a few years earlier played a major character in Fargo, couldn't rescue this film. It was simply bad to the bone! It's rmoured that JP4 is being considered. I hope that they come to their senses and dump the project. You would need a really strong script, a good cast and good direction. In this economic climate second hand work won't go rewarded?
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love this game.  It is a my &quot;crack&quot; after a very stressful day.  It is a great brain game. So much fun.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a fun app for you're kindle fire. I'm not one into games but this one has me hooked.I love the entire game andvits a bunch if fun. the only problem I have with it is the game doesn't give you enough opportunity to earn acorns, and ifbyou need or want more you eitherbhave to wait an eternity to gain a few throughout the game or buy it with actual money... which I find annoying. otherwise this game is plenty of funfor all ages.
0671004107|5.0|This novel for me was exactly what I was looking for in a Sci-Fi story. As other reviewers have mentioned, Carl Sagan does such an amazing job of extending from our current (well, his current...) time that the story becomes very believable. At times I had to remind myself that it was, after all, still a story I was reading, and not the present reality.<br /><br />The characters in the story were deep, and there were few characters introduced that the story did not build on extensively in some way. Relationships were well-developed, and earlier presumptions that I had about characters changed as the events of the story unfolded and roles were reversed. It was surprising to me how well this book was written, considering that the author was an physicist. It's almost sad for me that this was his only novel..<br /><br />I almost didn't buy this book, because I had seen the movie years ago, but I'm certainly glad that I did. Next in line for me is Cosmos, also by Sagan, which I'm hoping will be as rewarding of read as Contact was.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw this when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my aunt had taped it off t.v and brought it to my grandparent's house to watch when I was staying over. I loved everything about this movie, even though there were parts that terrified me. Now that I am older, I still never get tired of watching it. The darkness of the story makes it very intriguing, and I actually had no idea that Dorothy was the actress that she is now until last night, which was insane to me! There are so many amazing and horrific moments in this-I would recommend it to anyone who still has an imagination :)

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert's new cd,Trespassing, is half fun urban dance pop with the other half containing mid tempo and slower songs. Adam has the most incredible voice out there today. I have seen him sing live 3 different times and been totally blown away by his voice. No Autotune here folks. You won't be sorry if you buy this album. When I am down, Adam's music never fails to pick up my spirits. His first cd, For Your Entertainment is good fun,too. But Trespassing is pure Adam fun, since he wrote and co-wrote most of the tracks on the cd.

B007BWUJ60|5.0|La re-edición de este grandioso álbum, viene como la sorpresa perfecta para los fans y coleccionistas de Madonna en todo el mundo.<br /><br />\\"Like a prayer\\" podría considerarse como el álbum más cercano al arte que haya alcanzado a hacer Madonna en toda su carrera artística, marcando un antes y un después en su trayectoria musical. De aquí en adelante, Madonna tomaría las riendas creativas de los álbumes que le continuaron a este, tomándole el gustillo a componer las canciones con su propia pluma e imaginación, volcando en ellos sus propias versiones de la vida, el hecho de haberse recientemente divorciado de Sean Penn, el hombre de su vida, revisitando las frustraciones que le dejó el hecho de haberse criado bajo un estricto régimen católico que nunca supo darle una explicación convincente de porqué ella debería aceptar haber perdido a su propia madre a tan temparana edad, al mismo tiempo celebrando el sentirse parte de su familia en momentos donde todo parece tan efímero y artificial, celebrándose siendo mujer e independiente, que goza de ser la única al poder y explotando su sexualidad a otros niveles que antes no había conseguido lograr.<br /><br />Aquí se pueden encontrar grandes éxitos como los conocidos \\"Like a prayer\\", \\"Express yourself\\" y la cándida \\"Cherish\\". Pero las joyas verdaderas las pueden encontrar justamente en las canciones menos populares, por así decirlo, como en la extraordinaria e íntima \\"Promise to try\\", la primera canción que ella dedica abiertamente a su madre.<br /><br />Madonna se revela contra todo tras el sin sabor que le dejó divorciarse de Sean Penn y prueba que no solo es capaz de re-inventarse sino que también es capaz de tomar algo tan poco inspirador como sentirse abandonado por alguien que fue tu gran amor y rendirlo en una combatiente y pegajosa canción disco-pop como lo es \\"Till death do us part\\". También pone sobre la mesa el tema de los latinos que deben luchar a diario por sobrevivir en los barrios: la prodigiosa elegancia de \\"Spanish eyes\\".<br /><br />Talvez recuerden la confesional balada \\"Oh father\\", una mezcla de varios tipos, donde seguramente incluyó a su propio padre, si bien no queda del todo claro, dando cabida al perdón en su corazón tras su confesión \\"Talvez algún día, cuando mire hacia atrás, sea capaz de decir que no quisiste ser cruel, es tan solo que alguien te ha herido a ti también\\".<br /><br />Considero que el momento más débil del álbum es la forzada colaboración con Prince en \\"Love song\\", que años de escucharla aun sigo sin entenderla.<br /><br />Este disco es un lujo y tenerlo en edición vinilo, fiel a la original, es lo mejor que se le pudo haber ocurrido al sello hacer. Un muy buen momento. Muy recomendable.<br /><br />The re-edition of this great album comes as a fabulous surprise to fans and Madonna collectors all around the world.<br /><br />\\"Like a prayer\\" may be the closest to art album Madonna have ever done. From this album on, nothing will be the same for Madonna again since she discovered the pleasure to write her own lyrics, as a testimony of life, having been recentely divorced from Sean Penn, revisiting frustrations from been raised in a very strict catholic family, celebrating independence and the fact of being a woman who enjoys taking power, reinventing herself from pain, exploding her sexuality to a brand new level where only a few women dare to achieve.<br /><br />Such big hits like \\"Like a prayer\\", \\"Express yourself\\" and \\"Cherish\\" may be found on this one. But the real gems you can find them in the less popular tunes like the extraordinary intimacy of \\"Promise to try\\". The theme may sound a little familiar to fans. This may be the first song Madonna ever composed about losing her mother being (Madonna) sucha  little girl.<br /><br />Madonna proves herself that she can take a devastating personal situation - like her divorce - and turn it into a stunning disco-pop tune, an un-breakable song like \\"Till death do us part\\"; or putting on the table the latin struggle in some barrios to survive, with such elegance and devotion: \\"Spanish eyes\\".<br /><br />You may remember \\"Oh father\\" as well, a confessional ballad witch describes a mix of different kind of fathers, maybe her real dad was included in this one too, although it's not very clear. Madonna opened her heart to the posibility to find relieve in forgiveness declaring \\"maybe someday when I look back I'll be able to say: you didn't mean to be cruel, somebody hurt you too\\".<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest moment of the entire album would be the forced collaboration with Prince \\"Love song\\".<br /><br />Highly recomendable.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The pictures are very clear, the sound quality is excellent.  It is even more fun to watch these than the old ones on TV since there are no commercials and the picture and sound quality are better.  We have had a wonderful family time introducing our children to the REAL Star Trek!
B007M6P01O|4.0|AS in my other Amazon Instant TV review (of the Vampire Diaries), the quality of the service has been great.  I've experienced zero trouble with the streaming video.  Now, this show is plain awesome.  I can't wait for season three.  My only problem (which is very specific for my taste) is that sometimes the zombies and killing are really gory.  I can do without the gore.  The core of the show (and the best part) is the interaction and group dynamics.  So, good show, good service.  I will definitely continue to purchase Amazon instant video.
1469984202|5.0|Hugh had an amazing talent in this book to weave one story into another without being completely fluid. The subtlety was a gentle drop to the next story and had small, invisible threads of the previous characters in the \\"present\\".<br /><br />I loved this book and look forward to Wool #6 and so on and so forth!
B002NHGG92|5.0|This is the best show on TV, as far as I'm concerned.  It is the only show I make a point to watch.  I haven't missed a single episode.  Amazon's instant video service has been great.  I've never had a problem with the connectivity or quality of the video stream.  So, all in all, I've been pleased with the srvice and I love this show.
014310652X|4.0|The first time I encountered apostrophes in possessive pronouns in this edition of Sense and Sensibility, I was annoyed and thought I was dealing with careless proof-reading. After many such instances in the book, I realized that this odd practice was probably a nod to  Jane's handwritten manuscript and that standard English in Jane's day didn't mind \\"her's\\", \\"their's\\", etc.. For the sake of all the English majors who might read this version, (despite the off-putting \\"tempest in a teacup\\" cover) I wish the editor had made some mention of this intention in a foreword.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Having rented this movie twice, I decided that buying it made sense.  I would categorize it as a \\"feel good\\" movie.  Light, but pleasant story with wonderful performance by Betty While. There are movies that do not require suspense as to the ending, and The Proposal is certainly one of them.  As usual, when I enjoy a movie which I have rented, I go to Amazon to buy it, as well as almost anything that we may need or want, or even about which we may have questions.
1594203334|5.0|Loved the book. Such a great read and such a refreshing change from the obsessive American parenting norms (ugh!). I do think the single biggest difference in the American and French ways is the free/subsidized child care and preschool provided by the Government/society. This ensures that the burden of raising kids is not just the mom's. It's possible to be \\"sage\\" when both get a break from each other :).
1401307450|5.0|I chose to read this book because I enjoy RHCP's music, and because I find Anthony Kiedis an insanely attractive human being. I was curious about his addiction & how he still managed to keep it all together. I finished this book in record time...I couldn't put it down. Kiedis' recollection of his stories about his childhood, from his wild youth, meeting Flea and the other future/ex bandmates, and his wild sexcapades...it was gripping and I didn't want the story to end. It is a heartfelt, totally uncandid look into his life...no holds barred, nothing left on the table (other than the fact he changed one of the last girlfriend's names in the re-released edition, \\"Claire Essex\\" is in fact Yohanna Logan). If you're an RHCP fan, you'd be crazy not to have already picked this up. If you're not an RHCP fan, it is still an awesome read.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is a valuable Internet portal. A great way to follow interesting sites and topics without having to manually check all sorts of different websites.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|When I purchased this movie, it looked like and I hoped, something authentic. It isn't even close. As a biologist who has worked with wolves in the past, I can say that the writer/director's depiction is a complete fabrication and utterly inaccurate. Might be best to read something on the subject next time and do a little research before creating this sort of adventure movie. I was also disappointed that Neeson went along with the sham. He does a disservice to wildlife and wolves. This movie was closer to Little Red Riding Hood than something modern and accurate. It has action, violence and suspense, but little more. Thumbs down. I doubt I will view it again.

I wish it wasn't timed, I play a lot of these types of games for enjoyment, I it doesn't matter to me if I have the quickest time.Price is fair and I did have to send an app to the cloud to make space for it, but I do that with many apps, they run better that way.

B000001FDK|5.0|With me as I type this is the vinyl album of the soundtrack to \\"Grease\\" my Dad bought for me in the Fall of 1978. I wouldn't see the film in its entirety until 1981--my older sister went to see it with friends, but my parents deemed me too young at the time of its release--but on Friday afternoons just before school was out, I was one of the students who could bring my copy of the soundtrack to be played in my Elementary School homeroom. Having been one of the kids who hadn't been familiar with most of the soundtrack at the beginning of that school year and feeling awkward and left out when I heard my classmates singing the \\"Tell me more\\" chorus of \\"Summer Nights\\", my status changed dramatically, and I was now definitely one of the cool kids.<br /> Also, it was one of the favorite albums played by those dining our school cafeteria's \\"Good Guys\\" table, the area reserved for the classes with the overall best conduct.Most of the kids, however, would emphatically sing the curse words featured in the song, \\"Greased Lightnin'\\", and a few of us would jump up making ape-like gestures at the \\"You-ooh-ooh\\" chorus of \\"You're The One That I Want\\" .<br />  Aside from those two aforementioned stellar favorites,and the other one, the roster includes the  very contemporary sounding title song, sung by Frankie Valli, Olivia Newton-John's \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\", John Travolta's comically over-emotional \\"Sandy\\", Frankie Avalon's casual but sage-like \\"Beauty School Drop-Out\\", Stockard Channing's snide \\"Look at Me. I'm Sandra Dee!\\", Cindy Bullens' obscured \\"It's Raining on Prom Night\\",and the insrumental \\"Alone at the Drive-In Movie\\".<br />  The nostalgia act, Sha-Na-Na give us \\"Blue Moon\\", \\"Rock 'n'Roll Is Here to Stay\\", \\"Those Magic Changes\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"Born to Hand Jive\\", and \\"Tears on My Pillow\\" during the school dance segment.<br /> Louis St. Louis and Cindy Bullens perform \\"Mooning\\" during the dance segment as well.<br /> Cindy Bullens also gives us, \\"Freddy My Love\\", Louis St. Louis performs, \\"Rock'n' Roll Party Queen\\". Stockard Channing reveals her character's vulnerability with the song, \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\", Olivia Newton-John does likewise with a reprise of \\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\\".<br /> The whole cast joins in on \\"We Go Together\\", and we wind the soundtrack up with the instrumental of \\"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\\", and Frankie Valli's reprise of the title song.<br /> All in all listening still provides me with great childhood memories, taking me back to the wonderful nonsense I enjoyed that particular schoolyear!As the years go by, I'm sure others will come to enjoy it as well.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I was a little wary about this cover because of the other reviews that said the elastic straps made it a difficult fit for the Kindle Fire. Happily, when I slipped my Fire in, it fit perfectly. I wouldn't even say the straps are particularly tight; they're really perfect.<br /><br />With this case, I am able to stand the Kindle Fire up in either portrait or landscape position, although I don't much use portrait that way. It also folds back completely flat when I'm reading and only want the Fire directly in front of me.<br /><br />The case is solid and protective, and pretty too. I'm very happy with this purchase.

B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|Meddle is a transitional recording for Pink Floyd.  It contains some short, breezy, psychedelic numbers that represent their early years, and the masterful album-side long \\"Echoes,\\" a harbinger of the extended space-rock jams that the band would become known for in the 70s.  Keyboardist and vocalist Richard Wright is still a major contributor on this output, which I greatly value.  As bassist Roger Waters pushed Wright further away from the group in the late 70s, I believe the band's sound and coherence suffered.  \\"Seamus\\" and \\"San Tropez\\" are lackluster, so I knock the recording a star for those two throw-aways.  I find the remaining cuts to be very good to stellar.  In all, a top five Pink Floyd recording, along with Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and Animals.  Had the band deigned to release \\"The Man and The Journey\\" (bits from Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucerful of Secrets, UmmaGumma, Obscured by Clouds, More), that would have been the 6th essential Floyd recording (diehards should search out the bootleg of The Man and The Journey show from Amsterdam in 1969).  The Wall, while it has some great singles, is a deeply flawed mess produced by a band that was falling apart.  By contrast, Meddle is the product of a band finally overcoming the loss of a charismatic leader (Syd Barrett) and emerging into its own, forging a unique, distinctive sound.  Much of that uniqueness is absent on the Wall, and I don't even care to discuss the Final Cut, Momentary Lapse of Reason, or Division Bell, as the \\"band\\" was no more on those recordings.

0066620996|4.0|The book is based on a lot of research and hard work. The book is structured in a very good fashion. The crux of the subject is included in the main chapters. All the data and research is included in Appendices. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in building a company or simply learning about a business.

B007WV05GY|5.0|I almost didn't rent this movie because of the latest reviews yet I am so glad I decided to check it out for myself!  It makes me wonder what type of people just don't like this movie...ones who need a fairytale ending? Ones who need more gore?  Or ones who have no desire to ponder the concept of life and death situations?<br /><br />Liam Neeson does an excellent job as always and even though the viewer doesn't get to really know the characters that doesn't seem to be the objective of this movie.  It is fast, ferocious, and ultimately about man up against nature in all its majesty and terror.  Though, the wolves in reality most likely do not behave as depicted in the movie, that is not the point.  As antagonists, they could have been fictional monsters of any kind or even crazy psychotic man gone wild!  It's the movies!  They intend to suspend our reality!!  That is the joy of watching a good movie.  And this is a good movie. It will leave an impression that you will consider upon and if you watch all the way to the end of the credits you get to write your own ending.<br /><br />Peace.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|Totally worth the rental. My friend Su came over for bbq and then we wanted to watch a movie with our bellies full. Well...after she suggested this movie and halfway through the preview, I was like,\\"lets do this.\\" It has an all star cast, great story, plenty of action and the cinematic shots throughout the film are great!

B001HN69AY|3.0|The movie was strange but amusing. I'm not sure what the whole point of the movie was, but the Imaginarium was pretty wonderful. Heath Ledger was a fine actor in the film - I never noticed what a good actor he was until he passed. Whimsical, and not boring. Vern Troyer also acted as a good comedic foil.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|After seeing mixed reviews on Rotten Tomates my expectations for this movie were low. However, by the end of the movie my opinion was pretty high. I give it only 4 stars because I thought it dragged in spots in the first half.<br /><br />There is extra material added to the book, which is more or less necessary to make this into a full-length movie. I thought the added content kept the spirit of the book and made for a more interesting movie.<br /><br />Where this movie shines is in conveying the messages of the book. Dr. Seuss's book is not subtle. This movie is not subtle either. I was a little shocked at how heavy-handed it was, particularly in the song \\"How Bad Could it Be.\\" I'm sure it will offend people. But by being in your face, this movie is keeping the spirit of the book.<br /><br />I'm glad for this movie. It does gets the message out even more effectively to kids than the book, in my opinion.<br /><br />Are all corporations evil and greedy? Of course not. But whether they are conscious of it or not, their actions often have very adverse effects. People like to ignore this and tell themselves it's not that bad. How bad could it be?<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to make a lot of money is to convert life and health into money. Think about it. Have you ever heard of any companies selling products that were harmful or unhealthy? How about dumping toxic manufacturing byproducts into the land, water and air that we all depend on? How about mistreating employees or demanding too much \\"life\\" from them? If you have worked very long in corporate America some of these things will likely ring a bell.<br /><br />The answer to the movie's song \\"How Bad Could it Be\\" is that it could be very bad. We really are making our planet uninhabitable in the long run. We have to change how we do things.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hopeful, upbeat ending to this movie. I hope the reality of our future is as upbeat. Trends are not promising, I'm sorry to say.
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|Totally didn't expect this to be as good of a romantic comedy as it was. Wasn't a huge Anna Farris fan starting out, but thought she was funny, in an over the top kinda way. Anyway, this was really great. A slight \\"bridesmaid-esque\\" type twist, but a good movie nonetheless. I'm all warm and fuzzy from a comedy that's a bit more realistic in my opinion.
0345529057|5.0|captivating.  don't get too attached to any character.  The detail and depth of characters are really amazing to me.  Continuously moves and interweaves stories.  I have been trying to imagine how one would begin to write these books.  What kind of plot, geography, characters, and society would one plot out.<br />How would one keep it organized and continuous.  superlative read.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Just because Disney spent too much money on CGI doesn't mean that this film is a bomb.<br />On the contrary, this film is just as good as and better than many others and well worth watching.<br />This film is both serious and fun, mostly fun. Burroughs being introduced as a character was also a nice touch.<br />If you see it for no other reason, see it for 'the dog'.  I've watched it three times.<br />I like it more with each viewing. The actors all do a great job. Buy this film. While you're at it,<br />buy the entire series of books too. If you have a child with above average reading skills age 9 to 13, you'll<br />be doing them a favor by having them read the stories.
068987474X|5.0|I married young, and got a divorce 15 years later only to enter the grueling world of dating.<br /><br />I had no idea what I was doing. Do you give them your number? Do they pay? What about online dating? And really, what I desperately wanted to know as one guy after another just suddenly stopped calling... how do I tell if they are really interested?<br /><br />A male friend kept telling me to get this book. After a while I relented and finally ordered it.<br /><br />What an eye opener. Point blank, laid out in black and white, what a guy really thinks. How do you know a guys really interested? He pays attention. And he isn't afraid to say your his girl.<br /><br />After reading this book I stopped wasting my time on guys clearly just saying what I wanted to hear and eventually met a very sweet guy. He was shy at first, and it took him a little while to go after me, but just like the book says... he was interested, and he shows it.
B007549W62|4.0|The reviewers seem to be divided on this film.<br />Me? I liked it very much.<br /><br />The story takes place in an underground bunker after a nuclear attack on NYC. The survivors are locked inside. We have the man who built the underground shelter (Michael Biehn) and the many people he is sheltering. The film shows how the group easily slips into several conflicts turning the shelter into an underground hell of abuse, violence and murder.<br /><br />The actors are first rate - so are the sets, the direction, the makeup and the soundtrack.<br /><br />But to me, the script could be slightly come compelling if the film did not focus so much on the violence. It is strange that some characters start immediately to act like they are in a street brawl. And the progression of time is not very clear: I did not get how long they spent down there (or how long their ordeal took).<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who likes the genre. It's miles above the average.<br />I liked it. :-)
0345479092|3.0|Pros:<br />Formatted well, suggestions are easy to understand and employ<br />Don't be fooled, this is essentially a gentler version of cry it out.  I believe the Ferber method is effective, but I was not comfortable with leaving the room.  Understand that your baby will cry, but this method allows it to happen the comfort of your arms and the warmth of your presence.<br />This method (as with any other sleep training method) works, but it's not for the faint of heart.  It takes time, consistency and persistence for results.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Did not work for my child until he was about 4 months (happiest baby on the block is more suitable for newborns and baby whisperer is a nice transition.<br />A bit of a condescending tone<br />Can't see it working for a high needs/colicky baby.<br />Her advice feels counter intuitive especially if you're a new  parent (ie, she calls very natural and instinctive soothing methods such as rocking to sleep \\"accidental parenting\\". )<br /><br />Summary:<br />I read this book before my son was born and was ready to put the techniques in practice.  I followed the method to a t, but only ended up with a poor baby who has lost his voice from all the crying.  So I tucked the book away and followed my instincts.  I adopted the attachment parenting lifestyle and rocked, sang, held and cuddled my baby whenever he wanted it.  he did not like being put down so we wore him during naps or held him in our arms.  \\" happiest baby on the block\\" was a more valuable read for caring for our newborn.  At night, we Co slept, against the advice of many who warned \\"you'll never get him out of your bed\\".  I believe this gave our son the sense of security he needed to develop independence.  I knew we wanted to sleep train him eventually, but only when he was ready for it.  We were also ready to embrace the AP lifestyle for the long haul if needed.  However, somewhere between 3 to 4 months, during a looong drive my son (who hates his car seat) actually fell asleep in the car!  Normally, he would cry until someone took him out.  During subsequent trips, he started falling asleep faster, which was essentially inadvertently crying it out.  So I tried the Ferber method... And swore it off the very next day.  After being so attached and close to my baby, I couldn't stand the thought of him being left alone in the room to cry.  So I dusted off by baby whisperer book and gave it a go.  I liked that I could comfort my baby while cried.  We are less than one week into it and it's working great.  We sidecarred our crib so that he is still easily accessible for nursing and comforting and I'm always right by his side as he makes his transition (although this probably goes against the recommendations of the book).  There is also a great baby whisperer community online to help with any questions you might have from the book.  (depending on your learning style, you may not even need the book at all)<br /><br />In the end, listen to your baby first, before you listen to any one book. remember that he is a human being with needs and feelings.  The experts have never met your baby and didn't write the books for your particular baby. once you get to know him, pick and choose pieces from each sleep training methodology and customize a plan that works for him.ll asleep in the car!

1591396190|4.0|I loved the premise of the book, stop trying to compete and expand your markets, but reality is a bit tougher.There are great examples of how ordinary businesses were \\"tweaked\\" and the markets expanded and there is your challenge as a reader. I work for a large company and I actually think my company fits the bill of taking a standardized business and making it different. The advice in this short book is a bit too general on how to truly make yourself different but it does hit the overall point, there are too many products and services out there now.. YOU HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT!I also thought the advice on not simply focusing on your current clients but think about potential clients is very important. I know that sounds overally basic but with the hectic pace of business, we tend to not sit back and think about all of the other prospects out there while our current client's needs need to be taken care of now. In summary, some great general advice but seriously great results won't come easy.

1118156315|5.0|People drifting from job to job may soon realize that they've visited the same crossroads too many times. Changing careers is tough, but some job seekers may be tired of compromises which would only lead to the same suboptimal choices they've experienced in the past. While others may seek to become just employable, these rare and brave souls seek to be remarkable and relevant.<br /><br />The truth is that they already are.  We all are, in fact.  And now, there's a way to tap into that greatness and bring it into the present.<br /><br />In the spirit of Alexander Osterwalder's successful book Business Model Generation (BMG), Tim Clark (who was also BMG's editor) has written Business Model You: A One Page Method for Reinventing Your Career. Clark shows that you can use the same business model thinking from BMG to unearth your greatest strengths, talents, and interests, and then paint them onto a powerful blueprint.<br /><br />Business Model You was co-created between 328 entrepreneurial minds spread out over 43 countries. The book is a beautifully designed and succinctly written journey replete with each contributor's diverse experiences and insight. The common theme is that everyone involved in producing the book struggled, but ultimately succeeded, in reinventing themselves. Their stories will help you create your personal business model.<br /><br />What's a business model? In short, it's \\"the logic by which any organization sustains itself financially.\\" Likewise, the Business Model \\"canvas\\" is a structured but simple visual technique which shows how the nine most important components of any business model fit and flow together. First, the original canvas is introduced for enterprises before being translated to the world of the individual.<br /><br />Business Model You is also an itinerary of thought experiments, anecdotes, and exercises to help align work with purpose. Some of the many experiments include the Lifeline Discovery and Holland's Six Tendencies. This journey of self-knowledge really counts, because aside from financial sustainability and survival, this is a book about thriving and doing the kind of work that resonates at your core.<br /><br />It certainly takes a culture of change and innovation, but the first spark always begins with one person: You.urney of self-knowledge really counts, because aside from financial sustainability and survival, this is a book about thriving and doing the kind of work that resonates at your core.<br /><br />It certainly takes a culture of change and innovation, but the first spark always begins with one person: You.

055338466X|4.0|A general overview of the current state of cosmologists' understanding, detailing theories of existence and how and why reality works. It is more brief and compact than other such books, which helps lay readers as it elides the wonkier calculations and instead explains complex concepts with simple metaphors and thought experiments. They authors' tone is dry and analytical, though laced with subtle humor that makes it fresh and highly readable. I followed it well enough until the second to last page, where the authors attempt to answer the book's fundamental question, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" This was answered in a glib and perfunctory way, requiring reference to a concept of \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" energy that hadn't been mentioned earlier and that I couldn't follow -- the discussion of it seemed, to me, logically inconsistent. (For example, gravity is \\"negative\\" energy but a black hole's energy is \\"positive\\" -- huh?) This is no fatal flaw if, like me, you didn't read the book expecting an actual answer. However, it is somewhat out of place in a book otherwise so lucid and methodical, and leaves a bit of an aftertaste.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book so great that I don't even know where to start. First off the book breaks down the science behind exercise and its effects on the body in a simple and easy to understand way. Second he supplies you with an easy to understand workout routine that is simple yet highly effective. Third he helps you to understand supplementation better so your not lost when trying to figure out what supplements to take. He gives you many tips on eating. This book is a must have for people of all ages who are trying to get in shape. As a teen myself I found the book to be a great help, showing me where to start and what to do. If your a teen and are trying to find a workout routine that works for you, then buy this book!

0763644765|5.0|Love the fact that this is a board book. We got it from the bookstore, and it was actually the only potty training book my husband could find. While this isn't going to tell your child step by step  on how to use the potty, it is quite entertaining if you can read it the right way to them.<br />When my daughter was potty training, she loved reading this book on the potty or just for bed time. The \\"bye bye diaper\\" in the book was a big deal to her, at that point she refused to wear diapers anymore.<br />One thing that we really enjoyed to do was while she was trying, we'd count the undies at the end of the book. Anything you can do to occupy your little one when they're on the pot trying will greatly increase their chances of going, well at least in my case! It seemed whenever she was occupied, that's when something would happen! We would count the undies, and also name the types of images, ie. polka dots, stars, super hero, colors, etc., that were on the undies too.<br />At a younger potty training age, this is a good book, it's tough, and not to say you should try this, but if it were to fall in, the book is pretty resilient against liquid!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|My take on this product is. Well I would,nt sharpen by BenchMade Knifes with this product. As it will only shape the very top edge of a convex blade.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|Yes, they made a full length movie based off a children's board game that had no plot whatsoever.  Yes, it sounds crazy, and leads to endless jokes about how desperate for ideas Hollywood must be if they resort to board games for film ideas (can a \\"Hungry Hungry Hippos\\" movie be heading our way in the near future?).  Yet, despite all the odds, we have a genuine Battleship movie that is decisively not bad, but actually pretty good.<br /><br />The movie follows Alex Hopper, a brilliant but lazy guy who spends his days drinking, and slacking out on his brother's couch.  After a fiasco involving a gal and a chicken burrito, Alex finds himself in the navy, and facing the fight of his life, as several alien ships land during a war games exercise.  Thus, both sides engage in a deadly game of deceit and combat, with the fate of the world at stake.<br /><br />Considering how plot less the original board game was, the filmmakers deserve a lot of credit for creating a story that doesn't get bogged down with exposition or in-depth attempts to explain things, instead going for the Michael Bay approach:  Lots and lots and lots of explosions, firearms getting shot off, big visual effects, aliens, and more explosions.  And amazingly, it works.  The movie knows it's entire existence is silly in the first place, and runs with it (at one point, the aliens and humans literally play battleship with each other, in the manner of the game itself).  The story, while simple, does move along briskly, and never lags, ensuring that the viewer is never bored, and while the characters are a bit stereotyped, they're entertaining enough to watch, and Alex, though burdened with the traditional, \\"smart but lazy guy who has to grow and reach his true potential\\" plot, serves well as the film's protagonist.  Equal recognition must be given to Mick, a double-amputee soldier who helps contribute to the fight against the aliens, and is a delight to watch, as we rarely see amputees getting their own actionsequences.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there are some unexpected moments of greatness here:  The aliens themselves, while clearly not friendly, don't go around killing everyone in sight, which gives them a fascinating moral side.  I also loved how the battleship of the movie's title comes into play, and it's role in the fight against the aliens, and is easily the most entertaining part of the film.<br /><br />Still, for action and nice touches, \\"Battleship\\" is essentially the standard blockbuster entertainment: it deals in broad strokes with story and characters, and relies heavily on action scenes to keep the audience's interest.  I do wish there were scenes where the entire naval fleet engaged in combat, rather then just a few ships, and Liam Neeson is criminally underused, but as a whole, \\"Battleship\\" is an entertaining surprise that works perfectly as harmless, B-grade movie fun.  Not bad for a film based on a plot less board game.

B007LNJ3YS|5.0|This has been a highly anticipated release for me. I have been listening to Beach House almost non-stop since Devotion. Once again, the duo does not dissappoint. When listening to the band's three previous albums, Bloom fits perfectly as the next step in this band's progression, but that is not to say that this album is boring or predictable. Each song is masterfully crafted, and the album as a whole works very well. I'd say this release is a little more consistent than Teen Dream, or at least less experimental. Bloom seems to be more of an album rather than a collection of tracks (which was what Teen Dream felt like to me). I won't try to spoil the tracks or rate them one by one (that would be missing the point), so I will suffice it to say that once again, Beach House delivers a beautiful record that you will want to listen to over and over again.<br /><br />As far as the packaging goes (vinyl), a couple of intersting things may be noticed. This is a double LP in a single sleeve, and each record stores inside another two sleeves, so that is only slightly annoying. For whatever reason, these are 45 rpm records as opposed to 33 1/3 rpm as on most full-size LPs. The artwork here is all very subtle, except that the cover glows in the dark (OoOoOoooohhh). There is also no band photo (unless you count a sillhouette of what could be Victoria), which I guess is interesting. The sound quality is, of course, amazing.

This movie defies reality about wolves, cold-weather survival, firearms, human nature, and the basic laws of physics. Usually it's possible to suspend disbelief, but our intelligence is insulted throughout the film.  SPOILER ALERT (but don't waste your time with this film)Liam Neeson belting himself in tight with not one but three seat belts, and still being thrown clear of all the other wreckage of the plane? Wolves answering back human howls? A professional hunter who has a rifle but carries shotgun shells? Wolves killing a man and then then not destroying the body?  A professional hunter who thinks a bolt action rifle is ruined because the stock is broken? Shotgun shells that can go off by having a stick poked in them, and then fire instead of exploding out the sides? Leaving the wreck behind to seek safety in the woods???? A 200lb guy jumping across a chasm, and the other guy holds him back with one hand after the rope slips? Sticks pulled out of the fire that burn bright as torches while running full speed through the woods? Jumping in a freezing river and ever getting back out again? I've seen more realism in Saturday morning superhero cartoons.

B005LAIHIQ|1.0|Johnny Depp is a fine actor, but you wouldn't know it from this movie.  Hollywood has yet again bought the rights to the name and even some of the characters of the original series and then totally trashed it.  This movie couldn't decide whether it was a comedy, slap-stick, gothic or horror, so it tries to be everything and fails miserably.  The original series, on-camera bloopers and all, had good actors doing their best with some hauntingly sad storylines; all this remake has is great CGI and wonderful sound - with lines that aren't worth hearing.  The actors struggle mightily, particularly Angelique, but it's as entertaining as watching cars rust.  As I sat amazed at the awfulness of it, I thought how sad it was that they spent all this money and this is the garbage they came up with.  Extremely disappointing.

0060930349|5.0|Earlier this week I was perusing a fascinating novel but stopped my reading to pick up Paul Johnson's 1995 \\"A History of the American People.\\" I was hooked by the elegant prose, interesting anecdotes and characters of the American experience and enthralled by this magisterial work of a master historian!

Every presidential administration is discussed as well as social and economic history through the centuries. Johnson is strong in his coverage of economic history. He is critical of the New Deal and FDR's expanding federal government culminating in President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, His heroes are Eisenhower and the founders of the American experiment in democratic government.<br />  The book's weakest section is on the American Civil War. Johnson is hazy on the topic as is evident by such whoppers as confusing Albert Sidney Johnston with Joseph Eggleston  Johnson; stating that Stonewall Jackson was wounded in the back and calling the Confederacy the \\"Confederation.\\" His battle coverage of America's wars from the Revolution to Vietnam and the Middle East are short and negligible to our understanding. He is much better at covering political and diplomatic history.<br />  The book is a treasure trove of information which can be read from cover to cover or dipped into for looking at a particular era in our American story.  It would serve well as a college textbook in American history.<br />  Johnson ends his great book by a memorable quotation: \\"The great American republican experiment is the still the cynosure of the world's eyes. It is still the first, best hope for the human race. Looking back on its past, and forward to its future, the auguries are that it will not disappoint an expectant humanity.\\" (page 976).textbook in American history.<br />  Johnson ends his great book by a memorable quotation: \\"The great American republican experiment is the still the cynosure of the world's eyes.

The result was a severe U.S. contraction and 25 percent unemployment rate, but by 1950 the economy had nearly doubled in size compared with the 1929 peak. The pain had unleashed a boom, just as Hayek said it would.

The entire book is poorly sourced, and misinformed. It makes me question his credentials to work for Morgan Stanley because he's clearly and poetically dumb.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am an avid reader of adult fantasy novels, unfortunately there is so much out there that seems formulaic and cookie cutter that was rushed to publication for the cash. This book completely blew me away with the depth of the story and character development. I have read all of the standards, Tolkein, Martin, Jordan, Morcock..etc. This book would stand proudly on the shelf with all of them, and have a higher spot then a few. I can usually tell whats going to happen about a third of the way through just about any story I read, and it makes reading the rest of the book more of filling in the blanks than an enjoyable read. I read this book over 2 days, during the week starting on Thursday and just finished it at 1:10 am on a Friday night, so very little sleep over the last couple days as I was up reading till 2am the night before, I was truly disappointed when I finished. Not with the story, just with the fact that it was over, this will definitely be one that I read again in a year or so, it was that good. Very elegant story, great concept and society with fleshed out main characters that are noble, but flawed in a human way with some very good banter among the characters that doesnt follow the usual boring routine.  Everything I've read recently seems like the trailers at the movies and this was the feature presentation. A truly great read that deserves to be recognized and awarded. I will anxiously wait for his next book and can only hope it lives up to this one as the bar has been set amazingly high Blood Song.

B00004YTIQ|1.0|The cover fits the pool perfect, covers side to side and end to end. I bought a beach ball to place in the pool before putting the cover on. If it rains, the cover won't sag in with the beach ball inside the cover. Again, the cover is stong enough and you will be pleased you bought one.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This is my favorite work of Madonna to date. I listen to this cd all the time and each time I find something<br />new that I love. I simply do not understand the reviews which state mediocre. That does not even come close<br />to describing this fun, raunchy, romantic, sexy and explosive range of songs. I also love the continuity and<br />movement of each song as it plays. The songs are perfectly placed. Hard Candy is worth the purchase. It reflects<br />Madonna's exquisite range and I think we should all pay homage to an artist who continues to push the envelope<br />and does so with a bang.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing in this book is terrible.  Constantly repeating the same thoughts over and over.  But honestly, I keep reading to see what happens next.  I had a friend who read the series and kept asking if the writing gets any better.  It doesn't.  But its steamy and for now, is holding my interest.

B007VLHP9K|5.0|Having these performances on LD, I'm ecstatic they are finally being released on DVD. I even took the time to transfer them to DVD myself some years ago. However, since they were recorded in an early HD-format (HDVS), Sony is missing the opportunity to release them on Blu-ray.<br /><br />But, as a point of clarification: the 4th is represented here on 2CDs, not DVD. So, the five disc set is the original 3 LDs transferred to DVD. The remaining two discs are the CDs for a previously unreleased live performance of the 4th from February 1989 at the Musikverein, timing out at around 41min and 43min from info posted elsewhere.

B0062P3392|4.0|Director Gary McKendry's first deature film \\"Killer Elite\\" is an old school action flick starring one of the most famous action stars of our generation, Jason Statham. The story (adapted from the book by \\"The Feather Men\\" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, which he claims is based on truths) is about a group of mercenaries hunting down the targets, while being chased by a former SAS officer leading a secret society \\"The Feathermen.\\" Largely set in 1980, \\"Killer Elite\\" looks like a throwback to the 80's style action movies with tough guys with a good heart fighting for what they believe. No high-tech gadgets. No shaky camerawork. Just hardheaded heroes with guns and muscles.<br /><br />Jason Statham is Danny, a former member of a mercenary team: Danny, Hunter (Robert De Niro), Davies (Dominic Purcell) and Meier (Aden Young). Severely wounded in Mexico and fed up with the life as a mercenary, Danny retires and goes back to Australia. One year later, however, he is called back into action when his mentor Hunter is held captive by a sheik of Oman.<br /><br />What the sheik wants is revenge for the deaths of his sons, and forces Danny to kill three former SAS agents. With Davies and Meier, Danny sets out for one last mission, but the \\"Feathermen\\" enforcer Spike (Clive Owen) is quick to respond, trying to protect the targeted SAS members while tracking down Danny.<br /><br />Yvonne Strahovski appears as Anne, Danny's girlfriend, but \\"Killer Elite\\" is mostly about these tough guys and their missions. Acting is solid, location is interesting, and action set-pieces (shoot-outs and chases) are very good, though the cat-and mouse story itself is not compelling as it should be.

0241952875|5.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles, by A. Conan Doyle<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson discuss what can be deduced from a walking stick left behind by a visitor. When the visitor returns he tells of the old legend about the hound of the Baskerville family, and how Sir Charles Baskerville died recently. Dr. James Mortimer found the footprints of a gigantic hound twenty yards from the body! There have been sightings of a huge hound on the moors at night.

0143120530|5.0|Subsequent to reading the book, I became very enthusiastic and comfortable with the subject of memory!  Meanwhile, I forgot that others might not be quite so up to speed!  While trying to explain a memory palace to a friend, I realized that he had a smug \\"you're nuts\\" smirk on his face from ear to ear!<br /><br />Well, that right there sounds like a challenge to start learning!  I'm looking forward to The Day of Proof when I rip off the order of a deck of cards!  As Josh pointed out in the book, we don't want to run around over-savanting ourselves, but I want to at least indulge in the skill a little!<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when Josh explained that a pastry baker is easier to remember than a man named Baker.  After all, when you see the guy there's a certain \\"breadiness\\" about him.  That cracks me up!  That particular visual is going to stick with me forever.<br /><br />Thanks Josh for helping us remember!

B007NESBK2|5.0|My boyfriend and I had the privilege of seeing Sade live in concert on July 6, 2011 in Boston. Our seats were 6th row center! The show was absolutely amazing. The moment Sade took the stage, we were up out of our seats. Her voice, the band, and sets took my breath away. Looking around in the crowd, it was great to see all of the different groups of people who love and are moved by her music. Sade is timeless!!! That day will forever be etched in my brain as one of the greatest moments of my life!!!!

1401233791|5.0|There were a number of things DC did in the early 90s to try to give their long, established line of heroes a bit of edge (and drive up their slowing sales too).  Superman died.  Hal Jordan went crazy and killed all his fellow Green Lanterns.  And Batman, well, Batman was broken...literally.  A new supervillain named Bane was introduced, who pledged to \\"break the Batman\\" and take over Gotham City...and he did just that.  A storyline that is much better than it is remembered as being, this new reprint of the first chunk of the Knightfall saga is simply wonderful.  Featuring the previously hard to find \\"Batman: Vengeance of Bane\\" issue that introduced Bane and detailed his origin, as well as everything leading up to Jean Paul Valley, better known as Azrael, taking up the mantle of the Bat.  I'm glad to see that DC has finally gotten their act together and is releasing the entire Knightfall, Knightquest, and Knightsend sagas in their entirety, and naturally, just in time for The Dark Knight Rises.  Do yourself a favor, check out one of DC's most infamous storylines and see what all the fuss was about back in 1993, you won't regret it.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I've always liked this game and this is a good app.  The only problem is that it's addictive.  A lot of fun.
B005ISZRES|5.0|I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.<br /><br />It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|Paige Thornton (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are madly in love.  They meet by accident in a city office building and the chemistry is immediate.  They are made for each other and soon after they get married.  The romance continues until a tragic auto accident.<br /><br />Their parked car is slammed into from behind by a massive truck that injures both of them but she is thrown through the windshield and endures massive brain trauma. She is kept in a coma to help her recover from brain swelling and injuries.  Leo lovingly stays by her side throughout the ordeal.  When she is finally awoken she remembers everything about her life from 5 years ago but nothing about her career, her art schooling or her love and marriage to Leo....<br /><br />This is a classic love story that is tragically broken while at its peak by the accident.  Leo fights to regain Paige's love and to keep her meddling parents from taking over her second chance at life.  Paige forgets why she left her parents' home, left law school and she still loves her old boyfriend but doesn't know her loving husband and all the friends of the last 5 years.<br /><br />This is a well written story line based on true events.  It is sad, sweet and brings back the meaning of your wedding vows that you committed for life.  It will make you smile and it will make you sad.  I like the fact that the two main protagonists seem to have real chemistry together and for me it made the movie.<br /><br />The movie received poor reviews from the critics but it did well at the box office and it is well worth seeing.  My wife and I enjoyed the movie and I believe you will too!

B000002NJS|4.0|In writing this review, I am able to understand how some fans feel frustrated and say that no matter what, Madonna can't win. On the one hand, \\"Ray of Light\\" is perhaps her greatest artistic achievement and the point in which she was finally able to solidify herself as a genuine \\"real player\\" in the music biz--but while I admire this album for its' artistic merits and innovative use of electronica, I can't say it's one of my favorites by her because it's simply not FUN like alot of the rest of her catalog. I think it's best to say you need to be in a certain frame of mind to truly appreciate \\"Ray of Light\\". This is Madonna as Earth Mother--no dominatrix gear, Marilyn-bleached locks or feather boas. This is the point where she officially entered the second phase of her career (fans and critics definitely split her legacy into pre-ROL and post-ROL categories); the lyrics have her reflecting on past mistakes and regrets and future hopes--all this introspective insight no doubt brought on in the wake of Lourdes' birth.<br /><br />I'm still not a fan of the recent MDNA album save for two tracks, and it's ironic upon revisiting \\"Ray\\" that it sounds more age-appropriate for her NOW even though it's fourteen years old already. The fact that most of this material would not seem out on place on contemporary radio is either a testament to the fact that Madonna was way ahead of the curve with this one, or that pop culture has really not evolved much in the last fifteen years.<br /><br />On paper, it sounds like a hodgepodge but the album is surprisingly cohesive from the dreamlike, otherwordly \\"Drowned World (Substitute for Love\\") and \\"Frozen\\" to futuristic dance numbers \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" to World-Beat flavoured \\"Skin\\" and \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\". There's the trippy \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\", sorrowful \\"The Power of Goodbye\\" and haunting \\"Mer Girl\\". The latter half of the album is almost operatic and really shows off the vocal training Madonna endured to prepare for \\"Evita\\" a few years earlier.<br /><br />Like I said, not my favorite album of hers, but THE landmark album of her career and one that helped shape the direction of pop music for the Millenium. I still prefer the genius folk-electronica hybrid of 2000's \\"Music\\" over this because it's not as dark and moody, but \\"Ray of Light\\" still gets a Four-and-a-Half Stars here.for \\"Evita\\" a few years earlier.<br /><br />Like I said, not my favorite album of hers, but THE landmark album of her career and one that helped shape the direction of pop music for the Millenium.

B007K87C4M|5.0|Storm Corrosion is quite an achievement by these two artists.  I've waited to review this album until I've had enough time to digest it and, after having listened to the entire album at least ten times, my opinion of it, as with many Steve Wilson projects have evolved from curiousity to liking some parts to wanting to hear a track or two over to wanting to hear the entire album over from start to finish to finally, where I'm at now, whole heartedly loving this album with deep emotions and thorough enjoyment.  The person who explained it using a comparison to Simon & Garfunkel nailed it...it is very similar to that, if one had to compare it to anything but it would be more like the DARK SIMON & GARFUNKEL in a most delicious and thoroughly enjoyable way....it could be the sound track to Dark Shadows.<br /><br />All I can say is it is a beautiful listen, once fully taken in.  Fasten the seat belt and enjoy the auditorial trip...it's an instant classic that will get better with each listen and I truly believe I will be buying another copy as I will be wearing this one out!<br /><br />Hope I've helped.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I loved this movie, understanding it was a Science FICTION movie. The Soundtrack was excellent (no Hip-Hop noise), the Special Effects were superb, there was one scene that was uncomfortable to watch. The fact they honored the Vets, the Disabled Military members and the Navy deserves a big Tip of the Hat. In the recent past we have seen the Hollywood types cast a \\"Dirty / Dark\\" light on the Military, this movie was refreshing even with the one uncomfortable scene.

What I am reviewing is the 'upgrade' to Blue-ray. This is why I purchased this (I already have the standard DVD).<br /><br />On the matter of the Blu-ray upgrade, I found this nominally acceptable. I have a 30\\" 1080ip led flatscreen that is rated for slightly-above average performance (for its class). I personally think my TV performs exceptionally well. I also have top-quality, internet-enabled Blue-Ray dvd player.  I mention this because your experience of this media will almost certainly vary depending on the type of display and the type of player.<br /><br />On the whole, I do feel I got an upgrade: the images had a sharpness and a depth that improves upon the non Blue-ray version; and the colors also seemed to benefit from the upgrade. Not a lot, mind you.<br /><br />Bonus material was not significantly improved upon.<br /><br />This was a difficult review to write because 1) it is largely subjective, based as it is on my perceptions, and 2) subject to the technology variables that obtain from the player and TV being used.<br /><br />Still, I hope this helps.<br />Peace
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this even though the review said it as a bit of a pain because of the battery and 20' cable.<br />It sounded fine, but I can now see where the 20' cable is a bit much. Its sad that this would be a<br />great product if the offered a short plug that took plug-in power, or the plugged into the 20' battery<br />setup. The other thing is, the battery container is nearly big enough for a AA, why not use AA or AAA<br />and avoid the button battery. So close. Waiting on giant squids to compare.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like it because when I don't have my laptop at hand, I can still tweet about how my friends and I just saw the most funny movie ever!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|this game is very addicting had lots of fun with it.  would reccomend it to anyone that likes to sit and play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it its a amazing way to pass time. some games are a little hard but they ar still fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great addictive time waster that is perfect for any age.  Nice on Kindle Fire.  Would like to see a no ad version available.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Really cool and addictive game. Very much worth the price of admition and worth all the efforts and costs to own.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This movie was done very well, some of the bad reviews about dialog and bad acting are missing the point. This movie is done in the style of the great war movies of the 40s and 50s where the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined. It is refreshingly free from gratuitous racial issues.<br /><br />You will go away proud to be American and proud of these great men. Too bad there aren't more of these movies, we could use them. 5 stars all the way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very deep and sexual and maybe not for all readers.  It's an awesome read and makes you understand the needs that some people have in order to keep a relationship.  Very sexual and sadistic in its own way. It also helps you understand that pleasuring yourself and your partner can be exciting if you let them in the door and could make a relationship more comforting and open.  I loved reading these books.  At first I didn't think I would after starting in the first book, but as I kept reading is was very erotic and sexy and I couldn't put the book down.  Now I've come to understand that it has been the best book ever that I have read.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />I can only hope that E.L. writes more exciting books like this one...:)
0062183591|4.0|I would have liked some more academic heft to the book, but I liked the book for what it provided me. This third book from Dan Ariely focuses on the specific area of measuring the extent of cheating under a variety of circumstances. Several experiments the author and others conducted are used to examine how much we cheat, and how that varies with the extent of monitoring, the money involved, and so on. In the end, this is a short, lightweight read on the topic.<br /><br />As soon as the book is off the block, so to say, the author takes aim at the venerable Gary Becker, Nobel laureate, who gave us the modern economic notion of cheating by suggesting that \\"people commit crimes based on a rational analysis of the situation.\\" \\"He also noted that in weighing the costs versus the benefits, there was no place for consideration of right or wrong; it was simply about the comparison of possible positive and negative outcomes.\\" This came to be known as the \\"Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC)\\". And it this model that the author seeks to take a sledgehammer of research to. His and his colleagues' research was to try and find out whether this model actually held true under a variety of conditions.  A cursory look around, including the experience of Dan Weiss, who worked at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., who found out that \\"We are going to take things from each other if we have a chance ... many people need controls around them for them to do the right thing.\\" If one looks around in India, especially at the political, bureaucratic, and business class, one cannot but agree with this bleak assessment and with Becker's model of rational crime; lax controls and non-existent monitoring, a corrupt police, compromised investigations, a tardy judicial process, and a media in bed with the venal all mean that crime is a very low-risk profession in India today.<br /><br />The basic test that was used is a paper test with twenty matrices, each matrix containing twelve numbers, with the task being to find \\"two numbers that added up to 10\\" in each matrix. This became the \\"matrix task\\". After each person completed the test, for which they were given five minutes, they were supposed to submit their sheets to the experimenter, who would count the number of correct answers and then hand out money based on the number of correct answers. Another setup, \\"called the shredder condition\\", was one in which the participants had the \\"opportunity to cheat.\\" Here the participants had to count the number of correct answers, put their worksheet \\"through the shredder at the back of the room\\", come tell the experimenter how many matrices they solved correctly, and get paid accordingly. A third variant of this experiment was to plant a subject who would get up after just a minute or so after the test, proclaim loudly that he (or she) had got many more correct than was reasonably possible, and then see how people reacted. Since these tests were conducted on people on a random basis, and since it was possible to determine, on average, how many problems could people be expected to solve, without cheating, by varying the standard \\"matrix test\\" by adding conditions that made it easier and possible for people to cheat, it could be measured how much people cheated when given the opportunity and motive to do so.<br /><br />  \\"In the control condition, participants solved on average four out of the twenty matrices. Participants in the shredder condition claimed to have solved an average of six - two more than in the control condition.\\"<br /><br />Basically, it turns out that \\"we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self-image as reasonably honest individuals.\\" How so? Imagine if you were attempting the matrix test along with twenty other people. After the allotted five minutes you had solved only four problems - a very average result, but nothing to scoff at either. But suppose now you were in the shredder version of the test. If you claimed you had solved all twenty matrices, it would be fairly obvious to everyone that you were a big freaking cheat. On the other hand, if you claimed to have solved six or seven or eight problems, you could not only impress others, but also tell yourself that that represented your true ability. After all, you had got distracted during the test, and that time lost therefore did not count. Or that the room was too hot, and that affected your ability to perform to the best of you ability. And so on...<br /><br />Remember the age-old problem of gorging on junk food when you are tired? This is not a figment of your imagination; rather, psychologists have dubbed it \\"ego depletion\\". \\"The basic idea behind ego depletion is that resisting temptation takes considerable effort and energy.\\" Which leads the author into a direction related to this book, \\"Might people who overtax themselves in one domain end up being less moral in others? Does depletion lead us to cheat?\\" Which is sort of related to the very sad problem of dead grannies. Huh? Grannies and students and exam deadlines? Yes! \\"... students who are failing are fifty times more likely to lose a grandmother compared with non-failing students.\\"<br /><br />A while back I had read a very engaging and eye-opening book, \\"[[ASIN:0143117637 Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture]]\\", by Ellen Ruppel Shell, that talked about the different ways in which the fixation on cost has impacted our lives. Dan Ariely's book brings a different perspective on this issue, of fakes. Fakes are a cheap imitation of the real thing, the operative words here being \\"cheap\\" and \\"fake\\". Lying is at work even here. \\"People who 'dressed above their station' were silently, but directly, lying to those around them.\\" Fast-forward to some tests and it turns out, as you may have guessed somewhat but will also be surprised, \\"that wearing a genuine product does not increase our honesty (or at least not by much). But once we knowingly put on a counterfeit product, moral constraints loosen to some degree, making it easier to take further steps down the path of dishonesty.\\"<br /><br />  \\"In the end, we concluded that counterfeit products not only tend to make us more dishonest; they also cause us to view others as less than honest.\\"<br /><br />So what is the way out? Obviously, monitoring can help, as the matrix tests clearly reveal. But pervasive monitoring has its own costs, prohibitive at times, clearly impractical at others, and which raises questions of privacy in society. However, a mirror can help. \\"It seems, then, that when we are made unambiguously aware of the ways we cheat, we become far less able to take unwarranted credit for our performance.\\"<br /><br />At the end of the day, or the book, whichever comes later, this is a fascinating book that takes a very close look at lying and self-deception. It is likely that several years of further research study is needed to uncover the causes of lying, a topic of much study over thousands of years already. What this book does seem to do is tell us that lying and cheating are not simply matters of straightforward amoral calculations based on costs and consequences of getting caught. And thereby lies the challenge.<br /><br />Read about Gary Becker's work, Rational Theory of Crime on Wikipedia, and University of Chicago.<br /><br />A great book and still a fascinating read on how we are influenced and how we seek to influence and persuade others continues to be Robert Cialdini's [[ASIN:006124189X Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (Collins Business Essentials)]].<br />Other books on similar topics are [[ASIN:1400077427 Stumbling on Happiness]] and  [[ASIN:014311526X Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]], by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Challenging, fun, and great graphics but I wanted more...finished it in less than half a day.  please make a sequel!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was surprised to find out that I could buy video and then stream it through Amazon.com.  What a wonderful thing.  I'd heard about Downton Abbey from my boss who is a man of 30 years old and he said it was spellbinding.  Well, to say the least.  I watched the entire First Season on Netflix in two days and then, anxiously, went in to get the Second Season going.  Well, to my surprise, they didn't have the second season.  Now, if you have watched this Series then you know how utterly and fabulously addictive it is.  I actually felt a bit of a panic when I was told that they might not have it until the end of Summer.  Wah!!!!  Then, I decided to check Amazon.com and not only did you have it, but I could purchase it in a format where I could watch it immediately via video stream through a new feature called AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO.  I TOLD EVERYBODY about this feature.  Well done, Amazon!  I will be using this new feature often.  And certainly well done DOWNTON ABBEY II.  The only thing DOWNTON ABBEY II left me wanting is many, MANY more episodes.  AND, I hear that Shirley McClain has just joined the cast. Wow!  Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any better. I cannot tell you when I last appreciated a series more. Mystery, Intrigue, Romance, Suspense and with an outstanding cast and superbly written, directed and acted. PBS has to find a way to make the amazing ratings for this Show turn into a profit for them (i.e., they don't show commercials).  In the meantime, Thank You, Amazon and THANK YOU DOWNTON ABBEY.  Absolutely WONDERFUL.
1250000971|1.0|I just received my copy, was disappointed to see it only has 337 pages, while the review said 352. They must have been including the blank pages. While I have always enjoyed All of Jeffrey Archer's previous books and was really looking forward to the continuation of the Clifton cronicles. It seem to me The whole story could have been in one book at one price rather than 3 books way over priced.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|It's been awhile since I've felt so moved by an artist's music... the voice, the music, the lyrics. I find myself listening to \\"Blue Jeans\\" over and over and over again. It's such a sexy, sultry song and it has literally changed my life. I feel that people are being too hard on her about her live performances. I've heard many artists do MUCH worse... can someone explain to me why there was so much backlash? I thought she did just fine on SNL, her voice just sounds different live (as many artists' voices do)

B0034DGPEU|1.0|I couldn't believe as I turned the pages that this book had gotten so many good reviews. I don't want to repeat what some of the other one star reviewers have said. All I will say is I agree.<br /><br />I have been reading everyday since I was six. This book didn't have one original thought, character or plot device. I believe that as a writer you have to take from many subjects that have already been done and make it your own. This book was not unique in any way and it was the worse possible depiction of several different stereotypes. A sin inside a sin. I hate to down an author's work but as a lifelong reader I was so surprised by the reviews verses the reality I felt the need to voice my opinion.
006197806X|4.0|So I'm hoping that the trend of dystopian young adult books is working its way out (there are sure a lot of mermaid books cropping up, aren't there?) because I have a confession to make.<br /><br />I love this genre of book.<br /><br />Seriously - I love everything from older classics (1984 anyone?) to new stuff like The Hunger Games and Lauren Oliver's Delirium.  But here's my issue with these books - the insufferable love triangle.<br /><br />Granted, in Delirium something horrible happens to Lena and that pattern does not crop up throughout Pandemonium ... but even in death some things make themselves apparent.  Is it too much to just ask that a heroine be focused on the bigger picture?<br /><br />I enjoyed Delirium for what it was - and I enjoyed Pandemonium for what it was as well.  I enjoyed the Then and Now flashes through time, two separate stories being told which provide the bigger picture of who Lena was and is becoming.  I just wish the focus was less about boys and more about changing the world so that boys COULD be an option.  Just because they are there doesn't mean they take precedence over everything else, you know?<br /><br />But don't let me ranting and raving urge you away from this book, because of all the dystopian books out there, this is one of the better series.  I knew Lauren Oliver was a force to be reckoned with when I read her debut novel Before I Fall, and with each book she puts out she gets stronger and stronger.  I wish I could write like this woman, but since I can't I'll sit back and enjoy the ride.
B007HO392S|5.0|On her most recent album, Blown Away, Carrie Underwood shows us the world of country music.  She travels from traditional country to contemporary country to progressive country.  This album serves up songs for people across the spectrum and should be lauded for it's diversity.<br /><br />On the traditional side, Underwood provides the ballad Wine After Whiskey drawing the analogy between a regular relationship and the kind of love that is so strong that anything else seems \\"watered down\\".  She continues down the traditional path with Thank God For Hometowns which touches on the nerves of what it feels like to go back home while also acknowledging a past desperation to go beyond one's hometown.  The song embraces the listener as the hometown embraces the person returning.  Forever Changed is a tenderly handled ballad about the story of one woman's life from marriage to birth to dementia.  This is a painful topic yet Underwood sings about it with deep care and compassion that reflects a respect for the difficult and painful reality of dementia.  Leave Love Alone is a rootsy country ditty that will leave you clapping your hands and stomping your feet.<br /><br />On the contemporary country side, Underwood tackles fear of commitment with the fun Cupid's Got a Shotgun with the help of the excellent Brad Paisley on guitar.  She confronts running into a past lover on Good in Goodbye and looking back on first love with Do You Think About Me.  She follows the likes of Kenny Chesney and Zac Brown Band in dipping into Jimmy Buffet's school of music with One Way Ticket (Underwood provides the whistling herself).  She hands out inspiration to young women with Nobody Ever Told You and inspiration for meeting one beyond this life in See You Again.  She holds onto a long held bond between country music and faith in her power ballad Who Are You in which she sings with conviction and compassion.  With her lead single, Good Girl, Underwood follows in her own footsteps of talking aboutthat not so good guy but brings it to the next level with electric guitar, handclaps and an a cappela ending.<br /><br />Finally, Underwood plunges into the future sounds country can embrace with the title track, Blown Away, and Two Black Cadillacs.  These songs follow the tradition in country music of story-telling but is not your mother's country music.  Here Underwood paves the way for a new direction for country music - good songs and good stories go hand in hand in bringing new sounds to the present country landscape.  These two songs cannot be denied.  Their quality is unparalleled and they should become classics in the country genre and beyond.<br /><br />Although this album caters to a spectrum of different tastes, Underwood does not sacrifice cohesiveness for diversity.  The theme of this album is all kinds of love - unhealthy love (Good Girl), obsession with love (Leave Love Alone), transcendent love (See You Again, Who Are You), past love (Good in Goodbye, Wine After Whiskey, Do You Think About Me), poisonous love (Blown Away, Two Black Cadillacs), fear of love (Cupid's Got a Shotgun), self love (Nobody Ever Told You), love for your roots (Thank God for Hometowns) and love of life (Forever Changed, One Way Ticket).<br /><br />Miss Underwood serves up her respect for country music and music in general with this excellent album.
0345803485|5.0|I could not put this book down!  E.L. James has an amazing way of grabbing you and not letting go; the characters possess you and you fall in love with each of them.  One of the best books I've read in a very long time.

B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a great app. Not the only one of its type, but from a brief survey of others that I've done, the best that is out there for producing interesting sounding music without trying. It is also a good teaching tool as it visually associates relative distances with time in the beats and tones produced by each node. In addition the default melodic scales make it hard even for the musically inept to produce something that sounds bad.<br /><br />Very innovative and enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app in easiness to use and convenience but it freezes up often especially when wi fi is spotty.

B0000C23DO|4.0|first off, i like this because it includes the five best songs from american beauty, which is good as i lost my cassette copy a while back and have found no need to replace it thanks to this gnarly compilation. it has a lot of good tracks from the 'grateful dead records' period too and some good highlights of the arista years. liked the inclusion of u.s. blues~it's been my earworm alot lately since i have recently obtained the grateful dead movie and it's one of the songs featured in the movie~another worthy inclusion from the Mars Hotel album would have been Scarlet Begonias. i would have liked a couple more numbers from 'in the dark' such as throwin stones' or brent mydland's '900,000 Tons of Steel' , \\"West L.A Fadaway\\" or When Push Comes To Shove\\" anyway, guess i need a new copy of 'in the dark' lol~anyway, i'm veering off the subject, this is a great \\"one stop shop\\" if you're just getting into the dead or just want one \\"greatest hits\\" type of deal. Buy it together with \\"workingman's dead\\" as there is only two tracks from that awesome album.

0547391005|2.0|Two stars means \\"don't like it\\", which is true for me. I love Curious George and so does my child. I was excited to get this book for her so we could celebrate the classic stories. However I hadn't realized that in the original stories The Man in the Yellow Hat was sneaky and manipulative. To start he tricks George while in the jungles of Africa using his hat and then bags him up and ships him off to a zoo. Later he wants to use George to make a movie, and this is the reason he gives the nurse to keep George well in the hospital. Lot's of characters smoke pipes, including George before bedtime (which is not something he does and gets in trouble for, but is acceptable). Some of the lessons about his curiosity are bit extreme like breaking his legs or having to have open surgery. There's quite a bit that I didn't like. What I love about modern George is the lessons that are taught. I realize this is an old book and things were different at the time; the book was afterall written in Europe just around the time of Nazi Germany. I appreciate the book, but it's not something I want to share with my child at this point. There's a reason we wait till kids are older to talk about certain things and although some reviewers say that this books is a chance to expose them to reality, I prefer to wait and not use Curious George who is currently a role model/teacher of good lessons in life.
B004N868DS|5.0|The delivery estimate was slightly overshot. I got my mousepad about 9 days after the stated delivery date. But the wait was worth it. This mousepad is 2 sided. one side is optimized for \\"speed\\" the other side for \\"control\\". I usually play \\"rts\\" (real time strategy) games, but i dabble in first person shooters and the occasional role playing game. I am becoming more and more obsessed with computer gadgets as my interest in computer games slowly intensifies. I use the speed side for rts games and the control side for rpg's and fps'. Some of the \\"talking heads\\"on \\"youtube\\" have been dismissive of the wrist rest that comes with the mousepad. use it!!! carpel tunnel can be a real threat to people on the computer for long periods of time. if you are into computer gaming like i am you will need a mousepad like this.

086571701X|5.0|I devour every book I come across in regards to all aspects of gardening. This book is good for you regardless of your skill or knowledge level.<br /><br />Aquaponics has the potential to not only help you feed your family in a small space but to also give you excess to share with others. It is in my opinion the best book on aquaponics that there is (There are some excellent videos and you can youtube the topic to see some of the details but the book is a must) and it is vital to have a book so that you know all of the aspects. Knowing the subject thoroughly is worth the effort because it reduces your chance of losses or failures and giving up.<br /><br />Even though this takes some work and practice the results are more than worth it and this book covers all of the aspects in extreme detail. The only other thing you will need is a basic book on PVC plumbing, because that is a section big enough to fill a book by itself. Best of luck to you.

0871404133|5.0|This book is a must read for those who want to educate themselves on the current debates that are raging within the realms of evolutionary biology. While I have been persuaded by Wilson's arguments for group selection over inclusive fitness I recognize that as an amateur I do not have a long history with competing theories beyond familiarity with the works of Richard Dawkins. Nonetheless I think this book is exactly what the conversation needs right now regardless of whether you agree completely with Wilson's conclusions. This book is going to piss some people off, that is for sure. The reviewers who feel that this is simply Social Darwinism 2.0 are missing the point completely in my opinion and they lack an understanding of Wilson's argument and as well as the mechanics of natural selection. Wilson's writing is accessible and enjoyable and I  believe he will eventually prove to be correct largely because what he's saying is not a huge deviation from Darwin's original ideas. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding how natural selection works in the real world. Even if you end up disagreeing with the conclusion, you'll enjoy reading this book.<br /><br />I do agree that it is unfair to compare human societies to ant societies but that's because I find ants to be  much more interesting than humans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is and will probably ever be the most tricky and uncomfortable review I have ever written. Let me say, I have heard plenty of things about this book and  some of what I have heard scared the crap out of me. I have never been frightened to read a book until now. But I thought it best to get my own opinion and well...I loved it. I loved it sooooo much. I can't believe it myself. And I have no regrets.<br /><br />  The characters were incredible and intense as hell. Christian is truly overwhelming. He had these massive mood swings and it was hard to keep up with him. But I honestly couldn't hate him. Anastasia (Ana) was smart and was able to take on Christian which was surprising. But I like that she just didn't do everything he asked, she fought him at every corner. I would have hated her if she didn't question him and acted like some stepford wife. She was willing to do a lot for him (I mean A LOT) and I love the journey she took not only for him but herself. And they still obviously have a long way to go. I loved Ana's best friend Kate. She seems to know something is up before everybody else knows something is up. I wish we could get more about her and Elliot, Christian's adopted brother. They definitely had a lot sparks flying between them.<br /><br />  Now the problem with a lot of erotica/BDSM, is that they don't actually have plots. They are more just for the sex and not much else. Well we get plenty of both here. We slowly uncover that Christian has some dark past that is the reason he is the way he is and why he likes what he likes. It is unnerving to say the least and we don't even know the full story yet. But I want to know more and I want to know more now.<br /><br />  The one real criticism I have is actually over the hype. I think when people heard this was a Twilight fanfict, they just started grabbing it without paying attention to what they were getting into. And that is where the hype comes in. This is where I call bulls***. Quite frankly I think that the Twilight name drop was a way to get people to read it because I don't really see a connection between the two at all. It makes no sense. If anything, this book reminds me a lot of Gabriel's Inferno by Sylvain Reynard. It is not a BDSM/erotica, but the characters, the tone, and the depth of the books are very much alike. If BDSM isn't your cup of tea or you have read this and wanted something less extreme, I say go and buy Gabriel's Inferno.<br /><br />  Fifty Shades of Grey is very dark and erotic. It has its tough moments (very tough) and moments that have you laughing and giggling (I loved those emails). It is truly a mixture I haven't come across before. That is what makes it so difficult to write because I have read the complaints. On one hand I understand where people are coming from. But I also see that this comes from a dark place. It is unrealistic to expect that everyone is the same and everyone handles things the same way. And that is the whole point behind Christian Grey. I get where James is coming from here and what she is showing us. I am glad she went there. This is not the first BDSM ever written, but people are definitely acting that this is the very first BDSM ever written. This book will not be for everybody, hell probably not for maybe 50% of people that have or will read it. If BDSM/erotica isn't your thing, don't read this.<br /><br />  But I have had my eyes open and my views on things have shifted. We (especially me) are use to a certain kind of romance, I am glad to be introduced to a different kind. One that has more layers that really need deciphering. The title of this book is incredibly fitting. Things are not as black and white as we want to see them. I am dying for book 2 right now because that ending almost left me in tears. Not cool Mrs. James, not cool at all. Throw the hype out the window, if anything it makes things worse. Like I said, given all that I heard and read, I was scared to read this. I am glad I ignored all ofthat or I would have been missing out and not have grasped the real depth of this story if I had listened. I recommend this only to those who are willing to go into some very dark territory, the other 50%.that or I would have been missing out and not have grasped the real depth of this story if I had listened. I recommend this only to those who are willing to go into some very dark territory, the other 50%.
0345803485|1.0|Take that, E.L.! I'd rather have a man whisper/murmur THOSE words in my ear then be further victimized by this 'outstanding piece of literature.\\" I have read some erotica, but not much. I will not criticize the author personally, as I have been working on a novel myself since I was in my late 20's. First of all, I am sorry, but with words like \\"keen\\" and \\"you look lovely like that\\" and \\"gather\\" I could only picture these two people as British. Besides, how many American men say to a fashionably dressed women, \\"You look lovely tonight, that's a lovely dress?\\"<br />To prove I am no 'fogey\\" I was reading Eric Lustbrador when I was 18 as well as Jackie Collins, and even Bertrice Small.  I found the sex so so, but redundant from pervious books I have read. Hell, yours truly has read books where the act involves grapes, butter, candles, pistols, and yes, even whips. Besides, how many virgins, after making love with a  man for first time, a man who is quite endowed as it were, NOT feel a tad uncomfortable?<br /><br />To make a long review short, I was mostly angry. Throughout my writing life, I have taken writing classes, and even entered a piece I wrote into a writing contest for \\"Writers\\" magazine. One of the MAIN RULES for new writers, or so I thought before I read this book, was NOT TO USE CLICHES..EVER! or any BAD GRAMMAR..or if your grammar not so great...PROOFREAD IT! The editor of the magazine, as well as my writing teachers have told me this many times. One of them even saying 'you may have the best story in the world, but unless you master these skills (good grammar or know the rules regarding English grammar anyway) most editors and agents will ignore your work.'<br /><br />With the turning of each page, my eyes seeing phrases like \\"pedal to the metal\\" etc, I found myself clenching my teeth in confusion and annoyance. I am thinking of returning to my work, because for several years I had become depressed about if it was good enough, if I HAVE overused cliches, if my grammar is up to par, and i have not switched tenses. as well as the fact  that other authors I have read, who also write about what I am writing have the advantage of living in that place, whereas I only have my computer and my numerous notes. What does the success of this book mean now that all the rules I have been taught are apparently  being ignored? What does this say about the publishing industry?

B001FB55L2|3.0|The actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job. I felt they pull you into the characters. Even the little girls in the movie did great. I just was surprised how the story unfolded. It did not go into directions I expected and it went into other directions. I wasn't satisfied with the ending. I don't know what I would have wanted exactly but I felt like it was a snowball effect that landed nowhere. Not really a good ending. I am the type of person, If the ending is not good then I do not care for the movie. Good to watch one time. I would suggest renting it not buying it
1401235417|4.0|I just finished reading this graphic novel (don't worry no spoilers here) and I am thoroughly impressed by the work of Capullo, Snyder and Glapon. Snyder's writing is terrific, combining elements from Batman's past and setting them in motion for an all new mystery. His writing is true to Batman, and the characters in the volume speak for themselves; but they are brought to life through Capullo's spectacular imagery. It is gritty, dark, but still colorful and expressive very reminiscent to Jim Lee. If you like his work, then you will like Capullo. I can safely say that if you buy this graphic novel you will not be disappointed. I already want volume 2! Happy reading!

1400049628|4.0|Played for laughs by oft-times playing it straight this book by Max Brooks claims to be a treatise on how to keep your kith and kin safe when the brown stuff hits the fan in the form of a zombie assault. The book takes the zombie noob on a tour of what a zombie is, how they behave etc and also gives a lowdown on zombies through history as well as some quotes from those who have come face to face with the rotting undead.<br /><br />Brooks explains that his book is not the be-all and end-all of how to survive in general and freely admits the general reader should brush up on their generic survival skills by reading other `mainstream' works on bush craft etc and that his book is aimed squarely at facets of survival that pertain specifically to zombie related scenarios. As such he goes through weaponry, body armour, delves into zombie patterns of behaviour and also looks at areas that would be high and low risk in the event of an outbreak of zombieism (is that a word???).<br /><br />Beyond the above Brooks also discusses things such as ratings of zombie outbreaks based on size and also outlines basic plans for creating strongholds from which to wait out even the most terrifyingly gargantuan apocalyptic scenario.<br /><br />But to be serious for a moment.... a lot of this book is just good fun. It's entertainment at it's most simple and hey, it's not the end of the world if a lot of it is devoid of common sense (Brooks seems to get a lot of material out of saying \\"in this case you'd think X would be a good idea but actually it's not and here is why\\" when in actual fact it's pretty obvious that X would be a darn tootin' great idea - the guy is just taking up a contrary position to fill a few more lines of his book and stretch his idea out).<br /><br />Perfect fodder as a light hearted gift this `un, or for the friend or relative who spends too much time in front of a computer screen shooting zombies in this weeks latest craze undead video game.
0385737955|3.0|Interesting premise, but the characters weren't fleshed out and the author spent too much time reiterating how surprised or shocked or frustrated Thomas was with his lack of memory.

1932100660|5.0|People who think logically, if too much thought is put into something, can tend to move things beyond a point where it probably shouldn't have gone. This is especially true when it comes to diet. Unfortunately, for logically thinking people, moving to extremes equates to moving toward perfection in their minds, which may or may not be the case in reality.<br /><br />For example, it wouldn't be uncommon to read a few health books and come to the conclusion that the best health could be obtained from eating diets high in meat and fats. Why? Because some indigenous people ate meat and fat and their populations were healthy. Quite a few diets take this and run with it. Paleo diets and Caveman diets come to mind, and there are actually some truth to them.<br /><br />Indeed, much good research into diet and health has come from studying the health of indigenous populations. Research by Weston A. Price detailed indigenous people who ate non-farmed, high-meat diets and, yet, whose population were generally healthy and free of disease and cancer. Sally Fallon and the Weston A. Price Foundation has also done great work in exposing the dire health hazards of margarine and other man-made oils.<br /><br />The problem with perfection is that there is often a world of difference between what is in your mind and what actually takes place in the real world. While certainly, wild food represents the pinnacle of nutritious food, it is silly to think that the masses could revert back to a hunter-gatherer society. It is also a leap in logic to think that because indigenous people ate a lot of meat, it is OK for us to eat a lot of meat. The difference is, the meat we eat is not wild and is not of the same quality. It was the \\"wild\\" part that was the key to their health.<br /><br />And, while butter is better for you than margarine, much of its health benefits are lost after it is pasteurized and homogenized, and the same goes for milk. However, raw butter and milk just aren't realistic for the masses to consume for various reasons. In fact, many populations in the world don't even drink milk and these populations have much lower rates of cancer and disease than we do. That something was good for you in 1802, does not take into account either the quality or quantities of what is consumed today, nor the fact that people are living longer.<br /><br />I feel very strongly that any diet designed for optimum health, needs to be realistic, accessible, and affordable for the masses. What the diet perfectionist really propose is dietary elitism, where only the smart and more affluent can obtain good health and avoid cancer and other diseases. There may even be a certain point where it does boost the ego to know you really are smarter than everyone else...but keep in mind, your good fortune depends on everyone else's bad fortune, because if everyone decided to use only raw butter, unless you are a dairy farmer, your source of it would dry up overnight.<br /><br />The beauty of The China Study is that it is workable for the masses, affordable, and backed up by mountains of research. The longest lived people in the world right now, the Okinawans, are eating a somewhat similar diet. Folks this is it, and you really don't have to go to any extreme whatsoever. There are healthy people in China that eat meat, just way less of it than in America. What Colin Campbell has given the world moves perfection out of the minds of the dietary elitist and into the real world. Yes, the elitist can and do nitpick Colin's information, but until they can produce four decades of research to back up their accusations, their rhetoric really should be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Really, if a person could only read a handful of books on diet in their lifetime, The China study should be on the list.<br /><br />All of that said, I do think Campbell does make a few leaps of logic of his own. For one, because low amounts of animal proteins equal better health, does not necessarily make it true that no animal proteins equal the best health possible. That may turn out to be true, but it is hard to prove scientifically because there are so few large populations that eat no animal proteins. Which might make a thinking person ask the question, \\"why?\\"  Maybe all the vegan societies died off and the rest of the people said, \\"I think I'll eat a little animal meat from time to time.\\" (And to be fair, I think temporary periods of veganism make for a great cleansing diet, but there is a difference in doing it short-term and doing it long-term). The bottom line, at least for me, is the jury is still out on this, and I would like to see scientific evidence versus leaps of logic and opinion.<br /><br />Another fallacy of The China Study is that all of health is related to diet. While certainly, eating right is a cornerstone of good health, there are other variables. Getting stuck on the night shift at work for decades at a time can shorten a person's life.  Why? Because there are other components to health than diet. Sunshine, exercise, happiness, community and family, love, etc.. They all play a role in a person's health.<br /><br />If I were to narrow down living healthy to three books, I would get \\"The China Study,\\" the audiobook to \\"Ancient Wisdom for Modern Health: Rediscover the simple, timeless secrets of health and happiness,\\" by Mark Bunn, and \\"Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain,\\" by John J. Ratey and Eric Hagerman. And for an added bonus, throw in the \\"The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom,\\" by Jonathan Haidt.<br /><br />With just this handful of books, a person should be able to live a long, healthy and happy life. It's that simple.
0985081821|5.0|This book had me right on the first sentence.<br />If you haven't read this book before (and if you haven't, you need to), it starts out with Sophia Parsons, a 22 year old Wiccan who just inherited a house from her grandfather. She's only got a couple friends, due to some horrible things that have happened that have basically made her an outcast in the small town where she's lived her whole life. She also is hearing voices in her head, which would drive the sanest of people crazy - ya know? She has quite the reputation in her town, because she is Wiccan, and the town she lives in has Christian-crazy people who want her house because it lays on sacred ground. Worse, her mother is bi-polar and joined this little group against her very own daughter. So, Sophia's close friend, Ivory, takes her to a fancy underground club called 'Club Flesh'. Enticing, eh? There she meets a man who she is quite drawn to - Charles. Oh, he's charming and handsome and all that jazz. But when she is attacked by a man she's never met before, her crazy life is about to take an even crazier turn. Rebecca successfully mixes vampires (not the sparkly ones, trust me) and elementals together to create this enthralling debut novel.<br /><br />This story has a little bit of everything, but in short there is basically one creature for every element (air, fire, water, earth, and spirit) and then there are some other things too, like spirits/ghosts and humans with supernatural abilities. The way the story ties everything together is really neat. I absolutely loved Sophia, the main character! It's really her against the world. There's a Christian-cult in her town that ultimately takes things too far. Her mom is even part of it, and their relationship really tugged at my heart. And I like that Sophia is tough without being cold. She still has emotions and it translated well to me, which made the story more real, which sucked me in even more because Sophia is such a very real character I feel like she really exists out there somewhere.<br /><br />I became quickly absorbed by The Forever Girl, a paranormal love story which starts with the main character Sophia battling the world because she is 'different'. A simple night out changes her life forever when she discovers that no-one and nothing is what it seems. Drawing us into the world of vampires, elementals and other, darker forces Rebecca writes an amazingly spellbinding story.<br /><br />It's Sophia's voice that hooked me, almost from page one. There is something about the way she tells her own story that felt open and honest and just likeable. Which is not to say Sophia herself is always open, honest or easy to be around in regards to the other characters - just that despite whatever turmoil she's going through, her first-person narration stays true to herself. She never feels like an \\"unreliable narrator.\\" Rebecca Hamilton takes two tropes of the urban fantasy genre, blends them together and creates something exciting and original.<br /><br />The first trope is the \\"misunderstood Wiccan outsider in a small community with a secret to hide.\\" It's a stereotype, isn't it? But where some authors would hang a few generic and poorly-researched \\"wiccan\\" symbols on the character and move on, Hamilton clearly spent time building Sophia's world-view and making it as much a part of her as any real Wiccan's religion would be to them. In other words, it doesn't feel like a trope or a handy stereotype; it feels like a natural part of an intriguing character's life.<br /><br />The second trope is the \\"we're not vampires/werewolves, but the vampire/werewolf myths were based on us\\" trope that has become increasingly handy for authors who want a recognizable supernatural threat but who want to be able to change the rules. In the Cruor and Strigoi, Hamilton takes what most of us love about vampires and shape-shifters and then twists it for her world's needs, adding some original thought in along the way; her races are not differentfor differences' sake, but different because it's what her story & world need them to be. The fact that she mentions the Cruor were the basic of vampires myths exactly once, and then never brings it up again, is another perfect touch: we've gotten the point, it doesn't need to be bashed over our heads. What we learn of Cruor culture feels more authentic because we're not constantly being reminded that they're \\"vampires.\\" And the Cruor-Strigoi-Ankou-etc culture is something I eargerly await learning more about in future books.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoy about Hamilton's writing: the book is detailed without being full of details. It's another effective use of Sophia's voice; she shares details of what she smells, what she tastes, what she and others are wearing, because these are the things that matter to her, but she leaves out details of architecture, history, weather, because to her they are less important. This means we're not bogged down with \\"filler\\" events in the narrative. Months go by between chapters (the book essentially jumps from Halloween to Christmas at one point, with one short paragraph explaining the leap) and that's okay because it keeps the book moving and keeps our heroine from sounding like she's completely lost in morose self-pity. (Instrospective, Sophia is; maudlin, she's not.)<br /><br />Obviously, as I've given the book 5 stars, I really don't have anything to complain about. I will say this: I wish the relationship between Sophia and her friends Ivory and Lauren had been developed a little stronger in the opening chapters to give later events even greater weight. This is the one thing in the book where I felt Sophia's voice went slightly awry; if these are her best friends, I'd have liked to see more indication of that earlier on. But it's a minor quibble in a book that otherwise kept me up late to finish it. The last quarter of the book is a bit of a mad dash and I loved every moment of it. Though the ending did leave me a bit sad.I'm sure you'll love this book and much as I did!<br /><br />Happy reading! 
B004JMZPJG|4.0|I chose to order this case for my Canon SLR since it is both branded, stylish (love the orange stripe), lightweight and with enough space and cushion/protection for my SLR, as well as for the 3 pockets for camera accessories. Have been using for over one year now in all of travels and does the work brilliantly. Would recommend for start-up SLR users. Of course always makes sense to look for other options and choose best deal for you. But would definitely recommend!!
0443069522|5.0|The book arrived promptly and was in GREAT condition, although I think the vendor noted that it was in 'fair' condition.  I just got through with the Anatomy class I was taking that required this book, and it was helpful for the class itself; but this is not something I would purchase on my own as a tool to help me learn. The best part about the books IS DEFINITELY THE PICTURES, as some parts of the body, vessels or nervous system are difficult to imagine reading text alone, and the pictures puts it all in perspective.  But I found the text repetitive and redundant, often times repeating itself unnecessarily and and not very fluid in the way it  was written.  Great buy from the seller though, much more reasonably priced then at the college bookstore that's for sure.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second book of the trilogy \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". If you read the first book, you have to be hooked[[ASIN:B007IXWKUK Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]] by now and read all three books. The subject matter might be new and shocking for some readers but there's also a romantic thread. The writing isn't outstanding, but that doesn't seem important. I read all three books in a week over a month ago and I couldn't get the characters out of my mind. These books are being banned in some backward places but if you're aware that the subject matter is highly sexual I highly recommend the trilogy.

B006UG90RM|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST COLLECTION OF NEW SONGS THIS GROUP HAS RELEASED SINCE 1984. Eddie is right there, just like before, better than ANY moment with Van Hagar. Wolfgang does a pretty good job of covering Mike Anthony's brilliant harmony vocal spot, and if he plays all the bass on this album he has some real talent. Alex is there too; rock solid. Dave, well, Dave does very, very well for 30 years down the line, all right? When James Brown (Dave's idol) sang in \\"The Blues Brothers\\" in the early 80's you didn't hear him doing that scream that made him immortal. You could count on singers like Sinatra or Sam Cooke to still have all their tricks 30 years later, 'cause they didn't rip their vocal cords apart like James Brown, or like Dave had to in order to be Van Halen's singer. Dave still covers his notes very well here, and writes great lyrics. He is the only frontman for this band, and any true VH fan knows it. I'm going to the show here in my town; you should go too if they come to yours. And pick up this record.

I have been so lucky as a reviewer to be sent some fabulous books but this was one that I hadn't received or read and with so many people saying \\"it's their book of 2012\\" I had to know what you all know!<br /><br />I got what I expected from this book, a wonderfully told story that would strike right into the centre of my heart but most of all I took from this was that it was a perfectly written love story. Lou and Will are the most adorable people, humours, devoted and sincere. Of course I won't give anything away to those that haven't read it yet (or am I the last person to read it!?!) I read this book whilst working in london and staying in a hotel for a couple of evenings this week, I was totally blocked up with a horrid cold and feeling rather sorry for myself. Whilst this book made me feel slightly lonely as i read the pages, it did lift my heart to think that there could be people so selfless in this world and that certainly isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Perfect ending in my opinion. Did it make me cry? - no, but it certainly made me thing which to me is more important. I would agree, it is one not to be missed.

0439023521|5.0|I was first itroduced to this book so a book club almost three years ago. Back then, we had no idea that it would become the hit that it is today, but we all loved it. I remember this was the most popular book our club talked about, and we all eagerly awaited Ctaching Fire.<br /><br />And not without reason! Collins really GETS it. Unlike many of the copies that are being produced, Collins had been able to find a balance between everything that you must have to write a book set in a world like this. Danger, love, determination, and sacrafice.<br /><br />Good job!

B003YL4LYI|3.0|Book 5 had many of the great qualities I found in books 1-4, but I had hoped for more closure with the key characters. So many strings were left hanging - making me wonder if this book was really just a set up for the next book in the series.<br /><br />That being said, he is a wonderful writer whose characters create indelible impressions on the reader. I would rate the overall series a 4 1/2!
0345803485|5.0|I thought I would hate 50 Shades and got the first book only because friends pushed me into it. I read all three books within two weeks, then felt bereft because I had no 50 Shades world to return to anymore. This author has tapped into the primal female fantasy and has done so magnificently. I adored these books and hope she writes more of them. I also loved the way she ended the trilogy. I applaud her and am happy for her success.

0439023491|5.0|I remember our book clubs excitement about this book! We waited for months to get it, and when it was at last relashed, it passed our expectations.<br /><br />Some people have complained that Catching Fire is just a repeat of Hunger Games, because Katniss goes into the games again. But this did not bother me. First of all, Katniss goes into the Games for a different reason than she went in the first time. The whole atmosphere is different.<br /><br />Snow. We at last get to see the villian. There was no specific villian in Hunger Games, we didn't really get to see much of the rulers of the Capitol. But very early on in Catching Fire, we get introduced to President Snow, who is a creepy enough villian.<br /><br />There is a added level of romance of course, because now Gale is in more. That is a element of this series, but don't be put off by the \\"Team Peeta\\" and \\"Team Gale\\" things. This romance is not at all like Twilight, and you will find yourself liking both Peeta and Gale. I'm 'Team Katniss\\" LOL<br /><br />There are some interesting elements that we get to see about the people of the Capitol. In Hunger Games, the people were crazed to see Katniss put out on the field. But in Catching Fire, they feel as if they have a bond with Katniss and Peeta as well as the other champions, and are very sad to see them go.  think this is a reflection of the people who watch reality tv just for entertainment, not seeming to care that those are real people they are watching. Collins paints an accurate picture of these people.<br /><br />The Game is intense and there are more nasty Capitol tricks.<br /><br />I especially like relevation at the end about Haymitch.<br /><br />Happy reading! On to Mockingjay!
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|I remember playing this on the old tabletop cabinets at a pizza place. It is worth it to get this free. Controls are directly by tapping the missile bunker and dragging it toward the oncoming targets. Very different than the trackball, but that is still an option I think, haven't tried it though since touch screen is so awesome! I would likely go for all the Atari hits just because I grew up playing the old games. But I already have them! Fun to see this option in a tablet format.

B0066WJLU6|5.0|this flashlight app does what it is supposed to do, namely, it uses the devices backlight to make a pretty nice light. I wouldn't want to have to use it for any serious lighting need, but for lighting your way around your house at night it does great.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Read the books and really liked them.  I was pleasantly surprised with the series.  Too often books don't translate well to film.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Huge Bruce fan and I love it!  One track that is just ok.  Bruce is definitely tired of the working class being the underdog while the money/rich seem to get more and get away with not being ethical.
0066620996|3.0|I bought this as a requirement for work.  If you practice what is written in here than you will get your monies worth.  If you are the only one from your group that buys into it, then it will be a waste of money and time.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This most assuredly surpasses all other puzzle games.  Quite challenging and intriguing, also providing a great way to sharpen ones mind.  Recommended?  Without a doubt!  DO NOT PAY $3 FOR ANGRY BIRDS WHEN THIS SPECTACULAR GAME CAN BE YOURS FOR ONLY $1!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible is very good to read w/ the different versions that it has. I only wish it could be used offline but it's still a very good choice to have. This bible allows you to search the commentary and other options also, it allows you to bookmark and highlight your favorite scriptures. It's worth the download.

I've already gotten the whole trilogy and intend to finish what I started, but I have to say, I am a good bit disappointed.

B00723NWJE|2.0|I own every album that Norah Jones produced prior to this one, and really, really like each one of them.  I enjoyed the variety and the musical style change from one album to the next.  However, I'm glad I borrowed Little Broken Hearts before buying it.  After listening to the album 4 or 5 times, I find the album to be bland and depressing.<br /><br />The style is definitely a bit different from previous albums.  This one has a bit more of a pop/light rock feel to it, with heavy use of electric guitars and faster drum scores on some songs.  Generally, the songs have a somber beat.  Her vocals are generally darker and depressing-sounding as well.  It is missing some of the light acoustic instrument notes and piano scores of previous albums.  Voice alteration--reverb, echo, etc.--is a little more common in this album as well.<br /><br />The main dislike I have with Little Broken Hearts is its depressing, bland tone.  In music, there are bright chords and morose chords.  This albums is chocked full of sullen chords.  Knowing nothing about Jones' private life, this strikes me as a post relationship-breakup album, kind of like Jones' version of an angry Alanis Morissette album.  Most of the songs are negative songs about leaving or breaking up or infidelity.  In \\"Miriam\\" she even goes so far as saying she punished her unfaithful lover \\"ear to ear\\", implying that she slit his throat.  To his female lover, she says, \\"You know I know what you did, so don't put up a fight\\" as she is killing her.<br /><br />I'd like to think that I give artists leeway to test new styles.  I enjoyed the varied musical style of Jones' previous albums, which included both positive beats and lyrics along with more emotional \\"love and loss\\" songs.  This one is boring and just downright depressing.<br /><br />I'll pass this time.
0553801473|4.0|Having read all 5 books, I think it is time in book 6 or no later than 7 to bring all the threads together and wrap them in one glorious ending.  Does anyone have a suggestion where all this should end up?  It is time for Dany to go to Westeros and clean house.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is great reading! Both I and my son have read and thoroughly enjoyed. This was our first e-book experience and we are quite pleased with it.

B000RLCJ5Q|5.0|The Clash have always been about shoving the real life into your face with either a fist or a sarcastic sneer.  These songs are a great representation of their reflection on British working class life and the general teen attitude in rebellion against the 70's \\"Let's feel good about ourselves\\" attitude.  The music is pounding and vibrant with the punk rhythms and anarchy of chords and guitar licks that still ring in the new face of Rock and Roll that still is seen in groups 30 yr. later.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|May 19, 2012<br />Arlena Dean<br />Author: Rosamund Lupton<br />Published By: Crown Publishing Group<br />Age Recommend: Adult (Language)<br />Reviewed By: Arlena Dean<br />Raven Rating: 4<br />Blog Review For: GMTA<br />Review:<br /><br />\\"Afterwards: The Novel \\" by Rosamund Lupton was a wonderful thriller, suspense mystery read. This novel was definitely one that was a page turner till the end. There are so many twist and turns with surprises.... you will really have to keep up with this fast pace novel which is good since this is a VERY long read.<br /><br />This novel was written in a second person point of view...after understanding that.... I was able to understand the story line much better. Believe me be ready for lies, secrets and lots of half truths that is all around this plot of the investigation. In \\"Afterwards\\" you will find this was a novel of a mothers' love for her children and husband.<br /><br /> In this England community... Gracie Covey while at a Sport Day celebration for the children...she discovers the school is on fire...seeing that her son Adam is safe she then see that her daughter Jenny is not .... so he enters the school and is trapped on the third floor.... and then next Gracie awakes in a hospital...unable to move or talk..trapped in her own body...but she knows she is alive .... along with her Jenny....which now the novel appears to be somewhat paranormal....in that she and her daughter can only communicate....but both Jenny and Gracies' mind is alive and able to move about the hospital and other places(outside their body)..... but they are unable to communicate with anyone else. It is very interesting at this point on seeing how this author was able to relay...what has happen to them, on to eavesdropping on the family...friends and even the hospital staff.....then to the story moving on to discover that this fire at the school was from arson.... and fear comes that this arsonist is the same person who had been harassing her Jenny earlier. The two...Jenny and Grace start to seen what was going on... however, this was not possible for the other members of the family.....Jenny could not be protected by Grace....now I will not say more about that.... you will have to pick up this wonderful novel and find out how this all comes out. Be ready for a well written read.<br /><br />I felt that all the characters were off the chart... Very Good and very captivating.......Detective Sergeant Sarah MacBride....the sister in law to Gracie was definitely my heroine as well as one of my favorite characters. This author was really able to make a very believable story on a mothers determination to keep her children safe....even though her body is incapacitated......\\"There is no happy ending but there is 'Afterwards.\\"<br /><br />\\"Afterwards:The Novel\\" is a very absorbing book that I simply enjoyed and I was very surprised in the guilty person(s) that will leave you speechless. WoW!<br /><br />I found this book to be very intriguing and an extraordinary novel and if you are in for a good thrilling, suspenseful mystery... then \\"Afterwards: The Novel\\" is a good read for you.ier.

B005HIBWFW|5.0|This film is unique and almost defies description. Produced in 1970, it deals with the disastrous marriage of Peter Tchaikovsky, a gay man that is so engaged in romantic fantasy that he fails to see what a poor decision it is to marry a woman with real sexual and intimacy needs.  Glenda Jackson does an incredible acting job since she brings intense but real emotion into an intense but surreal film. The story is compelling as we see the great composer Tchaikovsky, played perfectly by Richard Chamberlain, undergo many torments of his own making.  Ken Russell's is an outstanding film maker and this is a great example of his wide ranging interests and skills.  There are entire portions of the film that has no dialogue and the actors convey the storyline in exaggerated actions while the wonderful music of Tchaikovsky plays.  The film is full of music.  Russell uses every opportunity to use the wide ranging works of Tchaikovsky in every scene.  Tchaikovsky is portrayed here as a romantic who idealizes his sister with whom he had an intimate non-sexual intense relationship.  After the death of his mother, his sister meets many of his emotional needs. Tchaikovsky does take a male lover whom he rejects to pursue a `normal' life with a female wife. Tchaikovsky again miscalculates the revenge this spurned lover will inflict on him.  The settings of the film are beautiful and grand. Chamberlain's portrayal of Tchaikovsky in concert at the beginning of the film is outstanding. Every scene with Glenda Jackson is alive with sexual tension on the verge of madness. The drunken honeymoon scene on the train from St. Petersburg to Moscow is outstanding film-making. Russell perfectly portrays that the inability of a gay man to meet the sexual needs of a woman can be a nightmare of guilt and terror for the man and woman who find themselves in this situation. This is an outstanding film and in 1970 was very daring film-making.
B004AOECUG|5.0|I love this film- it really gives you a feel what life in the Bronx in the 1940's was like.<br />De Niro is an amazing actor and transforms himself into Jake LaMotta!  Trully, this is a<br />tragic tale of a man who had it all, and due to his own stupidity, lost it all as well.<br />Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are fantastic co-stars in this film too.  I love the fact<br />that the film is in B&W, yet Scorsese uses a beautiful touch in the film by showing<br />\\"home movies\\" of both Jake and Joey's wedding scenes in color, yet makes the film<br />look \\"1940's\\" by using scratches and such during the home clips.  De Niro is one<br />the the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen, and this is his finest hour.
B007SSDS24|2.0|the trailer is better than the movie. the plot, location, and protagonists are good. but the content of the story and the dialog are not. the trailer got my hopes up too high for the film.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a great game but needs more points to be more available because games are pricey. loved it though great game
0439882826|5.0|A beautifully executed, unique, and surprising gift for any collector of pop-up books/art. After gifting Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy, I purchased another.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just love this book because I can bo my bible study any where and I can high light , keep notes. I love anything that gives me knowledge of my Lord Jesue Christ.
B007SGM084|3.0|My little sister begged me to read this series, way before it was such a success but after she explained to me what its about, I knew I wouldnt care to read about it - it did not intrigued me. Then other friends of mine, insisted I read it and love it - well I did and it wouldnt have made a difference to me whether I read it or not. The story line did not hold my interest - I mean the sex was hot and the h/h emails exchanges were great but I had no emotional involvement with the characters. I felt Ana was too innocent for her age, too fickle, and too stubborn, and even just plain stupid at times - especially near the end. And Christian - wow what a psycho stalker control freak - aside from his good looks and money - his flaws were too great for me to ignore and I didnt get what either saw in the other. The author tried to be deep with christian and why he is the way he is but I felt his progress was rushed. They even fell in love too quickly yet were full of contradictions. Were they in lust - yes, where they in love - no not buying it - more like a bad obsession. And they both were very needy and whiny - to the point of annoyance. Also the dialogue was cheesy, wasnt buying Christian as a cool dude who thinks its great to say \\"laters,baby.\\" And one more thing was there even one bad or average looking person in this book? Everyone here was not only outrageously good looking but had the smarts to go with it - yea right. I love realism in books I read and that was lacking here! With that said - it really was just an overall ok book for me but would I recommend it? Im a romance junkie and I have tons of other better books to recommend way before I'd tell anyone to give it a try but too each his own. Maybe I wasnt impressed since Iam an avid romance reader and I admit it takes alot to impress me now and I really dont get what this trilogy is such a big deal to everyone else.
0345803485|5.0|I could not put this book down. It only took two days for me to read it. I don't know how it got called \\"mommy porn\\" because I have read more explicit shorts on my kindel. It is an epic love story between a deeply conflicted man and a woman who is innocent, and oblivious to his world of self gratification. But he can afford it. The story is great by itself without the \\"juicy\\" parts because its just a love story.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Before the release of this DVD, to me Diana Ross' famously rained out concert was just that, an outdoor concert that got rained on. I saw the photographs, newspaper clips, and some of the video footage. However, when I actually saw the events of those two days on this new DVD, I finally understood the magnitude of greatness that Miss Ross showed the world. She was literally performing and singing her heart out in pouring sheets of rain. She said she was doing the show, and she was doing it. If the crowd wasn't leaving, then neither would she. Just think about the energy, the power of having a park (New York City's CENTRAL Park) full of 800,000 people in the palm of your hand! They're all cheering for you, screaming for you, singing your songs, and answering your questions. This woman is the real deal, and so is this DVD. This is a MUST-have for every fan, and all those who want to see greatness on stage.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Finally this Ultimate Historic even in both Music and New York history is officially released on DVD.<br />The print is not restored but for both those who have the bootlegged version and those who have only seen clips on youtube it is clean and vibrant. The excitement and energy of day one is still alive and remains untouched and unparalleled thirty years later.<br /><br />There really is no entertainer who has performed in the face of this type of crisis and chaos ever. The storm only fed the mythology and grandeur that Ross has tried to create for herself and she rose to the moment and milked it for all its worth. She became a goddess and the world succumbed to all her glory eagerly.<br /><br />Day two however was a different story. The show began with the same energy but very quickly it was evident this was a different crowd and an ego maniac Ross fueled by the previous nights glory.<br /><br />Ross became annoyed with the crowd. For the first time (because of the digital print) you can see the second shows crowd much more closely and they appear as a much wilder, dirtier, and lower class crowd. In His book Call Her Miss Ross author Randy Taraborrelli also blames the fact of day two being a Friday which brought in an end of week happy hour crowd. If you read his book one can also assume Ross was glaring at the crown and chastising them wondering why she brought in such a rowdy crowd.  One may say she was thinking \\"They didn't act like this at Streisand's concert...Is this what I attract?!\\" After Mirror Mirror  Day two's show quickly became boring even for the most die-hard Ross fan.<br />However my one complaint is that though the DVD does claim it contains both days in its entirety it's not. Pieces of Ice and I believe her rambling about her then new found religion was cut out. Not sure what the point of that was. Their absence does nothing to improve the tenor of day two and though it was not a big hit, some fans really love Pieces Of Ice.<br />The DVD is a must have for all Ross fans and well as libraries and classrooms around the world. Even the most casual Ross fan or Ross haters would be mesmerized of the spectacular day one event.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I appreciate the various translations that it provides that I didn't find in the other Bible apps I tried. Also, the reading plans are such a great resource too.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|Back in the late eighties I was a true Metallica fan, buying their first four albums and loving the metal sound only they could bring. But I also bought Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\", along with the \\"Hangar 18\\" CD single. I knew vaguely about the split between the two, but had no problem enjoying both. Do Genesis fans hate Peter Gabriel? No way, and that should be the same with heavy metal geniuses like Mustaine and Ellefson.<br /><br />Hearing this album for the first time takes me back to when metal was king and American music was at the forefront of creativity. Megadeth has never gone away, and in the wasteland of American radio (which resembles this album cover), Megadeth stays true to what makes music great.<br /><br />Nowadays, the feud between the bands is long over, Lars Ulrich was invited to write the liner notes to this 2-disc remastered edition. I agree with him, the final album track \\"My Last Words\\" is a classic that ages well. But so does the rest of the album. And why shouldn't it? You can hear most of these tracks when Megadeth is on tour! Buy the album, and appreciate the live experience that you can still treasure.<br /><br />Peace Sells... but who's buying? Look at the world today, nothing has changed. And Megadeth still kills.
B00004R84J|1.0|I bought a DVD and when it arrived it was defective.  I tried using it in two dvd players and my laptop but it would not work, this dvd looks like a cheap pirate copy and not even a real dvd.  I'm sure when they sold it to me they already knew this.  What a rip off.  Beware!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|calming little game. the only problem is that it<br /> takes too long to save the necessary number of acorns needed. I can't always buy them.  will be quitting soon.
0345803493|3.0|I read the first book and was hooked to continue the story. I enjoyed the story. It was a brief escape of the daily stresses and demands. I don't understand why the other reviews are so negative. If you were looking for a classic novel, then you already know the names to pickup and read. If you want a read that allows you to have a break from your life for a few hours them this is the story for you to enjoy by the pool.
B0080OJBQW|5.0|Not just another fawning review, I promise. I am a fan and for damn good reason. Nobody sings like this man. Even a track like \\"Trespassing\\" which I don't really like still makes me get off my behind. Excellent 'pop' production throughout, and lots of layered harmonies from his unbelievable voice. \\"Kickin' In\\" is the biggest surprise to me. I can't get it out of my head and it makes me dance even in the car, a lot like The Jacksons did way back with \\"Let's Dance, Let's Shout.\\"...(been so long, I can't remember the name of the song. BUT I REMEMBER THAT BASS LINE!) This CD could have that kind of staying power. First half funky pop, fun to sing along to, even though you can't possiby hit all the high notes. Second half more rocking and more slow jams. \\"Broken English\\" is by far my favorite track and \\"Underneath\\" is pure beauty. There's a lot of head and heart here. The chord changes alone in Broken English actually made my eyes water the first time I heard it and again, I love the harmonies. Underneath is just damn good poetry which also made my eyes water the first time I read the lyrics, before I even heard the song! So, who else can go from some booty shaking (with plenty of inside references if you know what they are) to the depths of emotion? Adam F. Lambert, that's who. Do yourself a favor and buy it. He's Kickin' In, baby.
B002M9WW30|4.0|This is bascially the VHS on Blu-Ray. Good though and the last movie is actually in Blu-Ray format. But can't complain. Remeber when these were originally made.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Recieved it incredibly fast and am extremely happy eith the movie thank you! Eveyone who buys it I hope you are as happy with it as I have been
B007BVOF8E|5.0|This movie was so good. Gary Oldman is amazing, and the story is incredible. I plan on actually buying it.
B001NBEWN6|5.0|A striking story that questions the long-laid-down laws of whom to love, and how much. The prose is magnificent, well-ordered, Faulknerian, with shots of childlike naughtiness. A highly recommended read.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|When I first got I was so excited to see what they did in the 2nd one. I would recommend reading the book first then seeing the movie so you can see how many things they left out that would have been good. I watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Very good movie for all ages!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it because its like Mario bros but for kindle and more!!!!! I loveeeeeeeeeee it sooooooooooo much. I recremend it to anyone . I love it!!!
0374203032|5.0|This was a supremely well written book. For a book by a philosopher it was very straightforward.<br /><br />It is pretty short and I would have preferred Sandel to go into greater detail.<br /><br />It is a pretty even handed analysis and certainly a lot less biased and partial than most books on the subject - both pro and anti free markets.<br /><br />At time sit maybe a little lightweight though because of the clarity of the prose I would rate it as a five star book.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should see Food Inc. It is inspiring, informative, instructive, and hopeful. It gives you tools and information about what people can do to get involved and make changes in their own lives and possibly become activists for changes in the United States Food Industry. If you are looking at your plate and you don't care where your food came from out of fear, this is your movie. My husband and I overhauled our whole diet because of this movie. We buy all our meat from a local farm that delivers to our city's farmers market and we joined a vegetable and fruit co-op. We pay a yearly fee and pick-up our share of local farm organic, not genetically engineered produce every other week. We don't eat any GMO corn, GMO soybean/soybean oil products, GMO SugarBeets,GMO eggplant, or GE franken-fish salmon!<br />The only topic I was seriously disappointed that FOOD Inc. did not expose was the factory farming dairy industry, so I will touch on it. In this bazarre and age old practice, cows are abusively artificially inseminated, to keep them perpetually pregnant, so that they can produce milk and milk by-products {yogurt, cheese, butter, ice cream} and the by-product of the cruel dairy industry is the bull dairy calf who has no economic value to the farmer. [Nope, I am not VEGAN] They are pulled from the mother cow at birth and this unweaned animal is sold for \\"bob veal\\", \\"pink veal\\" or \\"white veal\\".  Cows are like women. They can only produce milk if they are giving birth. Does that sound organic to you? If you enjoy dairy, look out for the leukemia virus, paratuberculosis, Salmonella, E. Coli, staphylococcal infections, juvenile diabetes, pus & blood. If you want to take your chance on all of that stuff, how about Monsanto's Bovine Growth Hormone that the FDA claims is safe for human consumption. Canada and Europe don't agree and they will not allow USA dairy products to be exported to thier countries. Doesn't this sound like our FDA, big business, and advertisers to promote a product to you like \\"milk it does a body good\\" when in all actuality this most bizarre practice is disease ridden and detimental to your health? I invite you to google it.
1439102813|5.0|Dementia and/or alzheimers seems to touch most everyone's life directly or indirectly.  This view from inside the mind of a victim is virtually transformational for those of us with someone close who suffers from this condition. It is a literary walk in the shoes of an alzheimers patient.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love the game, really long and very intense, but the only thing is that it needs 3-4 people to play that is my only complaint. other than that, would love to buy the expansions heard they are amazing.
B0053O89IS|5.0|What can one say - this is the best way to keep a track of what Seeley and Tempe are up to.  As we are so behind on the whole series in Aussie land it is so great to be able to get hold of these DVD'. as always the packaging is high quality and gives a great insight into the impending story lines - love the series, love the actors and love being able to watch top quality movies whenever I want.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White is without a doubt among this generations best musicians and artists.  He draws from the past, yet makes every song and sound his own.  This album is varied in terms of song styles, from the riffs of 16 saltines to the acoustic strumming of Love Interruption to the latter songs which are piano-driven.<br /><br />While this album is great, you know what I would love (and I bet many others as well)?  A tight album of guitar-based songs like 16 saltines, Seven Nation Army, Black Math, etc.....  That would be phenomenal.  Until then, this album will do just fine.
0345803507|2.0|I really enjoyed the first book in this trilogy. The second book was alright. As for this third one, well I'm about 15% and am so ready for it to be over. First, I find Ana crazy annoying. I would love to reach through the book and tell her to grow a back bone because I'm so tired of reading \\"Oh, no. I made him mad.\\" I just happen to like the female leads in the books I read to have a little more substance than that.. Also, the author really needs to limit her word use. \\"Mr.Grey\\", \\"Mrs. Grey\\",\\"oh, my\\", and \\"my inner goddess\\" are repeated an annoying amount of times. And remember, I'm only 15% of the way in! Maybe it has a decent story line, but it's hard to see it through all these personal pet peeves. I will finish this book, just because I paid $10 for it, but really am ready for it to be over with.
B005DZMODI|2.0|I can't believe how many reviewers think this is some type of new musical fusion of different genres. No, it is not revolutionary. I also notice many comments on how brilliant these musicians are. Technically, they both are; however, that does not guarantee they will produce great music. Clapton is a second rate blues singer at best. Wynton has no distinct style, unlike the greats of jazz trumpet - Armstrong, Gillespie, Miles, Roy Eldridge, Lee Morgan, etc. I guess it is a pefect pairing....two wannabes. With so many reissues available of the best jazz and blues recordings ever made, why the hell bother? (We only have so much time on this earth.) Andre Bocelli is a great singer. Perhaps he should team up with Wynton and make a reggae album. Don't laugh - many people would say it is brilliant(!!!!).

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible App. I now use it during church servicese, Bible studies,<br /> at home and everywhere I go. It has multiple wonderful features I<br />appreciate. It makes Bible reading easier. For one thing,<br />I don't have to carry my big Bible around any more.<br /><br />I like everything about this Bible App,  but  I specially like the features that<br /> allow me to easily navigate between chapters and verses, change font<br />sizes for easy reading and hilight selective scriptures. Thank you so much<br />for having it  available. What a wonderful gift!!

B004LWZW4M|4.0|It's a hard act following a classic series of movies from the old days so while I felt the character interactions and special effects were especially well done I found myself lacking in story plotting and overall resonance. So regarding the former two elements it's very spot on as we have a tight relationship between the main human character (James Franco) and the CGI created chimpanzee (voiced by Andy Serkis a la Gollum), Caesar, who will become the founder of an intelligent race of apes that dominate the globe in later years but unless you know of the Planet of the Apes universe (POA) then disregard that last part.<br /><br />John Lithgow is the father of the main character scientist and he's got Alzheimer's which explains why Franco's character is so hell bent on finding a cure. He works at a secretive company that is experimenting on apes to try and find a cure. Of course some of the apes are treated cruelly and disregarded. One mother dies during birth and Franco's character finds himself reluctantly taking care of the baby chimp and then growing emotionally attached to it. Those emotional connections are some of the best parts of this picture as you begin to see the species division arise as Caesar sees his kind as pets/slaves to humanity and gradually rebels. Up until the climax I thought it was plotted very well but the whole fight was poorly delivered. I personally felt that a more powerful counter force would have been sent out to deal with the ape problem at the end but I won't get into big time spoilers. There was also another big question at the end which wasn't answered to my satisfaction either. In fact up until the climax this was like a B plus to A minus film.<br /><br />This film was nominated by the 2012 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects. For POA fans who know it all this was intended as a prequel to \\"The Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\\". The screenwriters put several moments into the films that are nods to the old pictures so look for them.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $93M and it made over $481M at the Box Office (Wiki).<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: A minus to A; ACTION: B minus to B; THEME FOCUSES & DELIVERY: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its fast paced zombie killing fun for your whole horde. the animated dead don't stand a chance.<br />its really good!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Plays well, great graphics, reminds me of Mario Brothers back in my youth.  My kids are enjoying it quite a lot too.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|If you're debating on getting this knife just buy it, you wont be regret it! It is a serious piece of steel for the money. Just remember that this isnt a $100+ knife so its not going to be perfect on fit and finish. Yea it came with a small blemish on the blade coating, yea it doesnt have super smooth rounded corners, and yea the handle isnt exactly perfect fitting on the blade, BUT it is a badass knife made of great steel that'll take a beating. The sheath that comes with it is so-so. Not fantastic but it'll be good enough. The plastic liner helps.
B0040HO16S|1.0|Gossip,evesdropping, breaking the law, etc seems to be the favorite pastime of these characters.<br />Dorcas Lane is a spinster that is supposed to be of high moral character and enjoys all of the pastimes listed above, can't stay out of others business and enjoys a relationship with a married man.<br />if I had to put up with neighbors like this I would move asap.<br />I stupidly paid to watch
B004UID2LC|5.0|I would totally reccomend this app! It gives me free music. I already have 400 songs I have downloaded using this app. I have it on my Kindle Fire and it works great! It is wonderful and I would definitely reccomend it to anybody and everybody.

B005HSL626|5.0|great game all the game needs the mega fruit .yea go fruit ninjas. game is the most awesome game on amazon
B005LAIGPA|5.0|What a great movie.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and definitely not this much for my money.  The Chronicle is not you typical horror/action movie.  It is done in a documentary style that is easy to follow and without all that bouncy camera work - you remember the thing that made you sick to your stomach during the Blair Witch Project...  yeah, non of that.  The story and action are solid.  The story, while slow for about the first 10 minutes, picks up really quick and keeps your attention.  It is worth checking out.<br /><br />As usual, Amazon has provided the best price and great packaging.  If you are a prime member it is even better without paying shipping.
0451197968|3.0|SPOILERS!!!<br />I liked The Hunger Games, and hearing how similar this book was to The Hunger Games, I read it. I liked it, but my main problem with the book was with the main character: Ben Richards. He is quite the elitist. He was pretty likable in the beginning, but towards the end of the book, he really comes off as a jerk.  The ending was good, but it could have been improved. The book did feel dragged out, and I was kind of relieved to finish it.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I needed something bright, small, reliable and won't break the bank ($25.00) for my key chain and this is a perfect balance between size (2.5 inch) and lumen (140). I have two Fenix PD30 that I had for years and they are great. This one is just as good. Brightness is rated at 140 lumen and uses one CR123A battery (the manual doesn't recommend using rechargeable ones).
B00000099Y|5.0|Masterpiece start to finish, For my money this cannot be beat. listen carefully to the lyrics. think about them, \\"read between the lines\\" LOL
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I heartily agree with the high praises this production has accrued.  It is a masterful blend of an intelligent and throughly credible story-line, superb acting, a finely-tuned pitch of suspense, and thought-provoking relevance.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a complete and total waste of money - there's no way I would have finished it had I not spent $10 on the thing. Do you remember the high school guidance counselor from 10 Things I Hate About You? The one who wrote that tacky romance novel. I would imagine her book would have been better than this mindless dribble.<br /><br />My main three issues weren't even with the mindlessness of the whole thing - my first huge issue was simply with the way the story was narrated. The author is British; the book is set in contemporary Seattle. It was hard to suspend belief that a 21 year old American girl speaks like that. I'm 25. I don't speak like that. The book was neither British enough nor American enough, and it drove me up the wall. My second big issue came with the countless Tess D'urbervilles references. The author clearly has enough of a background in literature to make a gazillion references to the book. We get it. I personally found the references irritating. Thirdly, I couldn't empathize with either one of the characters - I could not care less whether or not the characters end up together. But then again, I was Team Jacob in the books this series is supposed to be based upon.<br /><br />Unless listening to a narrator describe her simultaneous orgasms with her partner / boyfriend / Dominant the exact same way throughout the entire novel, this book probably isn't worth the $10 or so you're about to spend on it. I won't be reading the other two books of the series, to say the least.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like everything about it except that you have to be connected to wifi to use it.  I'm not crazy about the fact that it runs all the time, but at least it doesn't slow down my tablet.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I DVR'd this train wreck of a movie from HBO on one of their 3 day free previews and somehow felt obligated to watch it all the way through. It's like 3 alleged comedy writers watched the old Lily Tomlin/Jane Fonda/Dolly Parton 9 to 5 movie about a bad boss as played by Dabney Coleman. These 3 \\"new generation\\" writers stole the basic concept and then expanded it with other bad bosses and how far 3 dissatisfied employees would go to eliminate the bosses.<br /><br />If this is what hollywood passes off as \\"comedy\\" these days, I don't see much hope for the genre. Continual profanities and sexual references show for fact that Hollywood writers of today have no idea what is funny. Only surprising thing about the movie was I don't recall even hearing anything about pot use. Most \\"comedies\\" today seem to have a thing about promoting the use of pot as a comedic device. I do wonder what people like Colin Farrel and Kevin Spacey thought when they read the script. Did they actually like it or was it just a nice payday for very little effort.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie for anyone.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very well written.  A hard story to read but one everyone should know.  The family suffered, but no one seemed to worry about them.  This book allows them to tell their story and learn more about their mother.  A must read.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|This is a really good movie. There is no action scenes, over the top drama, incredible comedy or shocking moments but what you do get is a great story well acted. I found all of the characters believable, the cast outstanding and the plot intriguing. It's worth renting or buying.
1556438850|5.0|Make no mistake - this is a textbook. This is the textbook I wish I had before I started training as a Yoga instructor. It covers everything you need to move from practicing Yoga to teaching classes. While no book can substitute for training with a real person, this book covers the theory you need to know to be able to teach: basic anatomy, Yoga history, teaching techniques, setting up a classroom, and even sequencing. Even if you've started teaching, this is a great reference for new instructors.

B004EBZX6W|4.0|App has always worked well for me.  Does exactly what I need for it to do and makes it easier to get my \\"novel ereader\\" (an off brand) to turn the WiFi on and off better than the onboard WiFi controller.

B007QSNMS6|4.0|If you are smartly playing in digital creation, you see many decks and presentations about \\"what is happening.\\"  They always include wonderfully articulated quotes from successful, wise people. And you wonder, \\"Where did they get that quote?\\"  Well, Velocity quotes are going to be all over decks for the next several months, FYI.<br /><br />The format is written literally as a conversation between the two authors, Ajaz Ahmed & Stefan Olander. You are most likely grabbing this book because of the titles these people have: Chairman and Co-Founder of AKQA and Vice President, Digital Sport, Nike Inc. Boom. Instant credibility. There is absolutely no need for them to establish their credibility, the web drips with accolades on their digital smarts, creative performance and successes.<br /><br />The bullet hole cover is fitting, as the book reads like bursts of shots. A smart idea. A great quotable line to sum it up. An anecdote. A quote from another source. Another smart idea, and so on. Each \\"chapter\\" closes with a summary, but ironically the book closes with none - it just ends. Well, there is a url and I guess that is the point, conversations keep going online.<br /><br />As someone who teaches university students in this arena, I found this book has already proven to be quite valuable. As mentioned, the quotes have found their way into my lectures. But more importantly, I have an arsenal of anecdotes from Nike and other cool brands for student questions.  The students definitely connect with the stories and the credibility of the authors. It allows me to reinforce my own ideas.  The thinking is mostly agreeable, as you'd expect with two people with such a proven track records.<br /><br />What kept me from giving it 5-stars:<br />+ I really liked when they included conversations with other people, but there were too few in my opinion. These two are going to have an extensive network, so I'd love to have other perspectives filling out the book's stories and points.<br /><br />+ It is strange to read an edited conversation. You don't feel like you are over-hearing a conversation (a la Joseph Campbell & Bill Moyers.) You also don't get the normal flow of an industry book.  It is an experiment, and it feels that way, both good and bad. I didn't actually \\"connect\\" with the material at times; it felt distant and conflicting. But I also enjoyed this, as it made me think and engage with the content, rather than just be led down an author's path.<br /><br />Overall, good read - and something to read NOW, not later.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I have to say this app is very addicting. If you love Carcassone and can't get enough, then download this app now. I've done very little but play this app in my free time since I downloaded it. The AI is very challenging with multiple personalities and play styles available. The addition of achievements is a nice touch.<br /><br />The only complaint I would make is that the app tends to suffer some occasional video flickering. But it doesn't interfere with the game.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This is a powerful survival film that works on many levels. It is haunting in nature as the underlying psychological implications become blurred. I was expecting something different and as this film unfolded I became totally engrossed by the somewhat mythological and operatic sights and sounds of man alone, yet not alone. The pace is lethargic and mystical in nature. The payoff is introspective. The forces at work are powerful and test the fabric of what we truly are.

B0055SWM08|4.0|Quiet, unassuming and highly addictive brain teaser. Flick the raindrop down the right channels and pick up the dots, but look out for the spikes!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|After the hype surrounding the film I preferred to read the series first and was gripped from the start.  The Hunger Games is an extremely descriptive, fast moving book which drew me in and kept hold until the very end.  At one point it even almost made me cry.  I enjoyed the fact that the story is told from the main character's point of view, of her world set in the future but still recognisable. Apparently aimed at the teen reader any adult would find the book absorbing and thought provoking.  It is a world of division between the elite and the downtrodden, severely controlled workers who provide the necessities to maintain the elites' existence.  Part of the control is to send teenagers into a competition where it is kill or be killed, the last survivor achieving fame and fortune for themselves and their district.  Catniss provides the focus for revolution.  You cannot help but read the complete trilogy.

B005J4ASDG|5.0|We had seen this piece performed at the Hollywood Bowl, and enjoyed it very much.  We vowed to get it when recorded.  We waited and waited.  Then some things that should not have been forgotten, were forgot.  Then a thing happened that the ring had not intended.  Amazon's web site recommended it based on other music I'd purchased.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into the debate as to whether this is a symphony or a suite.  All I know is that the music is great, there is plenty of it and it is put together in a logical and pleasant manner.  I think anyone who enjoyed the soundtrack will enjoy this.

0811879542|5.0|I happened upon this book when I was shelving books in the school library.  I read it to the kindergarten class and they all loved it.  I now intend to buy it for my twin grandchildren who are only 8 months old but I want them to have it as soon as they can understand what to do with the instructions on the page.  This is a book for the imagination and you have to present it like that-just fun. It does teach concepts of color, right-left, etc. in a very fun way.  Enjoy with your children!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Make sure you're not looking for a modern action movie because this is a throw back to the 70's-80's action. The characters are believable their motivations the same. The violence is graphic and straight forward. The plot is straight forward, no cgi, no wire fighting. If you enjoyed it check out a James Caan movie by the name of Thief.

I think at times she is too pushy but overall this was an entertaining series of two people learning to love. I hope there are more stories to come About the other characters. I'm intrigued. :)
0439023513|4.0|I am going to say this now... SPOILER ALERT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!<br /><br />Okay. I don't even know what to say after reading this book. The ending was less than satisfying. At first I thought this was a significant improvement over the second book. There was a lot less blood and gore, and more.... doing other things besides killing and dying. There was more strategizing, more working together, things of that nature that one would expect for the successful over-throwing of a tyrannical government. But it seemed to gradually fall apart. That was to be expected, of course. No one would be able to take the story seriously if everyone survived and lived happily ever after. (As it was, I was experiencing a little \\"Left Behind\\" deja-vu in the beginning, with everyone having just the perfect job to help in the fight.) But it was more than just losing bodies in the battle. It was like watching spirits die. As the reader, I felt crushed when Finnick and Prim died, so I can't imagine what Katniss would be feeling, if she were a real person. But to be totally removed from her mother and her best friend -- that just seems to defeat everything her character stood for. She went to war fighting for them. She survived it only to be shut away from them? How is that supposed to be any kind of victory over evil? I think her finally realizing she loved Peeta is supposed to be some attempt at a resolution -- I mean, how can anyone not be moved by her feelings toward her children? \\"Peeta wanted them?\\" -- but even that feels incomplete and just a little bit out of place. The epilogue seemed like it was just tacked on to the end to bring resolution to a story that never really resolved, and the \\"hey, we had kids\\" thing is just so overdone and, in this case, surreal.<br /><br />Barring all that, the first two-thirds of the book are pretty fascinating. District 13 is a very interesting place, with schedule-tattoos and a scientifically rationed diet. The rebels turn out to be very captivating and endearing people, and I loved that Ms. Collins included their back-stories. I've always found Haymitch to be an interesting character, despite his MANY flaws, and I was thrilled to read about his past (however depressing). Say what you will about Suzanne Collins, but she definitely has a way of making readers care about the characters and what happens to them.<br /><br />Can't say this was my favorite installment of the series, not by a long shot, and I'm not sure this is the type of thing I'd ever want to read twice. But, I'm glad that I DID read it, and that I've completed my journey through The Hunger Games.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Very impressed with the delivery time. Ten days from order to arrival in South Australia.  The quality of the boxed set is fantastic and everything arrived intact.  The actual  production is extraordinary. The opening scenes blew me away and I had no choice but to set aside a couple of days so that I was swept away and transported into another realm.<br />This is an amazing series and I can hardly wait for the next season to come out on Bluray. There's no doubt I will be ordering it when it is released.<br />Thanks once again Amazon for providing a great service.

I am really happy I did order it and there are a vouple projects I look forward to doing after I finish up a couple items that others requested I do (repair work mainly this time).<br />Definitely a more romantic style as titled and one that everyone should love esp if you are needing that WOW item for any special occassion.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I decided to read this on the backside of all the \\"hype\\".  I guess you could say that curiosity captured the cat.  The storyline is stelar showing the rawest of emotions between two people and their polar opposite worlds that collide.  I found it to be thought provoking and yes, \\"racey\\" at times, but, allowed myself to look past that to the story that was unfolding in front of me.  Reading Book One was not nearly enough for me, I found myself reading Books 2 and 3 and still wanting more.<br /><br />Thank you for the great read!!
B00000IBVC|3.0|I'm afraid my review of this dvd is not terrible favorable. Zhang Yimou did a beautiful job in terms of sheer stage spectacle. The singers, however, are basically second string and definitely not singer/actors, especially in terms of overly stylized gestures, Calaf's wandering eyes, the fluttery movement of Ping, Pang, Pong, etc. Where are the days of Callas, Tebaldi, Nillson, Bjoerling, etc. Perhaps it was the dvd I saw, but voices seemed out of synch with mouth movements. Grand opera can be beautiful, but I don't know that film is the best medium. When the camera gets so close you can see every double chin quiver, well....
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I'm really not sure how well this movie works if Tron isn't a part of your childhood. In its day Tron was something unique. Not necessarily good (plot and characterwise it was ho hum), but something visually distinct. So part of the appeal of this movie for me at least, is recreating that.<br /><br />On on that level (visually and aurally) they absolutely succeed. What we see on the screen here is a logical and satisfying extension of what came before. It's stunning to look at. We still have Light Cycles, but now we also have Light Planes for example. So far so good.<br /><br />But Tron: Legacy also apes the original movie when it comes to plot and character. In fact it is worse. We're talking characters so shallow that two dimensional would be a compliment and a plot that really doesn't make sense if you analyse it at all. I'm not going to even try and make it work. The plot black holes would suck me in.<br /><br />There's not much to be said about the acting either. Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn.... is. Olivia Wilde does a decent job of being pretty and a wide eyed innocent (not really an acting challenge) and Bruce Boxleitner doesn't really get anything to work with. The Tron sub-plot is under-used unfortunately.<br /><br />The only standout performance is Michael Sheen in the role of Castor, who milks his minor character for everything it's worth.<br /><br />Somehow though it doesn't matter. There's action, there's discs, there's Light Cycles!  And there's a really creepy Jeff Bridges both as Clu and as the younger Kevin Flynn.<br /><br />Let's talk about that for a moment. The effects work to animate a younger Jeff Bridges has been heavily criticized, but it's actually a pretty impressive technical achievement and it _almost_ works. But it's just slightly off. The face is *too* perfect and too still. For Clu you can go with it. After all he's a computer clone of Flynn. But they shouldn't have used it in the early real world segment.<br /><br />So great spectacle, crappy plot and so-so acting. Where does that leave us? Well I still loved it. Just switch off your brain and surf the wave. That's what Tron has always been like., crappy plot and so-so acting. Where does that leave us? Well I still loved it.

B004HD61KE|5.0|I really liked this book. I have read every one of his books and this one is just as good as the others. At first i was confused with \\" nano\\" stuff but finally caught on. And, so what if they are getting old...aren't we all. They are still out there fighting evil.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This is a nice, simple case.  Getting the case on was a little bit of a struggle but it does fit my Verizon iPhone 4 like a glove.  I like variety so I tend to switch cases back and forth but I'm concerned that this case can't take constant on and off action so I've left it on the phone since I got it. My only concern with this case is the strip of plastic (tpu) that is on the bottom of the phone, just under the home button.  It is a thin strip because so much of the bottom of the phone is open to allow the connector to fit and leave the speakers exposed.  It's the weakest part of the case so I think it's prone to eventually tearing/breaking, but it hasn't happened yet.  I guess that would be the same with any case made of this material.<br />I like that the case seems protective, with the material coming over the front of the screen which will help with any drop where the phone lands on its face.  It is also somewhat sticky without preventing you from easily removing from pockets and grabbing lint.<br />I have not used the screen protector but it's nice that it and the cloth were included.
B000059QY3|4.0|This is Gheorghiu's earlier performance of La Traviata..A newer one recorded thireen years later on Blu Ray is available on ArtHaus and is acatually a better buy. The new one has better sound and picture thanks to the Blu Ray process  and the sets in the large party scenes seem more opulent, as the La Scala stage appears larger than the one at The ROH...<br /><br />In that this performance is thirteen years older than the new one, Gherorghiu, quite naturally, appears somewhat younger and fresher. Her perfformance is very fine vocally and dramatically.The Alfredo of Lopardo is attractive and he sings well and Nucci,appropriately goes from a rather stern, cross, older Germont to a gentle, sympathetic one. The ArtHaus version has Vargas as Alfredo, better sung, but less visually appealing than Lopardo.<br /><br />The Orchestra is excellent  and the sound is fine, but not as good as the dts high definition on the newer Blu Ray disc,<br /><br />In the end, I prefer the newer Blu Ray version for it's more expansive party scenes, better picture and sound, not to mention the lower price.

B00361DR4Q|4.0|This is a huge bargain...The DTS sound and Blu Ray picture is outstanding.<br /><br />The sets are grand in the traditional manner, the singing superb. The acting is great. The younger Germont (Vargas) sings very well, but he lacks the physical appearance that would make him as attractive as he should be. Gheorgiu gives a strong beautifuly acted performance.<br /><br />The orchesta and conducting are very fine.<br /><br />A great purchase.

0345803485|1.0|Every element of the story is on-par with Twilight, only even worse, it's for adults. Has the author ever had sex? I suspect she has, as she is apparently married... how odd. There are but a few passable erotic moments, but other than that... God help you. Snoozeville. I hope you like reading about how this insufferable girl bites her lip, eats breakfast, looks for a hair tie, borrows her friend's dress, looks through her lashes (???), drinks tea, arches her back, blushes, blanches, flushes, etc, because she does at least three of these things on every. Single. Page. She manages to be infinitely naive (even admittedly so), yet also a snarky, condescending intellectual, changing back and forth at the author's convenience. She is just so horribly blank and poorly written, it disgusts me.<br /><br />In addition, it will be instantly obvious to you that the author has a severely week grasp on geography and American phrasing. Really though, this ranks low on the long list of severe flaws you have to contend with. A moment of silence for every dead composer and British author mentioned in the first four chapters of this rag.......<br /><br />Should I even bother going into Christian? The entire premise of this character makes no sense whatsoever... a self-made BILLIONAIRE at age 26? When I first heard about this book, I was told something along the lines of \\"a college student is swept off her feet by an older, wealthy suitor with a BDSM fantasy.\\" But no, the characters are just five years apart, and the guy is a ~~BILLIONAIRE~~ who just needs some therapy (I honestly would have accepted millionaire, but billionaire is just insulting).  He never actually works, with the exception of the beginning of the book. And once again, he has an arsenal of about six different things that he does over and over and over again. Always touching Ana's face, tilting her chin, telling her to eat, gasping, moving his lips and eyes, touching his hair, her hair, showing up \\"unexpectedly.\\" His eyes are gray, AND DON'T YOU EVER FORGET IT!!!! Ugh. The BDSM element is cringe-worthy to say the least, and it just seems like a weird, half-hearted attempt at kinkiness. It's not my fantasy, but if it's yours, I can guarantee that you will be disappointed. Everything about this is terrible. If you thought this was good literature, then you should just stop reading all together. There is no hope for you. Go make your husband another sandwich or something.<br /><br />I am disappointed with myself that I read this travesty in its entirety. I had literally nothing else to do, and it didn't cost any money (although I suppose my time is a more valuable currency). More than anything, I was curious and I fell into the trap of its \\"popularity.\\" Honestly, I am not an avid reader, but I can only assume that it doesn't get much worse than FSOG. I have read Harry Potter fanfiction that is thousands of times better than this... actually, that isn't saying much. Still, I cannot put into words how stunned I am that these books even exist, let alone got onto the NYT best seller list. I don't know what to make of this E L James woman. I guess I wish I had her confidence? She must have some nerve since apparently she thought that writing this crap was a good idea. There is a special place in hell for the editor of this book, too.<br /><br />My inner-goddess turned fifty shades of crap as I bit my lip and rolled my eyes. Then I ate some pancakes.

B005K17RU0|3.0|After trying a several \\"kindle approved\\" weather apps-  this one and The Weather Channel app proved to be about the same-- Lacking.  No hourly or even every several hour breakdowns.  No pinch zoom on radar maps and only thirty minutes worth of radar loop.  No barometric pressure and only shows humidity for the current day. Overall dissatisfied but this is probably the best among VERY limited options.  Give me Weatherbug or Wunderground please.  ANYTHING with a marine forecast and tide charts included would be nice.
B000HCO83G|2.0|I enjoyed X-men and X-men 2, but felt that Last Stand could have been much better.  Magneto is a great villain, but why does he have to have so much screen time in practically every film?  There are so many more villains from the comics they haven't even touched yet.  I've been dying to see Mr. Sinister or Apocalypse on the big screen for over 10 years.  It's always Magneto Magneto Magneto.<br /><br />  And don't even get me started on what the writers did with Phoenix.  Just some psycho who goes around killing for no reason at all.<br /><br />  And what was with that Sentinel in the opening scene?  I'd have loved to have seen more of them.  Less regular joes with cure guns and more giant mutant hunting robots, please.  Now that would have been a heck of a final battle.<br /><br />  So if they ever make an x4 I'm guessing the villain will probably be Magneto... again.  He's one of my favorite villains so I can't believe I'm getting bored with him in this film series.  I think the actor did a magnificent job, but it's time to branch out a bit more when it comes to X-men villains.  Onslaught anyone?  Days of Future Past kind of movie, maybe?  Ah well, a blind guy can dream.
0345803485|1.0|I'm so glad they had a copy  at the library that I could borrow so I didn't have to purchase this... thing. I would have been so mad if I spent any money on it. I truly don't get how people can get through the poor writing it's THAT bad (I only read the first 110 pages). I thought the concept was interesting and the sex scenes could be interesting, but you have to be a good writer to pull it off. In comparison, I think Twilight is a pretty good book now. I used to think it was pretty bad, but not after having read this. At least the characters were original/believable and their motivations believable for teenagers/vampires.
1400082773|3.0|I picked up Dreams from My Father last year with the hopes of discovering more about what makes the man (President Obama) tick.  I enjoyed the book and learned much.  It relates Obama's life journey (+ parents and grandparents) from birth until the time he decided to go to law school.  His white grandparents in Hawaii pretty much raised Obama and his Indonesian step-father appeared to be a good man.  Obama's biological father was a piece of crap as a human being (egocentric, alcoholic, selfish, and a bigamist).  Stanley (Obama's mother) did not seem to be much interested in raising a child.  She had other interests.  Yes, Obama drank heavily, smoked weed and tried cocaine in high school.  As I write this Sean Hannity is making a big deal out of Obama's past vices.  Fair enough.  However, what bothers me most about the book is the apparent fact that Obama did not write the book.  Yes, it is his story, he gathered the material, he tried but failed to put pen to paper.  He does not possess the writing skill to write such a book.  There is almost nothing to support the idea that Obama wrote his own memoir.  I don't view this as racist but simply a fact based on the evidence.  If Obama did not write his own book then who did?  None other than Bill Ayers of Hyde Park Chicago.  All the pieces fit.  Ayers has twice indicated in public that he wrote the book but he said it as a joke.  It is no joke.  Experts have compared the writing in Ayers' book, Fugitive Days, to Dreams from My Father and it all fits.  BILL AYERS WROTE OBAMA\\"S BOOK.  I have no doubt.  Do a little research.  Despite the charade I still recommend the book.

I didn't think hot-swap-able meant it literally would be super hot when I took it out!<br /><br />I worry the heat will hurt the memory card.

B005LAIGPA|3.0|I watched this film without seeing any previews or any reviews, and it's an okay movie with the same ol' story of the underdog letting power corrupt.<br /><br />The special effects are really good, the acting is good in spite of the documentary style filming (which I am not a fan of), the story line is good....overall it's worth a look and probably best watching it like I did--with no expectations.  I really liked the ending.
B00723NWJE|4.0|If you take this for what it is, it's a delightful, very enjoyable, easy to listen to Pop flavored CD that takes the great talents of Norah Jones, mixes them with Brian Burton's musical sauces and comes up with a tasty treat.  Are these the greatest songs ever written?  No.  But they are fine songs and several are quite nice.  But, the best part is that the whole CD is a bit different from her usual stuff and gives us something fresh to enjoy from this talented singer/songwriter.<br /><br />If you're in a bit of a reflective mood, this is a great CD to listen to.  It won't jar you out of your mood, but will probably catch your attention and take your mind down a few paths now and then.  And that's fine with me.  I'm in my 'early listening' phase with this CD and enjoying it very much.  We'll see how it holds up, but I think it will do fine.<br /><br />Since the mp3 downloads have been on sale a few times recently, it's definitely worth it at those prices if you are a Norah Jones fan - and maybe even if you're not.  Listen to the samples and decide, but don't just blow this one off.  There are some good tracks here and the overall package is quite nice.  (As many have mentioned, the overall sound, arrangements and production values are top notch.)<br /><br />I'm tending to like it even more the longer I listen...

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|FFVII is a cash cow that needs to stop being milked. One main thing I don't like about this type of marketing strategy is the company ripping off their true fans. Square Enix needs to stop making series within a series. FFVII is already bone dry. I stopped following FFVII after this movie and crisis core. Each story based on different time line and main character over the years of FFVII.<br /><br />Blu-ray has additional minutes than DVD. Why don't they make the full version before releasing it? If you bought the DVD before, you will feels like you're left out on some parts that you need to buy the BD version. BD is somewhat disappointing. There is nothing special in their Special Features other than an episode \\"On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel Animated Film.\\" If you're a fan of this series, you probably already know what's going on already at the time this was released. I don't want to watch old news on the Special Features section. This is no booklet inside this case (cheap version edition? I don't know).<br /><br />The picture quality is very saturated, flat and doesn't look as sharp as what BD quality should be. I'm not sure if that's what they're going for, but it's not exciting. Action scene isn't 60Hz HDTV friendly (if you're picky).<br /><br />This movie has great action scene and worth buying especially if this is your first time buying it and do not own it on DVD. This is an old release now so don't buy it as it was new release.<br /><br />+4 stars for good value on good movie. -1 star for lack of extras such as features and booklet/card
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This movie is every bit of 5 stars and would not categorize it as a \\"B\\" flick.  While I compare it to Notebook with friends, it's no Notebook.  Funny, sad, frustrating and a pure example of movie \\"real\\" love.  Beware the movie doesn't put your over the edge of sad, or funny just middle of the road.  I'll watch it again and recommend to all my friends that enjoy the same genre.<br /><br />I do have to address one thing.  People ranking this movie down because the director taking liberties with the story, specifically with the \\"took the christian\\" out of the movie.  Well, that's not all they did and changed.  The characters are hotter, \\"hottness\\" is like art, and Adams is fine.  While not a huge fan of Tatum movies, I thought he did really well in this.  Bottom line, it's a movie and like most \\"based on a true story\\" movies, or \\"inspired by true evens\\" there's usually only one thing that all of those have in common with the actual happenings...10% truth.<br /><br />Great Movie.

B007Q0OUNA|3.0|9472 Attack on Weathertop is a 430 piece LEGO set initially released in May of 2012 with a LEGO store price of $59.99. It is part of the first series of Lord of the Rings-licensed LEGO toys. It contains 5 minifigures (Aragorn, Frodo, Merry, and two ringwraiths), two black horses, pieces to build the fortress, and accessories (THE ONE RING, weapons, flames, etc..).<br /><br />I *REALLY* wanted to like this set. I mean, the ringwraiths (also known as Nazgul and Dark Riders) are some of the signature villains in LotR; Aragorn is action incarnate; *THE ONE RING* is in this set (as well as in 9470 Shelob Attacks); and Weathertop seemed pretty cool with its circular form and opening design. But, to me, the reality of the set just didn't live up to expectations. The ringwraiths are BORING - basically, generic black hoods we've seen in other sets combined with what amounts to black Ninjago outfits and black headpieces. The fortress itself is small, and even when split open on its hinges just doesn't have much room. Yes, there is a trapdoor and some nice weapons (and THE ONE RING), but the minute I was done building this set I was thinking, \\"I'd rather use these pieces to make something else (like turn Helm's Deep into a super fortress).\\" It certainly isn't a terrible set, but.. it should have been better considering the base story and material they had to work with.<br /><br />As I hinted at above, the bricks in this set can be used to make other sets more interesting. 9474 The Battle of Helm's Deep and 9471 Uruk-hai Army are two good examples of sets this one can be combined with for a \\"super fortress\\" build, but keep in mind you'll have to disassemble Weathertop from the instruction-based build to do it (but isn't that the best part of LEGOs?).<br /><br />Rating: 3 out of 5 Stars. This is not a terrible set, but there are definitely more interesting ones in the LotR line.

B007Q0OUKS|5.0|9471 The Uruk-hai Army is a 257 piece LEGO building block set that was initially released in May of 2012 with a LEGO retail store price of $29.99. It is part of the first wave of releases in the LEGO Lord of the Rings collection, and contains six minifigures, a horse, pieces for a rolling \\"hook shooter,\\" pieces for a fortress wall, and numerous weapons/accessories. The minifigures include two members of the army of Rohan (Eomer and a generic soldier) along with four Uruk-hai (a sort of fantasy super orc).<br /><br />When you first look at this set, you'll probably think to yourself that it is pretty boring. I mean, most LotR fans aren't jumping up and down to get hold of this set's \\"exclusive\\" Eomer figure (half probably don't even remember who he is). The figures look interesting, but they aren't particularly unique. AND THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THIS SET! First, it is an army builder - meaning that, if you want to build a big army of Uruk-hai, this is the set to buy with its four Uruk-hai warriors (it has a lower price point than even The Orc Forge set). There are also two Rohan army members, so you'll be expanding that side as well! The second big aspect of this set is that it is a fortress EXPANDER. The set contains grey brick pieces that, if put together as instructed, easily lock together with similarly-built wall pieces from other sets to form much longer walls - say, the walls of a huge fortress! Even if you don't follow the instructions, the grey pieces of the walls will work very well with other sets - you can free-build a castle or fort to your heart's desire.<br /><br />Note that, while the Uruk-hai will easily meld with other LEGO fantasy army soldiers (such as those in the Castles line), the Rohan soldiers will have a slightly bigger problem blending in due to their cream-flesh coloring (most LEGO minifigs are yellow unless they are in a licensed set, such as this one).<br /><br />Rating: *IF* you are looking to build an army and expand a castle/fortress set you already own.. 5 out of 5 Stars (you'll probably want to buy more than one of this set). If not, you will probably want to pick up a different LEGO LotR set.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This app performs perfectly on my Kindle Fire and gives me just what I need.  It provides the current conditions for my area as well as the changes to expect in the coming hours and days.  And halleluyah it gives me the percentage of HUMIDITY!  I love this app and recommend it highly.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|I just finished this and could not put it down. I typically don't care much for celebrity biographies or memoirs, as they are usually self serving and the subjects aren't all that interesting - but this author was: for her transparency, keen observations and willingness to lay bare the excruciating thought processes and obsessions it took to please and be pleasing.<br /><br />Not only did I find the author compelling, but the main theme, body image and our popular culture, touches on much larger problems, taps into deep truths of the prevalent body hatred women carry, magnified 100 fold in the current entertainment world. Portia de Rossi has performed a real service here in writing this book.<br /><br />I was struck by her courage as I read how searingly she bared herself: the thought processes that made perfect sense to her at the time, leading her down the rabbit hole of near madness, all the while the outer world is applauding her (up to a certain point) for the external results! I asked myself many times, is this the cost for young performers, that you have to become a kind of gladiator of obsession and anguish to 'win' in this arena? And that the 'price of admission' may very well be your very health and sanity.<br /><br />I had a brush with this issue myself long ago,(albeit a much milder version) the obsessive thinking, the isolation, the literal craziness that takes hold, all rang so so true.<br /><br />Her experience also goes to show how little one can tell about another's experience from looking at their outside. I remember when her character first appeared on Ally McBeal and finding her persona and appearance so compelling, and yet at that time she was a roiling stew of insecurities.<br /><br />I thought she was extremely gracious and tactful in not pointing fingers at her castmates on Ally (who in my mind - especially the star- HAD to play a role in exacerbating the eating disorder), but it also brought up the whole sticky subject of women in tv/film and body issues - and where is the line between pathology and illness and being 'professional' and practical, when getting work (for younger actresses particularly) is absolutely dependent on being uber slender.<br /><br />I would have liked to have her expound more on the toll the 20 years of abusing her body REALLY took, more detail, however I understand if she wants to continue to act, that admitting to permanent damage could hurt her chances of future employment (she claimed to have come out completely unscathed and that her lupus and liver damage among other things resolved themselves, which didn't ring true for me, but I  do hope are true.)<br /><br />It also occurred to me that this book could be used as a 'how to' handbook on anorexia for certain vulnerable people. The journey to ever dwindling numbers on the scale and what it took to get there were spelled out in explicit detail. But it did add to the harrowing authenticity.<br /><br />I was just so impressed with her overall though and so happy she wrote this (I assume she had help ) but she is obviously articulate and intelligent so she may have done it mostly herself..if so I hope she continues writing!d body issues - and where is the line between pathology and illness and being 'professional' and practical, when getting work (for younger actresses particularly) is absolutely dependent on being uber slender.<br /><br />I would have liked to have her expound more on the toll the 20 years of abusing her body REALLY took, more detail, however I understand if she wants to continue to act, that admitting to permanent damage could hurt her chances of future employment (she claimed to have come out completely unscathed and that her lupus and liver damage among other things resolved themselves, which didn't ring true for me, but I  do hope are true.)<br /><br />It also occurred to me that this book could be used as a 'how to' handbook on anorexia for certain vulnerable people.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|games are fun some are old school games you cant find very easy. plus most are games that make you have to think def. worth five stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm still enjoying this weeks after it being the FAOTD. The levels are increasingly challenging but not too much to make it not fun.
0345803507|5.0|Great trilogy. Fun read and even with 500+ pages, I finished in a weekend. Fun fun fun. I'm going to be sad when I finish the third book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app. does everything I need it to do. write on my kindle and syncs with my phone and Pc.
0393088774|4.0|A good read even for the layman in economics. Explains much in the way of politicized viewpoints and how these differing viewpoints have been passed off as fact instead of theory and the how the agenda of these differing views has colored the reporting of proposed solutions to the current economic crisis experienced in the US and Europe.<br /><br />The short volume could include much more about the investment in commodities speculation, which has recently distorted corporate investments and the rise of inelastics to address such as food and oil inflation but shies away from these areas to present a more modest solution.<br /><br />Still a very worthwhile read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game for people like me who cant keep their attention on one game for too long. This game is cool.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Il Divo.....What a divine group this fellows are..They sing like angels too. They sing in many languages so the more for people to enjoy.I can see them in person every time they are in Florida. I recomend them highly and also you cannot beat the price that amazon sells this albums for.. You would have to pay much more in  the Dept stores.  so go Amazon.....<br /><br />Thank you

B0072GPQNG|5.0|[[ASIN:B0072GPQNG War Horse]] , is a wonderful story of a horse that touched the life of many people. In England growing up and in France enduring the great war ( WWI ). Beside being a great specimen of a horse, his personality was upbeat, showing affection and gratitude for those who crossed his path, wether they be people or horse. Joey is his name, a horse who can make your heart glow with gladness. Art
B003E6K1VK|1.0|So I bought this item based on amazon's recommendation, and what a waste of money.  I own the AKG Q701 studio headphones, which recommend the use of a headphone amplifier to get maximum performance.  I wanted to grab something portable that I could use with my MBP on a flight to miami so that I could work on some tracks during my flight.  1) The battery would not take a charge while plugged in to my usb port, and caused a low level surging noise making using this product completely pointless.  2) Product build on par with something fished out of the claw machine at your local arcade.  Your better of just plugging directly into your laptop.

I mean I like Rick Riordan better in my opinion, in MY opinion! Please do better oh and by the way...<br /><br />  GO TEAM KATNISS YAY! :) please join the Katniss team (p.s it doesn't exist! Just support by saying Go Team Katniss! 5 times to a guy/gal who never read the series!)<br />  descendant of Apollo, Roman live SPQR! bye!
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|It could of been so much better if the action scenes where faster pace. The plot isn't all there either. Wasn't impressed.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|when I first got this I loved it but now it wont open:( please fix when I try to open it it goes black and then returns to my home screen kindle fire
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is the perfect hidden object game.  It combines adventure and hidden objects.  It is by far the best app out there for either or for both.  Recommend it to everyone.  Try it you'll like it.  guaranteed.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app. You can exit out of the app and still listen to the radio. You just have to click or tap the stop button when the app is open. I have a kindle fire and it works wonderful! You should get this app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this book was probably one of the most well written books I have picked up in a long time. It tells a story that many authors would have difficulty expressing, but James does it brilliantly and with much attention to detail. I was totally blown away with how amazingly the story unfolds...I bought the entire trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have to say, I think I rolled my eyes as much as Anastasia.  The sex scenes were laughable....especially considering she was a virgin. Come on....although its been ages since I was a virgin, I am certain first sexual experiences aren't typically so mind-blowing.  However, the funnniest part is his age. Maybe if he would've been older, it would have been a little more believable. I plowed through, even skipping pages, because I wanted what I considered, a small mystery solved.  It wasn't, of course, and I KNOW it's a trilogy, but I can't waste my precious time on the second one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app it is a great thing to do when you are board I play it every day if you like card games you are sure to like the solitaire app<br />  Janie
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Considering that this game is free I don't see why you shouldn't own this app. Its just like Mario brothers... I absolutely love this game!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|this app is great but the shopping list is useless because the stores don't always have. wi-fi but all other parts are great hope this review helps you<br />  Janie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best series I've read in a long time.mi couldn't put it down and finished it in a few days. Definitely worth reading!
B005ZUR724|2.0|I thought it was a good game pretty dang good graphics. but the reason I give it a 2 is because every time there was an update you would have to wait an extra week to really get the update up if they can fix that my rating will be a 5 hands down.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great app. Fantastic extension of the original. Those who have a kindle fire should not rate this poorly because their device is not compatible with Rovio's app that works fine with other android devices.  Obviously the problem is Amazon's device or its operating system, not Rovio's program.  Stop skewing the rating because your device is an ipad wanabee with proprietary settings/controls that interfere with you using it the way you want.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is simply a fantastic series, by the time you get to the third book you just can't put it down and when you get to the end of the last book it leaves you wanting more.<br />Buy this book series now so when the day comes and it gets made into a movie and is breaking all sorts of box office records you can tell people that you were there at the beginning when it was nothing more than a self published e-book on Amazon.com.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Leonard Cohen has been one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation, and everyone has heard some of his songs, if not him singing then one of the many legends who choose to sing his songs.<br />This collection shows why. It sounds great and includes all his studio albums from 1968 to 2004 remastered. Pure magic if you are a fan and a fantastic way to introduce yourself to the poetry of his lyrics. Little wonder that we see David Gilmore (Pink Floyd) in the front row at his \\"Live in London\\" concert.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. you should get it. I think. it's the best in the sires.get it now like now.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until all the timers were reset and now for some reason it checks for updates then says I'm not connected to the Internet when I am. I'm about to uninstall it due to the bugs and the frustration of trying to play it. Please fix it!!!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have only had this cd for about 24 hrs. & I have listened to it over & over. I believe I like it even better than the first one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was fast paced, and original. Once you start, you are hooked and can't stop until you've read all three. The characters are well developed and extremely relatable. The relationship between Peeta and Catniss is bittersweet and makes you look into yourself a bit even. I recommend this book to everyone. If you say, its not for you, give yourself the five page challenge. If you can put it down after five pages, do it. If not, get ready for an adventure!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enyoy playing solitaire and this game is really well done. it is a really really awesome game. good job
0521765757|4.0|The book has lot words with their pronunciations and I enjoyed it. Some of the words also convey their origin and makes it easy to understand variations as well.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This is a very boring movie. The humor is very bland and corny even for a childrens film. There are plenty of better movie out there. This is one to skip.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I think that it is important that the reader understand that the story was built around the pictures, not the other way around.  However, as the pictures and letters are so important, it must be noted that the Kindle does not display either well, the texts especially.<br /><br />It is an okay read, but fails to fully develop the characters.  The father, especially, is flat.  The conclusion is too pat. The exposition, common:  child suffering from psychological issues of unknown origins, mother allows son to travel huge distances, father goes along to study birds...All we really hear of him is that he is in the bar.<br /><br />Essentially, I think that it needs another 100 pages or so.  For instance, the \\"peculiar children,\\" the title of the book, and anticipatory subject for readers, are not really explained, and, again, poorly developed characters, unless you look at the photos, which helps a bit.  How does his grandfather end up there? How does he really fit in?  How and why did Miss Peregrine run this \\"place?\\" It was quite disjointed and left so many questions unanswered.  I was a bit frustrated!<br /><br />All in all:  the pictures are interesting, but never authenticated; the story is okay, with one scene anticipatory, but then the entire story crashes down, to great dismay.<br /><br />Clever idea, but fails to deliver.  There really is no substance in the characters, exposition, nor resolution.
B000IKNZMM|5.0|This is a good classic movie that I enjoyed years ago.  Wish it was on Blu-Ray but this regular copy worked out just fine.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun; perfect for relaxing. wonderful collection of games<br />equally enjoyed by kids and grown ups. I reccommend this game collection to everyone.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Paul is fabulous on this diversion from his normal material.  He tenderly lulls you with both his ballads and teases you with the uptempo delivery. The songs are delivered in a very personal offering. I would like to see him do more of this type of music, it is quite entertaining and very easy to listen to at any time of day or night.
0385528752|5.0|This book is packed with awesome information about how to make change easier.  The analogy of the rider and the elephant makes it so clear.  We cannot just think our way out of challenges.  It's important to engage the emotional and intuitive part of our brains also.  How?  Getting very specific about what we are trying to accomplish and when we will accomplish it (good goal setting) combined with a \\"why\\" that generates emotion.  I'm excited I found this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great lots of fun to occupy boredom. the options are endless. including. the option to do this rate for 250000 points
B004NELBPC|2.0|I was unable to view most slide shows and some videos. This app was rather disappointing. I enjoy the site, but the app, in its current state, is not worth downloading.
0553801473|4.0|This would have been another great addition to the series if we knew a new book was coming out in the next two years, but if the wait pattern holds, between books 4 and 5 not enough of the main story lines have progressed.
159562015X|5.0|This item met my expectations based on the description provided.  I appreciated that it was actually \\"NEW,\\" as I need the sealed code included with the book for a class I am taking.  The shipment was received very quickly, which exceeded my expectations.  Would definitely recommend using this provider again.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|This is a brilliantly written movie about family, and ancestors.  If you have not seen it, you should.  I loved it on the big screen and can't wait to add it to my home collection too!<br /><br />When I say it's about family and ancestors, it's not just about where your from or traditions.  It's more about that, while the main actor's (George Clooney) wife is in the hospital on her death bed, and raising their two children (one in colllege, and the other a teenager), is also an Executor of an estate he shares with his many sibling's in Hawaii.<br /><br />Decisions have to be made by Clooney in both his wife's life in which he learns of a relationship that he never knew, and also a decision that affects his sibling's and future generations as well.<br /><br />The movie is shot on location in Hawaii, and the scenery is absolutely beautiful if not breath taking.
B007DJUO8O|2.0|For many years, since a young kid of around 14 I fell in love with Opeth, and then around 10 years later I discovered Porcupine Tree and was blown away. Both Bands have had their ups and down in terms of album releases and quality....especially lately. Opeth's last 2 Albums, while completely different in terms of musical styles were, for me, quite dissapointing and Porcupine Tree's last effort 'The Incident' felt like a collection of B-Sides. Certainly those comments will upset a few blind die-hards however I am certainly one of many that feel the same.<br /><br />Which brings me onto 'Storm Corrosion'. This has been a long awaited and anticipated collaboration between 2 of the most respected musicians in metal and prog. Both musicians are extremely accomplished and deserve the accolades that they receive. However, there is something very wrong with this album. I love albums that 'build' and 'work on you' and all of those cliche words that get thrown around when describing this kind of work, however it just just does not work here.<br /><br />The 6 meagre songs which, granted, do clock in at nearly 50 minutes are bland at best and seem to go nowhere. Lyrically uninteresting with the only thing holding this album together is the fact that these two musicians can play guitar rather well. At many points however it feels as though there is far too much guitar-wankery and fret board masturbation occuring. One word: DRUMS. There needs to be some VERY GOOD DRUMMING added to this album to make it somewhat listenable. As a result of leaving drumming out from many parts of this album the arrow has hit far from the mark.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 out of respect for the 2 musicians involved.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Look, you have a damn tv show so why do we need to see half a video of commercials on the DVD especially when you can't fast-forward through much of it?  Workout is 25 minutes plus add all the commercials-who has time/patience for this?  Who cares about the names of the assistants?  Daily major turn-off.<br /><br />3 fitness levels.  Lots of jumping jacks and running in place followed by squat thrusts w/ 3-5 lb weights, pushups.  More arms, legs than stomach although some crunches.  Wear a high impact workout bra.  Level 3 is a lot of plank work.<br /><br />Yes, you feel it.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Brutal and intense is how I describe this movie. Definitely not a film for everyone. Thought provoking. Mother Nature does not discriminate. No discussion. One must accept the harsh reality that wilderness can offer. I could relate to this movie because of my own personal interests and experiences with the outdoors. Please do not allow children to watch.
B000059H98|5.0|My friend got this on Amazon, and much to her dismay, when she put it in, it was PAL compatible only.  I can see how she made the error - the listings are identical except for the little description that says region 2 on the other listing.  I'm surprising her with this replacement - the description says USA region, so hopefully we get the right one for her!  This is a rollicking ride of silly bizarreness that shouldn't be missed!
B00723NWJE|5.0|I loved Norah Jones' first two albums but fell off after, a little bored with the sound. I just stumbled across the new album, and I love it instantly.  I love the texture of the new sound, there's a dark beauty to it.  It seems like many of her fans are rigidly locked in the past, but if you're open to something different and willing to take a journey, you might rediscover the excitement as I did.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Since I got this I have been tired at work because I start watching and downloading from one thing to another from phone onto tv and time seems to go into hyper speed and I have to stop and go to bed to get at least one hour sleep before work. Great app

0061743526|1.0|This book can be rated highly if it is used for scholarly purposes. It is easy to read, with good intentions, but outdated.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is a must see for Christian men. It is clean and has a great message.<br />It represents the best work from a church that produces other movies with a message.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book makes my brain hurt.<br /><br />If you want the quick version of the review, here it is: please don't buy this book. It'll only encourage the author to write more.<br /><br />Now for the long version.<br /><br />The thing that really annoyed me isn't that 50 Shades of Grey is poorly written, juvenile, error-ridden, directionless and unforgivably boring (though all those things are clearly true). It isn't even that the book has received so much unwarranted attention and praise that even Sherlock Holmes would be forced to conclude that what remains, however improbable, is that the devil has a receipt for the author's soul filed away somewhere.<br /><br />No, what really annoyed me about this book is that it is so bafflingly unsexy.  I'm forgiving of many flaws when it comes to fiction, especially when it's self published, but when I read erotica I only care for one thing: that the story is erotic. Above all else the reason for the existence of an erotic novel is to titillate, and in this 50 Shades of Grey fails miserably.  The sex scenes verge on unreadable, and on several occasions I suspected that the author had never actually experienced sex first hand.  She seems remarkably prudish for an erotic author, describing genitals using terms that are as puerile as they are off-putting, and the descriptions of the 'action' made me think I was reading IKEA assembly instructions written by a drunk child.<br /><br />I won't bother rehashing the complaint that the author is working with the disadvantage of an extremely limited vocabulary, as many other reviewers have already pointed that out.<br /><br />As an avid reader of erotic fiction I know that there are a great many talented authors out there whose work goes unread by the masses; writers who produce sparkling prose, create compelling characters and write exciting, unimaginably erotic sex scenes.  I also understand that, for most readers, this book may be your first experience with erotic fiction.  You've heard the buzz, and against your usual tastes you've decided to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Please don't.<br /><br />The popularity of this book is the result of the viral power of the Internet.  It's nothing more than a joke that got out of hand, a piece of fan fiction that should never have grown beyond its dark corner of the web.  It needs to go back there.<br /><br />Now you may wonder why on earth I (and the other 1,000+ 1-star reviewers) am so worked up about it.  It's a fair question. I can't speak for anyone else, but in my case it's because I LIKE erotica.  I think it's a fantastic literary genre that deserves more mainstream attention.  50 Shades of Grey will be the first erotic book many of you will read, and unless your standards are dangerously low it'll probably be your last.  Thousands of people are, right now, getting the wrong idea about the genre from this stinker.  They're having their impressions shaped by an example of the worst of the genre, not the best, and erotica will suffer as a result.<br /><br />If you're thinking about reading 50 Shades out of morbid curiosity, go ahead.  Form your own opinion.  Hell, you might even enjoy it.  Diff'rent Strokes, and so on.<br /><br />If, however, you're interested in this book because you'd like to read something you might actually enjoy...<br /><br />Anne Rice/A.N. Roquelaure [[ASIN:B003QP4DU4 The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]<br /><br />Mollie Weatherfield [[ASIN:B001GMANLW Carrie's Story: An Erotic S/M Novel]]<br /><br />Or, for something a little more recent...<br /><br />Aya Fukunishi [[ASIN:B007PRJ8WW Erotica: Volume One - Ten Sinful Stories]]<br /><br />Selena Kitt [[ASIN:B003GDI92Y Taken (An Erotic Menage Romance)]]<br /><br />Please don't accept sub-standard erotica.  Your imagination and libido deserve more.

B007IPJMCM|5.0|There's no doubt the significance of this album and what it did to the metal world when it was released in 1992. The front cover art alone can almost sum up what this album and what this band represents. Pantera changed the game on what could be done while at the same time keeping the metal alive and well in the midst of the alternative/grunge revolution.<br /><br />This 20th Anniversary Edition of 'Vulgar' is nice addition to any Pantera fan's library. First off, the remaster, overall, is an improvement over the original. It is not a trebly-nightmare like the Cowboys From Hell remaster was two years ago, rather a nice boost in each instrument, especially Dime's guitar. It comes at you like a crunching, ripping, no-holds assault to the ears, while Vinnie and Rex providing infectious grooves, and finally the incredible voice/throat of Phil to top it all off. At times, as with the original CD, Rex seems to dissapear in the mix a bit, but this remaster bring out the low-end bass quite well. So for fans wondering if the investment in a new remaster is worth it after the unfortunate one of CFH, this one does the album justice.<br /><br />As for the bonus material, the \\"Previously unreleased track 'Piss'\\", it's interesting but nothing too-too special. By now, most fans know it's leftover from the 'Vulgar' sessions that the band decided would not quite fit, but would be later re-worked and included on the follow up as 'Use My Third Arm'. Hardcore fans will enjoy to hear the song in infancy and what later evolve into. The DVD, though very nice, is nothing really new either, but a nice complement to this Deluxe Edition. The live shots are from the Monsters of Rock Festival, showing the band at their prowess. The last 3 are promo vids for 'Mouth For War', 'Walk, and 'This Love', all classic and a great re-visitation of this time in the band's career. So overall, for the price, this is a great value for old-school fans, or new fans who may have missed the bandwagon the first time, this is a great set to learn why this album is held in such high regard in the metal community to this day. R.I.P. Dime.ime, this is a great set to learn why this album is held in such high regard in the metal community to this day. R.I.P. Dime.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game suck you cant go back and grind levels until after you reach level 50 but even when losing you still get a decent amount of money to level your troops up
B001ANYDAO|4.0|The book has Gladwell's usual mix of facts and insights, which shed great light even if not always 100% justified by the facts. For example, he points out the impact of general birth period on 19th and 20th-century plutocrats, and on 20th century Jewish lawyers bucking the WASP establishment, and the impact of birth MONTH on Canadian hockey stars. He's strong on showing unexpected correlations, but sometimes gets utopian on ways to fix the resulting inequities. His last chapter is a poignant essay about his Jamaican mother's mixed ethnic background, and all the little coincidences that give us the backgrounds we have.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Definitely worth reading! I started reading the book and it was so good I had to start over and read it to my husband who has a reading disability. We both loved it! We went to see the movie a couple weeks after it came out and it was very disappointing! :( My husband and I are very upset at how much was cut out and how much was changed! I don't even know if we would want to watch a sequel. The book is awesome though!!!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I ordered this G13 a long time ago and still love using it.<br /><br />The hardware ergonomics are nice. It's somewhat bigger than the Razer equivalent, the [[ASIN:B004AM5RB6 Razer Nostromo Gaming Keypad (RZ07-00490100-R3)]], but feels a bit better on ergonomics as a whole because your hand feels more natural in the position. The top row of keys on it are also angled towards you a bit so that it feels a bit more comfortable and you can more accurately feel or detect where your fingers are.<br /><br />I don't really use the joystick, but I would agree it's a little uncomfortable and hard to press. However, when I realized how nice it feels to use the indented WASD keys, I didn't really care and only mapped it for a few games, like for selecting upgrades in the original Monday Night Combat in the circular-shaped menu. That's the time when I found it incredibly useful, to be honest. I also like the two buttons around the joystick, as they make it easier to map other actions in games there where they make more sense for me.<br /><br />I love the choices of colors on the LCD and keys. You can pick almost any color, which is impressive compared to the [[ASIN:B002RRLQIO Logitech Gaming Keyboard G110]] and its very disappointing selection of only blue, red, and anything in between. With the G13, you can pick orange, cyan, yellow, magenta, purple, gray, green, and just about any other shade or hue you can think of.<br /><br />The LCD is incredibly convenient and I find that it is essential for my everyday computing needs now. I use LCDSirReal to display all my PC info at a glance, like RAM, CPU, download and upload speeds, volume, Winamp song info, Speedfan stats, and more.<br /><br />Configuration is really decent as well. You can use the drivers and program for the hardware to set up profiles and configurations, as well as macro keys. And who says you need to use it only for gaming? I use a configuration for video editing shortcuts on Sony Vegas Pro 12 as well as playing FPS titles on Steam like TF2.<br /><br />Out of the 2 years I've used this, the only complaint I have is how I have a little debris underneath the LCD screen. I'm not even sure how it got there, but I can't get it out. It's just a little speck, but it's so hard to get out and I can't seem to shake it or even move it no matter what I do.<br /><br />But other than that, just find the right gaming mouse and you'll have a much better time playing with this thing in your arsenal. I've found that it does have a learning curve to some degree (since the keys are all labeled, G1, G2, G3, and so on up to G22), but when you get used to it, gaming on a regular keyboard just isn't the same.<br /><br />EDIT on 4/8/13: Since then, I've opened up the unit and removed the debris under the screen with compressed air. I would not recommend this to most consumers, but for those that are skilled at voiding warranties, the G13 is well-put together. Seeing the construction inside showed me just how reliable it is structure-wise.<br /><br />Oh, and if anybody plays TF2 with this, I would suggest using Advanced Options to change the Spy's disguise system to the alternative one that \\"requires more keystrokes\\". That way instead of having to use keys 1 through 9, you can use keys 1 through 3 to pick disguises. You'll just need two keystrokes to select a disguise instead of one, but having them all accessible on the G13 instead of having to move your arm back to the keyboard is worth the convenience. People who use the G13 also know how easy it is to build things as the Engineer.<br /><br />I've also been playing hundreds of hours on the G13 and it's still running like the day I opened it from the box.

1401235417|5.0|This collection contains Batman issue 1-7, the first chapter of the main Batman title of DC comics relaunch of September 2011.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is very confident in his abilities as the Batman to contain crime in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne is confident in his ability as a billionaire philanthropist to make his beloved city a better place to live. Bruce Wayne knows Gotham City. Or at least he thought did...<br />As Batman, he is plagued by some unusual events, a random breakout at Arkham Asylum, a grisly murder of a John Doe, all the while an old urban legend of a group of powerful people pulling Gotham's strings keeps popping up. They are known as The Court of Owls and Bruce refuses to believe they exist. Bruce will be forced to change his mind when the Court calls for him to kneel before them.<br /><br />Scott Snyder is really dominating the graphic story medium with everything he does. And of course, credit the artists he works with as well. His American Vampire series gets better and better with each trade. His first journey into Batman, during his run on Detective Comics right before the relaunch in [[ASIN:140123206X Batman: The Black Mirror]], is one of the most pulse pounding adventures I've ever read. He also did such a great job on characterization with Batman (at that time Dick Grayson) and James Gordon by making them drive the story in a tense unforgiving narrative. I cannot wait to read the first trade of his highly acclaimed run on Swampthing.<br /><br />Ok, back to this story. Snyder, again, weaves an incredible tale that really challenges Batman (back to Bruce Wayne) and keeps the reader twisting, turning, and craving more. Snyder is also great at adding to the Batman mythos. There are some big shockers here but it does not detract from previous stories or the legend we know, again, it adds another jaw-dropping layer. Another trait Snyder does so well that I have only really seen Grant Morrison pull off so well during his run, is to be able to balance the man and the dark knight. We get a nice dose of scenes with Bruce Wayne being Bruce Wayne and doing what he needs and wants to do as that persona. It's not all a guy in a really cool military costume with a bat-theme for an entire issue. We get both worlds and Snyder manages to mix both as crucial parts of the unfolding story as a nice payoff.<br /><br />Now to give credit to the fine art of Greg Capullo. This man can really draw a deep psychological Batman story. He manages to set great tones and mood for however the story is going. A Wayne fundraiser is a joyous event with beautiful people and clean surroundings. Arkham Asylum is a slime ridden hellhole crawling with the worst the world has to offer. The agony and torment Batman goes through in issues 5 and 6 is some of the best art I've ever seen in a comic book. It cannot be described other than unnerving.<br /><br />This is an incredible Batman story, making it a great time to be a Batman fan. Bring on the Night of the Owls!!!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|it is fun but at a certain level it wont let u play the game but u can do options and other games wont let u reset when i got it it messed up my other games i do not recomend it
0312430000|5.0|I loved this book and sent it to a number of people at work. A simple but powerful idea, well-told. I hope Gawande writes many more books, as Complications, Better, and his edition of Best Scientific Writing were all equally compelling.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I obviously haven't seen it yet, and I normally don't do this, but the little teasers I see so far lead me to believe Prometheus will have something of a Heinlein flavor to it. Oh, I don't mean he could have written the plot...but the quick scenes shown malke me feel much like I do when I read his books...<br /><br />Anyway, it has been quite a while since I have been immediately drawn to a movie with the first few teasers, this looks like it will be Gooooooooood!!! I'll edit this naturally aftr I do get the DVD...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are real challenging but still a real fun game.I like pizza goldfish a whole bunch thanx for reading.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could barely make it through the first 25 pages. It was torture! Very minimalistic text, no depth to the writing. I was not offended by the subject matter at all, just the lack of content-Period! When someone uses the word 'besieged' twice in one sentence, it's time for me to choose another book. With all the hype about this book, I think it has drawn a group of readers who don't normally read, therefore it is easy for those to understand. Anyone who is an avid reader will not be challenged by this book at all. There are far more wonderful books out there for anyone to waste their time on such garbage. Thank goodness Amazon gave me the choice to delete it from my Kindle so easily!
0345803485|1.0|With all the hype about Fifty Shades of Grey, I thought I'd try reading something other than books on cooking and health. I only finished reading the first book because I purchased all three at once. Otherwise, I would have given the book to someone. Christian Grey has deep emotional issues and I did not appreciate how he treated or spoke to Anastasia at all. I understand the second book is more of a love story...hope so!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this story and would highly recommend it. The whole idea of this story was pretty mind blowing and I still can't quit thinking about it.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie is terrible. I cant believe it took a production crew, film makers, cast etc. to make this movie. Who ever rated this movie five stars needs to stop writing reviews.
B0068MNO4S|3.0|Watching Roland Emmerich's Anonymous made me realize what ridiculous lengths you have to go to when you cite other,usually more noble men, to be the true authors of Shakespeare's plays.Here Gloriana,the Virgin Queen, changes into a whore and hussy,having illegitimate children all over the place.The Earl of Oxford becomes her son and lover,while really being the supposed author of the works of `Shakespeare',who here is depicted as an illiterate buffoon,who can't even sign his name.The Earl of Southampton becomes De Vere's son.Ben Jonson becomes the messenger of the works from De Vere's pen,slagging off Shakespeare as a fraud,unable to get his own works put on.Marlowe gets killed by Shakespeare.Behind it all is the snobbish idea that only an aristocratic education could produce Shakespeare's range of reference(Oxford's study heaves with books, astrolabes, stuffed exotica).This is not just a what if fantasy,but a propaganda campaign to unseat the bard,with the backing of actors like Jacobi,Rylance,Redgave,Richardson,all publically casting doubt on Shakespeare's authorship.Emmerich poses a conspiracy in the film not to reveal the true author,a world of surveillance and torture.There's not a shred of documentary evidence connects De Vere to the plays and he died in 1604 before 10 of the Jacobean plays were written.German director,American scriptwriter, flippantly rewrite the English past.A 9 year old De Vere writes and acts in A Midsummer Night's Dream before the young queen.We see various stagings of the plays(under the aloof,discrete eye of De Vere,the magisterial Rhys Ifans)viewed through the narrow prism of Elizabethan court politics-so screenwriter Orloff suggests that Hamlet parodies Lord Burleigh,the queen's aged counsellor, while Richard III portrays his hunchbacked son Robert Cecil.<br /><br />If you realise the film is a theory not based on fact then like Shakespeare in Love you can enjoy with the aid of CGI,the stunning capture of the architectural details,themud-splatttered streets of London,seeping with sewage,this is a meticulously-crafted,well-acted film.We get lush interior court scenes or candle-lit chambers, the swarming of groundlings in a brilliantly-realised Globe theatre or around the bear pit.Ifans portays De Vere's understated,melancholy gracefulness, \\"An actor!\\" he laments. \\"An actor, for God's sake!\\" But Shakespeare it is, and Oxford continues to launder his material through this semi-literate idiot.This film is based upon a class-obsessed,anti-democratic agenda,looking back to feudalism rather than forward to modernity,based upon Looney's counterfactual bible,for true believers,rather than believers in truth.Yet a good film.Rylance turns in a radiant performance as an actor at the Globe,Armesto is excellent as Ben Jonson,Redgrave plays Elizabeth in her dotage and Hogg is brilliant as Robert Cecil.It's fitting that De Vere is plagued by voices he writes into the plays.Some of the chronology gets lost as the film jumps in the darkly lit scenes.Ben Jonson,now there's a subject,life and works,for film treatment!
B000RZIGVS|1.0|The set is very poorly made and if I had to guess, I would say they are cheap Chinese knockoffs. We were unable to watch even one complete season. Several of the episodes failed part way through and some disks wouldn't even load. I have never had this happen before! My DVD Player is a new Sony and it will play scratched Netflix movies all day long. When you look at the disks, they look just fine, but they obviously were made with defective equipment. The set was a birthday present from my Wife and she bought it two months before my birthday, so Amazon would not take the set back. A very expensive paperweight! I never heard of the company Amazon got this from, and other people seem to have had no problems, but be careful.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is awesome, I get hooked for hours at a time! Love all the options the game offers. Classic defense game with two of my favorite things. ZOMBIES AND SAMURAI!!!!
B001TM9ZHW|3.0|This book is right at the edge of making a recommended list. Brian Tracy wrote a short, practical book that contains a reminder to prioritize what's truly important, and tackle the hard stuff first. Not so bad, right? So why the less than rave review?<br /><br />Well, Tracy could have said the same thing in about 3 pages, as opposed to 100. The book becomes repetitive, and the stories and cliches are just not that engaging or profound. The 21 Great Ways are summed up in the two mentioned above - prioritize and start with the hard stuff.<br /><br />It's a good reminder, the message is important - and will get beat into you with the repetition.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was hard to put down. You are definitely thrown into the story quickly and want to see where its going. That was enough for me to finish in a night. Quick, entertaining and could definitely see as a film. There are Some interesting character arcs that were hinted at early on but I would have liked more detail in that aspect. The two main characters are interesting enough to keep you reading, so for that alone I recommend. The supporting characters are what I would like to see more from. They are entertaining but lack description and I had to use my imagination more for them. I also read that she plans on writing a book from the male characters point of view in this. That will be interesting to read.
B0055SWM08|4.0|well done game. quite addictive, enough challenge to keep it interesting, not so much you get too frustrated. great graphics too

I will be going to find his past books and guides.

0061122416|5.0|I read this right after high school.  This should be required reading in High School instead of the other 'classics'.  Amazing story, very simple and easy to read.  Main lesson I got from it:  don't be a sheep and follow the herd.  Trust your instincts and follow your passion - and be aware and open for any opportunities and adventures that will arise once you break away from the safe comforts of the herd.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|There is no refresh button in the app.  You can click until you are blue in the face and sometimes it will not display the current radar map.<br /><br />WITHOUT A REFRESH BUTTON IT'S USELESS.  How are you supposed to kick it in the pants to get it to display the data?<br /><br />I've used another app to force this closed and then SOMETIMES once it restarts it updates the weather and then will display the maps.<br /><br />What monkey would write a web based app without a REFRESH button somewhere that worked?<br /><br />It's going into the trash until someone fixes it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the best part is it leaves files like TWC.ERR and TWC.DEBUG around when it decides to go to sleep and not display anything and fills up the free memory on the KF, too.  That's cool.

0345803485|1.0|I couldn't make it past page 12... not even with the promise of over the top pornography at any moment.  The feeble grammar and inarticulate writing style made it impossible to hang on long enough to even remotely invest myself in the plot or characters.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|Excellent Sci-Fi film that transcends the usual<br /><br />  I was surprised by how much my wife and I both liked this film. It brings to mind Attack the Block and Super 8, but surpasses both of those in depth of character, script, humor and special effects. The special effects are astounding. But the depth of character surpasses the kitsch that most special effects really are, in this age of CGI and other computer generated marvels. We found ourselves really liking and caring about the main character, a quiet, smart, nerdy kid who is bullied both at home and at school. His creative outlet is amateur filming, which is a theme that runs through the movie and which lends itself very well to the idea of an Indy produced, hand-held camera that gives an otherwise unbelievable film its cinema verite quality. This serves to make the special effects even more memorable and believable, since the boys' astounding powers are so slowly developed; they are understated and minimized at first. Great script, beautiful characterizations, heartfelt sympathy for teens, the whole enlivened by humorous and believable teenage testosterone ... and some real magic. I had some very minor issues with the film, but this did not prevent me -- and my wife, who usually can't sit through a real sci-fi film -- from enjoying this nearly perfectly realized film. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.
B004OC07N0|4.0|This book helps to focus the attention on the important things first, given the importance of the first 90 days I think it is worth read it and use it as a tool to ensure you start with the right foot.
B007P6VM04|4.0|The music in Smash is simply amazing. I'd give it 18 stars if I could. But I found the choice of tracks on this album very odd. 6 original songs, and 7 covers??? Stupid and annoying. There are certainly some good covers in Smash, but that is not what most people really care about. (And, half of the covers on the album are meh, and my favorite cover - I'm Going Down - isn't even on there.) The best thing about Smash, hands down, is the music from Marilyn! It is so good!!<br /><br />I think it would have been much, much better if they had two albums - one with ALL of the originals, and one with covers. That being said, I don't regret this purchase.<br /><br />Check out this list I spent way too long making of all the songs in Smash. See if you want enough of the ones on the album for it to be cheaper than just buying the singles. And figure out how much more you'll still have to spend to get all the songs you do want.

0307949435|5.0|I found this book to be very enlightening.  I've struggled with my weight all of my life with kind of hit and miss success. As I got older it became impossible to hold the line and slipped into an extra 25-30 pounds. Add a knee replacement to that and I'm feeling all of my 60 years plus a few extra. I know about nutrition. I have a masters degree in public health nutrition and actually worked in some of the national nutrition education programs that this book talks about. I am utterly horrified at the shabby research that I took as gospel and  that I, personally, spread their doctrine wide and far. In fact I was so horrified that I did not believe this book could be correct, so looked long and hard for  informed, educated rebuttals. And I found several rebuttals but none of them questioned or refuted that  the research at the basis, of the increased exercise, low fat, high carb diet that is recommended by the government,  was  intentionally flawed to the point that it is virtually meaningless. Frankly  it is so flawed that it is just a lie.  Not only that, but a great many follow up studies show the same bias--the researchers were out to prove one thing and refused to look at other interpretations of their data, or they just left out data that did not fit what they wanted to show. Face it, you can show that cell phones cause obesity if all you look at is weight gain and cell phone use! You HAVE to look at the other events happening in people's lives and not just consider the one you want to prove. Another common rebuttal is to look at research that does not actually follow this eating plan yet claims their research proves that it is wrong.  The basic theme of the rebuttals I found was that they thought this book was oversimplified, or they just \\"felt\\" it was wrong, or \\"how could so many be wrong\\" or the one I liked the best, \\"we just don't have all the answers\\" as if we haven't been pretending we had all the answers for 40 years with the low fat, high carb diet!  Somehow if the government, the American heart Association, etc took the same stand--as if they are not all connected-- it had to be right. Yet I could find no researched based complaints regarding this book.  In fact I found a researcher who sits on the board of the American Hearth Association who had to agree that research did show that the high carb diets did cause problems.<br />  So I decided to follow this general diet plan myself.  After 9 months I've dropped 30 pounds (and, darn it all, seem unable to drop the last 5--somethings in life just don't change.) I've lost the constant craving I had for sweets (I used to wonder when I'd 'grow up' and stop eating every sweet thing in sight--seems to have happened, finally). I feel great and life is good. No I don't eat brownies etc but I really don't miss them. I can go to an event that has tables full of sweet, carbohydrate loaded snacks and just not even want them--no will power involved.  I had a physical with blood work and my results were better than they've been forever.  I told my doctor about my dietary changes and asked her what she thought about it. She looked at my lab results and said, \\"keep doing what you are doing because this is working very, very well for you.\\"  And my blood work is pretty much exactly what you would expect after reading this book--nothing special about it, just the same results researchers always report with this diet pattern.<br />  I suggested this book to my book club. They all found it very readable and well worth the discussion.  If you have struggled with your weight, or your cholesterol/blood lipid profiles I suspect you that you might find this book well worth reading. Personally I'm enjoying not pounding my head against the same low fat/low carb/constant hunger/seesawing  weight life style.  I much prefer the stability this way of eating offers.

In a nutshell most consumer players output on a whole about 20 milli watts but is it loud enough, ya sure it can be loud but the sound quality go's poof when you turn it up. Recently I purchased the Sony MDR-EX510LP headphones and while they sound pretty good something was missing, well their rated to handle 200 milli watts! If you think about it it's like driving a pair of 12's from your car stereo. The craziest thing is actually how small it is since I was worried it would be too big but it fits nicely behind my iPod Classic with room to spare and the rubber band that came in the package keeps things together.
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy is the best one I have ever read and it almost makes you cry when it ends. I read about the books on the internet, immediately ordered the set from Amazon, and read them all within a few days. I hardly ever see them now, due to the fact that several people I work with are constantly passing them around...I'm considering buying another set just so I can read them again and again. And,  yes,, there are strong elements of BDSM, but there is a truly a story to be told in these books.I am a Fifty Shades girl for life!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game! Very addicting and makes you want to keep unlocking levels. The only downfall is when you progress it takes more points to unlock the games. I play this on my kindle fire and would reccomend for anyone!
B00004VWAF|5.0|\\"On The Corner\\" is STILL sui generis - while it has antecedents, those are fully subsumed into an exceedingly singular whole, quite unlike anything or anyone else. Miles had a way of doing that. And he did it again with On The Corner. Is it jazz? Is it funk? Is it rock? Is it avant-garde? Who cares??<br /><br />If you MUST pigeon-hole the music you listen to, then STAY AWAY from On The Corner. It'll bake your noodle.<br /><br />Roundly vilified by all parties when first released, it has taken the world many, many years to be able to finally \\"hear\\" this recording without bringing all the category-driven baggage that was slapped on it initially.<br /><br />But that leaves YOU. If you're open to new musical experiences, then by all means you should definitely check out On The Corner. It is incredibly powerful music. It may change you. DIG IT!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series is a very enjoyable and easy read. Characters are fairly well fleshed out and act logically. The books themselves are an interesting look at what life would be like for mankind if forced to live underground.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love solitaire and playing this game brings me back to the days that I would play for hours on and off my computer. The controls are easy and there's no lag on the Kindle Fire. The only issue I have is that with my a.d.h.d I get bored too easily with these types of games so I have to move on but this one is a definite keeper.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I truly enjoy this application regularly. Although I prefer to read my leather-bound bible, this convenient application has allowed me to structure my yearly reading plan. It further commends and encourages you to continue reading through emails. I give it three thumbs up!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is awesome and while I'm addicted to it I get frustrated when I fail a level. :) I love the seasons and the different story boards. The controls are good and easy to use which is what you need when you have a touch screen. I also love the links to the website and the greeting cards, nifty.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a really great book!  Very sexy, but with a great story line.  I am looking forward to reading the remaining two in the Trilogy.
B005HSL626|3.0|While I know this is a sample of the game on Xbox you would think they [the creators] would give you a couple more levels so you can decide if you want to buy the game on Xbox. It would be nice to see a puzzle level or two. It is a fun game but after ten minutes I got bored of the same level.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very easy to set up and play. If you get tired of losing you can even request a winning deal. good for kids to learn on.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I first found about Angry Birds I didn't think much of it until I played it on my friends phone and then I was hooked. I got it for my Ipod and killed the battery on it. My husband bought me a Kindle Fire for Valentines day and playing Angry Birds on the Kindle Fire is awesome. The graphics are sweet, the controls are easy to use and the abilty to zoom out and in is good. I also like the response time and I love how there's no lag at all.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is a pretty good game. the gameplay itself is smooth, graphics are good, and it consumes your time very well in my opinion. If you like addicting games this is one for you.
B006A6EDQU|5.0|In The First Five Pages, Noah highlights for authors the pitfalls and trip wires which the unwary writing enthusiast can so easily incorporate into the first five pages of their manuscript. In a clearly written and insightful work, Noah as a publishing insider, indicates to writers how their manuscript can so easily be rejected because of common errors showing through in only the first five pages. I believe this book should form part of every writers reference library.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Earth's mightiest heroes--Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansen), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)--assemble to confront Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his army of extraterrestrials.<br /><br />When I read that Joss Whedon had taken the helm of this production, I felt optimistic that it was in good hands, given his solid work with super-powered characters on TV (Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel) and in comics (The X-Men).  I was not disappointed.  \\"The Avengers\\" is the big, action-packed film it needed to be, but it also features sparkling dialogue and the efficient characterization required in such an ensemble piece.  This strength is demonstrated in a scene in which the heroes' differences emerge in a heated debate about tactics and motivations; everyone becomes alarmed over how agitated Bruce Banner is becoming, since they know what may result.  This dialogue-driven sequence stands out even among the various face-offs between heroes and the huge battle at the end.<br /><br />I have loved all the movies out of Marvel Studios because, whatever the individual merits of each film, they have stayed true to the characters.  \\"The Avengers\\" marks the culmination of Phase I.  Now that all the origin stories are out of the way, I'm excited to see what comes next.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|There aren't enough superlatives to describe the quality of this show. I'm thrilled that I was able to buy the first season, since I don't have HBO. Beautifully written, superb acting, fantastic costumes and sets, wonderful music--every department is top-notch. Usually, I'm not a fan of fantasy but this has been so good that I've already watched the entire series 3 times.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have it on my kindle fire and its awesome! this game is amazing,  it has great graphics and is by far the best free game on the market. it is also very addictive. I love it. now if you'll excuse me I have to go back to playing my game.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great read.  Just wait for the end! Defending Jacob has unexpected twists and turns that will make you read until the end.  The surprising ending makes you think about your own values and believes.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I actually can't pick a favorite song, they're all so good. A friend said this is the first album she's bought in years that doesn't have a single track that she skips most of the time, and that's absolutely true for me, too.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I expected action. Repeated battles against the wolves. Instead, men talking and reminiscing and being tracked by wolves that you hardly ever see.<br />Do your self a favor and skip this movie. I usually like Liam Neeson movies, but he made a mistake appearing in this one.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|well I love the fact that it has zombies.also it is really cool to be a samurai. and you get acully kill the zombies
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well after hearing many people at work talk about this book I had to read it myself. The first thing that I have to say is that it was in the book description it mentions twilight. There is nothing in this book that reminds me of twilight!!!! After that being said this book is a very easy read that will keep you on your toes. Ana and Christian are a young couple that meet in a regular way. Christian leads a life that is in my eyes is a \\"normal\\" life outside of closed doors. What young 21 years old women would not want the money and life that he has???? Ana stands her ground with her beliefs in her life but she does try to be a submissive for someone that she has fallen for. This book was hard to put down after the first 5 chapters. After chapter 5 I was wanting to know more, it was like I was Ana. The only thing that I did not like was the end. It is a total cliff hanger but yes I bought the next book Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed so I will know how the whole story ends. Again easy read and great story line. But I am not sure how they can make a movie out of this BSMD????
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|After finally receiving Trespassing from amazon, I gotta tell ya, I thought i died and went to heaven...What an amazing CD. All the songs are buttilicious good. I was jamin'.  The funk, the beats, the production, the Voice, the songs, the lyrics are all thru the roof....I am so happy for Adam. The best \\"complete\\" Cd of 2012. Not one \\"filler\\" on this one..My only complaint is that i wished all the songs were longer but i guess that's what remixes are all about..Congrats to Adam! love you dude.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is relaxing and it challenges you to use your mind. each game is challenging. I like that the game has different levels for you to play. I would suggest that there be more info to some of games obstacle that are placed inside selective game.  I would tell other to try it.

0871404133|2.0|I have four of E. O. Wilson's books:  The Ants, Journey to the Ants, The Insect Societies, and Superorganism.  All of which are great works.<br /><br />So I guess that my expectations were high on The Social Conquest of Earth.<br /><br />He presents a compilation of very interesting facts from Physical Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, Biology, Archeology, etc.<br /><br />In and of itself that data is very interesting, but there was really no new data.  However, my biggest issue with the book is that he never pulls all of this together into a unifying idea or concept.  The book is just one factoid after another factoid after another. This left the book as a very big disappointment to me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very good game. quests are worth doing and items aren't over priced. runs perfect on my kindle fire. only thing that I don't like is it takes long to collect from buildings and plants. other than that I give it 5 stars
0307594165|5.0|In Toni Morrison's latest short novel of 147 pages, HOME, Frank and Ycidra (Cee), brother and sister, like so many Toni Morrison characters, are ones you cannot get away from. Frank has recently returned from the Korean War only to face a Jim Crow South, although the character Lowe reminds him: \\"Listen here, you from Georgia and you been in a desegregated army and maybe you think up North is way different from down South. Don't believe it and don't count on it. Custom is just as real as law. . .\\" Frank is very protective of his baby sister nicknamed Cee who faces unspeakable violence of the worst kind that cannot be discussed in a review without giving too much of the plot away.<br /><br />I'm convinced that no contemporary American novelist writes better first lines than Ms. Morrison. (For example, although I read JAZZ and PARADISE years ago, the first lines of  both those novels remain printed on my brain.) The first line here that begins a horrific short first chapter is \\"They rose up like men.\\" The other characteristics of a Morrison novel are here: one-word titles, complex characters totally convincing as people, a nonlinear story line, powerful statements about racism in America without  being didactic and, finally, beautiful language, often about love, hope, endurance. \\"Their parents [Frank and Cee's] were so beat by the time they came home from work, any affection they showed was like a razor--sharp, short, and thin. Lenore [their step-grandmother] was the wicked witch. Frank and Cee, like some forgotten Hansel and Gretel, locked hands as they navigated the silence and tried to imagine a future.\\" Unlike many who left the South during this period, their migration so well documented in THE WARMTH OF OTHER SUNS, these characters return to their home in fictional Lotus, Georgia. Of course Ms. Morrison captures this return in page after page of exquisite prose as these two, as Andrew Young would say, make a way out of no way: \\"So he [Frank] busted himself cleaning and repairing his parents' house that had been empty since his father died. . . He rummaged a hole next to the cook stove and found the matchbox. Cee's two baby teeth were so small next to his winning marbles. . . The Bulova watch was still there. No stem, no hands--the way time functioned in Lotus, pure and subject to anybody's interpretation.\\" Then Frank returns to the cotton field he had hated so much as a child and remembers a time when \\"he and Cee were free to invent ways to occupy that timeless time when the world was fresh.\\" (Reynolds Price, a great fan of Ms. Morrison's, is the only modern American author who comes to mind who wrote prose as beautiful and evocative as this.)<br /><br />Ms. Morrison uses the literary device of  pathetic fallacy over and over in this book that often reads like a prose poem: roots fight back, the sun sashays  and does her best, cornstalks sleep, etc.  How does this short novel rank with her previous fiction? Does it matter? It is enough to know that you are always in the hands of a great writer as Ms. Morrison delivers the truth. HOME of course is something to read in one sitting and not to be missed.g and repairing his parents' house that had been empty since his father died. . .

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay is awesome. And I think this is their best album. I would take off a star because of their use of dynamic range compression (it makes music sound louder sacrificing some of the quality with it) but the music is still too good.
1594203059|5.0|I was the ultimate believer in the theory that O.J. was guilty and walked by a miscarriage of justice. After reading this book, I have changed my mind. Regardless of his guilt or innocence, the LA police were irresponsible and have remained that way to the present time.<br /><br />The book is written as an adventure story. Reading it is like watching a true-life Rockford Files.<br /><br />O.J. is tragic character, right out of a Shakespearean play. He won everything and then lost it all by his own pride.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game that consistently is challenging but also relaxing. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the card game.  I also like the options of play available.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|An all-time favourite, read and re-read time and time again over the past 20 years or so.  It's great having it on my Kindle, but I do think you need a romatic streak to enjoy it as much as I do.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|This has to be one of the very few films that overall captivates and draw me into the story in terms of pure originality and uniqueness. I've watched this film more than 40 times and it preserves its brilliance and attractiveness very well.<br /><br />The acting and cinematography are superb beyond recognition. Eli and Oskars bond that accumulates gradually in this film is heartwarming and magical primarily because they are two tormented souls looking for peace and understanding. The found just that. This is just such a beautiful film which hit me on a variety of emotional levels simultaneously.<br /><br />Out of all the films made that are considered to be the greatest films of all time, this particular film let the right one in is a film that i would firmly state is one of the top 3 greatest movies ever made worldwide. I have phenomenal admiration for this film and implore people to give this magnificent film the rating it deserves. Its an undeniable masterpiece.

B0001ARCFA|4.0|All in all these k240's are a good buy.  The open ear, light design makes these the most comfortable headphones I've worn, and causes very little to no strain on the ears with long term use.  Because of the open design you can't expect any isolation from these, so they are more for studio use or any other place that has decent acoustic treatment or isolation.  Don't expect these to be good for going out to do field recording with.<br /><br />If you're looking for accurate sound, these give it.  They have a wide frequency range without giving too much boost to the bass.  There is a little boost, but its much better than most headphones you'll get for under $200.  I use these headphones primarily to edit fx and dialog in the later hours when it's inappropriate to crank up the volume in an apartment.  I notice that they give a better representation of what I'm hearing than my current speakers, which curve the lows to the sub woofer and boost everything above 7kHz.  These have helped a lot to do noise removal too.<br /><br />My only complaint about these is that they are rated at 91dB, so they are pretty quiet.  You won't be able to give these enough volume with an ipod or anything similar.  My last headphones were rated at 107dB, and they isolated 40dB of ambient noise.  Those gave me the ability to listen quietly, but crank it up if there was a trouble spot that I needed to pay attention to while editing.  The K240's are not that type of headphone.  With my Roland dp-990 they work great and I can get them louder than anybody should ever have them.  But I also have a bose companion system that I hook the headphones up to when I work, and at full volume (or close to) the listening level is good, but with the open ear design, any noise happening in your environment drastically affects your listening ability.  I just throw a compressor on my master fader and it helps when I need the volume boost.  Over all I would recommend them, just make sure the device you're hooking them up to has a lot of power, because you'll be turning the volume up more than with some other headphones.hem up to has a lot of power, because you'll be turning the volume up more than with some other headphones.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|It's 4 stars (sort of) but not because of the acting (3 1/2 stars) or the story (2 1/2 stars). I loved watching it on the screen and the action was great. It was the larger than life scenes and the animation that made it. The rest? Eh...

B00943SQCI|3.0|They assembled an all-star cast for this film. They included \\"dark\\" favorites such as Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee. Character actors like Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Toss in Chloë Grace Moretz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green and a great soundtrack and you would think you would have a great film, right? They forgot to hire a writer.<br /><br />The film opens with a long narration to give us the 196 year old background, then shifts to 1972. Some of the humor involves the typical 200 year old man stuff coming into a strange era. It also had the immature \\"balls\\" humor. The dialogue was bad. It managed to be campy without being funny. The advantage of bringing the series to the big screen would be the use of great special effects limited by a stage. This was underutilized.<br /><br />This movie was classless.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is a must read to truly appreciate the strength and courage of Jaycee Dugard and her years of imprisonment. I have followed her return to civilization and she continues to impress me with her tenacity to provide a safe and full life for herself and her daughters. Jaycee Dugard is a very rare woman and one we can all learn from.<br /><br />The diary notes and intelligence of an 11 year old teenager growing through the years is remarkable. At times it may be difficult to understand but once you recall her age and living conditions, you can only be in awe of the presence of mind she had through such formidable years. Thank you Ms. Dugard for not only sharing your story but providing us with the belief that there is nothing we can't overcome.

B007JWKLMO|4.0|This DVD tries to frame George Harrison's spiritual journey from his beginnings in Liverpool to his search for himself while still a member of the Beatles to his route to self-discovery as an artist in his own right. Scorcese uses interviews of people who knew Harrison (some recent but most are older) as well as home movies, clips from shows and other material to look at how George Harrison sought to develop his own spiritual identity.<br /><br />A bit long but well worth it if you're interested in George Harrison. The only downside is that if you don't already know George's bio then you're often at a loss as to when some of the events seem to be taking place or the film just barely touches on some topics without really discussing them. All I can say is, I really enjoyed it.

B0040Z9H5K|4.0|Everyone has said Iron Man was a great superhero movie, and I'm wholeheartedly in their camp.  That said, don't let that keep you from watching Iron Man 2.  It's a good movie in its own right.  In Iron Man 2, the world knows that Tony Stark is Iron Man, yet it isn't satisfied.  The U.S. Government wants Stark to give them the technology to the Iron Man suit.  S.H.I.E.L.D. is keeping a close eye on Stark, and Stark Industries is facing new problems brought on by Tony's irresponsibility, culminating with a late-night party while wearing the Iron Man suit.  Stark is slowly being poisoned by the very arc reactor that is also keeping him alive.  How Stark deals with it is what makes this movie so interesting.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. suits his role perfectly.  His Tony Stark is egotistical and narcissistic, but still has a playful sense of humor and a powerful desire to do good in the world.  These qualities don't often go together, but Downey brings them all to Stark in a believable way.  I'd pay to watch an entire movie of him sitting by himself--he's that good.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Pepper Potts, who's a dedicated, hard-working woman trying to manage both Tony and his company, but slowly being driven mad by the stress of it.<br /><br />Don Cheadle steps into the role of Lt. Col. Rhodes, and it isn't one of Cheadle's best.  Terrence Howard played a perfect Rhodes in the first movie--dedicated to the military, but also to his friend Tony, forever putting up with his shenanigans--even standing at attention for three hours on Tony's aircraft.  In this movie, Cheadle just doesn't seem believable as a military man.  In the Congressional hearing, both the Senators and Stark just overpower him verbally, and there just isn't the same level of playful banter between Downey and Cheadle as there was between Downey and Howard.  (No \\"Spring Break 1987\\" jokes here.)<br /><br />Overall, Iron Man 2 is very much worth watching.  It's just not as good as the first.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read reviews before reading it and I was glad I did or I would have been more disappointed. It wasn't a terrible book but it just didn't work with me. The writing was so redundant; how many times can she flush crimson,  scarlet, or any other shades of red! I agree with most others in saying writing just wasn't there. With all the hype, I expected more from the sex scenes. There were maybe 2 that I enjoyed. I know it's a trilogy but I feel like many other books put what is going to happen (what I assume will happen) into one book, not three. Why was this book so long and the time span in the book so short?<br /><br />I'm still indecisive about continuing the trilogy. The ending just left me unsatisfied, not yearning for more.

B00008J2PG|4.0|Excellent movie about one man's humanity in one of the darkest times of the twentieth century.<br />A true story of a man who would truly live his beliefs and benefit thousands.<br />The true scope of his desire to live how he understood his faith is not understood until the final voice over comment at the end where Hugh O'Flaherty's \\"Christian\\" character is revealed in how he acted after the war had ended.<br />Worth watching for anyone trying to define what character truly is.

B005LAIHGI|5.0|Sacha Baron Cohen does a great acting job in his latest film, \\"The Dictator.\\" The gags are mostly good and although some are tacky and racist (with a few being crude) it still held my attention on a very rough day for me because it works as a parody of dictatorships. There is little about the plot and the film that I can add to the reviews already posted here; but I can certainly vouch for other reviewers who write that the film is actually pretty good entertainment, a parody and nothing truly offensive even if Sacha Baron Cohen is very daring when it comes to topics for jokes and gags.<br /><br />The plot is not terribly deep; but it moves along well and you shouldn't get bored. Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the brutal dictator of the fictional, northern African country named Wadiya) surrounds himself with excellent actors all turning in convincing performances that make the film even funnier. Sir Ben Kingsley plays Tamir, the rightful heir to the dictatorship occupied by his apparently younger brother General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen). Anna Faris is brilliant as Zoey, a Brooklyn, New York vegan small business food store owner who's liberal activism clashes sharply with Aladeen's \\"take no prisoners\\" and kill-`em-all policy whenever anyone disagrees with him. Nadal, a scientist ordered to create nuclear weapons for Wadiya, is well played by Jason Mantzoukas; his timing is just right and he supports Baron Cohen really well.<br /><br />Soon after the film starts with some gags and basic introductions, General Aladeen is practically summoned to the United Nations. They want his assurance that he isn't developing nuclear weapons--otherwise they may use military force against Wadiya. Aladeen travels to New York with Tamir and an extensive entourage--but soon after that he is kidnapped and nearly killed in a very funny scene with one of my favorite actors, John C. Reilly, playing the would-be murderer. Tamir hopes that with the real Aladeen out of the way he can use a phony \\"double\\" for Aladeen and use the double to make Wadiya a democracy so Tamir can sell its oil to countries around the world, most notably America and China.<br /><br />But what Tamir doesn't know is that Aladeen escaped being killed and wants nothing more than to gain back total control of Wadiya. Just how Aladeen and Zoey get to know each other and how Aladeen tries to win back control of his country is how the rest of the film plays out, complete with gags and jokes about anything Baron Cohen wants to tackle, including 9/11, blacks, Jews, Asians and just about anything else you can imagine.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked Sacha Baron Cohen's other films, I think you will like this one. It is better than \\"Bruno\\" and while it isn't quite as good as \\"Borat\\" it's definitely funny. It managed to divert my attention on a rather stressful day and that's actually saying a lot. In addition, if you're new to Sacha Baron Cohen's sense of humor and you're not that easily offended, you should enjoy this film.ony \\"double\\" for Aladeen and use the double to make Wadiya a democracy so Tamir can sell its oil to countries around the world, most notably America and China.<br /><br />But what Tamir doesn't know is that Aladeen escaped being killed and wants nothing more than to gain back total control of Wadiya.

1451648537|4.0|The bestselling biography of Steve Jobs was not high on my reading list but I was lent it and devoured it in a week. Since it wasn't my book and I couldn't write in it, I don't have excerpts, but I have a couple responses.<br /><br />  Isaacson is a great writer. I agree with Steve Jobs himself that he was an a-hole, but Isaacson made the life of this a-hole very interesting.<br />  Steve Jobs was an a-hole. I'm not disagreeing with his own self-assessment.<br />  Steve was an artist with an artist's petulant demeanor.<br />  The serious girlfriend in his life before he married concluded he exhibited Narcissistic Personality Disorder. See [[ASIN:0972072837 The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists: Coping with the One-Way Relationship in Work, Love, and Family]]. I think she's right.<br />  How could a company succeed with such a self-centered person?<br />  How could a company succeed without such a focused person?<br />  Notice the two sides of that disorder?<br />  He lacked empathy. People who survived and thrived in his employ learned to cope with his insults.<br />  He pursued beauty instead of profits.<br />  He saw beauty in simplicity and purity.<br />  He hired the best and fired the rest.<br />  He was always looking 5 years ahead.<br />  He considered various mind-altering methods beneficial<br />  Fasting<br />  Meditation<br />  Zen Buddhism<br />  LSD<br />  food fetishes<br />  His reality distortion field was an effect of his intense focus, but it also hurt him and those around him when he refused to engage reality: his daughters, his initial cancer result, some business decisions<br />  I respect those who left the company and all the money because they couldn't work for him. I totally understand. Dignity is priceless.<br />  One of his early lieutenants described himself as an \\"assaholic\\". I thought I invented that word, but I'm glad others recognize it's value as a word. I think it's easier to say than Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
0345803485|1.0|I read several chapters of this book hoping that there would be quicker development and insight into Christian's disturbed psyche, and therefore a revelation that would bring about a change in his behavior.  I got tired of tolerating this female character, supposedly a strong, smart, girl, allowing herself to be emotionally and physically violated.  This is a terrible example of what is acceptable in a relationship. I am disappointed in our society for making this a hit.
0441013597|4.0|I really enjoyed Dune. I think that Frank Herbert is deserving of being considered as one of the foundation blocks of modern Science Fiction. To me, what made this novel so special is the immense amount of care that Herbert put in to world-building and creating comprehensive political and religious structures that encompass many different facets of the people who populate the complex world (and universe) that he has created.<br /><br />In some ways, Herbert has almost treated this novel as more of a Fantasy-type novel that he then fleshed out with Science Fiction elements. So much care has gone into creating the world itself that you don't see as much in Science Fiction as you do in Fantasy. While reading the novel, I felt that you could have asked Mr. Herbert any off-the-wall question about the Freman culture or way of life and he would be able to answer without hesitation. I think this same feel also applies to the Bene Gesserit, House Atreides, House Harkonnen and the politics and people involved in the majority of the Imperial regime. It's this feel of a complete back-ground and established history that make this novel (and hopefully the rest of the series) truly special much like Tolkien's Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The story itself is fairly fast-paced and filled with political intrigue. The story does have slow moments from time to time, but these times mainly focus on critical moments in character development or the building of important plot points, so they didn't seem to drag at all but actually served to enhance the more dramatic and action-oriented segments of the novel. Characters both good and evil, long-term and brief, are fully fleshed out and easy to root for or against.<br /><br />All in all, a very good novel and one that is deserving of the praise that it has received from fans and critics alike. I will not hesitate to pick up the next book in the series sometime down the road.
0345479092|5.0|When I found out I was pregnant (5 years ago), I bought about 8 books on babies and read every one. This was by far the best book I read. In this book the author talks about how important it is to respect your paper and treat them like their own person. She gives amazing tips and logical advice, as well as some things I'd never thought of. Now, 5 years later, I have an amazing 4.5 year old son who we can totally see benefitted from what I learned in this book. In fact, I now buy this book for EVERY baby shower that I go to.<br /><br />FANTASTIC BOOK to help you understand and bond with your baby, and be a better parent! If everyone in the world read and learned from this book we'd live in a Utopia, where everyone is well raised, well adjusted and happy.

B006AR2C3K|5.0|Original Release Date: December 6, 2011 - ???????<br /><br /> I just came from an Ebay site and it reads the original relase date for this CD is<br /> 11/25/2011 (that would be Christmas Day to the Christians (who are hypocrites as Jesus told his diciples they were) - \\"because they like and even love to stand on the street corners and in the synagogues (churches) and pray out loud in order to be seen by men.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was highly annoyed by this book. I found myself yelling out loud at the ridiculously repetitive use of words & phrases. Get a thesaurus!! Not only that, but the story just keeps repeating basically the same scene over & over & over... & the places & geography are all wrong ( I live in Seattle ).<br />If you have ever read a well written, well researched book you literally will not make it through this. Other than an excuse to read/write about S & M , I can't imagine why it exists.

But the enhanced content is only available on IPAD, IPOD, & IPHONE. Are you freaking kidding me!?! How dare amazon sell a book for Kindle that can only play the content on an Apple product!!! I have never been so completely taken aback by false/misleading advertizing. It is NOT ENHANCED KINDLE CONTENT it is ENHANCED APPLE content. What a rip-off. I haven't even begun to read the book because I was so outraged. Unbelievable!!![[ASIN:B003YL4KS0 Curly Girl - Enhanced Ebook Edition: The Handbook]]

B0067R0APK|5.0|Live radar, hourly forecast, a daily forecast for two weeks, and video clips for local forecasts make this app a keeper.  Combine that with a few extra customizations and an advertizement-free experience make the premium version worth the small cost.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I ordered this watch because I wad looking for a quartz chronograph, something cheap that could get banged around the kitchen, hot tub, or riding bikes.  And, I have to say it's performed great.  Keeps great time, as any quartz ought to, and I really can't fault it on anything.  42mm is pretty large so it certainly helps to have larger wrists, but larger seems to be in style,  so it's really no big deal.  Additionally , the dial is a very brilliant blue, that I really, really like alot.  All in all, It's a pretty good value, keeps good time, and is aestheticly appealing. So if you're looking for a quartz chronograph, this is a good value.  For what it's worth, I'm still wearing it while writing this review at 2 am.

0345803485|5.0|I read all three books in 3 days and wanted more.....  The popularity of these<br />Books has more to do about women wanting men to be attentive, romantic and<br />Dominant in and out of the bedroom and less about out of control kinky sex...<br />This does not mean that women want to be complacent and subservient but<br />They do want the feeling of being with someone that makes them feel safe<br />And their MAN makes them feel that they are the center of the earth...<br />Who would not what that!!!  To some degree I think women's lib.has made<br />Some men feel that they cannot fulfill this role or \\"we women\\" will put them<br />In their place....  The intimacy of these two characters is hot....  As far as the<br />\\"kinky\\" I thought it was prety mild.  If the avg.

B004TTMYQG|2.0|For the last year, I was using this app as my key appointment tracker.  Sometime in the past it stopped adding any new appointments I create back to my Google calendar. Of course, I I learned this the hard way, scrambling to sort obut why I missed events.  I'm disappointed that updates haven't fixed this.  I need reliability.
B005ZO4TOO|5.0|A delightful presentation of a clasic that surely children(and adults) can enjoy. In our home it will become a Christmas table-top book for the Christmas Season.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome compilation of games. The games are both fun and CHALLENGING!! In between the games can get a little mind numbing.. However still a spectacular app.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|A great start, especially when the hero crosses paths with a tough, smart 14 year old girl - both fleeing on a bus for different reasons - and someone tries to kill the girl - who does a bang up job of defending herself.  They both flee the bus and it suddenly blows up (with her assailant on it).  Neither the hero or the girl know if they are after her or him. It's a great set up and I was totally riveted.<br /><br />But then the girl pretty much takes a back seat, which was disappointing because she's interesting & so is their relationship, and the plot just became more and more convoluted.  My enthusiasm began to wane.<br /><br />Yes, they explain it all at the end via a neat & tidy exposition speech (they needed it), but really, a majority of the action felt like going down a rabbit hole, spending a lot of time on clues & redundant characters that, in the end, had very flimsy ties to the main plot's endgame.<br /><br />Regardless, it's fast paced, snappy, and fairly entertaining.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not sure why everyone's complaining about the price...I saved 2 cents by downloading each separately...figured if I didn't like #1 I'd save even more.  That said, I read them all, twice, in a week!  The lack of beautiful prose did become annoying the second time thru but I knew which parts to skim past by then.  One reviewer suggested reading a Sleeping Beauty story by Anne Rice instead.  I downloaded the trial version, and while the language was beautiful, I found the story very ugly and didn't buy the rest of the book.  Fifty Shades is an enjoyable story about the interesting relationship between two consulting adults with visions of not-so-vanilla sex...  I hope the movie version receives an R rating to do my imagination justice;)
B000VSYDRM|1.0|Here's to all the budding serial killers out here, this monumental piece of cr**p is all the more disturbing due to its beautiful cinematography. I assume the book (which I will never read) is equally elaborate prose with the same effect, of trying to elevate murder to an art form. Of all the ways to explore sexuality, love,and the senses, as a species we are becoming more and more decadent, and less evolved. I bailed after the second murder. And of course, this movie (and horrid book) are more than celebrating violence against women. Disgusting to the extreme.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|First off PLEASE READ THE BOOKS! Thank you.... Ok now for the review. They did a very good job capturing the characters, the story, the monsters, the scenery, ect.. the acting was great, tons of action, sex, intrigue, and such to keep you guessing and your attention fixed to the screen. I have introduced many friends and coworkers (even some who aren't really into the whole fantasy thing) to this show and they ALL loved it and are now hooked. Defintely a great buy!

B004EPYZSK|3.0|Not bad for a movie that has both cowboys AND aliens. It's nice seeing Ford as something of a badguy at first. Plenty of action, but even with both Craig and Ford it was just another \\"aliens try to take over earth\\" plot. We all know how those end. ;P
0345803485|5.0|I'm not sure why some of the top reviews for this product are so negative. I thought it was a great book (and I'm a guy). It's an entertaining read if you're looking to burn a few hours.
1451629184|3.0|I don't know about people finding this book inspirational or heroic. As a mother, I find this book very painful to get through.  Despite Ms Dugard's assertion that she has been progressing since her rescue, and that she's on her way to healing, I felt otherwise.  First, the narration is very detached. Maybe that's why some readers complain that it's poorly written.  It's because the substance is all covered up under this tone that is trying to be rational, meaningful, hopeful - the substance is there, but I feel as if both the writer and reader don't dare to even take a peak. I've encountered this kind of writing/story telling before - it was from Vietnamese Boat People survivors, who told a straight forward narrative of how their ship met pirates and people got raped, dragged off, killed etc. etc. repeatedly. You get told the facts, and then you look at the person who's telling the story, and it's as if they were just a scholar presenting a paper.  That sort of thing.  I hope it make sense.<br /><br />Towards the end you also get a glimpse of the ugly aftermath that is media sensationalism.  Her therapy session that involved the horses chasing after her and various family members carrying grain buckets, and the lessons she drew from that session makes me think that perhaps this book is in print because the media and the public's craving for details of her life demands it.  Maye it's just another handful of grains thrown in the direction of the horses in hope of escaping a stampede.  Who has been hounding her to publish a book? I would ask myself.  That sort of thing.<br /><br />Ms. Dugard has all my respects and good regards in the world, because she has been through so much and her suffering is unimaginable to me. Reading her story just sorts of make me feel despair, knowing that this kind of evil still exists and might just be down the road from my home.
B000ME5B30|1.0|I had a class assignment on this video and tried to rent it and trying to view it was horrific. I have netflix and know I have a reliable network connection because netflix plays great. THis video kept pausing and loading and asking me to try again later. I watched a program for half an hour on netflix then tried to watch this video again. I was asked by amazon how the quality of this video was I checked unacceptable now it sakes me to rate this video. So here I am saying once again I got nothing positive to say about this experience. I had to then go to 3 video stores till I found a copy to rent for my assignment. As for the movie, CO2 comes after global warming by 800 years not before it. Its like saying exhaust gas from your car makes your tank full of gas and makes it run. Its a bit out of order.

B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade is hands-down my favorite singer, EVER.  I saw this show twice (Atlanta & Memphis) and was just as thrilled as the first time I saw her in concert back in 2001.  The band is a collection of some of the greatest musicians I've ever heard live who play so well together its as though they have telepathy.  I will admit that I expected the same powerhouse vocal performance that she gave in Lovers Live, but it was a bit more subdued this time.  Still, I would go to see her again and again and again.  Her talent (and her band's) exceeds most of the junk played on the radio today and they should all buy a copy of this dvd to learn how it should really be done.

0345803485|1.0|Opened the book to take a sampling and happened upon the end of a violent encounter.  The heroine was shocked at the violence, physically hurt and humiliated.  She vowed the sort of \\"never again\\" thing and sulked off, only to be followed by a sweeter more pentinent guy who was worried about her.  All her feelings seemed to mean nothing moments later as she is reminded how pretty he is and apologizes TO HIM before professing her love for him.  I have no idea how this is different from a scene where a husband throws his wife across a room and is then sweeter and more sorry afterwards.  If this makes one battered woman think that really loving someone means swallowing that all down and somehow loving them more for sharing what a monster they are, then this author should truly be ashamed of herself.  For all of the readers who are lapping this sick drivel up, well, it gives me little hope for women of today.  Perhaps she would have been less forgiving if he wasn't as pretty, or as rich.

B007SGM084|5.0|I have never read anything with a BDSM type theme before and was not really sure what I would make of it.  I read it because there was so much hype around it and because I had loved the Twilight series and heard this was loosely based on that series.  I absolutely LOVED this series!!  I could not put it down and found myself reading all day long and into the night.  I actually think it is a shame that the only part of this book that is ever talked about is the BDSM aspect because there is so much that goes on, including a romance (filled with much lust of course), suspense, and even an aspect of coming of age for Anastasia.  I will be reading this series again for sure!
B004C6QDG8|2.0|I looked forward to this new release from Analog Productions. I had every reason to be enthusiastic after hearing Freddie Hubbard on Hubtones, Dexter Gordon on Go, and Lee Morgan on Sidewinder, all SACDs from Analog Productions. However, for some reason, Maiden Voyage just doesn't sound right. It is so very dark sounding. I compared it to my RVG edition CD. On the Analog Productions SACD, it sounds like the top end has been rolled off. I wish I could recommend Maiden Voyage but sadly, I cannot. Take my advice and stick with the RVG edition of this one.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The book was very good - I appreciated the creativity in developing the plot around authentic vintage photographs. It is a fantasy book but blended well to not be too \\"out there.\\" I'm not a big fan of sci fi and fantasy books but I really enjoyed this. It was a quick and easy read for me - read in about 1-2 days but enjoyed reading it very much. I did read it on the kindle and the detail on the photos/writing on the back was difficult to read so it would likely be easier to read in hardcopy but it is doable on the kindle with good lighting and vision.

B0041O40EI|4.0|The previous reviews have been thorough and accurate but I just wanted to restate that this is a pretty tough puzzle to complete.

0345803485|1.0|I did not like this book. I do not understand what all the hoopla is about this is a simple love story that tries to be an erotic novel. I found this to be a boring read and felt that the author does not know a thing about eroticism. The author needed to read The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy by A. N. Roquelaure to understand true erotica. Not worth your time.
B004V8W54Q|4.0|When I first saw this movie, forty years ago, or so; I thought (1) it's a little slow and that (2) Mr. Gilliam's fantasy is so far-fetched that I had trouble (even as a Monty Python fan) suspending reality to the point that I could consider our society being at constant risk of terrorist attacks.<br />In 2012, I think this movie is relevent and I with it would be re-cut (it is a little slow) and re-released.  The ending is perfect.

0307594165|4.0|In \\"Home\\", we have the story of Frank Money, a bitter, damaged veteran of, most recently, the Korean Conflict, and in a broader sense the American racial conflict. Two years home from the war, he's a drifter with one guiding principle: he never intends to return to his home town of Lotus, GA. His most recent dread stems from the fact that he alone of a trio of near lifelong friends has returned from war, but that is only the top layer of his distaste for a town that was defined in childhood, for him, as a place of neglect, humiliation, and loss. It is only when he receives a letter begging him to once again save his beloved younger sister that he finds the courage (perhaps born of desperation) to revisit his past.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is a slim book, less than 150 pages, but there is a wealth of wisdom encapsulated in its pages. There are lessons about dignity, courage, regret, loss, but most importantly about defining one's own life. For being such a short book, Ms. Morrison has done an admirable job of creating fully-fleshed characters in Frank and Cee, his sister; I always admire someone who can tell a succinct, yet still complete, story. We learn things about Frank and Cee in bits and pieces, much of it non-linear in time, which feels like getting to know a flesh and blood person; who, after all, reveals to us their life and soul starting with their birth and moving in orderly progression to the current day?<br /><br />The title of the story comes from a cherished theme, I think: home is where and what you make it. There is much talk of homes and houses in this story, from the ramshackle house in Texas that the Moneys flee when Frank is only four years old, to the home his family shares for a few years with their silent grandfather and cruel step-grandmother, to the apartments they later inhabit; we even get a look at the desire to own her own home Frank's briefly mentioned girlfriend has, and how the effect of his indifference to her desire has upon her and their relationship. The dimensions of rooms are detailed, the conditions of houses as a reflection of their owners--it's really marvelous how these details become almost another character in themselves.<br /><br />An interesting plot device occurs when Frank occasionally speaks for himself, first person narrative in the midst of a mainly third person narrative; Sometimes he agrees with the story teller, sometimes he's flashing out a point, occasionally he contradicts her entirely. It's a lesson in the unreliable first person narrator (as Frank also ultimately contradicts himself in a major plot point), but it's also a lovely counterpoint to the sometimes heavy structure of the main narrative.<br /><br />This is funny; I originally set out to write a three star review, saying that I liked it, but didn't understand the inclusion of two chapters--one in Frank's girlfriend's point of view and one in their evil step-grandmother's POV. I was unable to see their relevance and considered them a weakness (and perhaps the product of an editor letting a powerful author have her head), but in the course of writing this, I've changed my mind. Now I know why they're there: they reinforce Ms. Morrison's point about houses, HOMES, and how they both reflect and define their owners. God, that's beautiful. (She did that to me with \\"A Mercy\\", too--I didn't figure out exactly hw I felt about it until I was reviewing the book) I came into this with the thought that Ms. Morrison's theme was, \\"Don't let others define you\\"; after all, she even has a character say almost those exact words. As important as that message is, I think she had more in mind, something more subtle:<br /><br />As it turns out, you can go home again. After all, you carry it within you.relationship.

B005DEQV9W|4.0|This is a great book for parents of children who have ADHD, ASD, CP, and even reading difficulties. He explains how the infant reflexes can sometimes still be present and how it may affect how the body functions and behaves. Very informative. There was only one slight issue I had with the book. He spends a lot of time trying to negate the Swiss government's position on ADHD and medication. Overall this is a great book once you get passed the first couple of chapters. Easy to read with pictures of some of the movements to help individuals work with those in need.
1439153663|3.0|Seven year old Lavinia's world changes beyond all recognition when her parents both die during their long passage from Ireland to America. Left with Lavinia and her brother, the captain decides to make up what he's lost in passage fare from the parents and sells Lavinia's brother into indentured servitude while taking Lavinia to his own home in Virginia. The little girl is taken in by the captain's illegitimate daughter and the rest of his house slaves, and there becomes part of their family in most respects; in a few others she exists in the uneasy gray space between black and white.<br /><br />Those are the facts, and the story begins well. I liked the character of Lavinia, and my heart hurt for her as she takes her first steps into the world of slavery (for she does not find out that she is actually an indentured servant for many years). Belle, the captain's illegitimate daughter, is drawn well, as are Mama Mae, the head of the household/kitchen staff, and her husband, Papa George. They are the strong support for a secondary cast that is sketched more than fleshed out, and help the story trot at a fairly brisk pace for the first half of the story. I found it interesting that the questions of slavery that we see most often (right or wrong? good or bad?) are neatly sidestepped by basing the story in the late 1700s rather than the far more common 1800s. I also found the differences in the treatment and status of house slaves versus field slaves depicted strikingly; it's not a comparison that is made often in historical fiction.<br /><br />Problems begin in the second half, though. Lavinia ages fairly unbelievably--it's very difficult to believe that a girl raised since small childhood in the realities (and close quarters) of the slave quarters of a Virginia plantation would be quite as naive as Lavinia. The characters that begin so believably denigrate to stock: the 'Evil Overseer', the 'Noble Father and Mother', 'Neglectful Owner', 'Crazy Southern Woman'. That was disappointing. It's not that those characters could not exist; the fact that they have become stock seems to indicate that there is more than a whiff of truth to them. The problem arises when they become interchangeable with any other character of the same type in any other book of the genre.<br /><br />As a student of history, I was put off by the fairly astounding (and pretty unbelievable) events as Lavinia grows up. Taken in as an indentured servant, but accepted as family? Courted by not only a man of social standing in Philadelphia, but also by the handsome, fairminded, and Noble NEW Overseer AND the new master of the plantation? By the time of her marriage (and I won't give away that one), I was ready to toss the book.<br /><br />Still... I was interested enough in Belle to keep reading. That's something, right? I also found myself a bit fascinated by Marshall, the captain's son. Of all the characters in the book, he was the most faceted, a bit tortured, the most interesting, and ultimately the least explained. Though it's made clear by the author what she thinks destroyed his character, I found myself wondering where his fascination with the Evil Overseer came from (as it's noted that he spends time with Rankin even before his personal calamity). I also was a bit jarred by one of his later relationships, as it seemed out of sync with his character as presented up to that point.<br /><br />At the end, I left the story with a shrug. The writer seemed to do the same, as the book ends quite abruptly, with Lavinia's version of\\"... THIS happened, then THIS happened, then THIS happened, and then we all lived happily ever after as one big happy family.\\" YAWN.<br /><br />\\"The Kitchen House\\" began well, had some high points, but ultimately disappointed.

B0034G4P1W|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Aardman and all its work up to this point (Chicken Run, Wallace and Grommit), so I was looking forward to seeing \\"Pirates! Band of Misfits\\". Sadly the trailer not only had all the good parts in it, but the out-of-order snippets made for a more interesting story than the movie itself. Children might enjoy the film for its goofy style, but the usual excellent timing and humor of an Aardman production was definitely missing.<br /><br />If you have been a fan of Aardman then you may well be disappointed. I certainly was. \\"It's the wrong trousers!\\"

0307352145|5.0|Montgomery, Alabama. December 1, 1955. A public bus pulls to a stop and a sensibly dressed woman in her forties gets on. She carries herself erectly, despite having spent the day bent over an ironing board in a dingy basement tailor shop at the Montgomery Fair department store. Her feet are swollen, her shoulders ache. She sits in the first row of the Colored section and watches quietly as the bus fills with riders. Until the driver orders her to give her seat to a white passenger.<br /><br />  The woman utters a single word that ignites one of the most important civil rights protests of the twentieth century, one word that helps America find its better self.<br /><br />  The word is \\"No.\\"<br /><br />So begins Susan Cain's riveting book on introversion, the much-maligned personality trait shared by more of us than you would probably guess: one out of every two or three Americans, a third to half of our nation, are introverts. \\"If you're not an introvert yourself,\\" Cain writes, \\"you're surely raising, managing, married to, or coupled with one.\\"<br /><br />As Cain points out in this powerful and compellingly readable analysis of how personality type shapes culture and history, to be an introvert is not necessarily to be shy, as many people think, or slow, or timid. (Note the negative connotation of those words.)<br /><br />While there is no standard definition of \\"introvert,\\" Cain says (this despite hundreds of studies on the common personality trait), she picks out several key characters of the quiet end of the introvert-extrovert continuum. Introverts do just fine on less outside stimulation, she writes, \\"as when they sip wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or read a book.\\" Introverts work more slowly and deliberately, do less multi-tasking, and \\"can have mighty powers of concentration.\\" Introverts may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation.<br /><br />Further, she points out, introverts tend to \\"dislike conflict\\" and \\"have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions.\\"<br /><br />Quiet is no feel-good pop psychology book; it's a thorough and insightful look at those of us who, like Rosa Parks, know the power of quiet fortitude in a world that could use to do a lot less talking and more listening, a lot more being and less doing, a lot more steadily acting on core beliefs and a lot less accumulating riches and stuff, and a lot more loving than bragging and fighting. (Just sayin'.)<br /><br />Quiet illuminates what introverts have to contribute to a world that Cain maintains really, truly needs our gifts:<br /><br />  Take the partnership of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.: a formidable orator refusing to give up his seat on a segregated bus wouldn't have had the same effect as a modest woman who'd clearly prefer to keep silent but for the exigencies of the situation.<br /><br />Quiet reads like the Introvert Manifesto, and in true introvert style, it's not about violence or even oratory; it's a thoughtful and thought-provoking call to use our power for our own and the world's good, and to nurture and take pride in our own characteristically quiet, deep and considered gifts.<br /><br />by Susan J.

B001H9JBW6|5.0|I can not recommend The Last Enemy more highly as an enjoyable, intelligent, suspenseful, surprising adventure that, without condecension or pedantic-ness (is that a word?) reveals something that is hard to understand but critical for citizens in \\"free\\" societies to fully realize.  It is a great story and a completely believable prediction of what might happen due to the conflict between personal liberty and the \\"security\\"  of constant surveillance.  I wish I could afford to send a copy to everyone in government and anyone who doesn't see the difference between privacy and dangerous secrets.  I've heard that TIA was actually proposed in the US after 9/11.  Brrrr.

0345803485|5.0|I have to laugh at some of the one star reviews, I don't think they get it. If you want this book to be a great literaly novel, it isn't. I agree some parts are not the most well written. For me this book was an erotic fantasy and was written as such. If you are very conservative and not openminded this book isn't for you. I really wonder why read it when you know from the start you won't like it? For those have read other romance and erotic novels and can step outside of reality this book was quite enjoyable.  I think this book is delicious and have recommended it to all of my friends.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|This cover is great!  I love the look and feel.  The elastic holds strong and fits nice with my Kobo Wifi.  It doesn't block any of the buttons or the charging port. However the light is blocked.<br /><br />This case does NOT have a magnet in it.  Although, and here's the trick, the piece of cardboard with the info about the case that is placed in the elastic where the ereader goes has a magnet hidden inside it as does the thin insert that goes in the pocket on the inside cover.  So if you were looking at this in a store you would notice that the cover shuts itself magnetically.  I find this to be extremely misleading for anyone who is looking at it in a brick and mortar store.  Even though I bought this case online, and the case itself is fantastic, I took a star off for this misleading fact.

B0009A40ES|5.0|AMERICAN PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis  novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company.  The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting body Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage).  Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the `look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fianc&eacute;e (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her.  Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.<br /><br />AMERICAN PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved.  Grady Harp, May 12is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved.  Grady Harp, May 12

Just name any group big or small, it don't matter!

B0000033TE|5.0|I'm 57 years old, born in Los Angleles. I've listen to everything from soul, psych, rock. Did you every notice when a band changes it's record label, the sound and production is different then before, Led Zeppelin, the Stones, ELP and on and on, sometimes good and sometimes bad, mostly BAD. Think about it, why did ELP went down the tubes after this album. Did anybody ever notice that then me? What I'm trying to say is this, their was a big difference in sound quality from the master tapes from Cottilion to Manicore Records! Just like Led Zeppelin with Atlantic to Swan Song, we had to put a lot of Equalization on these Records to try and make it sound like before! I thought the Phisical Graphity Album on Swan Song Records SUCKED on sound quality compaired to Atlantic Records! And what Manicore (UK) suggested for Emerson, Lake and Palmer to do is to make a 3! Album Live Package to boot! Big Mistake right there, should have waited a little longer for that, because did You hear the Next Album? It SUCKED People because with that gamble, We have missed recent Albums from ELP on Cottilion Records in the future! Think about that! P.S., I wonder if our Ancestors had the same problem with Sophie Tucker, Al Jolson, and Bing Crosby, who knows?
B00364K6YW|5.0|NO other version can match it.  This 6 hour A&E/BBC Version of Pride and Prejudice IS the Definitive Version! Best ever made or ever will be made. Excellent acting, word for word from the novel, and FULL of color making it pleasing to watch. This is the only version I like. It's PERFECT in every way! BEST OF ALL they have NO live Stock or Pigs running through their house! This version shows the Bennett family as Jane Austen intended them to be...  aspiring to be apart of the Upper-class. If you like accuracy and are an Austen Fanatic, you will need this movie ASAP! It's truely the best ever made.
0061120081|5.0|If you are only to read one classic book in your life, this is the one to read. Harper Lee beautifully describes life in Maycomb, Alabama and creates characters that jump off the pages. With the narration of Scout Finch, the novel has a childlike innocence, but still deals with serious topics. The idea that a story can be told through a child's eyes, stripping away all adult jadedness is remarkable and deserves all the praise it has been given.<br /><br />It is a must read for anyone who considers themselves well-versed in literature.<br /><br />I also suggest reading the book prior to seeing the movie, but both are great!
B00633W614|3.0|When I reached the last page of \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" I kept checking for more pages!  This just could not end with Harry being arrested in NY?  What a cliff-hanger!<br /><br />But, much like \\"Who Shot JR\\", the resolution was a major disappointment.  \\"Sins of the Fathers\\" felt more like a short story or novella.  It simply wasn't fleshed out.  It's like Sir Jeffrey wrote a rough draft, barely more than an outline, and turned that in to his publisher to make a deadline.<br /><br />The elements of a good story are there but they're disconnected somehow.  It doesn't flow.  The narratives are all over the place and its hard to keep them straight.  We seem to jump months, or even years ahead, with a one sentence explanation of what happened.  For instance, we had Harry going from being in prison to being in the US Navy in WWII! We get a one sentence mention of that time from someone, and that's it?  It's like Archer didn't have time to finish that part of the story so he just blew it off!  Like I said, a rough draft, and incomplete rough draft.  It is a page turner, though.  It just doesn't compare with the high quality of \\"Only Time Will\\".<br />I read this on my Kindle in one day.  The characters in this book are plastic, and I never felt the emotional connection I had with them in Only Time.  When it ended, I really didn't care what happened next.

0547569653|5.0|I'm not typically a biography reader, and I'm not someone who follows Scott Jurek or the sport of ultrarunning in general. Sure, I run a little, but I'm not fanatical about it, and I'm definitely no vegetarian.<br /><br />Still, I picked this book up and read half of it on a plane between Phoenix and Houston. I would have kept going all the way through but the plane was landing. (I read the second half on my way back to Phoenix.)<br /><br />All I can say is that the book is very well written, entertaining, informative and inspirational. I can't speak to the quality of the recipes as I haven't had a chance to try any of them yet, but my copy of the book has markers in it to call out the (vegetarian!) recipes that I want to try.<br /><br />Scott seems like an amazing person with an fantastic group of friends in the running community and around the world. His life is definitely not without struggle and conflict, but he's made it this far and is still going.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the titles associated with each chapter: \\"The Pride of the Cake Eaters\\", \\"Bug Boy Goes Gown\\", and \\"The Wisdom of Hippie Dan\\", to name a few, and the accompanying quotations sourced from the likes of Lao-Tzu, Randy \\"The Macho Man\\" Savage, Tupac Shakur, Robert Frost and John Muir.<br /><br />If you've read and enjoyed [[ASIN:0307279189 Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen (Vintage)]], I think you'll enjoy this book.

(I'm blushing and biting my lip in shame at admitting this fact.)<br />Having studied human sexuality in college I was intrigued when I heard about the topic of these books. I imagined a courageous writer willing to explore a long held taboo by opening up a discussion about the inner workings of the human heart when domination and submission become the focus of the sexual relationship. And then I read the books. Populated by poorly defined characters who seem to think of nothing but sex and whose decision making ability is on  par with self involved middle schoolers.  The author strung a series of sex scenes together and as an after thought added cliched characters (older and incredibly handsome man/ virginal younger woman) in unlikely scenarios (filthy rich and powerful male who can do, be and have almost anything falls for the trembling, naive but feisty young college girl who literaly stumbles into his arms). The  repetition of descriptive words as well as whole passages  seemed designed only to fill the pages rather than forward the story. This is a flimsy and superficial story stretched no doubt for financial reasons into three books.  That the books are listed on so many best seller lists is a tribute to the talents at promotion by the publisher and gullible nature  of readers like me.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book in under two days, on and off. The author has obviously ripped off the style of the Bridget Jones books (first person, present tense, cutesy emails with subjects like \\"Shouty Capitals\\"). She isn't quite successful in masking her British background and adopting the American vernacular and tone of voice.<br /><br />Worse, she knows little about the BDSM lifestyle. Reading a few articles on Wikipedia does not an expert make. She daringly begins to set up a sexual encounter, only to run away squealing. \\"Look! I'm so naughty! Giggle!\\"<br /><br />The reading level is that of a Grade 7 girl. If you enjoy very, very light reading and want to consider yourself open-minded for reading a book about BDSM, and you're not troubled by an intellect or faculties of critical thinking, this book is for you. Shelve it with your Harlequin romances. It's that fluffy and meaningless.<br /><br />I have skimmed the next two books in the trilogy. There are two insulting themes in them. Apparently the author has Anastasia \\"cure\\" Grey of his \\"sickness\\", as if people can't be happy, well-adjusted and into BDSM. Second, she has Grey \\"suffering\\" from his kink as a result of childhood abuse. This is reminiscent of lesbian novels in the 1950s; publishers would not support novels that had a happy ending, or well-adjusted gay women characters. They would only publish them if one of the characters either died or went insane. James is guilty of the same heinous bigotry with these badly-written books.
0718157834|5.0|This book was given to me as a birthday present from my sister. Firstly I thought it will be another light chick lit book, so it took me some time before I started reading it every evening before I went to sleep.<br /><br />Shortly I became addicted to the story and was postponing my sleep, even though I knew I was going to be tired the next morning. In the evenings I was looking forward to going to bed, so I could conect with my friends again. Yes, friends, because the book gave me a feeling I was inside of the story, I understood all the characters, how they felt, what intensions they had, for what reasons...<br /><br />This is for me one of the books which you want to read fast, so you know how it will end, on the other hand you do not want to finish it quickly, because you know these people from the book will disappear from your daily life and you will not be able to reconnect with them again. I really enjoyed this book, the style how it is written and I decided to buy also another books from this author to see whether they will give me the same feelings which this book had created. Enjoy reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great game now on the tablet. Fun easy to configure and very cool. Love it. Best mobile solitaire game yet.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|My wife was happy and I even watch it great deal it had the tracks I like and some I havent head adele is a great artist and has a good sense of humor
B0079R8KO0|3.0|i searched through a lot of different covers to get and decided on this one. i like it, but am a little disappointed. the material is more synthetic than leather. not very soft. and the front side is kind of grainy. does not feel as i thought it would. also, took a couple tries to snap my kindle into the case. wasnt sure if it would hold, but seems pretty sturdy now. the elastic strap to keep the cover closed seems somewhat loose, even when its new. not sure how it will hold up over time.<br />i do like the stand, however. nice to be able to prop it up and view movies or what not. by far the best feature.<br />but i am not sure how the back cover will hold up over time, since it has to bend when you prop up the kindle. can already see a crease...<br /><br />overall pretty good product, but not quite what i expected...
0345803485|5.0|Received this book as promised.  It was in excellent condition.  Read it in 10 hours.  It will be one that I would recommend to others.  It was well written and flowed throughout the story.  You need to buy all three at the same time as you will want to read Book 2 and then Book 3.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this would be a 5 star game but it has to many glitches. the timers reset to a very long time then it kept telling me my wifi wasn't connected when it was. I haven't been able to play the game because of this. uninstalling!
0345803493|5.0|Received book in excellent condition.  After reading Book 1 went to Book 2.  It continues the story and gives insight into questions that you have from Book 1.  A very good read in this trilogy.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love bejeweled so this game is very addictive! It's something different for a change from that, plus I like the rewards at the end of each level.
0345803507|5.0|Received book in excellent condition.  This is the final book of the trilogy.  It continues the story.  It has much more of the whole story line.  It is a must to finish this story.  It shows the growth of the characters and why Christian is the way he is.  I read the whole series in just a few days.  It is one that is hard to put down.  Thanks to the author for this trilogy.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This is a FULL BLOWN office suite....nothing is limited....you can create documents (spread sheets, word processing etc.).<br /><br />This is a very powerful and fully featured software and FOR FREE.... you can't ask for better.<br /><br />It really is amazing... you can read and write docs and you can read PDF files too.<br /><br />Full editing features just like any office suite on a PC with all the bells and whistles you need.<br /><br />GREAT GREAT software.
B001J4E1D8|1.0|I was very disappointed to receive a DVD from Amazon that was made in Mexico! The second disc is obviously a counterfeit. As it was the same price, as at other retail stores, I thought it would be of the same quality and stanards that you expect form a true BBC Video.Buy it in a retail store, so not to get \\"made in Mexico\\".
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Recently my PS3 quit working (got YLOD) and I decided to buy some thermal compound and fix it myself. It's been about a month since I've added the paste and my PS3 is still going strong.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|As a digital artist I have often found that relying on computer software can make a person forget the basics of drawing (shading, perspective, etc...). I bought this book to aid me in improving on my drawing ability. When I first contemplated buying the book I went back and forth because I am always hesitant to buy into anything that guarantees success. However, this book does exactly what it promises it will do. Not only did it improve my skills it also helped my fiance with learning how to draw as a beginner. I would recommend this book to anyone whether they are a beginner or someone like me looking for a refresher.
0340818859|5.0|Watching The English is another unique book. I received it in great time, in great condition, for a great price. Thank You
B004MC8CA2|4.0|very good Bible to use and very useful to use when your on the road or even if your out and about just to have something to read is good
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun wholesome even children playing game. I have it on my kindle fire so I can play any where<br />thanks for creating this.would love to see more games like this I also have ice age which is another fun one
B007WV05GY|2.0|I was really looking forward for this movie. What a disappointment. At least kill the wolf at the end, but no.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I ordered this book after reading the sample and could not believe how intense the writing was. I found that it was written in such a way that it connects you to the reality of what is war. I found that Chris Kyle is likable from my point of view. He reminds me of my husband and he writes the way my husband talks which makes it very easy to read and really get into the moment. Great read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 20 years old, 5'3\\" and 163 lbs. I'm looking to go down 40 lbs by this time next year. I gained about 30 lbs since starting college and I figured the best way to start losing the weight was with this DVD. I'm overweight, unmotivated and love to eat so I like the idea of only working out for 20 minutes a day. I started the \\"30 Day Shred\\" 4 days ago and although I have not noticed any weight loss (it's only been 4 days after all) I do notice that my love-handles have gotten smaller. Level 1 definitely kicks your butt - I still find it very difficult to do push ups. It's do-able though and there's also modified versions to the harder exercises.<br /><br />Level 1 starts off with an easy enough warm up and ends with basic stretching.<br />It includes 3 circuits, each circuit consisting of:<br />1) 3 minutes of strength (pushups, lunges, side lunges, chest flies, etc.)<br />2) 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope [without the rope], punches)<br />3) 1 minute abs (basic crunch, reverse crunch, side crunches, bicycle)<br /><br />As Jillian says, you don't get to workout for 20 minutes and take a break. You're constantly moving during those 20 minutes.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is so addicting.  I wish it was easier to get credits. But regardless it is still a blast. I cant stop playing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Shockingly bad on so many levels. The unbelievable nearly non-existent plot, the thoroughly unlikeable characters, the sophomoric and just plain bad writing, the poor editing and repetitive nature .... It is easily the worst book I have ever read.<br />Please don't waste your time. There are many other interesting erotica type books out there that are well written and thoughtfully constructed.  It makes me sad that this author is getting so many accolades when her writing is atrocious. (not to mention the  editors!!!)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better written and it flowed very smoothly versus the first book! I love Christian Grey's transformation from a tortured soul to an amazing and wonderful man! Can't wait to start on Book III.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a very simple smooth game. works great on the kindle fire with very few lags (mostly when zombies are near your gate and your by the bridge or beyond) buttons could be a bit bigger, and you should be able to buy charms with silver coins but you cant :/ also, the rifleman is useless.<br /><br />move by tapping either side of the screen, the character attacks automatically but you can choose two &quot;special&quot; attacks that you can use once they've cooled down. you also have the option to call allies, which are bought using leadership points that gradually increase as you play. you also have the option of using a single 'charm' each level that gives you special bonuses.<br />as you kill zombies they'll drop silver coins and leadership points, as well as a present or glue credit every now and again. they also drop small silver balls that can be used to play pachinko and win special prizes. the button to play this minigame is at the bottom of the upgrades page and is somewhat difficult to notice if you aren't looking for it.<br /><br />my only real problem is that I have no idea what to do with the tea ive won in pachinko.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Very realistic and intense movie. No Silvester Stalone and titanium braking under the weight of 100 pounds girl if you know what i mean. Everything made sense. But be prepared to be shaken.
B0071QIN00|4.0|this app is fun to play, but only for a while. once you beat the game, the levels get kind of boring. but,you can erase your progress, so thats good.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think this game is great.  I love this new version of a classic game from when I was a kid, brings me back to simpler days.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game!!! Best one ever!!! 8) It is also like Mario but way way better!!! 8)
0895260131|5.0|And it's no wonder because to shed light on Islam is to destroy it. Robert Spencer, by presenting facts in a logical and collected manner, has debunked all the fashionable myths about the so-called religion of peace.<br /><br />More than a religion, Islam is an ideology, one of rapine, death, and mayhem. It teaches that its benighted followers are entitled to rule over and exploit the rest of mankind. Decent human beings all over the planet should unite to make sure Islam will never see the 22nd century.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun games like that u can open more just by playing makes it fun love this game like that my kids can play to
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its fun to play, and a good time killer. If you like to save space on your device I recommend this app. The point system is aggregating as well as.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|Note:  My Vine copy never arrived.  Had to borrow from a friend who uses his IPad at the police academy.  Stand function works well.  The feel is good, and it does a decent job of protecting the IPad... Seems like a good deal for the price. Really wish I had gotten mine... :)<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After the 5th most satisfying (hers) sex scenes, I started skimming through them. Not that I don't enjoy reading erotic parts but it was the same thing. Also, unbelievable because from a virgin she becomes this, like I said, unbelievable woman with an amazing sex drive.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Great to see paul do something different and best enjoyed with your SO, a bottle of wine cuddling on the couch.
B001YXSWDE|5.0|The Basement Tapes might make you laugh and cry; is that true of Dylan's other recordings?  Admire Blonde on Blonde for its singular vision, Live 1966 for its venom, but I'll take \\"i bought myself a herd of moose / that one day she could call her own\\" over just about anything.  There are a lot of great lines like that, if you're in the mood.  I love the way Dylan sings 'Tears of Rage'--tough on the surface, but with as much emotion as you can hear in his later albums.<br /><br />I think a lot of us have some issues with the presentation of doctored Band material alongside the real Big Pink recordings, but it's as almost as gorgeous as the rest, so who cares... Ain't no More Cane sounds great.  I wish that there were a couple of \\"original basement tapes\\" tunes on here, like Ferdinand the Imposter, or I'm Not There, on One Man's Loss, but they couldn't get it ALL on the CD.  The Basement Tapes sessions contain multitudes, though maybe not like Greil Marcus thinks.<br /><br />I love this album deeply, have been turning to it for years. If you are reading review #400 of this album, you already have it... but if you don't, try it out.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I like the graphics, music &amp; sound. Has never crashed on my DINC (1). Like all the options, especially the options for skipping<br />a level, seeing a solution if stumped, etc. (kinda like when ya cheat at solitaire) ;-D  Even feels a bit educational.
0345803507|5.0|You must read the trilogy! Great characters; Plots within plots. Well written - an easy read. One of those books you can't put down. Then there's the sex! OMG!
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I was tricked by all the hype and the Amazon rating for this book. I love world building,fantasy and historical fiction and am an avid reader...so I was hoping that this book would be something good. There is NOT one character that you will connect with during this boring, poorly written and disconnected book. Save your money and read the customer review by mlle.x from March 1, 2011 about \\"Mary Sue with nothing to do.\\" It sums up the tea-drinking, yoga-doing, constant sleeping, 2-plates-of-food-eating annoying witch that will bore you with her uneventful \\"magic\\" and the most pathetic uninspiring love story you can ever imagine. Please save your money and look elsewhere.

B0013LL2Z2|5.0|My teenage nephew had never seen \\"Logan's Run,\\" and since he is a science fiction buff, I thought he should experience this classic! Thank you Amazon, for having retailers like this one who offer a quality DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this series, should have never been canceled, and should of made more movies, hopefully we'll get more movies, til then, we wait
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game is fun but it is some problems with glitches other than that everything else is fine. Graphics are good, audio is good,  and gameplay is good.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This movie is so entertaining! The music is great and really heightens the emotion in the seen. Family friendly is a big plus too!
B0083GPDBO|2.0|I cannot stand movies that are made in the third person.  It reminds me a lot of Blair Witch being filmed by a video camera.  Movie was<br />all over the place.  Really weird movie.
0525423281|5.0|For adults too.<br />Fabulous author, she writes at the top of her profession, and will be a NYT bestseller before too long.  This book has it all: great characters, moral quandaries, character development, strong sense of time and place, humor, romance, etc.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good lots of fun hats running out of energy tho that gets boring low points highs too don't have much more to write
B007R21JJK|1.0|UP-DATE: 6-28-2013<br /><br />This review concerns Amazon. The shipping was on time, but the packaging was horrible. I ordered another new board with an I7. The board had been a returned item as evidenced by Thermal Paste and after removing processor cover noticed at least 10 pins bent or broke.<br />This is not the first time this has been noted by other customers. Amazon needs to get a quality control system that would check items going out to customers to make sure they have factory seals. This motherboard was missing all the cables and books, plus being used and returned.<br />I have learned one thing!!! Check your items immediately upon receipt.<br /><br />I have used this board in the past. It is a great motherboard. No problems with it. period...
B000QUCNP4|4.0|If you like detective stories, or investigation stories, this is the movie of the year. I may be biased, because I lived in San Francisco when the Zodiac resurfaced after years of silence, and when the book was written about it. This movie is a pretty darn accurate account of a true story.<br /><br />This is a story of obsession: the obsession of the Zodiac killer is one thing. The obsession of certain people who investigated the murders, especially the one who did not give up, and eventually wrote the book about it, is the other.<br /><br />It's not an unduly gory movie, really. There is blood, and there are killings, but they are not over-emphasized. It's just part of the story. There are the methods detectives use, and there are the methods reporters use, and the ways they work together, and the ways they conflict. Like when the cop who \\"cannot discuss an open investigation\\" with an investigative journalist (editorial cartoonist, originally) says \\"So I can't tell you to go see so-and-so in Vallejo.\\"<br /><br />According to the movie, the cartoonist turned investigator lost his wife over his obsession with this case, and her fear that he was making himself a target for a killer. The reporter who got fired for drinking after he was threatened personally by Zodiac was the cartoonist's friend, and he eventually went completely down the tubes.<br /><br />The police did investigate the man who eventually turned out to be the Zodiac, interviewed him, searched his trailer and found some pretty good circumstantial evidence. But the handwriting expert cleared him, so they dropped him from their list of suspects, although at least one police investigator continued to consider him their best suspect. How the cartoonist eventually found the evidence that convinced him and the top cop on the investigation (after he was removed from the case) is the most fascinating part of the story. But still, it was circumstantial evidence, and the fact that one handwriting expert had cleared him stood in their way. Another said not to rule him out on the basis of handwriting analysis.<br /><br />Did you know the crime was never officially solved? It's pretty clear who did it, yes, but the evidence was not gathered that could officially charge him with it, and he died before he could be prosecuted.<br /><br />I was completely absorbed in this story, and recommend it to anyone who likes crime and detective storiesd him stood in their way.

B005P3NPXG|5.0|Seal has really found his strength in singing these classic R&B soul songs. I bought Soul 1 last year and just love it so much. I am overwhelmed with how ridiculously good Soul 2 is. It starts with \\"I'm Wishing On a Star\\",and as soon as you hear this song with Seal's smooth voice, you just stop in your tracks. It is so beautifully done. I love this CD so much I have now bought copies for two friends, and now I'm buying one to send to my sister. If you're wondering whether you should buy this CD, the answer is a big YES!!! I can't wait for Soul 3. Enjoy.
B0000AUHPK|3.0|I tried to read this book when I was very young, and again when I was in college, and got lost in the style of language, in the confusion of names, and in the fact that I was really not yet experienced in reading for the pleasure, rather than for the book report. As I recall, I got a B on the book report because of Cliff Notes.<br /><br />Now that I've seen this movie, I will be giving the book another attempt. [Update:  Third time's the charm, as they say.]  Now I have faces to go with the names. Now I can keep the two Cathies separate. But there's one more thing: now I can put aside the adolescent question of who I am supposed to like, and who dislike. Because you can't watch this movie or read the book without deciding that the story does not depend on your liking for any of the characters. This is just as well, because they are all pretty flawed.<br /><br />Heathcliff is introduced to Cathy's family as the starving urchin her father found orphaned in Liverpool. He is to be adopted and treated as a brother. Cathy does her best to treat him like a brother at first, but the fact that he is not genetically her brother begins to matter as they grow older. Then her father dies, and her brother, who hated Heathcliff from the day he was brought home, inherits Wuthering Heights. He turns Heathcliff into a stable hand and humiliates him. Cathy's brother is an SOB, you see.<br /><br />But there are SOBs enough for everyone in this story. And there are others who are not malicious, but only weak. Fatally weak. And there are selfish women and devious power trips, and lies, theft, all sorts of evils.<br /><br />And there is a passion which may or may not deserve the term love.<br /><br />A very disturbing story, but very well told.
B00786XVOG|4.0|I was at the concert and it was spectacular. In the DVD are not all scenes. When the concert started a cruise ship was leaving the bay, and with the music of Yanni and the play of light it was magical. Those scenes were missing from the DVD.
B00004VVNB|3.0|Michael York sure was sexy in 1976!!! I'm not sure how I managed to miss this one when it was in the theaters, but that's part of what a DVD is for, isn't it?<br /><br />I read the story many long years ago, but remembered little enough of it, and of course they always change things. Anyway, it is the Year of the City 2274 and Logan is a Sandman. That's a terminator for the people who get past their 30th birthday without submitting to Carousel, the hype being that people are given a chance to be renewed, but neither Logan nor his friend has ever seen it happen or known anyone who was renewed.<br /><br />One day, Logan meets Jessica, a girl who wears an ankh as a necklace charm, under odd circumstances. The next day he terminates a runner who has one in his pocket when he is killed. When Logan turns in the ankh along with the other personal effects he took off the runner, he is given the assignment to pretend to run in order to find Sanctuary, to which the ankh is the key. His life clock (a crystal set into the hand at birth) is reset from 26, his real age, to 30, and time for Last Day and the Carousel. Instead, Logan runs. He takes Jessica with him as his guide to the people who know about Sanctuary.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will say that Logan and Jessica find the only old man in the world, played to perfection by Peter Ustinov. I kept thinking of my good buddy Richard every time I looked at him. [OK, Richard's not really THAT old, but ]<br /><br />It's not only an interesting science fiction concept, but a grand adventure. You may get a little tired of the people who are all slim and elegant and beautiful -- and under 30 -- and wear similar clothing which is apparently color-coded to their position. Farrah Fawcett-Majors is type-cast as a bimbo, for your amusement.<br /><br />It's a fun movie, partly because you can't tell for the longest time whether Logan is running because he was given the assignment or because he really is running for his own sake. So who am I to spoil that?his own sake. So who am I to spoil that?
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|THEY FIXED THE GLITCHES!!!!  NOW IT CAN BE DEEMED THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I am a grown 30 yr old and brought this for my 7 nd 5 yr old, but I play it more then them and am mad when they mess my town up! lol
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Brilliant! I challenge you to watch this movie just once, all the way through, not stopping and backing up to check out details, and figure out all the ways in which the illusions were created. I'm going to have to watch it another couple of times myself.<br /><br />Quite apart from the absolutely brilliant plot, the actors and actresses, the costumes, the settings, all are just wonderful.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays illusionist Eisenheim, and Jessica Biel plays the aristocratic young Sofia, whom he had loved as a child. But she was a titled lady, and he was the son of a cabinet-maker who made furniture for her family. They were forcibly separated, but not before he gave her a locket which opened in a secret way to reveal a picture of him. Keep your eye on that locket.<br /><br />The Crown Prince comes to one of Eisenheim's performances, and when the illusionist calls for a volunteer who \\"is not afraid of death,\\" the prince volunteers Sofia. She recognizes Eisenheim as the young man she once loved, but does not reveal this to the audience. He asks \\"Have we ever met?\\" as part of the act, and she says no. Then he does his illusion of standing her in front of a mirror, the image in the mirror is murdered, but she is OK. Great show!<br /><br />Sofia is supposed to marry Crown Prince Leopold, whom she does not love. But Leopold has revealed some of his darkest secrets to her, so if she will not marry him, she must die.<br /><br />From there, I refuse to give away anything. You will have too much fun working it out. Now I think I'll go watch it again and see if I can add it all up.

B000P0J0A6|4.0|I saw this movie when it was in the theaters, but I had not remembered just how funny it was until I got the DVD. I was laughing so hard at the bar-room scene I couldn't catch my breath!<br /><br />A rather incompetent inventor goes into a curiosity shop in Chinatown looking for a Christmas gift for his teenage son. He comes across an odd little creature, as adorable as a teddy bear, called a Mogwai. He wants to buy it, but the old man who runs the shop says it's not for sale. The old man's grandson, however, says they need the money, and he brings it out to sell in the alley. Along with the Mogwai comes three rules for taking care of him: (1) he does not like bright lights; (2) don't get him wet, and (3) most important, never, ever feed him after midnight.<br /><br />Of course, all three rules are eventually broken, and the results are scaly green gremlins that run riot all over town. As I say, the bar-room scene is quite hilarious. A large group of them are cornered in the movie theater (where some more great visual jokes are done), but Stripe, the leader of the gang, gets into the department store across the street.<br /><br />The cute little Mogwai, named Gizmo, eventually triumphs, but how he does is the funniest movie you'll see in many a year.

B000HWZ4CA|2.0|OK, this movie is propaganda, plain and simple. Note the year, 1941. Some people wanted to intervene in the war in Europe, but a great many did not. The official policy of the US government was non-intervention. So Gary Cooper makes a movie about the biggest hero of World War I. Not coincidence. Congress didn't think it was coincidence, either, and after only one week in the theaters it was withdrawn until after Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Anyway, it's an odd movie in a lot of ways. York is from the hill country of Tennessee, and it would have been all too easy to play him as a caricature, and his family and neighbors as corny stereotypes. Somehow, this movie managed to avoid that. The accents and speech patterns strike me as quite authentic. And while there's no denying that York and his neighbors have had very little experience with the world, he has one thing the army needs very much: he's one heck of a straight shooter. On the firing range for the first time, he is disappointed because he only hit the lower (4 o'clock) position of the bulls-eye, not dead center. The next five shots were grouped around the center so tightly you can barely tell them apart.<br /><br />One thing that may disturb today's audiences is the extent to which York's conservative Christian religion is a part of the story. He was a hell-raiser at first, then was converted by a lightning bolt to his gun (which the special feature biographical info admits was fiction) when riding home in a thunder storm. He takes a strict interpretation of \\"thou shalt not kill\\" and so applies for conscientious objector status. He is turned down because the little church he attends is not part of a well-established denomination, and there is no explicitly pacifist doctrine of the church. It is simply York's private interpretation.<br /><br />His commanding officer gives him a book of American history and a ten-day furlough, and when he comes back, he is willing to fight. In time, he is sent to France, where he kills a large number of Germans and captures 132 of them, effectively single-handedly, although seven other soldiers who survived from his unit helped him herd them back to the camp.<br /><br />The movie has real historical significance, and it is comparatively well done. But frankly, if it were not for that, and for Gary Cooper in the title role, it would not interest me very muchls a large number of Germans and captures 132 of them, effectively single-handedly, although seven other soldiers who survived from his unit helped him herd them back to the camp.<br /><br />The movie has real historical significance, and it is comparatively well done.

0307592731|5.0|The author, 26 at the time of the hike, is still lost four years after the premature death of her mother. After failing to keep her siblings and step-father together, failing her marriage, and dangerously dabbling in drugs and promiscuous sex, Cheryl whimsically decides to backpack the 1100-mile Pacific Crest Trail. Inexperienced as a long-distance hiker, she sets out, BY HERSELF. Her account of her unusual childhood, uncanny mother and her naiveté of the rigors of backpacking, BY HERSELF, made me cry, read with fear for her life, and laugh until tears streamed down my face. Simply reading her book inspired me to go for long walks, yes, BY MYSELF, but around my neighborhood, not in the wild. The book succeeds on many levels, with fierce honesty, raw feeling and insight that can only be achieved by walking the walk. Please do not try this unless you've trained for such an endeavor. She was lucky she lived to write about it.[[ASIN:0307592731 Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail]]
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is a movie that needed to be made. It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.<br /><br />It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on \\"fishing trips\\" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.<br /><br />Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word \\"gay\\" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.<br /><br />So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.<br /><br />OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch.

B00003CX9E|4.0|This is a 2-disc special edition, and I'm thinking maybe the special \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" is almost as interesting as the original movie. The point is made that this movie constituted a battle between two enormous egos, two enormously successful men: William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles. Hearst was old by that time, and Welles was young. Hearst's empire you know about. Welles had been amazingly successful in radio and producing plays in New York. He was signed to an unprecedented contract with RKO when he came to Hollywood in 1939. The script of \\"Kane\\" was leaked to Hearst, and a huge battle ensued. Interestingly, he was not nearly so upset about the film's portrayal of himself as of his second wife -- that is, Kane's second wife; I'm not sure Hearst ever married the woman he lived with who was represented by Kane's second wife. Hearst managed to have RKO stop distribution of the film, so it did not become known outside of art-film theaters and college film-making courses until much later.<br /><br />The story opens with the death of Kane, and everything from there on is about reporters attempting to follow up on the mystery behind Kane's last word: \\"Rosebud.\\" So there are interviews with the people who were important in Kane's life, and then flashbacks as they tell their stories. It's an effective way to tell a story which may have been original with this film. We are talking about a film released in 1941, after all. In fact, I think many things were either original to this film or developed into now-classic movie techniques by the film. For example, Kane gazes on a picture of the \\"best of the best\\" in his rival newspaper, which then morphs into a live grouping of the same men as they are being photographed upon their coming to work for Kane. Kane (Welles was a young and quite handsome man at the time) smiles and jokes charmingly over the fact that it took him six years to get what he wanted.<br /><br />Another interesting technique is a series of identically staged scenes that come immediately after one close associate comments that Kane's first wife probably rarely saw him except at breakfast. They both get older and fatter, their clothes become more expensive and elaborate, the opulent conditions in which they have their breakfast are more and more opulent, and she becomes more and more nagging and shrill. So we know it's over time, and the strong impression is that she grew increasingly bitchy and he grew increasingly tired of her. Very effective story-telling for what probably only lasts two minutes.<br /><br />There were enough differences between Hearst's life and Kane's that if he had wanted to, Welles could have fallen back on the old \\"it's only fiction\\" line in his battle with Hearst. But both were way too egotistical to allow any compromise. As the movie progresses, you can't help wondering who can be said to have won the battle in the long run.<br /><br />I'm going along with the critics who have said this is one of the best films ever made, but a bit too serious and demanding of its audience to ever be one of the most popular.ntically staged scenes that come immediately after one close associate comments that Kane's first wife probably rarely saw him except at breakfast.

B00772M1F6|5.0|So, I went home, found the download on Amazon and purchased it.  From the NPR interview, McPherson was originally a punker from the mid west.  Someone gave him a double disc set of a Buddy Holly compilation and that 'scratched an itch' for him, and why not?  The original theory behind punk is that it gets back to the roots of rock n' roll, before it was 'polished'.  Back to the Days of Little Richard, The Fat Man or Little Milton!  Check out the double disc Sun sessions of Elvis and you've got an idea of what this is all about!  This is that good! McPherson even went to the extent of using microphones from the 50's and 60's and recording on a standard professional studio tape machine from the 60's.  Yes, analog! If you like the Black Keys, you will really love this one.  There are a couple of sleepers on the disc, but they are worth hearing again, and again, because they will grow on you.  I hope he comes here to Reno, because i understand he puts on a really good live show! Maybe the next album will actually be available on vinyl!
B00003CXD5|3.0|This movie is the same age as I am! This is the one with the famous line about \\"We don't need no stinking badges.\\" This has often been called Humphrey Bogart's finest performance, but then there's Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon to consider. The man certainly had talent, didn't he?<br /><br />Bogie and another American drifter find themselves with no jobs or money in a small Mexican town. They stay at a cheap flophouse, where they listen to the stories of an old prospector, who says that gold prospecting is mostly dangerous for the way gold changes a man, changes his soul.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, the rest of the movie proves he is right. The three of them put together enough for burros and supplies (I'll let how they came up with the money be told in the movie), and head for the hills. The old prospector knows what he's talking about, and is also sturdier than Bogie and the other young man put together. Saying that they do find gold is not giving away much of the story. The story is really about what happens after they find it. There's a cave-in where Bogie would have been buried alive if the other young man [I never remember character's names once the movie is over] hadn't dragged him out. Bandits attack them (there's that famous line about badges), a nearby village has a boy who was nearly drowned and apparently in a coma, and the old prospector saves the boy's life. The village wants to make him their guest, so the two young men take the burros laden with gold and head for Durango, where the old man will meet up with them.<br /><br />Sure.<br /><br />No, I'm not going to tell you what happens next, except that Bogie gets better looking as his beard grows in, and he gives one remarkable performance. I may in fact prefer Casablanca, but it really is a close call. However, since the story is held together by Bogie and the crusty old man, there are times when it drags a bit, and even times when the banditos and federales seem just a bit too stereotypical. So even though this really is a classic, I can only give it three starseven though this really is a classic, I can only give it three stars

B000M341QE|1.0|You can tell this is a 21st century movie: everyone curses constantly, mostly with the f word and variations. Everyone has a really, really foul mouth. Also, there's lots of blood. Not a movie you want to let your kids see.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are two state police officers. One was actually planted in the police by a gangster (Jack Nicholson). The other goes undercover and goes to work for Nicholson. So they are both working for the police (one honestly, one not), and both working for Nicholson (one honestly, one not). They end up sharing a girlfriend, too.<br /><br />Nobody knows who is lying (they all are), nobody knows who is loyal to whom or what, and frankly, it's hard to care. I think it is entirely possible this whole thing was done to display the various uses of a cell phone to cops and criminals. Cell phones everywhere. Cell phones and guns.<br /><br />I give this one star, just for letting me look at two handsome young hunks, and because Jack Nicholson does a bad guy so well. Otherwise, it would be no stars at all.

B000022TSW|4.0|This is a very, very funny movie. I've avoided South Park mostly because I have avoided television, and also because I really don't like to hear kids use dirty language. But this movie has cured me! I'm not anything like Cartman's Mom!!!<br /><br />The kids sneak into an R-rated movie by two potty-mouthed Canadian comedians, and when they emerge, they are all talking extremely dirty. Creatively dirty, though. However, they don't seem to be able to talk at all without using the F word or the S word or the Q word (????). Cartman's mom decides to blame it on the Canadians, and the next thing you know, we're in a war with Canada.<br /><br />Kenny does indeed get killed, but his death is so complicated it's not easy to say who \\"they\\" are in the line, \\"Oh, No; they killed Kenny.\\" My own vote goes to the supremely incompetent surgeons who accidentally replace his heart with a baked potato. But you could also blame the Canadian comedians for showing a scene where one of them ignites his fart. Kenny tries it, and sets himself on fire. That's how he ended up in the incompetent surgeons' hands.<br /><br />He drifts toward heaven, where voluptuous females await, but then he is denied admission and sent to hell. There he finds Saddam Hussein in a rather dysfunctional gay relationship with Satan.<br /><br />It's just too funny to spoil by telling you all about it, but watch it more than once, because there are all sorts of quick little sight jokes and word plays and just all sorts of things to make a grown-up laugh. Wait until you see what they have instead of the bubble that held Glinda the Good Witch in Oz!!!<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it for anyone too young, but by 16 they certainly ought to know enough not to be contaminated.<br /><br />Tell me: can ANYONE understand what Kenny says? I sure can't!

B000053VAF|5.0|As it says in \\"My Sunday Dogma Missal\\" which accompanies this DVD, \\"I'm banking on the fact that God has a great sense of humor.\\" Cited as evidence is the platypus.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary, even a supernaturally funny movie. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are two fallen angels, Bartleby and Loki, who have discovered a loophole in God's law that will allow them to get back into heaven. However, the Voice of God (Alan Rickman; you know, Snape?) says if they make it, all existence will end. Something about God having been proved wrong, or something. Such a contradiction would bring down the whole works.<br /><br />So the Voice of God appears to the Last Scion (I'll let him explain that) and convinces her she's got to go to New Jersey and stop Bartleby and Loki from getting a plenary indulgence by entering a newly rededicated church run by the trendy new age bishop played by George Carlin. Along the way, she meets more crazy divine characters than you or I could imagine. But Kevin Smith, who wrote and directed the film, has way more imagination than you and I put together. It's good he does, too, because he's mixed together some of the most incredible twists and turns on a plot that, amazingly, makes a certain amount of sense.<br /><br />It is to laugh, of course, but it is also really about God and religion. And so you might find yourself believing this alternate reality is more rational than the one we are currently living in.<br /><br />Five stars. Really. Earned every one.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really have enjoyed the game but have started over due to the timers getting bugged and having them set at 250:00 before they can be collected from. Not good. I want to buy coins for the game but wont do that because it would be a waste of money if my timers screw up again. :(
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|Matt Damon is back as the highly trained assassin Jason Bourne. He tried to retire, he really did, but when his dear Marie gets killed as a result of a breathtaking chase through the streets of an Indian town, he is back to trying to find out what he had done in the past, and for whom. He finds out.<br /><br />A neat twist is that the supervisor in charge of the project of \\"resolving\\" Jason Bourne is a woman, one of those super-bitches who walk all over everyone to prove she's at least as tough as any man. Yeah, right. However, it does make it all the easier to root for Bourne to show her up. He does, of course. The scene I liked most was when he called her to tell her his terms for coming in out of the cold. He said to send Nicki, the operative who had run things in Paris. She says, \\"Suppose I can't find Nicki?\\" \\"You shouldn't have any trouble,\\" he counters from his perch on the next building, \\"She's standing right next to you.\\" The way the blond bitch suddenly turns to the window, genuine shock registering on her face, is terrific. Imagine a big-time CIA boss who stands in front of open windows!<br /><br />The pace is unrelenting. Seldom is there a scene that runs in human real-time, allowing the audience to know what the heck is going on. An amazing fight scene between Bourne and another of these highly specialized killers is extended to the point where frankly, it is pretty literally unbelievable. No one could survive and keep fighting the way these two do.<br /><br />So who do each of these people work for, and what are they up to? I suppose the point is that in CIA operations, you don't always know. But it's a little too much for me. Again, one of those you are going to have to play more than once to figure out what it is all about.<br /><br />If you love amazing chases and fights, if you want your action pretty literally non-stop, then this is the movie for you. Not for me.

B000063UR1|4.0|First of all, I have always liked Bruce Dern. His quirky voice, his not-quite-handsome face, his awkward ways, seem to bring out the nurturing mother in me. Since the only human character in some two-thirds of the film is Freeman Lowell played by Dern, I am set up to enjoy this movie. Also, there are two lovable droids, Huey and Dewey (Louie was careless and was destroyed), and I've got a soft spot in my heart for droids. In fact, it was Huey and Dewey who set me up to love R2D2.<br /><br />Anyway, Freeman Lowell is the ecologist on a space ship called Valley Forge (I lived within a few miles of Valley Forge National Park as a child) which carries six huge geodesic domes with six different ecological environments in them. Problem is, this is all that's left of earth ecology, because the surface of the planet has been completely paved over with man-made things. When the Valley Forge receives an order to nuke the domes and come back to earth to be refitted for cargo, Lowell's three astronaut co-workers consider it a fun thing for fireworks and they are eager to get home.<br /><br />Lowell goes into the temperate forest dome to plant some new seedlings as the other domes are first rocketed a safe distance from the ship and blown up. No mushroom cloud in zero gravity, but a sudden flash, an expanding ball of light, and then nothing. Finally, as the fourth dome is blown up, Lowell goes nuts and kills one of the other astronauts (in self defense, however), and then pushes the other two into the dome they are about to detach and explode. So it detaches and explodes with them in it.<br /><br />So Lowell is alone with one dome remaining, running the ship entirely alone with the three droids. Two, after Louie gets careless.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch how he gets away with the ship, how he reprograms the droids to assist him (and to play poker!), and what happens when he is eventually found by a \\"rescue ship.\\"<br /><br />I like this movie, partly because of Bruce Dern, because I love science fiction, and because it is one of the first to have an explicit ecology theme. I will unhesitatingly give it four stars.rn, because I love science fiction, and because it is one of the first to have an explicit ecology theme. I will unhesitatingly give it four stars.

B000059HB7|4.0|John Wayne is the sheriff, Dean Martin the former deputy whose been on a two-year drunk due to having his heart broken by a woman who just came in on the stage one day, and then left. So far this is one of Wayne's other movies, but this was the first one: El Dorado, with Robert Mitchum as the reforming drunk, was 1967. And this premise is as much as the two films have in common, so we can forgive The Duke the repetition, I think.<br /><br />Anyway, Ricky Nelson is a hired gun who gets involved, and so with Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in the same movie, of course we have to have a couple of songs. They do a nice job of it. Walter Brennan sings the chorus with them on the second one.<br /><br />Walter Brennan is the other deputy. Angie Dickinson provides the romantic interest. So it's a star-studded cast for what is basically a pretty typical Wayne Western. But it's a good one. There's humor and drama and action and a little of that hard guy western philosophy which works pretty well in this one. Ricky Nelson did a surprisingly good job for a young man who was basically brought up on his parents' TV show, getting by mostly on his good looks. He sure did have those good looks, folks! I was 11 years old when this movie was new, and while I don't remember seeing the movie before, I had the hots for Ricky Nelson big time when I was 11.<br /><br />It does what a Wayne western is supposed to do, entertain.

B0009X766Y|5.0|I want to issue a warning: if you have never seen this movie before and you by the two-disc DVD set, do NOT watch the second disc first! It's way too much of a spoiler.<br /><br />Having said that, I promise I won't spoil it. I remember now how very much I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater, and I still enjoy it even though I know about the ending, but I would not spoil your fun for anything. This is a genuine classic of film-making, a gem in your DVD collection. It also won seven Academy Awards, so I'm not the only one who loves it by any means.<br /><br />Paul Newman and Robert Redford play two con men who team up after Robert Shaw, as a slick New York mobster, killed Redford's former partner. His old partner recommended he look up Newman when he told him he was quitting -- just before he got killed.<br /><br />So Redford goes to look up Newman, and finds him sleeping off a drunk in the back of a merry-go-round place which has a whore house and gambling den upstairs. They plan a Big Sting on Shaw, involving several favorite character actors in the plan. The one thing that always amazed me about the big sting was how many people were involved, when the take was \\"only\\" half a million dollars. However, I suppose it's quite possible that in the 1930s, that was enough. Also, many of them were also looking for revenge for the death of Redford's former partner, whom most of them knew and liked.<br /><br />As I say, I won't spoil it by telling you about the sting, or what went right and what went wrong, because it's too much fun to watch it unfold. But I will suggest that once you've seen it through, go back and play it again, and see how many clues to the various sub-plots you missed while enjoying the excitement. There are quite a few: the director is conning the audience almost as much as Redford and Newman are conning Shaw. Works, too!
B0081KTI0E|4.0|The Woman in Black is a pretty traditional haunted house story that focuses on atmosphere and the lingering feeling of dread instead of CGI gore and horror. If you've read the book, you'll be familiar with the unsettling nature of the story - a general sense that translated well to the stage play and here to the film. The filming locations capture the remoteness of a house cut off by tide and tragedy and the general production design makes great use of a set to spring some fairly major jumps.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe is well cast in bringing an innocence to a pretty dire situation where children keep dying every time the woman in black shows up, and he's clearly going to keep going beyond Harry Potter. The rest of the cast do well to portray the town that doesn't want Radcliffe there too. All of the tension and surprises rise from the situation and some clever camera shots and even the most hardened horror fan should get quite a few scares.<br /><br />It's all a fairly solid production until the ending. Susan Hill's book transcended the genre with the end of her story (which has since been copied many times) but this movie doesn't stay faithful to the original material in an attempt to spare the audience the downer. Considering the whole tale is about multiple violent child deaths, I think the filmmakers underestimated the audience here.
B000HEWEJO|4.0|OK, we've all seen this movie dozens of times. But one great advantage of DVDs is that you get the special features to tell you about the movie. Do you know WHY you have seen it so often? Because due to a clerical error, the copyright was not renewed when it came up for renewal, and it was in the public domain. So TV stations could play it as often as they liked without having to pay a royalty. So they played it a lot, especially around Christmas. It became an American tradition. Once VCRs were invented, and then DVDs, people could have it in their homes whenever they wanted.<br /><br />Oh, yes, it's a unique movie, and very good in a lot of ways, but did you know that it was not a box office hit? It only became a big hit after it went into the public domain. So you love it in part because you associate it with Christmas traditions, and childhood and being happy.<br /><br />Certainly it's a wonderful life if you are George Bailey, but not many of us are. And Clarence's inscription in the book he leaves for George thanking him for his wings says no man is a failure as long as he had friends. But how many of us have a whole town (less the crabby old skinflint and his minions) to be our friends?<br /><br />Maybe I'm just being terribly cynical, but I'm not George Bailey, doing things to help people, being the reason they are able to buy a home, saving lives through quick thinking and action, like the little kid who would have been poisoned or his brother, who would have drowned.<br /><br />Clarence gave George a unique opportunity when he showed him what Bedford Falls would have been like if he had never been born. Wonder what would be different in this world if I had not been born. And maybe that was Frank Capra's point: not that we are all as lucky as George Bailey, but that we have all had an impact, small or large. For good or ill, the world really would be a different place if any one of us had never existed. I hope I am not flattering myself when I say that on the whole, the world is better off for having me in it. What about you?<br /><br />I will give this four stars out of sheer sentiment.e whole, the world is better off for having me in it.

B00005K3NR|4.0|This is still one of the creepiest, scariest movies I've ever seen. Which is what's so good about it, of course.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek is creepy as Carrie, and Piper Laurie is twice as creepy as her fundie crazed mother. Is it any wonder we who saw this movie in our formative years have a deep-seated fear of fundamentalists? Or, for that matter, why others of us have a huge fear of witches.<br /><br />Most of you probably know the story. It starts with Carrie freaking out when she gets her period for the first time in the shower at gym class, and all the other girls make fun of her, throwing tampons and sanitary pads at her and shouting \\"Plug it up!\\" The gym teacher feels sorry for Carrie when she realizes that nobody had ever told her about menstruation. Carrie asks her mother why she didn't tell her, and she starts going on about how if she had never sinned, she would not have gotten it. (Frankly, getting it for the first time as a senior in high school could only happen to someone as undernourished as Sissy Spacek anyway.) Her mother's solution is to lock her in her prayer closet, complete with a truly spooky crucifix that has hair like her mother, white staring eyes, and a lot of spikes stuck all over his body.<br /><br />But Carrie has a special gift. She can move things with her mind. She was excused from gym class for a week due to the shower room incident, and spends the time in the library researching psychic phenomena. She learns that what she has is telekinesis.<br /><br />One of the popular girls at school feels sorry for her, and persuades her very cute boyfriend to ask Carrie to the senior prom. When her mother insists she cannot go, Carrie enforces her will with telekinesis. That's when mother quotes the line \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\" after Carrie is out of the house.<br /><br />John Travolta kills a pig to get a bucket of blood, at the instigation of his bitchy girl friend, the one who has vowed vengeance on Carrie and the gym teacher because she got a week's detention, walked out on it, and in consequence was banned from the prom. They perch the bucket of blood above the center of the stage, right where the King and Queen of the prom will stand. They also instigated a cheat to guarantee that Carrie and her date are chosen King and Queen.

B007549W62|1.0|Being fairly liberal on reviews, I usually take films that are not well-known and often find gems amongst the rough. Not so with THE DIVIDE. I was pleasantly surprised to see Michael Biehn (TERMINATOR) in one of the prime roles and thought that might nudge this film up a notch on my enjoyment meter. Again, not so.<br /><br />I also sincerely love post-apocalyptic films. How much so, you may ask? TANK GIRL is one of the films I enjoy. As is ZOMBIELAND, MAD MAX, and LOGAN'S RUN. Yup. I'm seriously into  them. So I sat down with this film hoping I might add it to my \\"Dead Earth\\" series (as I like to call them).<br /><br />But ...the main thing that makes these other films \\"work\\" where THE DIVIDE failed was sympathetic characters, a decent script, and an ending that actually was an ending (or at least made some sense). THE DIVIDE just seems to end with no resolution. No understanding of what actually happened to the world above (which the characters in this movie venture out into and find themselves a part of some sort of post nuclear holocaust experiment).<br /><br />I get that the producers/writers/directors were trying to show these people in a pressure cooker element (people of differing personalities and behaviors stuck in a basement together until they burst at their mental seams). But give us some empathy ...somewhere. When people started dying/killing off, I could've cared less. I was hoping they'd all die quickly so the movie would be over sooner. Seriously? Who cares if they were angry with this person or that person? I never knew any motivation behind anything anyone did. Why SHOULD I care?<br /><br />My assumption is that this was a \\"straight-to-DVD\\" production. And rightfully so.<br /><br />Now it's straight into the trash bin for this one.
B000NA28I4|3.0|I liked it more than I expected to. People keep comparing it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, and I didn't find it quite as good as either of those, but I had read the book, and decided I should see what they did with the movie, since I could get it at a bargain price.<br /><br />The special effects, especially Saphira the dragon, are very good. I liked her best when she was a baby, though. In fact, she reminded me of both the Mogwai and of the baby dragon Rubeus Hagrid hatched out. There's something about baby animals, no matter how fantastical they are. Ed Speleers did a good job as Eragon, but I thought he and his cousin looked a little too much alike: hard to tell them apart when they were fighting.<br /><br />The villains were a little too unbelievably villainous, but I suppose that's the way they are in a fantasy; the heroes extremely heroic, the villains extremely villainous. It just seemed a little too much like a story made for children, or at least adolescents, and I suspect that's the simple truth. Besides, I'm not much on battle scenes.<br /><br />I want to give it four stars, because there was much to like about it, but I have to say that in comparison with others I've given four stars to, this one only merits three. It's good, but it's not great.

B000P0J0AQ|3.0|Curioser and curioser. At one point, Morpheus offers Neo two pills: one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small . . . and Neo chooses the one which Morpheus says will show him how far down the rabbit hole goes.<br /><br />Somebody (maybe everybody) has considerable experience with psychoactive drugs here. Sorting out which is \\"reality\\" and which is the matrix (that is, an artificial program to keep humans in line) is just a hang-up for the audience. The characters seem to realize that, as Robin Williams pointed out, reality is just a concept.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking of the movie \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\" which I may review next. I've got it here, and it seems fitting.<br /><br />It is extremely difficult to describe this movie. It is clearly done mostly with computers, but then that is the point of the story itself, so it has a looking-glass aspect. And in fact, there is much of Lewis Carroll in this movie, along with some taste of kung fu and anime. The matrix program characters are apparently Japanese and run in columns instead of rows. But mostly what there is is LSD, mescaline and peyote. I've had enough experience to recognize it when I see it.<br /><br />Anyway, hacker Neo gets caught up in a group of rebels from the Matrix. He thought he was in 1999, but that was the Matrix; the \\"real world\\" is in \\"something like\\" 2199; they are not sure of the date. Morpheus believes Neo is \\"The One,\\" the person they have been looking for all their lives who can destroy the power of the Matrix.<br /><br />I think if I watch it another dozen times, I may come to understand it somewhat. Then again, maybe not. I give it three stars, just because I'm really not fond of kung fu movies.

B000HWZ4A2|3.0|Gary Cooper plays Howard Roark, an architect who does not compromise. He is an individualist, and since this is Ayn Rand's book, an objectivist. The whole thing would work a little better for me if I liked his designs, but they represented radical modernism in 1948, which was the point of the story. I just don't happen to like the sleek modernist buildings most of the time.<br /><br />Anyway, the point is not whether or not the audience likes his designs. We are to understand that his designs are original, completely original, and that he will not compromise them. And in fact, the compromises offered are sufficiently horrible to make the point. A man of genius knows that a building, or a sculpture or a book or whatever, must have its own internal integrity; it must function as a whole, not a conglomeration of disassociated parts. At one point his proposed sleek modern building (model) is given a Greek temple face toward the street, while the rest of the building remains a large block. It's thoroughly disgusting, and he will have none of it.<br /><br />So rather than compromise, he goes to work in a stone quarry in New England, where a wealthy and sophisticated young woman played by Patricia Neal (who had a off-screen love affair with Cooper as well as the on-screen one) notices him and makes a play for him. Finally, he is called away to design a building the way he wants to, and at the grand opening of the building, she shows up. She is introduced to Roark, and we discover that she never even learned the name of the stone cutter she seduced.<br /><br />For reasons that are too complicated to spell out here, she marries her former boss, an older man played by Raymond Massey. Massey asks Roark to design his home, saying it is to be a temple to his beloved wife. (Remember, Roark loves her too.) Roark goes from one success to another, but there's a snag.<br /><br />An old school friend, a third-rate architect who admits he never did anything original and copied from Roark all the time, asks him to take over the designing of a housing project which is supposed to be for low-cost housing. Roark stipulates that he will design it and let the third-rate guy take the credit and the fees, but only if it is built exactly the way he designs it, with no alteration at all. His old friend agrees, Roark designs it, then goes on vacation while it is built. Predictably, the wimpy third-rate architect gives in to the demands that it be modified, and the results are truly horrible. The thing looks like what it is: a design made by a committee. No unity, no grace, and just plain ugly. Even someone who doesn't much care for modern architecture can see at once it is an abomination.<br /><br />So Roark blows it up. The crowning of the movie is his speech to the jury at his trial for the crime. It is brilliant, and pure Rand.rk all the time, asks him to take over the designing of a housing project which is supposed to be for low-cost housing.

B00009NHC5|4.0|Audrey Hepburn is brilliant as the recently blinded housewife, Susie, who is home alone when Alan Arkin comes to call. He believes she has a doll which is full of heroin. The title suggests the theme: she may be at something of a disadvantage now, but wait until dark.<br /><br />The bad guys -- Alan Arkin is the crazy one, but Richard Crenna and Jack Weston are his unenthusiastic confederates -- create an elaborate charade to try to convince Susie that her husband is a murderer, and she must give them the doll as the only piece of evidence that connects him to the murder.<br /><br />Susie's smarter than the three of them put together. She has a useful ally in the little girl who lives upstairs and does errands for her, but between the two of them, they brilliantly uncover the lies and vanquish the bad guys.<br /><br />No, I'm not going to spoil it by telling you how. It's a four-star movie.
B0026OR2XQ|5.0|The kernel version covered by the book is a little bit old, but the main idea about developing device drivers for linux is there and it is a very good book.<br />You can find it for free in pdf or you can buy it in kindle/paper version!<br />Worth every penny.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|OK, we know Matt Damon knows how to play a spy: dead-pan, giving nothing away on his face. But this one is without all the judo and guns. This is a spy who does it all with thinking. Does not make for a very big action-type story, but it is interesting.<br /><br />Edward Wilson is a member of Skull & Bones, and we get some inside information on what that's like -- assuming it's accurate, which how would I know? Let's just say that what I do know of secret societies in general, it seems authentic. So that's the first thing that puts him in line, on the insiders' network for espionage work during WWII, in the OSS. Once the war is over and they realize they are going to need spies in the face-off with the Soviets, he is recruited for a major role (apparently number three man) in the CIA.<br /><br />After that, the plot gets very, very complicated. He learned early on that there is no one he can trust, and that becomes more and more true the longer he is involved. Unfortunately, his son grows up to want to be a CIA man, too. And that is really why the plot is so darn complicated.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you. I can't anyway; I didn't understand half of what went on. I will need to see it another couple of times to figure it all out. But I wonder if I will bother. Frankly, it was disappointing.
0345803485|4.0|I have just begun reading Fifty Shades of Grey on my Kindle.  I have to admit, when I saw the skit on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" that referred to the book, I was intrigued.  A book has to be extremely good or abysmally bad to get recognition on a contemporary comedy like SNL.<br /><br />So far, the book is definitely NOT funny. I was beginning to find Anastasia's character pure cardboard, at least until the sex part started.  I was surprised by her inexperience, and I can't decide if she gave in too easily or if she was very brave to cross the physical threshold into womanly sexuality. Unfortunately I think it was more the former.  Oh, I believe that there are many 18 thru 30's who have no prior experience - I'm just not sure that I needed to relive my own first time through a girl who didn't give it much consideration before jumping on the helicopter and then into bed! Oh, well...maybe this way of starting your sexual life is more normal these days.<br /><br />So I'll keep reading all three books and I'll let you know what I think when I'm done. It would be a joy to me to find that the next two books are NOT written in first-person (I find that really annoying in this story). I'm quite sure I'll have some observations about the \\"toys\\" and the \\"punishments\\" but honestly, I'd just as soon leave that part out and make it a sweet and angsty love story. Aren't human relationships violent enough already?<br /><br />Yours truly, The Grandma Who Will Read Most Anything
6305181810|4.0|I should start by telling you that lawyers refer to drumming up business as \\"rainmaking.\\" The title has nothing to do with magic or dowsing rods.<br /><br />Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a hot young lawyer with what may be a really big case. But he's up against the suits in a large and respectable firm that represent the insurance company that denied the medical claim of a young man who is now dying as a result. What can he possibly do against such big guns?<br /><br />But Rudy has an ace in the hole in the form of a self-styled \\"paralawyer\\" (the proper term is paralegal, but he considers himself almost a lawyer, no matter how many times he has failed the bar exam) played to perfection by Danny DeVito. Now I worked for insurance defense lawyers for 16 years, and my inclination is to root for them against the ambulance-chasing plaintiffs' attorneys. So with all my prejudices intact, I found myself rooting for Rudy and Deck the paralawyer, in spite of the huge demand in punitive damages. I know punies, as they are called, are normally a negotiating ploy when the plaintiff's attorney has no intention of going to trial. Not here. Rudy has uncovered facts which make the punies fully justified. But how does he get it admitted into evidence past an army of experienced defense attorneys? How will he explain the technical details to a jury of ordinary folk? Pay close attention: it's all worth it.<br /><br />They go to trial, and I guess it's no big surprise that they win. How big they win is the only surprise.

B00005JJX8|3.0|This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most amusing films. It's not humorous throughout, and there is a mystery there, but it is truly a fun film. One historical note: this was the last film Grace Kelly did before she married the handsome Prince Charming . . . er, Rainier.<br /><br />Cary Grant plays John Robie, formerly a jewel thief known as \\"the Cat\\" because he was a cat burglar, climbing around roofs and terraces in dark clothing. There have been some large jewel thefts lately on the French Riviera, and Robie decides he must catch the real thief in order to clear his own name when the press starts assuming it is \\"the Cat\\" back again. Grace Kelly plays a wealthy American beauty (type casting all the way) who decides she's going to catch the thief (figuring it's Robie) by baiting him with her mother's beautiful diamonds. And her beautiful self, playing at seducing him. Predictably, after awhile she's not playing anymore.<br /><br />Jessie Landis is great as the mother who acquired wealth suddenly when oil was discovered on her property not long after she was widowed, and is determined to find a \\"real man\\" for her son-in-law. Naturally, Cary Grant seems the type to her. She comments that it may have been a mistake to send her to that finishing school: they seem to have given her rather too much polish. But she knows nothing about her daughter's motives in playing with Robie.<br /><br />Robie was also active in aiding the French Resistance during the war, and so he knows a lot of people who were also involved in the Resistance. Problem is, they are mad at him because they assume he's gone back to stealing jewels and they are being harassed by the police.<br /><br />Keep your eye on those Resistance fighters. Two of them are not what they seem.<br /><br />There are dozens of Hitchcock-signature plot twists and turns before the real thief is caught and Robie is free to accept Frances' seduction of him.<br /><br />Good fun, pretty scenery, a terrific costume ball, and a nicely complex plot. Not profound, but enjoyable.ely complex plot. Not profound, but enjoyable.
B007SGM084|5.0|Exactly what the title says. I just couldn't put my Kindle down! It's a little shocking at first, but once you get passed that and see the story develop - you get hooked easily. I don't know what to do with myself now that it's over.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I laughed until I thought I'd choke!!! This is one incredibly fun movie. You simply have to see it.<br /><br />Remy can cook. In fact, he's a real gourmet chef. Only one problem: he's a rat. Linguini, on the other hand, cannot cook. In fact, he's probably one of the clumsiest and most incompetent people you've ever seen. But he's a human, and a chef in a fine Paris restaurant has to be human, right? So Remy hides under Linguini's toque (Is that the word? His chef's hat.) and pulls his hair one way or another to direct Linguini's movements.<br /><br />The result is a fine adventure, a lot of unexpected plot twists, some incredible chase scenes, and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I was afraid they had given too much away; there would be no surprises. Boy, was I ever wrong! Remy is not only a great cook, he's completely adorable and a bit of a philosopher. There's one scene where his father tries to convince him that life is basically a war between the humans and the rats, and says \\"that's just the way it is, you can't change it.\\" Remy disagrees. \\"Dad, life IS change!\\" he exclaims. So as he turns to go, and his father asks him where he is going, he says, \\"Hopefully, forward.\\" And he is.<br /><br />I will probably play this movie until I've essentially memorized it. I truly love it. Five stars, no question.

0439023513|3.0|The book is decent. It is not amazing though, and Collins is raking way more money than she should off these books. There are a lot of flaws in this series. I suppose I'll just list the pros and cons.<br /><br />-SPOILERS AHEAD-<br />-I REPEAT, SPOILERS AHEAD-<br />Pros:<br />-The few interesting characters: Peeta, Haymitch, and Finnick.<br />-The ending was exciting and surprising, despite being overly vague.<br />-It gave a realistic and didactic depiction of how terrible war is and how cruel people can be.<br />-The depressing nature of the series did, in fact, touch me, especially near the end of Mockingjay.<br />-Parts of the novel were very well written.<br />-The first book was amazing.<br />-She chooses Peeta (thank God).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The characters: First of all, there are waaay too many characters introduced in this small series of books. Especially the last one. A lot of these characters are basically nothing more than names, although I suppose that makes them easier to kill off in order to build faux suspense. And then a lot of the characters that actually are important aren't developed very well. Didn't anyone else find it odd how Prim would go from acting and talking like an 8 year old to saying things that are incredibly mature? Coin is never developed enough to make her assassination justifiable. Katniss comes off rather whiny. Gale is unlikable. And most others can be described entirely in just a few words.<br />2. The love triangle: Very forced. We barely see Gale in the first two books. By the third book, he and Katniss just come across as two childhood friends who outgrow each other. Peeta has always been the kind, likable one, there to protect Katniss. I'm glad the resolution to the love triangle was just an afterthought at the end of the novels, because I never really bought into it.<br />3. Uninteresting plot/poor pacing: This was a problem in the second book too, where it seems as though nothing happens until Part III of the novel. Katniss really just spends the first 2/3 of the book chilling in District 13 and filming \\"propos.\\" Btw, there really isn't much suspense in the novel as the rebels seem to be easily winning the war and taking over the districts. The only suspense I felt was during Katniss's failed mission to kill President Snow, and even then the suspense was weak in that it revolved majorly around the deaths of meaningless characters and felt rushed and poorly written.<br />4. The final events of the novel: Wtf? Some people claim that Katniss agreed to the last Hunger Games to gain Coin's trust. If this is implied in the book, it is done VERY vaguely, and we would also have to make a BIG assumption that Haymitch was in on it too. Also, I still have no idea why the children were bombed. What I got out of the book was that Coin did it in order to shorten the length of a war she was already bound to win, which is difficult to understand considering how it makes no logical sense.<br />5. Pointing out symbolism: Collins clearly doesn't think much of her audience when she explicitly states the meaning of a majority of the symbols and metaphors. For example, making multiple comparisons between the assault on the capitol and the Hunger Games. We get it.<br />6. Delving into Katniss's thoughts: I know it's written in first person, but that doesn't mean we need to read pages of Katniss's over-analysis of unimportant events (while leaving out Katniss's thoughts where they matter, such as at the end of the novel).<br />I suppose this review was more critical than it had to be, but then again, these books are more popular than they should be.

B007LNJ4YW|4.0|How do you follow an album which was a dreamy pop masterwork that single handidly made a lush electronic form of shoegaze music the height of fashion and left a trail of broken hearts from New York to Newquay? It also saw young men (and rather aged males) fall hopelessly in love with the dulcet dones of the sultry chanteuse Victoria Legrand and give fulsome admiration to the musical wonders conjured by Alex Scally from his pole position in Beach House. 2010's opus \\"Teen Dream\\" was a wonder indeed and from the minute Legrand crushed you with longing regret of \\"Walk in the park\\" or had you singing at the top of your voice to the wonderful distortion of \\"Norway\\" you knew you had encountered something very special.<br /><br />In terms of the Baltimore duo's latest offering its safe to say that if you loved \\"Teen Dream\\" the romance is about to be rekindled. There is certainly progression on \\"Bloom\\" which makes it a cleaner more pure pop form of music but at the same time this album is certainly the first cousin of \\"TD\\" and if you had put the lovely opener \\"Myth\\" as the eleventh track on that album frankly no one would notice the joins. It is a scintillating pop song full of huge Legrand choruses and Scally instrumentation which concludes with a huge finale of bells, guitars synths, kitchen sinks et al. Next up is \\"Wild\\" a song which your reviewer has become so smitten with it is with a sense of regret that the third track comes on. It is a pounding shimmering pop song with a superb vocal and imbued with that latent regret that the sweet raspy voice of Legrand should seek a patent to protect. Equal wonders follow not least the lifting bliss of \\"Lazuli\\" (appropriately a stone, revered for its intense blue radiance) where music pundits have noticed the Liz Frazier dimensions of Legrand's huge vocal. There however a couple of minor slip ups within the album. The song \\"Other people\\" for instance is a wonderfully gossamer thin pop song all airy graces and appears to be created as a potential single. Repeated listens however suggest that it is neither fish nor fowl and it is not a song on the album where your automatically aim the needle of the record player. Similarly why do bands persist in the high irritation of the hidden concluding album track where you wait an eternity to be deliriously shocked by the presence of more music which you knew was already there in the first place (Beach House have never really majored on 16 minute songs). Its a shame really since the gorgeous mystery track \\"Wherever you go\\" which follows the rather harsh \\"Irene\\" harks back nicely to the Beach House of the earlier \\"Devotion\\" era and didn't need to be tucked away.<br /><br />These are small quibbles in the grand scheme of things and once you hear the truly wonderful rolling piano ballad \\"On the sea\\" the bands genius is laid bare for all to admire and leave you with a quivering lip. Beach house are consumate musicians who have perfected an approach which is distinctively their own and which delivers time after time. \\"Teen Dream\\" was an album of such greatness that following it was bound to be a difficult prospect, Equally \\"Bloom\\" is an album which is deeply layered and textured and reveals a little more beauty and depth on each listen. Who knows with the passage of time it may well be every bit the equal to its august predecessor? \\"Time is the revelator\\" as Gillian Welch once wisely observed and for know just enjoy another wonderful instalment of music from this dynamic duo.as a potential single. Repeated listens however suggest that it is neither fish nor fowl and it is not a song on the album where your automatically aim the needle of the record player.

Its a shame really since the gorgeous mystery track \\"Wherever you go\\" which follows the rather harsh \\"Irene\\" harks back nicely to the Beach House of the earlier \\"Devotion\\" era and didn't need to be tucked away.<br /><br />These are small quibbles in the grand scheme of things and once you hear the truly wonderful rolling piano ballad \\"On the sea\\" the bands genius is laid bare for all to admire and leave you with a quivering lip. Beach house are consumate musicians who have perfected an approach which is distinctively their own and which delivers time after time. \\"Teen Dream\\" was an album of such greatness that following it was bound to be a difficult prospect, Equally \\"Bloom\\" is an album which is deeply layered and textured and reveals a little more beauty and depth on each listen. Who knows with the passage of time it may well be every bit the equal to its august predecessor? \\"Time is the revelator\\" as Gillian Welch once wisely observed and for know just enjoy another wonderful instalment of music from this dynamic duo.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|A mother copes with a son who is a sociopath in the making. In infancy he's colicky, as a toddler he is unresponsive and torpid, as a child he is manipulative and conniving, as a teenager he is sadistic and dangerous.<br /><br />The movie is deftly plotted via present day encounters, dream states and flashbacks. The cinematography is sinuous and vicerally symbolic; and instead of being sinister and foreboding, the soundtrack is often quirky and purposefully inappropriate.  It's told completely from the mother's point of view. We are in her head, not Kevin's, which is probably the scarier place to be. As the Mother Tilda Swinton is front and center in every scene and her portrayl is quietly tragic and nothing short of flawless. Ezra Miller is chilling as Kevin. This all makes for a pitch perfect psychological drama like none other.<br /><br />The film opens in a dream state with the mother in a place that looks like hell. In reality that's exactly where she is. Her life is never-ending game of cat and mouse, of which her son  always has the upper hand. He's smart beyond his years, and he's always one step ahead.  Any signs of being loving, happy or normal are carefully calculated by Kevin. He knows how to use a toilet, but won't. Wearing a diaper way beyond diaper years and crapping his pants during playtime with Mommy is a psychological weapon. He speaks only in biting laconic outbusts. He spits on the lunch Mom made him, and paintballs Mom's \\"special room.\\" Mom may be cold. She tries. But she has a child who cannot be bargained with using straight talk nor nurtured with patience and understanding. He exists simply to torment.<br /><br />The father is rarely around and chooses to ignore that his son is deeply disturbed. \\"He's a child, boys will be boys,\\" his wife \\"should get help.\\" Kevin knows this and uses it to his advantage. He has no problem turning on the charm with Dad, because Mom is the real target. Dad buys son an archery set to \\"bond\\". Kevin practices andhones his skill. His  targets of choice multiply and he hits them with tragic precision.<br /><br />Present day revolves around the aftermath of a catastrophic event orchestrated by Kevin. As the movie stays in Mom's point of view, we don't see the tragic event as it happened. There are no over the top bloody images, nor screaming people pleading for their lives, and few corpses. It's only by seeing how the Mom is ostracized in her community that we understand the magnitude of what Kevin did. While she is slapped across the face, cursed at and vandalized, her son escapes exposure and is devoid of shame. In serial killer fashion, he's happy to claim rockstar status in his notoriety.  He's a minor and he used a `Prozac made me do it' defense. And if he really is an unrepenting sociopath, either born or bred, regret and a rationale will never come to be. So it's Mom who really suffers the consequences and shoulders the blame out in society and in her own being. Once again she is the ultimate target. Once again, the son has won.

B000002HJD|5.0|Jim Morrison's poetry blows me away every time I get a chance to read it, It is amazing to me the age he was when he wrote thousands of pages of poetry this good. THAT is what the world lost when he passed on, a great poet with so much more to say, so much more to create, rather than the singer in The doors...YES, he was that too, but he was so much more. Talemted poets of his caliber do not come along to often, and although poetry is very personal and not everyone will relate, or even understand some of it, the talent shows. Jim had a remarkable, creative mind and was intelligent beyond his years. The fact that his peotry is taught at Stanford, Duke and Yale does not surprise me!!!! To hear his poetry spoken by him is a true gift to the world, Jim was right when he said \\"nothing is as eternal as poetry\\", nothing can survive a holocaust but poetry\\" - I feel so lucky that he recorded this poetry and that the surviving doors cared enough about Jim's legacy to put music to it, and release it for the world to enjoy.  I miss you Jim.
0345479092|4.0|This book had lots of helpful hints for parents to understand babie's needs.  Also has lots of tips for problems with sleeping, breastfeeding and so much more.  What I liked the most was that she had solution to problems that did not let the baby \\"cry it out\\" which is what some people chose to do if they don't know what else to do to fix a problem.  I read it when my baby was 8 months and wished I had read it sooner!
0439023513|5.0|This was my second purchase and I can't say how great the experience was.  Not only did I get a fantastic book that was in perfect condition but had really great service.  Thank you for a great experience
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you have not seen this movie, you really are missing out!  I have not seen every SG movie yet, but this one is one of my all-time favorites.  And no, I don't have a crush on every SG movie to come out, so no rose-colored glasses here.<br /><br />Artistry/Animation:  9.99 out of 10.  I have seen a lot of anime, and to be honest this is the most impressively drawn and colored anime I've ever seen.  I don't give it 10 out of 10 because I don't believe anything is exactly perfect.  This is really close.  You can just tell that a lot of effort was spent on this movie.<br /><br />Plot:  7 out of 10.  OK, so there are a LOT of moving parts in the film that tie together at the end, or I guess I should say competing interests between the different characters.  complexity does make for interesting watching, but you might be a bit confused the first time you watch it.<br /><br />Music/SFX:  9 out of 10.  the music is awesome!  the sound effects are also really well done.  it says the sound is English 5.1, but I don't have a full surround system anymore so I can't tell.  The english translation actually makes sense, so I just watch it in english.  (ok you anime purists, get over it!  sometimes I like to actually SEE the movie instead of keeping my eyes glued to the subtitles at the bottom of the screen and watching the action with my peripheral vision.)<br /><br />Length:  9 out of 10.  why did I put this in here?  because it's feature film length!  it's over 2 hours long, and a lot of feature films nowadays are less!  I really get depressed when I find a movie I like and it ends before I finish my popcorn ;) since anime is hand-drawn (for the most part), it tends to be shorter in length (the animators must get tired) and that bugs me sometimes (anyone else?).<br /><br />I won't bore you with gushing restatements of the plot, just watch the movie!  I mentioned the things that are important to me and really stand out, even on the 5th viewing.<br /><br />feel free to comment too!oo!

B007T2XC7A|1.0|I liked her hit but I haven't really liked the way she's grown since. This album cover looks like she took a turn for a more punk/Blondie direction, but the music is milquetoast. She really needs a shot in the arm of some edge because these wanderings in the bland sea of easy listening is not doing anything for her.
B005G02RIC|5.0|One of the most enjoyable production of Tosca in recent years. The tenor and soprano were excellent in singing and acting, as well as Raimondi's Scarpia.<br />The sound and the view is much better than actually being there in the Arena. The real canon fire in the first act is awesome.<br />What a treat. Grazie, producers.

032180354X|4.0|I ordered this book after discovering Dustin on Flickr a while back.  The book is an extension of his Flickr postings - strobist shots followed by a pulled back setup shot that shows the lights and modifiers used.  The majority of the book consists of sets of final images and the setup shot, beautifully printed.  Few words are found in the image section.  The light and modifier used is called out, along with flash power and distance from subject.  The camera, lens, and exposure information is recorded.  That is about it.  Dustin does give some very basic overview information in the beginning of the book, where he briefly discusses equipment choices and exposure variables (shutter, aperture, ISO).  He briefly touches on flash guide numbers (GN) and the dreaded inverse square rule, actually giving a nice concise explanation of those difficult concepts.  This is not exhaustive information and appears to be tossed in as a courtesy to newcomers.  For more thorough coverage, you'll want to seek out other resources such as Dave Hobby's excellent Strobist tutorial.<br /><br />This is not a guide book at all.  It is pictorial teach-by-example. I've read lots of lighting books and watched a lot of videos. I understand the basics of how lighting works and what various modifiers do.  What I was looking for in order to improve my work this year was inspiration - effective use of lighting with subjects and environments that are attainable by me. There are enough books on studio lighting. Nice, but I don't have a studio. I don't have a budget for assistants or expensive lighting gear.  Who doesn't look good lit by a 7 foot Octa?  I need to light people with things I can carry with just my own two hands.  In that regard, I really like that so many of the examples are on the streets and make use of relatively inexpensive and portable lighting equipment.  Like Dustin, I often use the streets as my studio out of necessity.  I wanted was some inspiration for creative on-location shotswith minimal gear.  For the most part, that's just what this book does.  There are some studio and indoor shots but most are taken outside in urban environments.  Most of the images dark and edgy.  That appeals to me.  It won't be for everyone.  If you're looking for brightly lit shots of perky teen seniors or brides, this isn't what you're looking for.<br /><br />The only thing I found lacking was that while the book shows WHAT was done to get a shot, there isn't any insight into the WHY.  I'd loved to have some quick production notes added to get inside his thought process.  Why this modifier over another?  Why were the lights placed where they were?  What problems were being solved by the lighting choices?<br /><br />I did enjoy this book and it gave me a lot of good ideas.  It helped remove some of my excuses - oh, if only I had an interesting location.  Dustin has a way of making even the most mundane locations look great in his shots.  The setups are, for the most part, simple.  I came away with an \\"I can do that\\" mindset.  I appreciate his willingness to share so much of how he gets things done.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the game is not easy for kids. i let my brother play it and he couldnt figure out how it worked.
0345803485|1.0|I kept trying to force myself to keep reading, mainly because I was trying to find what everyone was raving about but, it just never came. Very sorry I bought into it!
0439023521|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. It very well describes the \\"Games\\" and it is definitely a page turner. I just couldn't put it down. I loved the braveness of Katniss the main character, and Peeta and their star crossed relationship, I love the action and adventure in the actual games, and overall, I just love this book so much. The movie was also really good, but you should definitely read the book first. After you have read this book, you should also read the 2nd and 3rd books, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. You will not regret reading this fantastic book.
B005HSL626|4.0|Love the game - perfect for any age.  Can't play anymore because it has crashed.  How do I get my Fruit Ninja back???

B00003CXA6|2.0|The first 2 hours and twenty minutes of this 4+ hour movie had about 2 hours of  soundtrack that overpowered the dialogue and the sounds of battle.  It was so irritating that I finally had to stop.  I like a good soundtrack but this was not one of them.  It was WAY too sentimental and over dramatic.  And it never clicked with the film.  Maybe one day there will be a director's cut that deletes about 80% of the score.  Until then, I won't be watching the second half of the movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game and it's fun to do when you're bored.I like how it is actually possible to play this game without spending any money!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Bravo! A very impressive game (just finished it). The authors clearly put a lot of thought into not only the level design, but also the theme, transitions, music, and the overall look and feel of the game. On top of that, it was entirely playable and even smooth on my modestly powered Optimus phone. This is the first app I have purchased, and it was well worth it. Highly recommended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app. it is cute.there are so many fun things in this game. so buy the app and trust me u will love it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have no clue how this book became a bestseller. I normally do not succumb to buying books or anything for that matter, because everyone else is buying it. I normally read books from the 18th-19th Century so you can tell I'm not into trends. I stupidly thought this would be a good book because of all the hype, so I bought it. Big Mistake!<br /><br />I read 70 pages that were tedious and not engaging in the least bit. The wording is horribly simple and the same words are repeated over and over and over... I also have no clue why this is being called Mommy Porn. Even the sex scene was boring. It felt like I was being told about was going on rather than being brought into the scene itself.<br />There is absolutely no way I can finish this book and can not believe there are others who have read all 3. There is no connection to the characters and truthfully it is quite the bore. It's a shame that good erotic fiction writers don't get any hype. And this pathetic book, that shouldn't even be called Erotic Fiction, has become a bestseller. It's a real shame.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I admit I was not eager to read the 1st book. This is not my typical genre. I did it with my book club. I was unsure of what to expect and dreaded the actual \\"Hunger Games\\" in the book. Surprisingly enough the \\" Hunger Games\\" was the part that kept me riveted. The most disturbing part is NOT the violence, it's that it depicts the worst of human nature and that is real! I would not want kids under age 13 reading this trilogy.I think most would miss the point of the story. I read all 3 books and could not stop reading. I also saw movie and believe that without reading the book viewers missed a lot!
B005USZYDU|1.0|I am fan of John Grisham, just got the kindle and would like to buy this ebook. However, the price is US$9.59 (in Hong Kong), which the paperback costs US$7.99 only!!! At the same time, same ebook at Kobobooks.com just costs around US$6.6.<br /><br />Amazon, please review and lower the price!!! I am sure lots of fans will buy more if you do that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely brilliant series. You will fall in love with the characters (this is the second season -- so make sure to watch the first season). This version includes the Christmas episode.
1439156816|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading Stephen King, and this work of nonfiction is no different. In it he addresses all of the issues I have with poor writing. I think this should be required reading for every aspiring writer.
142313866X|5.0|This is really nice and has a wide range of Disney projects featured in it. I would say it's probably 70% paintings and maybe 25-30% pencil drawings. There really wasn't much in the way of layout in the book, and is almost all BGs, but it's an amazing book for that specific field of animation and no book of this quality out there, like it. If you're looking for layout the other book that has Disney and other big animation films in it...the name escapes me, that recently came out, is much better for that. It has a scene from '100 Dalmations' on the cover. The Layout & Background book is great for a collector or for someone in the animation field who wants to brush up on their skills.

B0077PBPJ6|3.0|Part I dragged on and on with so little happening I almost gave up on it.  The lovers had no chemistry between them, the character of the leading man was so distasteful in the war scenes that I cared little about him in the love scenes.  There was so much time wasted on wordless glances and stares that I could almost hear the director in my head telling the actors to \\"Say it with your face since there are no words in the script.\\" Well, they didn't say much with their faces either.  There were graphic sex scenes that put me off--they were completely unnecessary.  I enjoy love scenes much more when it's left to my own imagination and not when I'm made a voyeur into someone else's bedroom (or behind their tree).  The only character I cared about was Firebrace.  Part II picked up speed somewhat and more happened but if you are looking for something worthy of the 2-1/2 hours, you will be disappointed.  And what does \\"Birdsong\\" even mean?  I haven't read the book so I'm assuming they kept the title for the movie and cut out the part that lead to the title.?????
0345803507|5.0|This is a great book. It is worth the hype. Get the whole series. To enjoy this book, you must be open to the experience. Boy oh boy, is it worth the experience. Might need a cigarette.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games! It is now my favorite series! The book is also impossible to put down and the details were amazing! I would totally recommend the bokk to anyone and everybody. If you're looking for a book that keeps you on your toes, filled with action, and is a great series then read the Hunger Games and \\"may the odds be ever in your favor!\\"

B0002EXH40|5.0|\\"Youthanasia\\" moves further away from the thrash metal sound of prior Megadeth albums but it still remains extremely heavy. The shredding, head-spinning solos are still there and so are the aggressive guitar riffs. The difference really is that everything sounds slower than on previous albums yet just as intense. This is also a very dark album because Dave Mustaine sounds genuinely frustrated and hurting inside. His lyrics also reflect that.<br /><br />Having said all that, this album sounds like Megadeth's version of Metallica's \\"black album\\". The difference between the 2 albums is that Megadeth wrote ballads AND kept the amazing shredding solos plus they stayed true to their roots whereas Metallica watered themselves down and actually tried to cater to the mainstream.<br /><br />The songwriting is excellent, the musicianship is excellent, and Dave Mustaine  sings more from his gut than on any other album up to this point that I've heard (and it makes the songs sound that much more intense). \\"A Tout Le Monde\\", for those who don't know, is not about suicide. It's about having the chance to say goodbye if something happened unexpectedly.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, \\"Millennium of the Blind\\" is a fun little out-take but nothing I'd listen to alot. \\"New World Order (demo)\\" sounds like it could've fit in on \\"Rust In Peace\\" with it's thrash metal leanings. \\"Absolution (instrumental)\\" is a nice little piece that probably could've made the album in my opinion. The demo for \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" doesn't sound as good as the album version so it's not essential in my eyes.<br /><br />Anyone who likes Megadeth definitely needs to own this.<br />I would actually recommend anyone who likes metal to purchase this.
0345803485|1.0|I like erotica. In my library I have some quality writing. I wanted to see what all the hype was about; I requested a sample of the book. These volumes WILL NOT be occupying space in my library. I must say, this is some of the worst writing I have seen in some time. If you like this type of erotica try the Marketplace series by Laura Antoniou or the Beauty books by Jacqueline Carey, try short story compilation \\"Slow Hand\\". So sad to think this drivel made it to the best seller list ... so sad. Can I give it a negative star?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would definitely recommend!  Not a book for everyone though,so if you are not in touch or open with your sexuality or If reading any words that have to do with sex make you cringe or uncomfortable don't read the books!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was a good summer read. Lots of action and violence; I sat by the pool and forgot I was on vacation. In the book, there are very few \\"Good Guy\\" and no one wears a white. So if you want loose a few hours... .
B002UXRGM0|5.0|It has been around 6 years since I first watched Life of Mammals, and when Life was aired in local TV I still had that same feeling of awe and surprise that I had had back then. There are some typical scenes of big cats chasing prey, lemurs moving-moving, and sardines being bullied into forming a ball, that you, most certainly, have seen before. But what made me buy this series is the new material, if not a new perspective on things familiar. BBC has upped the ante with new camera tricks, super slow motion, and full HD.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was totally addicting. Once I started, I could not put the book down. I loved it. Yes, it was 'interesting'. But, I tended to focus on the broader story line than just the physical relationship. Overall, the book was fabulous.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite watch I've ever purchased.

1400069289|3.0|The power of habit - seemed more like the power of repetition with stories and research often repeated in other works with little new insight on habit formation.  For example it talks about a runner who replaced bad habits with running and gained more self-discipline.  Like most all the stories in the book, the runner decided one day to be \\"born again\\" with new habits and everything in her life started to improve by rewiring the feedback loop in her brain.  It seemed to over simplify the reasons for success of replacing old rewards with new rewards.  The typical heroin, sex or gambling addict is most likely not motivated by the \\"joy\\" of running.  If they do find this new \\"joy\\", almost always other more important support systems are involved to find this new \\"joy\\".  The analysis of cause and effect for habit formation is lacking.<br />The notion of bad habits as misguided coping mechanisms seems poorly explored.  Many addicts don't enjoy their successes and are unnecessarily hard on themselves for failures which they self-medicate with their bad habits.  The book poorly covers the depression or other internal emotional issues that drive addiction.  The coverage of successful self-help groups like 12-step program seems weak.  The need for empathy, caring and love as a type of reward seems uncovered.  The self-respect and benefits of guidance in a positive peer environment seem weak.  The coverage of secrecy and its effect on habits was weak.<br />The book focused more on where in the brain than where in the heart / (emotions) habits develop.  Clearly, habits once developed are non-emotional decisions.  However, the emotional intelligence that allows one to develop the will-power for more positive feedback loops is poorly explored.  I found the book to have good stories but poor guidance.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very exciting story that keeps you hanging until the very end.  The characters are interesting and compelling and each event adds twists and clues that don't seem to make sense ... Until it all comes together.  The only problem is that you cannot stop reading, hoping the next chapter will provide some clarity and answers.
0439023491|3.0|The problem with this series is that although okay for teens, adult may find the characters shallow.  The main characters seem one sided and the story line is very simplistic.  It is no Harry Potter series!

B0083GQVOC|4.0|The film begins with a strange, slow-motion pan of the La Tomatina (tomato) festival in Spain. As you look closely it reveals a certain amount of social anarchy: violence, public sex, etc. Or a hint of them, anyway. And towards the end of the scene we see Swinton reveling in it all, embracing it wholeheartedly. A look of supreme bliss on her face. This is the only glimpse we get of her character as the \\"famed world adventurer\\" she is supposed to be. Immediately afterwards she finds herself pregnant and extremely resentful of that fact.<br /><br />This movie attempts to delve into the \\"nature vs. nurture\\" argument of what makes a child grow up to become a cold-hearted killer. It is obvious from the beginning that Swinton's character hates the restrictions that being pregnant and then a new mother has placed on her. She is no longer able to follow her heart's desire and travel the world on a whim. When the child is born she resents him to such an extent that she is unable to bond with her baby and it is left to the father (John C. Reilly) to give the child all of the affection and love he will ever receive. As the little boy grows up we see the anger and resentment toward his mother grow day by day, sowing the seeds for psychopathy. In my opinion, it is not a case of one or the other. Not nature vs. nurture, but a combination of the two. A perfect storm, if you will, of circumstance and genetics that creates a child capable of murder.<br /><br />Swinton gives a finely nuanced performance as the reluctant mother who resents her child and despises herself for it. As the years go by we see her painful, awkward attempts to connect with her son only to be rebuffed by the child who becomes increasingly angry and disturbed. John C. Reilly is good as the father with blinders on. Ezra  Miller gives a solid performance as the anti-social teenaged son. But it is newcomer Jasper Newell who gives a standout performance as Kevin in his early years. The animosity he feels as Kevin toward his mother is palpable and comes across as very real.oward his mother is palpable and comes across as very real.

It has a better production and it has a more professional sound than their first. The covers are great too but that's one thing that puts it down a small step, if it had more original Beatles songs I'd give it 5 stars. Please Mr. Postman is a cover but it's also one of my favorites though, the best original Beatles songs would have to be All My Loving, It won't Be Long, All I've Got To Do and Hold Me Tight. The entire albums solid and it's nothing too different from their albums up to Beatles For Sale, just mainstream rock and roll/pop which isn't a bad thing and it's somewhat underrated compared to their later albums.
1401235417|5.0|I can't remember the last time I read a Batman comic. I know I read \\"Death in the Family\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" back in the day, but I don't think I've actually read any of them in the last twenty years or so. After reading this, I'm beginning to get an idea of what I've been missing.<br /><br />The story centers on a grisly murder that might well tie into a secret cabal that's been running Gotham from the shadows for the last 400 years or so, and which may have ties to the Wayne and Grayson families. Batman begins investigating and soon finds himself drawn into a situation far different from what he expected.<br /><br />I found myself getting really drawn into this story. Batman's portrayal is very well-done, and I liked his relationships with Dick and with Alfred. I especially liked a scene at the very beginning involving pretty much all of Batman's rogues gallery. I also really enjoyed the artwork, which was very good and not overly-stylized, as sometimes tends to be the case.<br /><br />What I didn't like is the same thing I disliked with DC's Animal Man collection, and that's that the story is incomplete. You get the first seven parts, but clearly the rest are going to be printed elsewhere. I suppose I can understand why they do it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.<br /><br />That complaint aside, this is a very good book and well-worth picking up.
B000002IOY|5.0|Years Of Decay is a masterpiece in thrash/speed metal and arguably Overkill at their best at least right next to Horrorscope. The songs are in a different direction than on their first 3 albums, more technical and progressive. Overkill develop their signature sound here. I Hate, Elimination and Time To Kill are thrash classics. It's right before they slow their songs down for a more mature sound, they're still very fast here and have speed metal influences.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise.  I did not know what to think of the movie.  I hate when reviews give away the movie.  So don't read to much in to any.  Just watch it.
B000002ADT|5.0|Kind Of Blue is a classic and arguably one of the greatest albums ever made. Miles Davis' most highly acclaimed album and without a doubt his best. It's good instrumental jazz and was ranked #12 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time. The remaster sounds great and better than before. All of the songs are so good it's hard to choose a favorite but for me it would have to be the 11 minute \\"All Blues\\" which is a masterpiece.<br /><br />1959 Line-up consists of:<br />Miles Davis - trumpet, band leader<br />Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley - alto saxophone, except on \\"Blue in Green\\"<br />Paul Chambers - double bass<br />Jimmy Cobb - drums<br />John Coltrane - tenor saxophone<br />Bill Evans - piano (except \\"Freddie Freeloader\\"), liner notes<br />Wynton Kelly - piano on \\"Freddie Freeloader\\"
B0083GQVXI|4.0|First off, I love Tilda Swinton. She always fully and intensely inhabits her roles, and she did so again in this film, which in turn stays very true to the book of the same name. As is almost always the case, the book goes into much greater depth, but the film still does a good job of capturing the essence of the story. It is shot in an extremely fragmented manner, both visually and chronologically speaking, but since I was already familiar with the story, I could be a little off in my assessment that this constant back and forth still makes sense as the film progresses, although even I was beginning to tire of it about a third of the way into the film. However, I recognized that Kevin's mother could not escape from her shattered existence, so I understood the need for this disorienting (and effective) camerawork/editing. While they never do completely abandon this format--still flashing forward in time and back again occasionally--the film does settle down a bit towards the middle and spares us the constant freneticism of the jump cuts that marks its start. Another reviewer also rightly pointed out the overt symbolism that occurs throughout the film from its very start: smashed tomatoes; oozing red jam; spattering red paint: we get it.<br /><br />The film, as did the book, will definitely spark conversations regarding nature versus nurture. I tend to think that both factors are at work, both in this story and in real life, and again, both film and book do a good job of depicting that, although since it is my understanding that film & book are works of fiction, I tend to wonder if the depiction of Kevin isn't a little TOO evil, right from the start. When I read the book (and the film carries this over), I almost felt like it provided the kind of pat answer we all want to hear about the whys of what motivates the kids who show up to school and mow their classmates down one day: because they're bad seeds from the outset. I kind of think it may be a little bit more complicated than that. It might be even scarier for us to think that they were in any way normal, ever. Watching this movie, any of us can watch Kevin and see immediately that there's something wrong with him. It's the fact that we can't predict who might be the next killer that scares us.

B006C45MRE|2.0|I was left with a sick feeling after watching this movie.  I thought a film with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig would be some good eye candy but thank goodness I didn't eat anything before watching.  There is once scene in particular that is really awful.  Even though the torture was shroud in darkness, you knew exactly what was happening and I just want to throw up.  I'm NOT a fan of any sort of sicko horror movies and I feel rather dismayed and mislead to the nature of the film.  I don't really mind gun fights and bloodshed but I draw the line at vivisection and disembowelment.  WTF.<br /><br />One star for Daniel Craig and one star for Harrison Ford,  Minus a million stars for not warning me about the torture!

0345803485|5.0|I'm a big fan of erotica novels. So needless to say this trilogy piqued my interest the second I heard about it. When I viewed all the reviews here on Amazon I decided not to purchase it. Then I heard from friends of a friend that they loved it and couldn't put it down. So I decided to take the plunge and purchase the trilogy. I'm almost done with the first book and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. It's a love story that you follow between two individuals who have a lot to learn about each other and what true love is. That neither of them has known before. Some of the sex is a little extreme but not too much. He doesn't push her beyond what she's comfortable with. I read a little bit every chance I get. You want to know what's going to happen next. I highly recommend it.
0061339202|3.0|The research presented in this book is quite interesting, but stylistically, I found the writing to be a bit too verbose and redundant. I also felt that at times, the book verges on self-help territory; however, Csikszentmihalyi is one of the most renowned psychologists of the last few decades, so his advice comes with a lot more credibility than your average self-help guru.
1468179993|4.0|This book contains just 107 pages and can be finished in one sitting. If you are going to give a speech/talk this book will help you a lot. You will be able to improve your talk significantly. Jeremey Donovan covers the following in this short and simple book:<br /><br />1. How to choose a topic?<br />2. How to make it memorable?<br />3. How to get introduced?<br />4. How to open your talk?<br />5. How to construct the body of your talk?<br />6. How to conclude your talk?<br />7. How to tell stories?<br />8. How to verbally deliver your talk?<br />9. How to add humour?<br />10. How to physically deliver your talk (gesture & body language)?<br />11. How to create visuals?<br />12. How to overcome stage fear?<br /><br />The chapter on getting introduced, opening your talk and constructing the body of the speech are good. This book is more about a speech and less about a presentation (made with slides). The entire focus of the book is on delivering a TED talk (and TED talks mostly have very little role for slides). This book will thus help you in delivering any speech. If you are going to give a speech to share a story or inspire an audience, this book will be of good use. It is a good 'first book' for normal people going to deliver a talk.<br /><br />I wish the book could elaborate on topics like 'how to tell stories' and 'how to add humour'. The book is too crisp and moves over many things too fast. That's why I feel its a good place to start if you have a speech to make. It's not everything that is there to learn but definitely gets you moving in the right direction.<br /><br />Disclosure: I am a presentations blogger and got a free review copy of the book.
0439023483|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is simply incredible. Good luck putting this book down after the first chapter! Suzanne Collins made me feel as if I were running through the arena with Katniss. Katniss Everdeen is a role model for all young girls. She is fearlessly passionate for her sister Prim, incredibly smart, and not afraid of heart break. Katriss is beyond her years when it comes to intelligence. Growing up in the poorest area of Panem, district 12, she learns to provide for her family. Panem is the remains of what used be North America. The 13 districts declared war on the controlling government, the Capitol. The Capitol not only won the war, but they destroyed district 13 to show the 12 remaining districts they meant business. They also had to agree on terms to provide one girl and one boy from each district to fight to the death on television, which they call the celebration of \\"Hunger Games\\". On the day of the reaping, which is when the boy and girl from each district are randomly chosen to fight in the Hunger Games, Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is picked. Prim is horrified knowing that she won't stand a chance against the 24 trained tributes. So being the courageous sister that she is, Katniss volunteers for Prim. And the heart- racing, breathtaking, incredible adventure begins. After Katniss is trained for a week, she is propelled into the arena with her other tribune, Peeta, for the 74th Hunger Games. Every twist, every turn in this book made my jaw drop and thirst for more. Thank heavens there is a sequel to this book or I would be heart broken. I rate this book 5 stars for making me think with a new perspective and begging for book two. I truly encourage you to read \\"The Hunger Games\\" because it is an amazing read and this book will go to infinity and beyond.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I asked my friends what's new and good to read ----\\"Fifty\\" was what everyone told me to get. I was hesitant, not wanting to get into a trilogy but despite my reluctance, I bought the first book. OH MY- I did not realize it was going to be so erotic and I thought it was outside my scope of what I am normally accustomed to read. Well, 6 days later-I finished all 3 books and I'm starving (\\"hungry\\") for more! I was glad to read that there is a movie coming out and that I was not alone in that I have already cast the characters before finishing the first book!!  This trilogy's incredible and unnerving!! I couldn't read the pages fast enough! Getting ready to start all over again and reading a bit slower to savor every sentence!! Trying to find another book to get lost in but I soo want it to be another tale of Christian and Ana!! Ahhhh....

B005LAIHGI|4.0|This is raunchy comedy club humor brought to the big screen and it works about 85% of the time.  Saw it today, let me inform people firsthand the film DOES NOT make fun of victims of the 9-11 attacks, Muslims, or Christians. It DOES poke fun at cultural bias and stereotyping based on lack of understanding. It DOES poke fun at Bush/Obama era economic and foreign policies. It DOES ridicule misogynistic Middle Eastern attitudes regarding women. The supporting cast provides some great nutty contributions, particularly Jason Mantzoukas and Bobby Lee.
0385737955|5.0|I could not stop reading this book.  A lot of my male students passed it around this year, so as soon as I had some free time I picked it up.  Less than a day later, I was buying the second one.  Fantastic story!
0345803485|3.0|The author is a true genius and perhaps this literary creation is a birth of a new genre - Kinky Porn Soap Opera. It is quite entertaining and hard to put down although definitely leaves regretful aftertaste of time which could have been better spent...uhmm...sleeping, or playing with your cat, or contemplating human need for mindless entertainment. At any rate, a little advice for future readers - if you have read the first book , there is really no need to continue with other two - you've seen it all. I do admire the author though for this ingeniuos, brave and very luctarive invention.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is a great remastered recording of a classic but I still can't decide what is the best Aerosmith album, \\"Get Your Wings\\" or \\"Toys In The Attic\\".  That's ok, it's a good problem to have.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Despite the 253 user reviews from rotten tomatoes and few others this movie surpassed my expectations. It reminded me of the movie Indiana Jones I saw with my Dad when I was a kid.<br />This movie is not for this ignorant generation who is looking for bullets, explosion and bloody movies. This movie is a classic!  if you looking to see \\"ghetto gansta style acting\\" like fast and the furious or see \\"Bullets don't kill me type movies\\" like Rambo and that crap, then, this movie is not for you. But do us a favor! don't rate this movie! it was not meant for you! you chose the wrong movie! go watch Justin Timberlake! that is the kind of actor you are looking for... the white kid who is nerdy but pretends to be cool and black rapper, plus kicks ass because is a bad ass, and by the way he also happens to be James Bond. hahaha.<br /><br />I think this movie did not have a good reception because unfortunately they didn't market the movie well enough prior to the grand opening. The marketing suck and the previews of the movie suck as well. So the blame is on the marketing people for not doing a good job.<br /><br />I see a great potential in this movie, it could become the next Indiana Jones of Mars!  lets hope that the next one.. John Carter of Mars will be that Indiana Jones i am talking about.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|Opeth's new album is not for everyone... Opeth as a band has always been that way, but it is especially true for this album. Mikael Akerfeldt has expressed dissatisfaction with the contemporary heavy metal scene, which has lead him to the conclusion that Opeth should abandon it altogether. The result of this thought process is Heritage... An album that, although not one of my all-time favorites, I found to be thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />I'll admit I wasn't fully convinced of how good this album was until just recently. I got this album as a Christmas present from my sister, so I have had it for a couple months. I've listened to it a couple times in that time span... The first time I listened to it I was at work, which, in retrospect, was not a good idea, because I was too busy ACTUALLY WORKING and didn't really have time to properly evaluate it. I listened to it a couple more times after that in the following months but eventually wrote off the new direction taken in this album as just not my thing... My initial rating on I-Tunes was a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />But a couple things happened between then and now that changed my mind.<br /><br />First: I saw them live. I had to accept the fact that the new album was going to make up most of the set list. When they played the new songs I enjoyed them more than I remembered. Also, they wrapped up the concert with Demon of the Fall and The Grand Conjuration, proving they could still do the heavy songs and keeping everyone satisfied.<br /><br />Second: Recently, my respect for Mikael Akerfeldt and his reasons for making this album has skyrocketed. I love metal, but I also understand his exhaustion with it's elitist fans. And when you're in a creative career like making music, I don't think you should be confined to working in a specific genre if you don't want to. Think about it... If someone forced you into doing a job you don't want to do, wouldn't you be miserable? Plus, think about the quality factor... If he wrote adeath metal album just because some of his fans won't accept Opeth any other way, would it have been any good? His heart wouldn't have been in it. It's better to turn out a quality album that's polarizing to some than to put out a safe, but crappy album. Also, after discovering Opeth and listening to all their material, without knowing anything about Mikael, I assumed he was a somber and serious person, just like his music. But I found out... The guy has a sense of humor. The first time I got a sense of this is when I stumbled across an interview with him where he talked about played Angry Birds on the toilet. I also got a pretty good taste of it at the live show I went to. Mikael has a great stage presence in general... He keeps the segments between the songs interesting, cracking jokes and giving fun facts, asking trivia.<br /><br />Finally: I had been thinking about branching out anyway. Like I said, I love metal, it always has been, and probably always will be, my favorite genre. But at the same time, I've heard about all the different varieties of growls, screams, shrieks, guitar riffs and blast beats that there are. I want to expand my palette a little bit... That being said, my current problem in experimenting is getting past the album art from different genres... I kind of look at them and my mind kind of automatically goes \\"THAT ALBUM ART ISN'T METAL!!!\\".<br /><br />So, I came back to Heritage with an open mind. And, lo and behold, I like it. It's still not my favorite album of theirs, but there are plenty of good songs and moments on it. You can recognize the sound as Opeth, but at the same time, it's like nothing else you've ever heard and full of unique things. I've spent so much time explaining why I opened up to it, so I think I'm just going to end with my 4 favorite tracks, a fun fact, and some advice to people who don't like this album.<br /><br />(In no particular order)<br /><br />1.Heritage<br />2.The Devil's Orchard<br />3.Famine<br />4.The Line's in my Hand<br /><br />Fun fact: This is only the third Opeth album to not have any 10+ minute songs. To put that into context, this is their 10th album.<br /><br />Advice for people who don't like Heritage: Check out Bloodbath, the death metal super-group that Mikael was involved with for a couple of years. They only came out with a couple albums, but they more than make up for the lack of brutality in this album.

B0000640SA|5.0|First the good: This is an amazing film. Guy Pearce is brilliant, as is Christopher Nolan. The moodiness and the style in which this film unfolds is a tour de force. I've watched it many times, including the \\"chronological\\" version - which was the reason I bought this DVD. However, accessing the chronological version really annoyed me. After 15 minutes of playing through the menu, I just Googled it because my patience was wearing thin. I just wanted to watch the movie, not go on an Easter egg hunt. This DVD really should have included an easy access menu or at a minimum, an insert in the DVD with a \\"User's Guide.\\" I really enjoy the extras, but finding them has been a completely random experience. I didn't want to downgrade the movie, which is one my favorite films, and the quality of the DVD is well-worth the price. But save yourself a headache and just print a user's guide off the net and leave it in the case.

B007Z9QWVK|5.0|This movie has many messages, but one of the most important messages that you get out of seeing this movie is that nothing is ever what it seems on the outside. If you want to find out what the truth really is, you have to do your research, make an effort to get the facts. Its a two folded story one of the famous British love affair  between the man who would become king of England and an american woman, twice divorced; that captured the imaginations and caused an uproar and the other story of an american girl, in modern time, caught up in a nasty marriage with a man that beats her on a daily basis. How would she deal with it, how does her fascination with the royal love affair tie in to the film? You'll just have to see it for yourself. One things for sure, you will enjoy it, its got an amazing eye for detail, the costumes are identical to the era, and the films score is magical.<br />The film may not have caught the worlds attention but anyone willing to give Madonna a chance , woill surely see, her talents as a director are clearly showing here, and it wont be her last efforts behind the camera, and I hope it wont because I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Thanks Madonna for proving you can do it all & do it well!

0765322889|5.0|It never ceases to bug me the injustices this series has suffered as a result of ignorance by casual readers.The sheer scope and intricacy of this series is mind-achingly colossal. Without exception it requires concentration and a small amount of preliminary research to familiarise with the stories fundamental elements like the magic system. It should ease the intimidating plummet into a story which without exception, punishes negligent complacent reading.<br />This is the basis on which most readers criticize, and in some cases completely lambast Erikson's story. The Malazan series occasionally requires recollecting over previous events and peacing together dialogue in order to fully comprehend the motives of some characters. The whole story in some respects is akin to assembling a puzzle. The most rewarding things in life though require effort and willpower.<br /><br />The story is the best peace of fiction I have ever encountered. Period. Erikson completely averted the path of traditional fantasy and presents the reader with a story redolent of real life with regards to it's realistic characters battling with morality, losing faith ,capitulating to temptation,enduring trauma etc. Main characters die regularly. Torture, rape, massacres, prevalence of nefarious characters without apprehension are all common place.<br /><br />The Malazan series has some of the richest characters, dialogue and characterisation you will encounter. He also manages to successfully implement philosophy into dialogue, making it relative to the (usually severe)circumstances and not just sounding like pretentious dribble from the character. Each race is so lush in history. All the gods are realistic with logical motives. None of the black lord-Destroy the world for no reason-because he's the embodiment of evil archetypes or cliches in this story.<br /><br />The world is massive with the story stretching over several continents, each enveloped with lore, history, peculiar cultures and religions. Seeing life through the POV of a brutal barbarian with a very pure severe notion of justice, who rapes and kills in his self righteousness, forces the reader to broaden his mind. This individual criticizes civilisation and is very astute in his observation of it's corrupting effects.Such fresh alien perspectives are more evocative than the usual Black/white banal archetypes inherent within traditional fantasy(The shining knight,The dark lord etc.)The characters in the Malazan universe are substantial and Erikson allows us to almost reach into their sub-conscious. Erikson's capacity to create peculiar and fascinating characters is evident in many individuals such as Anomander Rake. The philosophy and outlook of a character who has lived since the beginning of time is astonishing. Seeing life through so many amazing points of view forces the reader to augment his perception of reality and ultimately grow.<br /><br />With regards the structure of the story, it isn't conventional and proves daunting to some. However this doesn't deter the story from reaching it's momentous finale in a graceful manner.Eventually I came to understand that this was the only way for Erikson to format the huge chunks of story. The main events themselves are straightforward to follow. It's the ambiguous actions and chat of the Ascendants(Gods) that leave people perplexed. That's no inherent flaw within Erikson who intentionally left certain things ending in a fog,paving the way for educated guesses and speculation from the reader.However it does at times cause frustration.<br /><br />Despite my admiration for Mr Erikson and his series,I must reluctantly admit that the series is not without its faults. There are simply too many characters who are not imperative to main story progression.Some sub-plots are mediocre in the eighth and ninth book in particular.(or perhaps I just need a re-read to see more clearly their purpose).I do concede that if he had condensed everything by 10% and somehow made the story more accessible to casual readers,The Malazan series would be more popular. However some people in their frustration at their inability to comprehend such a great story will,as a defence mechanism, ardently lambast the series for it's minor flaws.<br /><br />Take the critically acclaimed fantasy series \\"A song Of Ice and Fire\\" and multiply x5 in scope. Add an enriched abundance of luxurious descriptive narrative, spread more plot threads(ALOT MORE),make the characters more passionate who convey their depth in the most beautiful vivid colloquy and reminiscent thoughts imaginable. That churned recipe for genius culminates in the form of The Malazan Book Of The Fallen by Steven Erikson. The pinnacle of modern fantasy.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Best thing about this book is the complete unpredability - this is NOT a cookie cutter romance. It's amazingly light on sex scenes but gripping from start to finish. I highly recommend for readers of any romance genre. Very fresh!
076115678X|4.0|I love this book. It is full of very useful info and styling tips to help deal with curly hair. After reading it cover to cover, I went to the DevaCurl website to find out where to buy her products and immediately started using them. For the first time in my life I love my curls. Her website even provides a hairdresser search page to find a curl savvy stylist in your area.  And the dvd included with the book is great too, it shows you how to care for your hair and yes there is some product endorsement but hey, the products actually work and she shows you how to use them. It's a relief to finally find someone who understands how to deal with this unique and temperamental hair type. I fully reccommend this book.<br />((8-2-2014 UPDATE:)) While I still refer back to this book from time to time for styling tips or to make one of the homemade recipes, I have switched to a different haircare product line called: \\"Shea Moisture\\". It's way more affordable and the products are awesome! They are also a lot easier to find locally. They are sold at both nationwide discount dept. stores as well as drug stores. IMO, for my hair at least, I think they perform better than the DevaCurl line of products. And for half the price!

0439023521|5.0|I am not one to hop on the bandwagon of popular fiction, but my friend Miranda said that I HAVE to listen to this audiobook!  I have to admit that I didn't really know anything about this book when I checked it out at the library, so it turned into a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Collins immerses us into a dystopian society that was formerly North America, but is now known as Panem.  The time of the annual Hunger Games is approaching as everyone prepares to attend the Reaping.  All citizens are required to attend the Reaping, where they will choose each Districts representatives that will participate in the games.<br /><br />As you can tell from the summary above, young Prim is selected from her District, but that is when Katniss comes forward to take her place in the games.  It takes a courageous girl to step forward knowing that it is very possible she will be murdered because of her decision.  A boy and girl from each District will be chosen to participate, and the games will not be over until there is only one child standing.<br /><br />When the games actually begin, I think I turned into a nervous wreck as I listened to this audio.  It was very intense as these young people are forced to murder in order to stay alive.  We see how Katniss herself deals with these conflicting feelings that arise as she fights for her own survival.<br /><br />I am not going to tell you any more about this book, except that it was amazing!  I know that this book is considered a young adult novel, but obviously readers of all ages have found enjoyment from it.  With themes of survival, honor, trust, and family, there really is something that will appeal to just about everyone.  I don't hesitate in recommending this novel to just about anyone I know.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|I have been a fan of the Terminator series since the first movie. Terminator 2 holds my interest just as well as the first. The concept and the acting is not disappointing and will keep you going right to the end. Plenty of action. Many sequels spin an entirely new story and although this one has some new characters it ties in very well with the original.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this app it is so so much fun.u can do so much I hope that every body will get this app
0307719219|5.0|I first heard about this book on an NPR interview and its premise is straight forward and so obvious that it truly boggles the mind why no one has arrived at this conclusion before. It supports its assertions with multiple historical examples and you don't have to be an economist or statistician to understand the structural explanations put forth. It also is disturbing when those models are held up to current political philosophy here in the United States. It helps explain why some of our states are far poorer than others...they chose rhetoric over reality, in short, they voted for it. I dearly wish a copy of this book could be given to every member of congress and the senate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun because u can play so so many games on just one app WOW!I hope every body will get this app love it

B0015DWJX2|5.0|My brother recommended this book for my Kindle.  The title intrigued me and I thought I would take a look so I downloaded a sample and was enchanted from the first page.  I've never read anything quite like it and was very sad when I came to the end.  Would thoroughly recommend this book and have urged all my friends to read it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love it and its fun just wish it didn't lag and the graphics are so realistic wish I had more time to play it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker was even better than the first. I've heard people say that it is a very sexual book and to a point it is. It is a true love story about a couple who each have psycological issues. This was a VERY quick read and I couldn't wait to get to book three.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|If you're a fan of the story of Beauty and the Beast (in all of it's various forms and translations), you'll like this modern translation.  Some of the lines are overly predictable and silly-sappy, but a lot of it is a decent or excellent translation of the classic fairy tale.<br /><br />The actor who plays \\"the beast\\" does an excellent job of it.  It's not the best acting in the world but he does show all of the emotions at the right time, and his reactions to the scenes are excellent (and like all renditions of this story, he looks better deformed than normal...).<br /><br />The actress who plays \\"belle\\" is equally sweet; again, the character is a little predictable, but her reactions are perfect.<br /><br />The gentleman who plays the blind tutor (Will) is just spot on with his lines and character, and honestly, he should be in the movie more promenantly, along with the woman who plays the house keeper; they might actually be the two best charcters throughout this movie, which is usually the case with the not-so-main characters.<br /><br />Even the witch is enjoyable in this movie; I never thought I'd say I liked an Olson in a production, but...Yeah, she does a good job playing the self-assured, all powerful witch in a way that is a stereotype with a bit if a twist.<br /><br />I'm particularly drawn to this version because the setting, reactions, lines, characters, everything is a real true-to-life variation of this story that just shows perfectly how it might be in our current times.  It translates very well, and is enjoyable all around.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A fun game to fill time....challenging! But I do win every once in a while!! Thanks for the enjoyable game!
1118156315|4.0|This book hands you a good method to assess and redesign your career. For this, it uses the business model canvas which is a powerful toll to asses and design a business model. It is a real do-book. It has a number of assignments in it bringing you closer to your goal every time you have fulfilled one. The book uses a similar approach as Business Model Canvas, assuming oneâ(tm)s career can be modelled like a business. Up to a certain point this is very true. The book provides you with a new perspective on your career and makes you think about your skills and value proposition to your customer, e.g. employers. However, the focus is sometimes too much on making money. Although this is certainly one of the goals of a job, it is more important to be satisfied with your life, regardless the amount of money you make. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to reconsider his or her career.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a pretty cool game. Great game to pass time. Love the different games so you can never get bored playing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Personally, I loved it! There is a story between all the freaky sex stuff...a story about a man who thought he was a monster and the girl who tamed the beast. This was a quick, enjoyable read, and addicting. I couldn't stop until I read the last word of book 3, although by book 3 I skimmed through most of the sex since it became redundant and too frequent. And come on ladies, who wouldn't want a Christian Grey to challenge our innermost sex Goddesses?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm only doing this on 5 stars because it will give me points. Now I'm going to fill this up with random crap. Potatoes are yummy like fruity fruit.

And Steve if you're reading this I am dating your girlfriend so that means she is cheating on u.
0061537969|5.0|I've read many, many books about dog's lives over the years. Having recently adopted a wonderful rescue dog after losing our old beloved Golden Retriever, I was drawn to several \\"dog narrative\\" books. I have to say Garth Stein's \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is so well written, so insightful, touching, appropriate and entertaining. The story line is unique and captivating.... I simply couldn't put it down. It gives the reader such a different perspective on what dog's think and feel, and in a highly credible manner. For anyone who loves dogs and has a heart, this is an absolute Must Read.
B005HSL626|5.0|i think fruit ninja is a funn challenging yet intense game that everyone would like if yoi haven't played.  after you play it once it starts to get addicting . thatz how funn it is. so i suggest if you never played and your looking for a funn challenging intense game this is the game you are looking for! :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Suspend your disbelief over the premise - that a millionaire (BDSM enthusiast) will fall in love with Bella Swan - I mean Ana - and enjoy the story.<br /><br />The story gets a little rough, but the budding romance / steamy moments keep you reading.  Books Two and Three are much better.<br /><br />Your mother would blush if you caught her reading this ... but she wouldn't stop reading it.
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|Intelligent, not too preachy not too light, just right.  A perfect airplane book without the cliches.  Some great insights on feminism which don't stop you from buying that new lovely pair of shoes.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book is unique because the abduction story is from the point of view of a small boy.  As a result, you have an entire book from the perceptions of a child.  The author does this successfully.  We are still able to get enough background information and the story progresses along.  We also get that innocent voice that doesn't really comprehend the world around him.  It did take a bit to get used to it and at times a child's interest got a little boring.<br /><br />The first half of the book moves along rather well.  There is some intensity, but the last half of the book breaks more into some personal challenges and adaptability of the mom and the boy into a new situation.  I enjoyed it, but I think the idea of the book was better than the result.
0345803485|5.0|This literary romance is like no other. I chosen not to write a summary because I'm sure you can find several on Amazon but what I will say is, the amazing reviews you've seen on television and the Internet are for a reason. Most books typically grab my attention 4 or 5 chapters in, however, Fifty Shades of Grey is one that captivated me pages in. This is a great read for women and I actually would recommend it to men too! However, in all honesty, this is for a mature audience not teenagers or conservative folks who have no desire to explore sexual boundaries within a relationship or just in a book. It's hard to believe this is fiction because I'd imagine many of these relationships exist, and if they dont, im sure they will now that this book has gone viral. Shades of Grey peaks your imagination, allows you to explore YOUR personal limits, and at the very least, is a read you won't regret. Can't wait to begin the second book of this trilogy. If you're considering the book, pick it up....

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I sow the show on Broadway last summer, and this is the closest experience I have had to seeing it since then. Ramin is EXCELLENT with Sierra. The music is excellent, the cast is amazing, and once you think that the performance is over, there is an amazing surprise!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Talk about in-depth!  This is one of the most interesting pieces of non-fiction that I have read.  If you are at all into technology, business, or Apple, then you can't go wrong with this book.  The author holds nothing back.  He even points out inaccuracies in quotes from Steve Jobs himself.  It's a fantastic read.  Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story had me from the beginning! I could stop reading, and waited for any moment alone to dive back into this magnificent world. I really found the story to be well written and the use of suspense masterful! I cannot wait to see this made into a feature film or mini series (HBO?)
B006MVJ2L4|2.0|Adam Lambert has a spectacular voice. It's a shame that he wasted it on the lame genre of electropop/electrodance, the equivalent of disco. It's just such an incredible waste. I hope his next album goes in a different direction.
0345803485|5.0|At first I couldn't even get through the first chapter, it left me thinking ..all this hype for this ? really ?..I actually had to force myself to continue reading -figured well I bought them so I might aswell flip through the pages ..I don't know what it is but the more I read the more I was hooked ...I couldn't put the book down .I fell in love
0345803485|5.0|Book arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. Looked like it had never been read.  Enjoyed the book; it was eye-opening in detail, but an interesting story that kept one reading to see what would happen next!

I will def. be buying the second book that's for sure! Page turner, i recommend it for sure
078322933X|5.0|I enjoy this movie. I was surprised when i found out the demented boyfriend was being played by the detective in saw 2. He should make more movies like this.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|What made me post is that many of the reviews seem to focus on the WOLF aspect of the movie.  For me, the movie was about something else.  Not until the end, did I decide that the movie was mostly about coping with death.  Knowing that death is imminent and exploring different reactions.<br />My wife is an M.D. and had to do a rotation on an oncology ward and she gave me some perspectives on this.  And actually, I'm not sure it is 100% but it could be, that in the movie, the protagonist's SO [significant other] (wife, girfriend) \\"leaves him\\" by dying of cancer.  I am sure that we are supposed to think she died of some medical issue.  And this was not clear until near the end.  Before that he says \\"you left me\\" but maybe we could think she just broke up with him.<br />So, ultimately we know that she struggled with death - and she probably knew that it was an impossible struggle.  She tells him not to be afraid.  Perhaps when she said the words she meant - he should not be afraid of her death - but at the end of the movie - we think she means he should not be afraid of his own death.<br />Throughout the movie, the protagonist is portrayed as being more comfortable with death than most of those around him.  He might have made a good oncology nurse!  He is shown perhaps comforting the wolf that he just shot - giving us the impression that he is perhaps grieving for the wolf.  He also comforts a mortally wounded survivor after the plane crash, telling him that he will die and asking him to think of someone he loves (his daughter) in his final moments.  These actions also have the side affect of calming the other survivors.<br />And finally at the end, we are given the impression that the protagonist knows he will met his death, but does not try to run away.<br />There are variously recognized stages of grief:  Denial, Anger, Barganing, Depression, Acceptance and we certainly see all of these portraied by the various humans in the movie.  But for me the primary theme is the struggle through these stages against an impossible situation in which death is certain.  The parallel between the protagonist's SO and the protagonist himself reinforces this theme.<br /><br />This movie cannot be very popular, because while it contains one of the Freudian requirements (violence) it does not contain the other (Sex).  There are no short skirts or high heels in this movie!<br /><br />And this movie reminds me a bit of another movie that was not popular, Thin Red Line.  In that movie the protagonist's mother dies of a medical issue and he thus becomes more familiar with death and the stages of grief.  On Guadalcanal he faces death with more acceptance than most of his compatriots.  Woody Harelson for instance dies cursing his own stupidity.  The protagonist accepts his death with perhaps a bit too much ease, but the movie makes its point - and the point is (for me at least) the same point made in THE GREY.  That some of us can move through the stages of grief to the end (acceptance), while others cannot.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie - but I do not think I would watch it 20 times - it is perhaps too painful.
B0013N4AT0|3.0|I like Opeth. I like the sometimes confusing genre hopping within their albums, sometimes within one song. I love the growls, the clean vocals, the brutality and gorgeousness of their folk/prog melodic tendencies. All the elements that make Opeth unique are here and the density of the sound of this album is interesting. But something is missing: I find myself listening more to the technicality of the music rather than the music itself. Which is something like judging a photograph on what kind of camera was used. It's just not compelling for me on an emotional level, at all. The music just drifts over me. I find myself never being fully engaged and though I've listened to this album several times, it's just not sinking in for me.<br />Yes the music is complex, but the individual parts that make up the music aren't terribly memorable as compositions, nor does the whole make up for the individual parts shortcomings. The musicianship is impressive, but there's nothing that surprising or, from a compositional framework, all that interesting happening. Still Life isn't a bad album, just not as good an album as Opeth are capable of.

B000SLP4SE|4.0|good movie, worth watching. Mark Wahlberg does good solo acting. The story although complicated to follow, does eventually becomes sensible. the locations of shoots too were good. a nice variety of places and constant thrill made it a worthy watch.
B007SSDS24|4.0|NOTE: THIS CONTAINS NO SPOILERS!<br /><br />I really liked \\"The Darkest Hour.\\"  In fact, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews here on this site.  While I do not feel it was a five-star movie, I do feel this movie did exactly what it had to, as well as it could.<br /><br />To be honest, when I first heard that an aliens-invade-the-earth movie was going to involve two American \\"aliens\\"--that is, two Americans visiting Moscow on a business deal--I found the notion intriguing but not compelling.  I mean, why Moscow, right?<br /><br />But the movie takes off very quickly.  Once Ben and Sean, the two Americans, are double-crossed by their Russian \\"partner\\" Skyler, several things are set in motion: their two personalities are clarified in crisis, they have a need to go out and burn off steam (and meet Natalie and Ann), and the audience is ensured that Skyler's gonna die.<br /><br />All of that takes no more than five to ten minutes of screen time.  And when the aliens do arrive, they do so in noteworthy fashion: as little Aurora Boreali that drift to the streets.  As it has been typical of aliens ever since \\"War of the Worlds\\" did it on the radio 70 plus years ago, the intruders somehow zap! people into nothingness.  It isn't until sometime later we begin to understand how (through some kind of electrical disintegration).<br /><br />And, as we find out after the five of them spend an unspecified number of days hiding in a food storage room, there are apparently precious few human beings on the planet left alive.<br /><br />What really made this film enjoyable was the clever use of its characters, particularly Sean, played by Emile Hirsch.  I hesitate to use the word \\"plucky\\" except it describes him to a T: resourceful, creative, resilient, he becomes the backbone of not only their twosome, but also the film.  I found Hirsch to bear a resemblance to a more cheerful \\"Bourne\\" as he noodles his way through situations that are making others crumble.<br /><br />Indeed, this characteristic is echoed throughout the movie, a thing we are fond of calling The American  Spirit, but its appearance in this movie proves it does not belong to us alone.  A likewise spirit among surviving Moscovites helps prove human tenacity is a worldwide human characteristic.  Not that everyone has it--and this film doesn't mind killing off its central characters, mind you--but those that do are like little islands within the desolate streets of a ruined city...and, we suppose, world.<br /><br />I loved \\"The Darkest Hour.\\"  I thought it did what good sci-fi movies without a blockbluster cast or budget do: package its product with good, clever special effects, but never forget it is character and story that drive a movie.  Emile Hirsch and the rest of the cast (Olivia Thirlby, Rachael Taylor and Max Minghella, among others) created compelling personalities who were always interesting.<br /><br />Credit also goes to the special effects team for not only dreaming up a clever representation of a menacing alien presence, but also for giving its characters interesting ways of dealing with it as well.  The film never feels stale, never drags, never becomes unbelievable.<br /><br />And the proof of the fact is that, given the fact that we are left in the perfect position for a sequel, it is one I definitely want to see.d, this characteristic is echoed throughout the movie, a thing we are fond of calling The American  Spirit, but its appearance in this movie proves it does not belong to us alone.

B000GIWS7E|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for one of my friends. They loved it and said it was far better than it looked in the youtube videos. I think this is a good buy for the Dream Theater fan in your life.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|.<br />NOTE:  THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS!<br /><br />As played by Saoirse Ronan, Hanna is an enigmatic killing machine who is as cold and barren as the arctic environment in which she is raised by her father, Erik Heller.  An ex-CIA operative himself, he's given her everything he can: martial arts training, encyclopedic knowledge, fluency in several languages, and most of all a place to hide away from the forces who have been looking for her all of her life, to (at best) study her, or to (at worst) kill her.<br /><br />She's had the option to leave her father's \\"care\\" ever since he deemed her ready: all she has to do is touch a button.  And as our movie just barely starts, she does--and we're in for a wild ride from here on in.<br /><br />You would be excused for thinking this is another in the \\"Bourne\\" sub-genre of movies: a highly trained but unknowing (i.e. \\"innocent\\") operative is left to fend for herself against the murderous intentions of equally skilled assassins gunning for her.  How many times have we seen this trope played out?<br /><br />I can't tell you that this one is truly different--to be sure, there ARE differences, and I think you'll discover them without my spoiling it for you here.  But what I did like was the concept that, for Hanna, almost EVERYTHING was a discovery: people, society, our cultures, and most of all music.  It was all new, all magnificent, but she was so inundated by it all that any one thing was hard to register.  Imagine being thrown into a blender and being told to pick out a chocolate chip...it's almost impossible.<br /><br />One thing she has to deal with, perhaps above all, is just who SHE is.  Hanna knows she's being hunted, and she has been trained for this.  But exactly why has never been appropriately spelled out.  And in this sense everyone is an enemy or at least a suspect, not the least of all those who are closest to her.<br /><br />\\"Hanna,\\" is directed by Joe Wright, whose previous works--\\"Atonement,\\" \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" and \\"The Soloist\\"--clue us in to the notion that there is going to have to be something sophisticated here.  Wright's works do not bespeak a director of action films.  But Wright does indeed do a great job of handling the quick cut/fast moving battle scenes, including one incredible continuous scene in which the camera follows Eric Bana (as Hanna's father Erik) as he exits a bus, travels through the station, along a street, down an escalator into a subway station and into an open area in which he is forced to battle four hired assassins--ALL IN ONE UNBROKEN SHOT!!  All of this while the camera literally swirls around him as he walks, descends, and fights; it's absolutely fluid, and absolutely amazing.<br /><br />What Wright brings to the film is an unspoken intelligence, a way of setting this action flick in a more intellectual plane.  I think it's possible to follow a metaphorical slant here, too:  the film has a depth to it that goes beyond bullets and knives.  Follow the line \\"I just missed the heart,\\" if you want a clue.<br /><br />What struck me about Hanna was how perfect the young actress playing her was.  Saoirse Ronan is extraordinary as the girl trained to be, well, extraordinary.  Her blonde hair, her pale Irish complexion...it all makes for a blank canvas as yet unwritten upon at the movie's start.  And, while she is this innocent young teenager, she is also a fearsome killing machine, more capable than anyone could know, except perhaps the father who trained her.<br /><br />Eric Bana deserves credit too in his role as the father.  He portrays a man who is torn by his duty as an ex-operative, and protecting the daughter he has, as well as the history, the fate, that is foisted upon her.<br /><br />But it is Cate Blanchett who really acts the hell out of her role.  She is a red-headed terror on two feet, alternately cold-blooded and yet strangely fashion conscious, cruel and fastidious.  But then again, the other killers we see are strange, too...very strange.  They make the particular sub-strata occupied by these horrendous beings one you would be quite obviously best to avoid, one where killing is merely a highly specialized job.<br /><br />I liked \\"Hanna\\" and recommend it.  There is certainly room for a sequel, and I would find it an interesting proposition.  What Hanna might become, given her shall we say unusual upbringing, would be anyone's guess...very strange.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|.<br />NOTE:  THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS!<br /><br />What a sad, sweet movie.<br /><br />Discovering your wife is/was having an affair while also being confronted by the fact that her recent injury has left her in a completely vegetative state, and that the plug needs to be pulled--how do you deal with that?  And all of this is added to the fact that you`ve really screwed up raising your kids, and that burden is now yours alone to bear.<br /><br />\\"The Descendants\\" stars George Clooney, an actor increasingly proving his depth as a portrayer of wounded souls.  Here he is Matt King, a man who is getting pressured from all sides.  He is the sole trustee of a beautiful virgin Hawaiian lagoon that most of his numerous family line want to sell to a developer.  His is the deciding vote--and the trust will expire in seven years.<br /><br />First, however, must come his family, and to truly care for it he must give up his role as the \\"back-up parent\\" and learn how to deal with two foreign species: his two daughters, Scottie (10) and Alex (17).  Both need attention, as each is going in her own misguided direction.<br /><br />Scottie is acting out in school, texting inappropriate messages in school, including insults and disturbing photos of her dying mother, and Alex is at her expensive boarding school, drinking, carousing, and filled with unresolved anger toward her mother.  And she prefers to hang out with her friend Sid, a young surfer-type whose favorite word is \\"dude.\\"<br /><br />Matt has a load on his shoulders that no one would want to bear, and in fact there is more going on than I've included here, as I don't want to provide \\"spoilers.\\"  What is important now is his coming to terms with these problems, and doing so in a manner that will allow others to get on with their own lives.  There were times I cringed while watching, wondering if this movie was just too beleaguered to watch--but I'm very glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />That Matt's last name is \\"King\\" is no mistake; he is indeed the patriarch of the family when it comes to this trust, and his decision regarding it will not only affect those who live, but also those who have passed on--the trust consists of 25,000 acres of land that has been in the family ever since the early 1800s when it belonged to relatives who were actual royalty on the island of Kaua'i.<br /><br />\\"The Descendants,\\" therefore, is an aptly named movie, and during this movie we will find out just how much this responsibility means to Matt.<br /><br />As I said, I found this at first to be a difficult movie to watch, but increasingly easier as the plot draws you in.  What especially works is the relationship Matt has with his older daughter, Alex, and her acceptance of her role as the matriarch, if you will.  She has things to work out on her own, and it is her growth that better enables Matt to hang on.  She has a directness to her that is initially off-putting, but becomes both comforting and compelling as time goes on, and is wise that her father listens to her...she becomes a worth ally.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful, gripping movie about love, and forgiveness, and anger, and redemption.  I found it to be smart but not too clever, and I believed in the characters and the story and the decisions that were ultimately reached.  I thought the acting was terrific, and apparently so did many others...especially those in charge of year-end awards.<br /><br />\\"The Descendants\\" was either nominated for or won most key movie awards, from the Oscars to the American Film Institute to the Golden Globes and on and on.  It is a good film, extremely well made and heartfelt.  Clooney's performance alone is worth seeing and he was likewise honored this year with several nominations.<br /><br />However, I felt particularly glad that Shailene Woodley was also honored for her performance as Alex--I truly thought she stood out in a movie where everyone was great.istake; he is indeed the patriarch of the family when it comes to this trust, and his decision regarding it will not only affect those who live, but also those who have passed on--the trust consists of 25,000 acres of land that has been in the family ever since the early 1800s when it belonged to relatives who were actual royalty on the island of Kaua'i.<br /><br />\\"The Descendants,\\" therefore, is an aptly named movie, and during this movie we will find out just how much this responsibility means to Matt.<br /><br />As I said, I found this at first to be a difficult movie to watch, but increasingly easier as the plot draws you in.

B005X5XIL0|5.0|I can not believe that no one has written a review on this CD!  Man, you can just<br />close your eyes and make believe that Andrea is singing every word to you!  His voice<br />is magnificent, his co-singers are awesome and David Foster is just as perfect as he<br />always is!  This music should be played for every child in pre K to understand the world<br />has music that is worth more than one lifetime!<br /><br />Andrea..........I love you and your music!
0345803485|5.0|The message to be revealed in this story is that of horrific child abuse and the affects that it has on an adult.  This story walks that fine line between being in imminent danger to human society and learning to live an acceptable existence and what we would have considered normal.  Captivating an innocent college graduate who lived just outside of the party animal life style was so intriguing to Christian Grey he had to experience what naive innocence could have to offer into his twisted existence.<br /><br />Sexually advanced females where not the challenge to someone who had never had the one thing he lacked innocence. The experienced females only feed into the BSM controlled environment of the bedroom slavery.  Anastasia posses the strong, self-confidant, opinionated drive that pulls the reins in on Christian.<br /><br />The author takes the reader on an exhilarated journey up, down, and sideways with the most entertaining \\"Mommy Porn\\" erotica of the twenty-first century. Well done E. L. James. Bravo!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|You know what they say about curiosity, well, my cat's dead. After hearing all the hoopla about this book, I had to see what the fuss was all about. Boy, was I irritated with myself for throwing my money away. The writing is amateurish, the characters and storyline are shallow and the sexual content is overly gratuitous, ridiculous and silly. The only reason I gave the book a second star is that the book mentioned some beautiful music which I looked up and downloaded to my iPod.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|I found this movie both well acted and educational about a time period long ago, but still part of modern culture. Many people are still alive who remember these events and they were very big news back then. Abdications for an American divorcee just wasn't heard of and it rocked the monarchy. It also led the way for Elizabeth to become queen. Regardless of the history aspect, the movie is told very well and creates good emotions for the main characters. Colin Firth's Oscar was well deserved. And, honestly, it was nice to have a movie without the violence and sex, thrown in just because it sells. I'm don't mind them when necessary and am far from a prude, but it was nice to just have a simple story.
1609613937|5.0|The updated info is very helpful and I was shocked at how good the recipes are. You would think that a low fat, plant based diet would be boring but it isn't. I've lost about 13 pounds so far and haven't been hungry or bored with the food yet. This is the perfect book to go along with the Forks Over Knives documentary.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|At first I thought this would be just another tower defense game, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was so much more. It took a minute to get used to the auto-attack feature, but it provided a more immersive combat experience. Not being able to play easier levels to farm cash gives an added challenge,but the various allies and spells are well thought out. Alhouh this does have a real cash market, the items for sale are not necessary to enjoy the game.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album is the BEST!!!  Adam's vocals SHINE thru all the songs!!  Never Close Your Eyes thru listening to this album--you will miss something!!!!

B007MJ9LA2|1.0|Easy listening or elevator music best describes the first half or more of this one.  Respect for most of his previous albums should not cloud the assessment of this one.  It is not enjoyable to listen to.  It does not draw me back to it.  It's just bad.  I gave it one star only to be able to complete the review.

1423113462|5.0|Many of the characters we've grown to know and love in the \\"Percy Jackson\\" series are back for this first installment in \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\" series, but the focus of the story revolves around three newcomers: Jason (a blonde teen with no memory prior to waking up on a bus full of troublesome teens), Piper (a girl of Cherokee descent with a famous dad, a history of changing schools, and a knack for getting people to give her whatever she asks for... even a car) and Leo (a Hispanic boy who is apt to run away ever since his beloved mom died in a fire... something he feels extreme guilt over).  These three teen have made it longer than most before being claimed by their godly parents, and have somehow managed to survive.  But when they are suddenly attacked by storm spirits, Annabeth comes to collect them, believing that by doing so she'd find Percy - because he's gone missing.<br /><br />But since Jason appears to be suffering from amnesia, and according to Chiron \\"should be dead\\" things only continue to get more troublesome and soon the new three are setting off on a quest together.<br /><br />The story is told from the three character's perspectives, about three chapters each before switching to the next one, and the transitions are seamless and flow incredibly well!  And I adored each of the three characters in their own right.<br /><br />I loved the Percy Jackson series and love this first installment here!  The characters are a little older (starting at about 15 or 16).  And even though this book is quite lengthy, it didn't feel that way at all and was a very quick and engaging read.  And the way Riordan weaves the stories of the gods into a current tale is, dare I say it, rather genius.  And I was totally surprised and impressed by some of the plot surprises.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to start book two!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hours of fun for free! I love the variety of games! A challenge on each one. This app is worth your time
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not a bad game for having over 100 games in one app. only problem is to unlock games costs to many points
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It lives up to the media hype. It's entertaining and provoking. Its a light read, not much thinking involved, no crazy plots or complicated character personality to keep track of. It's a mindless journey of sex and lust. It's the xxx version of \\"Twighlight\\"... Which is most adult twihard fans fantasy come true.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is fun . filled with good stuff to keep you playing. this game is very  highly additive! !
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|So worth the wait. Besides the awesome production with leading musicians, the writing and the delivery are pure Adam.  Dance, love, cry and be inspired.
0817439390|5.0|This book is a must have for the budding photographer! Very practical tips and hands on advice with pictures to help show what you're aiming for.  No nonsense and simply stated language that really helps make sense of what can sometimes be confusing information.
B0071MV540|5.0|Fun movie, keeps moving, nice mix of comedy. Enjoyed the cast and story, not what I expected, much better!  Eddie Murphy's role seemed short.....love Matthew Broderick!
B00785P2QC|5.0|well yea yea well yea and yea Love the build your own thing better than this guy needs help. ^.^
B007H7XJD4|5.0|Prompt delivery.  Product as described.  Purchased this film for our growing blue-ray library.  Great price and picture quality.  Have already watched this 2 or 3 times with friends.  It does not get old.  Would recommend this film to a friend for an action packed movie night.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|It tells you 5 strengths it's very precise how it picks those top 5 so the assessment is pretty long
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|This is a strange blend of atmospheric art-house film with flashes of sepia-toned memories of childhood or former lovers, and a grim survival tale in the beautiful Alaskan wilderness. While this could be an interesting mix to create a high-brow narrative of daring and clever escape, it doesn't add up to much. There are no real ideas here, the entire film could have been a brilliant 20 minutes of lovely, grim determination, but instead it keeps repeating the same tale: survive the wolves in the cold. That's it. For an hour and a half. The photography, acting, directing -- all are top notch, but the story is just... uneventful, which is a high-brow way of saying boring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are different. some are more challenging than others. its a good app if you are bored. give it a try.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|The author of this book keeps you on the edge of your chair with wonder of what's next.<br />The editing for the Kindle version leaves much to be desired.<br />There are many typos.
0143119680|5.0|This is an extremely well written and researched story that spans diverse disciplines such as alchemy, history, and a remarkably self consistent scientific inclusion of what it means to be a witch (or some other creature or human). The mystery is well handled and unfolds very gradually. This is sort of a grownup Harry Potter type story about a witch finding her true self. The author has done her research and should earn praise for the thoughtfulness put into the story elements. The only part of the content with which I had difficulty was a relatively weak female protagonist who appears to need a strong male to \\"complete\\" her. Having daughters of my own, and having tried to ensure their confidence, I personally prefer strong female characters. However, and I want to emphasize this, in this first novel of the trilogy, this perceived weakness attribute of the female lead possibly could be more device than defect, and so readers who sense the same should probably reserve being too judgmental as the story unfolds in books two and three. The author may be setting us up for a shift in character roles. Recall that Harry Potter transformed from a helpless dependent child into a powerful wizard.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Potter, you may enjoy this. This trilogy will likely easily morph into a movie script.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|What can I say; I love listening to Michael Bublé.  This album had songs that were not on other Bublé CDs that I own. Glad it was available through Amazon.<br /><br />Colleen
B0053KWDES|5.0|I read many many reviews on the FiiO E11 pocket amplifier, and all of them were correct.  The design and quality of this pocket amp is very impressive.  Built-in rechargeable battery, high quality connectors, metal casing, metal protective transport case and includes USB cable (Mini B to USB) connector to charge.  The audio reproduction and quality of this amp is amazing, as it even powers a pair of Sennhesier HD 558's (50 ohm) without breaking a sweat, and even on volume 4, this sounds simply amazing.  I don't know how FiiO have managed to make something so compact but miraculously power high end cans without any issues.  I can't recommend this amp enough.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I just love Game of Thones and had to have the first season.  I've been watching the second season and will purchase that as well when it's available.  Thanks to HBO for such a great series.
0312641893|5.0|I originally bought this book because I loved the cover.  It's definitely one that I wanted on my shelf as a hardback because it's beautiful.  But this book has everything I could ever want in a book to read, as well!  Cyborgs, aliens, the hint of mutant wolves!  Love it!  I wanted to hold off on recommending it to people until I was sure that the author made good on the promise of all the story lines that were started in the beginning but I now have no problem telling people what a great book it is.  I'm looking forward to the next books in the series.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|For ensemble superhero movies, \\"The Avengers\\" is about as good as it gets.  It offers good acting, good dialogue, good direction and great production values.  Hats off to Joss Wheldon for getting all his superheroes enough screen time for character development, while honoring the Marvel universe created by recent movies.  Props to Scarlett Johansson for developing the back story of Black Widow and for holding her own with the guys in the action department.  Props also to Mark Ruffalo for his nuanced interpretation of hapless scientist Bruce Banner and his raging alter-ego the Hulk.<br /><br />The plot is straight-forward.  Banished Asgard demi-god Loki finds a way back to Earth courtesy of the Tesseract power source and an alien civilization looking to invade.  The first casualty is Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) SHIELD headquarters, leveled in a savage attack.  Fury summons the Avengers (Ironman, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Hawkeye, and the Black Widow), who will be forced to build some teamwork on the fly as Fury's floating aircraft carrier (wow!) also comes under attack.  The climatic sequence will be the defense of New York City by the Avengers against a seemingly unstoppable horde of aliens pouring through a wormhole in space.<br /><br />The movie leaves plenty of room for a nice sequel if the current cast can be kept intact (watch through the credits for a hint of what might be next).  The movie is fairly long at two and a half hours, but the fight scenes are good and the movie is highly recommended to fans of the Marvel superhero comics and movies.
1400069289|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because it used science to back up its claims. I'm a firm believer that habits drive most of what we do and establishing good habits can make life much more enjoyable. I agree with the author that you can't get rid of bad habits, you can only replace them. How often have we seen people give up smoking only to gain weight? Unfortunately that happens far more often than smokers taking up running because making positive habit changes is hard. At the end of the book the author gives an easy to follow method for identifying key components of bad habits so you can make habit changes that will be more lasting. The only disappointment with the book was the last 25% was all footnotes. If you're looking to change or help others change this is a worthwhile read.
B001F12J0C|4.0|The DVD's arrived in mint condition, still shrink wrapped.  Shipping time was very acceptable.  I would have liked to know that the DVD's are not full-screen (probably not filmed in HD).
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Really well researched and well done - the best and most honest Bob film, and possibly the best reggae doc there is. Some particular strong points include talking with and about Bob's extended family on the Marley side - everything else on Bob always simplifies this side of things. Bunny was also uncharacteristically forthcoming, although I thought a bit more about Tosh would have helped. A final nitpick - showing Channel One while talking about Studio 1... hmmmmm<br /><br />But this movie is 99.9999% on point - you will do well to watch it.
B000000HHE|5.0|this album is de la soul best album and one of the best hip hop albums period. it's full of that golden age sound. with a touch of jazz and it's even better with a bonus disc of rare songs. so do de la soul a favor and buy the stingin thing. it's well worth it.
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|Very slow moving. The problem with this film is the writing itself. The story is just dull. The dialogue is just dull. The movie has competent enough actors, but they tended to over act with a lifeless script. The climax is pretty good, but I have seen better. But I don't know if I would want to sit through this just to see a 5 minute climatic scene.<br /><br />Good for a Redbox rental if you have seen everything else in the box.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. I play it all day thanks for letting me play all the time.vyeyv.  hey. hey hey.
B000VSYDRM|2.0|The begining sounded as though we would be hearing a tale more upbeat, even with a murder. And honestly, I had higher hopes with Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman being in it. And I have heard from flutely-tuty reviewers of how highly 'scented' the movie was to break away from main stream hollywood. Bla bla, I love a great indie. I even like noir. This was noir-navore (carnavore,get it? lol) Ok, seriously, to me a movie lover, not a cult movie lover, I really didn't like it, sorry. What's a movie without an ending to reminisce? Can we really be expected to enjoy the last 'drops', and be told to enjoy it like the movie? To be seduced into a romantic version of why you really liked the movie, but were afraid to say it was crappy? The emperor and his clothes kind of thing? Yeah, save yourself those precious hours and find another movie.
0439023513|2.0|***Spoilers***<br /><br />In this book Katniss seemed to be more selfish.  Her great heroine characteristics were gone.  She does everything, even her last brave act, because of her own personal reasons more than the greater good.  The final villian is hardly even present for most of the book.  No one seems to be happy in the end.  The one person that seems to truly find happiness dies abruptly near the end.<br /><br />I loved the the first two books, but I did not care for this one.  I felt sorry for Peeta in the end.  Sure, he ended up with the woman he wanted, but she never seemed to love him at all.  She just used him to make herself feel better.  He was like a morphling drug.  I always thought that Peeta deserved to be with someone who really loved him--and I thought that if he ended up with Katniss, that her love for him would blossom.  In the end Katniss just seems to settle for Peeta because he was there and gave her comfort--and Gale was no longer an option because he was responsible for killing her sister.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I keep on restarting my file because I keep on finding better ways to do it oh yeah this game is awesome
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Caused my kindle to freeze up. Had to force shut down to get out of the game. Played it one time for about ten minutes then deleted it. You know what they say, \\"you get what you pay for.\\" This product is free and there is a reason, cause it's a free piece of junk software. AVOID it.
