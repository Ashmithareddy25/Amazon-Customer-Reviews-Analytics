B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a fun and interesting game. Very intriguing and progressively challenging. I can't wait to get further into the game when I can try the larger grids!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was able to download book easily and fast then read the book faster than I thought possible. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|First a word about the format, used a Kindle App on an Ipad. Worked so well, was my second ebook reading.<br /><br />A great book about a great man, not a perfect man but  a great man.
B0086700CM|4.0|Definatly a great app! i had it on my ipad and now on kindke fire. i recommend it but the only issue with it is sometimes on the kindle fire, it gets veey pixelated and weird but over all great app
B002CGLX3S|5.0|This is one of the best songs of the previous century. I remember hearing it for the first time and talking with my mother about the lyrics and what they meant.
B001UV4XX8|4.0|I would like to rate this movie with five stars. But It was a little boring on some scenes. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the movie. I think the crazy part is when the husband is walking out of the library and a few man are right on top of him, fallowing him. And when he walks in a room where people were sitting and readying. Right before he walked passed a table everyone at the table stopped and kept their eyes on him. In tell they were told to stand. I think that was pretty scary. All and all this was a good movie.
034580404X|5.0|I have read these books several times and they get better every time I read them.....I just hope the movie can be half as good as the books.<br />It will all depend on the casting I guess.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was the first book I read with an interview style to it and I just loved it. Max Brooks did an amazing job and I've never talked to anyone who hasn't liked the book. I love how he took different locations all over the world and gave them their own intriguing stories. It is hard to pick a favorite passage from the monkeys on the bridge in India to the French fighting through the sewer system. The book kept me enthralled the entire time and had the occasional light touch while maintaining its intensity the entire way through. Absolutely haunting!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Its so kewl! I love how you can edit the pics to look so many differnt ways! much better than i hoped! 5stars from me!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved this series, but was disappointing that there were only three episode in this season. They should have made it longer, and left the ending open for that possibility. A must own.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is a great game I don't see all of the problems you guys are talking about its not the game thats the problem.
0811875555|5.0|I really enjoyed looking through all the pages. i especially liked all the drawings of the characters, and how the animators put the movie together.  So this helped me see the process, and an appreciation of what they can do from an idea.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is really addicting and fun it is a strategy game were you summon soldgers and they fight the enemy you control your caractor.and.buy upgrades. sometimes it takes me to a screen and I don't know how to get out but its a fun game
B00001OH7P|5.0|One of many masterpieces from this gifted singer.
B000K7MMP4|1.0|Only 3 of the 5 episodes are avalible to watch on Amazon!  You can't buy them!!  Only episodes 1, 3, and 5 can be viewed as I write this review.  Why put them here when you can't see them all is beyond my understanding.  Shame on you Amazon for tricking me into watching the 1st and left me hanging for the 2nd!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Not your boring everyday crime show. The banter between Castle and Becket will leave you in stitches. He is so far out in left field with wild stories of how the crime came to be and she is so focused on just the facts. These opposite sides collide which solves the crime but with a few twists and turns. I never figure it out until close to the end.  The characters are so well written but what else would you expect of the creator of the Rockford Files. Even the supporting characters are warm and charming.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|There were parts of this book I absolutely adored as an author. It is far more captivating than the first, even though I loved meeting Ana and Christian, in Fifty Shades of Grey. The charity ball, for one, reminds me of the surreal glamour, like in the Great Gatsby. I won't give anything away, but the best part of the book was an intense moment between Ana and Christian when they both break down together. I love what E.L. does with characterization and the twisted complexity of these two people trying to figure it out. Books are all about the characters to me and their uniqueness, she definitely does not disappoint.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great game played it for two hours and it was so much fun I think everyone would get this game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game to eat up some time. . . . . .<br /><br />plus its freeeeee. . . . . . . .
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Beautiful disasters is a young, fun and carefree book which I really enjoyed reading.  That young desperate love draws you in making it impossible to put down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|nice working app on kindle fire.looks and  works great. thanks for a nice product.<br />A+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />word word word word word word
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Jamie McGuire is an amazing writer and this was a great an example. It's a great story with great character development. If you're looking for more like this read The Slammed Series.
B005YCZLT4|5.0|Like most the version that are not in spanish but there are some songs in spanish that are very good highly recommended -
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game has simple puzzle mechanics but is quite difficult to master... and it's surprisingly addictive. The annoying menu system is the only real problem.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|I love this movie. I am a  huge scifi fan. this is a mind twister..... I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mind twister
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the books -  great storyline no matter what others say aboutt the sexual content, type of books that make you feel all kinds of emotions, from crying to anticipation. A real spell binder that you don' t want to put down.
0201721481|4.0|When I unwrapped the package, the book seemed to stay in a warehouse so long--the condition is not so good. But the content must be very good, so four star.
B002TQ3OBU|5.0|Very impressive experimental progressive, with two parts of the sky moves sideways and in the second disc the whole Sky moves sideways, Is heavy the duration of the songs -
0743496728|5.0|Summer reading for son.  Didn't want to wait for a copy from the library, or pay the rediculous bookstore prices.  Found both books needed on-line in \\"used\\" (didn't even look like the splines had been broken!) condition that were not only in fantastic shape, but also incredible prices!  Quick delivery as well.  Thx!
B0067Q42BY|2.0|game is very lame with the whole quest and travel through china. it's too much like a comic book crossed with a kid's version of mahjong. if you actually play mahjong then you won't like this game as it seem childish and too easy. there are a lot of wild cards.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved reading this! Has beed the best series I have read, I read it so quickly because you get so wrapped up in the books. I strongly suggest this book to anyone looking for a good series to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a really good game for people who like fun challenging games. Its challenging but not too hard and VERY rewarding! I think you'll love this game!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome series! I'm not a reader and I couldn't put these books down!  Full of suspense and romance at the same time!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I didn't think that this would be that good of a movie. I was not aware of the books, so the name \\"John Carter\\" didn't really ring any bells. And the trailer I had seen did spark much interest either.<br /><br />But when I saw it, I loved it! It's a great science fantasy adventure, with a well-designed world and an interesting plot. And the ending leaves you wanting more!<br /><br />I quickly looked to see if sequels were forthcoming- but then I learned of the box-office flop- so buy this film, and maybe, just maybe we can see a sequel eventually.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Starts off a bit Mills and Boons but keep reading as it definitely gets so much better and you won't be able to put it down!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game! Everything is great but the down side is that you  have to purchase stuff to get anywhere or you have to wait for ever! So everything is great exept for that.
0984334904|5.0|I browsed around at a few different kanji flashcard products, knowing that Sino-Japanese characters would play a big role in my ongoing studies. Well, I was lucky to find these, because they really do what I need them to do.<br /><br />More than anything, these are cards for the serious learner who wants a rigorous experience. They include several vocabulary on each card, some of which are introductory and others of which are more specialized. I appreciate the variety. Also very important is a feature that many publishers willfully, and inexplicably, ignore: the kanji readings are printed exclusively in hiragana and katakana. No romaji here. If you're not familiar with romaji, you're not missing out. It's the romanized form of the Japanese alphabetic system, and is only for extreme beginners. Before anyone picks up these cards, they really need to learn hiragana and katakana. It's beyond me why so many flashcards try to shield learners from actually learning the script. Go figure. Additionally, the Chinese reading for each character is listed in katakana, which is standard practice in Japan. I appreciate that the publisher didn't cut corners or play to the lowest common denominator, and instead produced a professional product.<br /><br />The price on this set may scare you away. Don't let it. These are a worthy investment for those who take fluency in Japanese seriously. The long-term value here lies in their capacity for reuse. You can look back at the early cards and still learn something new, because the sample vocabulary goes beyond simple words like \\"train\\" and \\"big\\" to those including \\"apple tree\\" and \\"geometry.\\" What's more, buying the other two volumes (2 and 3) will bring you up to speed with high school students in Japan. By the time you finish with this series, you will be able to read characters in any standard print materials.<br /><br />The cards are laid out efficiently and pack a useful amount of information. The stroke order is included, and if youchoose to study the writing using these cards, you will appreciate that. Perhaps even more useful is a listing of similar-looking characters. If you haven't yet confused \\"between\\" and \\"listen\\" or \\"noon\\" and \\"cow,\\" you will soon discover the value of those cross-references. On a more practical note, I have been impressed with the durability of the cards. They are coated well, in a manner similar to playing cards.<br /><br />I am thoroughly impressed with these flashcards. Give them a shot.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty shades of dysfunctional, juvenile, archaic young relationships. An awful example for young, educated women about young love. Is this really an example of modern America?
0805095535|5.0|Paul Auster, never heard of him until I chose this book.  The title intrigued me, then I read the back cover and knew I had to read \\"Winter Journal\\". To paraphrase the author he  tells us everything starts in the body and everything will end in the body.  This connected with me because I have often thought about how much of our lives is lived inside ourselves, in our minds, emotions, etc... So I unwrapped the book when it came in the mail and before the mail came the next day I had finished Mr. Austers wonderful book.  To \\"hear\\" someone express their inner thoughts about events in their life is invigorating, how much like each other are we in certain circumstnaces? Is it true that most of us really are similar in our actions and reactions?  Yes, and no. I really admire the writer for being able to put his inner most thoughts, pains,joys, fears on paper for the whole world to read.  Besides that I love were Mr. Auster alludes to the thought that we are known by our faces, almost exclusively, to others our faces is who we are, and yet we rarely see our own faces.<br />Paul Auster has inspired me with his \\"Winter Journal\\" to start a journal of my own that I will pass down to my children and husband. Perhaps they will know me better if I can get down those inner feelings on paper. I know I will enjoy trying.  And I thank Mr. Auster for the inspiration to give it a try.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I cant even begin to describe how amazing this app wa for me. So many sound options and best of all its a free app. I'm just really glad I found it :))
0743564413|4.0|Hemingway - Initially, the story and character development seems slow and my wife wanted to stop (too boring).  However, things do progress and become more interesting as the story advances.  By the second half, it becomes an enjoyable travelogue of bohemian entertainment, drinking and conversation.  There is a lot of drinking (hey, its Europe in 1924).  The best parts are his descriptions of the bullfighters and bullfighting.  Really masterful. 8 out of 10<br /><br />William Hurt - could have been better.  Some characters sounded the same, making it confusing to follow the storyline.  4 out of 10
B004P4S4NM|4.0|This album is excellent. Beautiful voice & this is one of only a few albums I can say I enjoy each & every track.
B004IQMXD4|2.0|Firstly, I am a HUGE Stevie Nicks fan.  I love her work.  However, I have to say that I do not particularly like this album.  In fact, I have listened to it about three times, and can not listen to it again.  My view is perhaps tainted in that I have heard some of the songs as demo tunes before and as I found the demos great, was surprised at how much she had allowed those lovely demos to be butchered.  I agree with other reviewers this is not the best work from Stevie, and after the great Trouble In Shangri-La, I expected an album full of great songs.  Sadly, it feels to me like Stevie is simply churning out an album to meet a contract obligation perhaps?<br />I am not going to write tons of things trashing Stevie's album, that has already been done and for the most part I have to say, sadly, I am in complete agreeance with the negative comments.  However, it does not stop me hoping that her next release will be one I can stamp five stars on.  However, from now on Stevie, I will be making sure I fully sample your next release before spending money on it.<br />To sum up: I find this album boring and uninspiring.  It is a collection of less than worthy lyrics set to some terribly (possibly rushed) music.  Sorry Stevie, this is one album that is destined to collect dust on a shelf.
B007PKOKTK|2.0|\\"The word pariah came into English from Tamil paraiyar, the plural of paraiyan, which literally means 'drummer' and comes from the word parai, the name of a drum used at certain festivals... Its use in English and its extension in meaning probably owe much to the long period of British rule in India.\\" -American Heritage Dictionary<br /><br />Russell Brand is the voice of the Easter Bunny's teenage son, who decides to travel to Hollywood to become a drummer in a rock band instead of succeeding his father on Easter Island.

0553593544|5.0|The Bourne Identity<br />By Robert Ludlum<br /><br />Off a small island in the Mediterranean a man is found floating in the ocean. The man has no memory of who he is and how he came to be floating in the ocean clinging to a plank. He is taken to a doctor who has been tending to him upon his awakening the doctor tries to help him remember the man has had extensive facial reconstruction and something implanted in his hip that has a bank account number on it. The man follows the bank account lead and begins to discover very odd things about himself, that he has an uncanny knowledge of how to kill without being detected, how to blend in to his surroundings and even how to change his appearance so thoroughly no one will recognize him, but how does he know these things?<br /><br />I have never seen any of the Bourne movies and this is my first spy novel so I had no idea what to expect. I guess I didn't expect there to be so much discussion on every little thing and I had thought there would be a lot more action. There were times when I desperately wanted to tell the author to get to the point, or at least back to the fun action parts, but when it did come to the action it was so well written and intense I would feel even more irritated when I had to sit through more debate. Not only was this novel a brilliant action packed story but also a love story, Jason Bourne meets takes a woman hostage but then the hostage begins to be his only ally and the bond they form is remarkable. This was a well written and thoroughly addictive story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a wonderful book to read.  I will disclaimer my review that I am * young at heart but not young adult.  I had no expectations of this book, only great reviews, which I did not read.  I jumped into this book.  I smiled, I laughed, I cried.  What a story of life on the terms of reality when dealt the card of illness; cancer to be direct.  Personally, I have been touched since May with facing untimely deaths and this book was just what I needed; another touch of loving reality.  Life is so good...grab the gusto.
0451232577|5.0|Excellent historical novel, truly a jewel, on par with the great \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"<br />Page turner, captivatingly takes you into the world of historical drama and excitement,<br />rich complex characters, drama, love and unexpected twists. Thumbs up.
B003RYA17I|5.0|I was given as a present !! ..... what terrific power has Jordi EVER, high respect not only for ancient spanish music but as well for all ANCIENT music, shows education, respect, cooperation with those musics highly well-known and educated on their native music and conforms with them a FULL MASTERPIECE ..... thanks for that .....
B001HM1PFO|5.0|IF THIS IS NOT IN YOUR COLLECTION OF ALL TIME FAVORITES, YOU ARE MISSING A CLASSIC EXPERIENCE IN YOUR LIFE!!! \\"LOVE IT\\"...
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have been a lover for the classic Science Fiction and to see this one finally on the big screen is a testament to the words \\"Worth the wait\\".<br /><br />Despite the critics, and proponents to this film, I found it was overall a classic in it's own right  It reminded me of when I was younger and seeing classics like the Time Machine coming to the big screen for the first time.  I had no problem with the pace, the dialog, and the actors were a sheer wonder.  I strongly recommend this film and consider it a classic.
030758836X|5.0|....when I cannot put a book down, take off work to read, that is a great sign of a good read.  Gone Girl was that kind of a wild ride.  Loved it, great fun, keep wondering, some predictability, but next turn, wow.  Loved the whole package - cover to cover.  Well done.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is a fantastic novel. The characters develop extremely well, the plot is intricate yet not confusing or misleading and its a fresh story.  I imagine that every publisher who passed on this guy will really regret it shortly, this has the makings of a truly great start to something special.  I've read literally hundreds of authors and Anthony Ryan is right up there with any of the greats.  Thank goodness we have ebooks to make these rare gems available to us when idiot publishers are missing the boat on such obvious treasures.<br /><br />Give this one a shot - its not short, its not cheap and isn't full of cliche plot devices.
B008A1NSTG|1.0|The movie never downloaded properly.  I could not watch it or bring it up on my Kindle.  All the other movies worked, however this one did not.
B00027JYLC|5.0|If you haven't seen this... YOU HAVE TOO!  Great classic film.  Real freaks, great story and very entertaining.  A little creepy.. a little strange.... but very good.  Not many people have heard of this movie better yet seen it.  It's worth the price and I believe a must have for ANY film collection.  A true gem of cinematic history.
0316023744|5.0|I am a huge fan of Antony Beevor's books on WWII and his book on the Spanish Civil War was good, too.  It is the only book I could find on that war that was for the general reader - not expensive books for specialists.  This book is a step above most of the many books on the Second World War because Beevor's writing style and the extra attention he pays to parts of this war some authors skim over.  A great read, buy it!<br />If you like WWII histories, be sure to read his other titles on it.  All of them fantastic.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it daily and really enjoy it. the syncing makes it super useful for studying and sharing. I would recommend it to anyone.
0345803485|5.0|Excellent book, great price, fast shipping. I would order again and recommend others to order as well...looking for a new book to order now.

B005H5H3LW|3.0|A well made anime to real life movie. Yes it could of had more space fights and a better evil alien but all in all it is entertaining.
0062071017|5.0|A well written book!  It has helped me reframe my ideas for leading our mid-sized business.  I've purchased over 20 copies to deliver as gifts to fellow business-folks!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|You couldn't ask for a better blend of classic and \\"new\\" Christmas music. Buble's thrown in a few fun renditions, a new song or two, and his version of White Christmas with Shania Twain is amazing. I usually stick to the old standards like Bing and Nat, but Buble blew me away with this album. It's going in the regular holiday rotation, for sure!
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I fell asleep in the first 45 minutes if you need something to help you sleep and don't want to use a sleeping pill this is for you.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I totally loved this movie...except for the \\"treatment\\", which I think was totally gross and totally unnecessary.  I close my eyes every time I watch the movie when it comes to that part. Armie Hammer was especially adorable as the prince.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I don't know if anyone else has noticed, this &quot;update&quot; is the previous version (2.1.1), it was on 2.2.0<br />good thing I made a backup with Titanium Backup when it told me I had to uninstall first...

0545265355|5.0|This series is totally engrossing.  Don't buy it unless you have time to read.  Once you start, you will not want to but it down.
1932735410|5.0|This is the best book on learning project management in a structured way and to take the PMI certification. I strongly recommend it together with their application with exam questions. Really useful!<br /><br />I went through the book once, then went to one of their classes, then passed through the book again, took 3 exam simulations on the software and took the PMP certification with Proficiency. Their program really helped.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is just fun I like having this app is is very very very awesome I have lot of fun

B008764ZQ4|4.0|Needed something to use my credit on so this was it.  A nice collection to get some of the more well known songs.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I love, love, love Liam Nieson (sp?) in anything he does...(oops, I'm drooling on my keypad)! The movie, although it kept my attention, was so predictable...until the ending.  I am going to watch it again because of the ending but, for me, that made all the difference between this movie and the one it reminded me of, The Edge. As with these kind of stories, it's a view into the true human instinct to survive at ALL cost...its always interesting to have that human dynamic laid out in raw form in front of you.  What is amazing to me about those of us watching this type of human  survival unfold we always try to place ourselves above the treachery it might take to accomplish our goal.  Anyway, the movie is good with lots of action.  The dialogue, however, was rather difficult to hear.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the book thinking I was NOT going to like it but promised someone I would at least give it a try.  Now I am hooked and almost done with the third book!  Very good and I am very impressed!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I unfortunately bought this book after hearing the hype and I wish I hadn't supported its continued sales figures. Painful prose and the plot read like a cross between the famous five, american psycho and 9 1/2 weeks.<br />A shame this book has had so much exposure when there are so many more worthy authors out there trying to get some exposure to their work.
B0040GYAOM|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this album!  I highly recommend this to any Elvis lover.  It's amazing that the songs you're listening to were all number 1 hits! A must for any Elvis fan.
B004Z98B1M|5.0|I had been trying to see this movie for quite sometime.  I wanted to share this with my grandchildren.  After watching the movie I had the opinion that the movie was not just for kids.....it was for everyone because it had a moral to the story.  I explained to my grandchildren that what the movie was trying to tell everyone is that you should never wait to go after your dreams and that if you find yourself years later not having fulfilled your dreams you should not get discouraged...go on and go for it no matter how others may perceive your undertaking.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|When I dropped my Kindle Fire I cringed thinking something would be broken.  Thank goodness for the case as it is still like brand new....great product and for the price, highly recommended!

B007YOC4RW|5.0|A must for any modern blues fan. Joe is a phenom with the guitar and he surrounds himself with great talent. This is a typical JB cd I don't like all the songs but, the ones I like get turned all the way up. I bought tickets to see him in Toledo two days after buying this cd.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Amy is a wonderful wife with a past that has thrown her into the limelight from childhood through the children's books that her Mother wrote about 'Amazing Amy'  who could do no wrong and was the heroine in every case.  Amy continued through life trying to live up to those expectations.  The story continues through high school and her craving for attention and always coming out on top to her marriage and life with 'the perfect man'.  When things started turning away from 'Amazing Amy' she has to make them turn around to present her in the best of light and things get bad.  Very intriguing as they look for Amy who goes missing casting blame on her husband.  Now you have to read the book -- well worth the time.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|I saw this film in the theater and it's a product of the time and culture in 2008 when it emerged. Although many praised this film when it came out and a truck load of accolades have been dumped on it by a fan base that is almost fundamentalist in it's devotion to comic books films, both time and circumstances are putting things into a broader and more mature perspective. Several things should be pointed out now about the film-DVD.<br /><br />First, as many have pointed out already It's not a PG-13 movie. Nolan got under the R rating simply by removing images of blood. Added to the fact that it's a comic book film this ratings misnomer lead people to believe that they could take their children to the theater to watch it. I saw children of all ages in the theater when it came out and I'm sure on DVD parents figure PG-13 means safe to watch.....it's not. 'Dark Knight' is an adult film for mature audiences that understand metaphors and deeper life themes. It's for people who have life experience and can use that to separate reality from fan boy fiction. But at the end of the day were talking about a fictional character in a silly looking costume. There is more to be learned from real people who have lived real lives and confronted real evils through out history. It's time to grow up.<br /><br />Secondly, America is going nuts because it has lost it's center. It is now a battle of the lobbyists and the fundamentalists. On the right you have the drug, financial and business lobbys and everything from people who believe that Obama is a crypto muslim, that Christ will return soon just before a soon to be apocalypse, and bigger guns are a right and the solution. On the left you have the environmental, racial, and lawyer lobbyists plus the hijacking of media journalism which has created fear and division and driven the rise of conservative talk radio, you have an inordinate focus on sex and violence to the point of nausea, and you have people who firmly believe there is no God and all faiths are useless.  It is nearly impossible to stand in the middle of all this and raise a rational truth to the forefront that unites instead of endlessly dividing. People just give up smoke pot, watch CSI, sports, porn, and celebrity news and hope it all goes away. We need wise men to step forward to create a new culture that fosters unity. Spiderman, the Avengers, and Batman aren't going to save the world.<br /><br />Lastly, It's been 4 years since the films release and the war in Iraq is won and over and off the news cycle. The Joker as a metaphor for international islamic terrorism and Batman as a metaphor for the democratic west has given way to the Joker as a metaphor for domestic terrorism both islamic(Nidal Hasan) and homegrown (Jared Loughner). And whats becoming evident now in a post Colorado shooting world is that America is a boiling pot and people are on the brink.  And for some reason Movies are pushing the mentally unstable over the edge. Like clockwork now and maybe even at an accelerated rate their seems to be a spate of violent attacks by Americans upon the innocent.<br /><br />Additionally people are losing their jobs, on over prescribed and dubious pharmaceutical drugs, breaking up with their wives/girlfriends, losing their houses etc. etc. Fear and paranoia are setting in just like during the cold war years. More prisons and SWAT teams are not the answer they are just band aids that arrive after the fact. Who cares about prison sentences and response times, find out the cause and make it stop before it happens. I can no longer sit and watch the Matrix or the Dark Knight because it just isn't fun or interesting to watch anymore when you know that somewhere in America, someone is about to lose their marbles, murder a child, shoot people in their house of worship, rape, steal, create chaos and foster anarchy. It wasn't always this way. America was never perfect but it used to be a peaceful nation, hard working, relaxed, united in it'spurpose, confident, enjoying it's enormous freedoms, raising it's children, going to church, going for walks in the park. Where did we go wrong?<br /><br />Since we look to film so much for our guidance consider the words of King Theoden - \\"Simbelmyne [a flower]........Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.....No parent should have to bury their child..........Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. How did it come to this?\\"<br /><br />Take a snapshot of 2012 and file it away, it's a dark time in America and there is no comic book hero to save us.
B004ZNB12O|4.0|This compilation is about as good as it can be given a single disc limitation.  Most of those reviews that complain include lists of songs that in total could not possibly fit on a single disc so their arguments are pointless.  I like the inclusion of \\"Have a Cigar\\" on this disc and the flow of songs from one to the other is as good as one could want.<br /><br />My comments here are with the remaster.  In comparing \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" from 2001's \\"Echoes\\" 2-Disc hits package with the one here, I can not hear any difference in clarity or sound volume between the two.  Sounds EXACTLY the same.  So was this 2011 disc re-reemastered as an improvement over 2001's Echoes?  I don't think so.  For that reason there is no reason to get this CD if you have Echoes (unless you have to have a cigar).
B006WXHJTO|5.0|Eugene Levy was fantastic in this movie.  This was the best American Pie movie yet.  Loved all the movies and this was either the best or second best American Pie movie in the series.
B0044WUQ3G|5.0|I watched it and enjoyed it however, Please Remake This Movie...  The story had a solid base but what it lacked was anyone who has ever been in the wild, cold, someone who had to make decisions in a life threatening moment.  For the remake, forget the tension between the new couple and the third wheel.  The dynamic of three skiers being stranded on a lift proved itself (except for in California where the Ski Patrol skies for 30 minutes after the lifts are closed to ensure this kinda event doesn't happen...  Perhaps the Ski Patrol doesn't do the same for smaller resorts in other states, sobeit...)...  I am an Eagle Scout and have been in many situations where decisions had to be made quickly.  When the lift stopped my first thought would have been to use the clothes that WE were wearing.  Tuck in your hair and tighten your hood...  Use your knit cap and cover your face...  The third wheel had a hood but never put it on!  He had it behind him the whole movie.  She could have tucked her hair in her coat, used her cap to cover her face, and drawn her hood and snitched her water-proof hood over her face for the entire movie.  The three of them could have use body heat until the morning and then tied their clothing as a rope to lower someone enough to safely fall to the snow below.  And the bigest WFT was why did she not protect her ungloved hand and hold onto to the biggest heat sink around her?...  I watched it and enjoyed it however, someone, anyone who has ever had to survive the cold, join the technical team in support of the remake of what could have been a truly five star movie...
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|The movie JOHN CARTER was not something I was that excited to see.  I had seen previews of it in the theater prior to the feature film and thought I would not like to see it; however, my son who is a cadet at USAFA and is a pretty tough guy, highly recommeded it.  When he came home on leave, we watched it together.  This movie was fantastic.  I could not believe that it had not done well at the box office!!!  It has all the elements of a great story, really good character development, lots of action, and best of all; it has a superb ending.  A great ending is crucial to the overall feeling that a person has when he or she walks out of a theatre.  This movie should have received awards.  I give it 5 stars and would highly recommend it if you like a good action movie with a completed plot and great ending.  This movie is one of my all time favorites!!!!
B006G3Z41A|2.0|My expectations going into this film were not particularly high--I knew it had been labeled as \\"torture porn\\" by some, and that it was't a particularly high-brow movie. But with Quentin Tarantino as producer, I thought maybe this would be slightly a cut above, or at least on par with movies like \\"Saw\\". Boy was I wrong...<br /><br />Before we even get to any real action, the viewer must sit through a 45-minute introduction in which Eli Roth tries to insult his audience's intelligence in every possible way. Almost every single character is a cardboard cut-out stereotype--no imagination is used in building them up as characters. Our focus is on two Americans and one Icelandic tourist, who represent in every way an extreme example of ignorant, obnoxious Americanized tourists. Their only goals in Europe seem to be getting laid and pissing off locals for no reason (this behavior is presented as normal, and in fact the one character who is hesitant to sleep with prostitutes in Amsterdam is later presumed gay by another character). In this introductory part of the movie, the audience also has tits thrown at them at a rate far faster than even the American Pie series, leading one to wonder if Roth thought sex appeal would ultimately save this worthless project. But this only seems to make things worse--every single female in the story is shown either in the middle of drunken sex or desperately begging to have some. This representation of women almost makes the first half of the movie read like the script of some frustrated schoolboy's fantasy, and does nothing to advance the characters or the plot.<br /><br />We then change settings to Slovakia, where the stereotyping of Eastern Europeans is even more appalling than that of Americans and women. Roth paints us a picture of a dark, uncivilized world inhabited by toothless backwater locals, insanely corrupt officials, and children who roam the streets in gangs and are willing to literally kill people over candy. This movie received a big backlash in Slovakia for its portrayal of the Slovak people, and I can see why. A movie shouldn't have to depend on such aggressive stereotyping in order to get its point across.<br /><br />Anyway, once the real action gets going, the movie improves slightly. The American characters become a bit more human (although one of them is lured away from the town to his doom in a manner that is unbelievably stupid, even by horror flick standards), and some moderate suspense is successfully built up. In these scenes, we finally get to see some gore (which is, after all, what we were looking for all along, right?), and the script starts to rely a bit less on the aforementioned stereotypes.<br /><br />So did I enjoy certain parts of the movie? Yes, some of the later scenes were more fun, just the type of low-brow thrill that I was expecting. But ultimately it wasn't worth the tedious opening, the horrible portrayals of Americans, women, and Slovaks, and the fact that it was impossible to sympathize with the main characters, due to how pointlessly obnoxious they were. If this is what the first installment was like, I can only imagine how vapid and pointless the sequels were. If you're looking for cheap horror thrills, go watch Saw or even go back to the classic 80s slasher films--don't bother with this one.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app for listening to radio on the Fire. It installed easily, and the user interface is clean and simple. The app gives you access to a huge range of radio options -- you can select local stations or select a category (such as news, sports, talk, music, etc.) which then brings up a wide range of local and non-local stations.<br /><br />You can also select specific music genres, such as \\"classic rock,\\" \\"country,\\", etc. and it then presents you with all the stations that specialize in that type of music. You can even select by language should you want to listen to stations that broadcast in a particular language (and the language list is huge!).<br /><br />One of my favorite features is the podcast menu. If allows access to It also includes a podcast menu that has a huge list of podcasts on every topic you could think of. A real treasure-trove for podcast fans.<br /><br />It allows you to set favorites, and automatically tracks a list of recent stations listened to. Playback has been very clear for me, with only an occasional stutter. It works in both portrait and landscape mode<br /><br />I'm having an enormous amount of fun finding new radio stations. Highly recommend!!

0143121006|5.0|Perhaps we will in upcoming years find the answer to the death of British businessman Neil Heywood, who may have been murdered, according to recent newspaper stories, by the wife of the former Chinese high politico Bo Xilai.  Perhaps it will not take 75 years to get the truth out, as it has done for another murder of a Briton in China from back in 1937.  _Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China_ (Penguin Books), by Paul French, tells a story that is just as sensational as Heywood's.  French is a business advisor in Shanghai, but he has written on aspects of Chinese history before.  His current book is a real-life whodunit, with a horrific crime, bungling policemen, a cover-up by a corrupt bureaucracy, a determined but unofficial detective, and plenty of red herrings.  Plus it gives us the exotic atmosphere of a Peking long gone.  It is a fine true-crime page-turner.<br /><br />On 8 January 1937, the body of a girl was discovered near the Fox Tower in Peking.  n old man was walking his caged songbird early in the morning near the tower.  It had been drained of blood, her rib cage had been broken, and her heart had been ripped out, and was missing.  She was a British student, Pamela Werner, and her elderly father Edward Werner was a former consul well known to all the Britons in their expatriate community in Peking.  Pamela liked ice skating and listening to big bands on the radio.  She had boyfriends.  She had been raised in Peking and spoke fluent Mandarin.  Once her body had been discovered and identified, officials sprang into action.  One of the problems is that some of them sprang into action to obscure what had happened.  Because of the nature of the crime and its locale, a joint Chinese-British police operation was launched.  The detective team was steered away from any evidence that might seem to implicate any expatriates.  The investigation wound down; the murder had been horrific and spectacular, but it was going to wind up just another unsolved case.  Pamela's father was not going to stand for it.  He wrote one letter after another to the newspapers and to British and Chinese authorities.  He published a pamphlet asking that the case be reopened.  During the waning years of his life, he spent his fortune on informants and unofficial investigators.  He descended into what was literally called the Badlands, next to the British enclave and visited by expatriates who wanted to take part in the brothels and opium dens.  He discovered a wide-ranging cover-up, and found that important witnesses had simply lied about vital information in the case.  Werner found the answer (you find no spoiler here), and French has broadened it into a account of his daughter's last night.<br /><br />Sadly, Werner's efforts, though they found truth far deeper than any official investigation, bore little fruit.  Werner continued to report officially on what he had found, but no culprit was ever brought to justice.  All the time since the murder, the Japanese had swarmed in the background, and eventually they marched through Peking streets, even putting Werner into an internment camp.  Pamela Werner's grave, in the British Cemetery, has itself been buried under one of the ring roads around the city.  French has brilliantly brought back her sad story, the heroic efforts of her father to uncover the truth, and the almost unimaginably strange atmosphere of the darker parts of old Peking jostling with the proper British Bureaucracy, all about to be swallowed up in the transformations of World War II.was going to wind up just another unsolved case.

0345803485|2.0|I was at work and I started hearing how several of the nurses were reading the 50 Shades of Grey. As an avid reader I thought I might enjoy this so I downloaded it to my iPad. I must say I am quite disappointed. The book reads like it was written by a very amateurish high school student. I am forced to agree with the critic that asked if a teenager wrote this. The book is flat and is two dimensional. I VERY quickly grew tired of how Christian is constantly being described as the ULITMATE male by Ana. In addition the female characters lack imagination. They gush, blush and constantly use the same adjectives when describing Grey. The sex-scenes are poorly descriptive at best. I may get through the first novel but I will not waste my time with the rest. At best the book is a \\"B\\" rated S&M novel that is poorly written that should quickly find its way into the bargain bin. I am having trouble finishing it and I will remove it from my iPad as soon as I complete it. Please, if you just want to waste time, try Angry Birds, they are MUCH more entertaining.

The only thing I don't like is that you have to buy the colors with the coins you earn, but it is better than most because you can actually chat and not get your account deleted. It's really fun and easy to use. I highly recommend it! :)
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|grandparents got this for the kids few years ago when it first came out, i hadn't heard of it and didnt know what to expect. we all loved it, the kids watched it a million times. When we got a blu ray player there were a few movies we already owned on dvd that i wanted to upgrade, this is one of them, it is a christmas time classic that we watch with hot cocoa every single year even as kids are getting older. But we also watch in summer time, good anytime of year even though basically a christmas movie this appeals to adults and kids alike, it is one of all time favorite movies.
B008COII1Y|1.0|I rented this movie from Redbox for a dollar and some change. What a waste of money. I don't think I even got to the thirty minute mark. Here's what I remember from the movie. First, the events have already happened. Someone opens up a book or a journal or something and is telling us about some past Civil War Zombie outbreak. Scene one seems to have our hero, the father, fighting in the Civil War and also having to down some Zombies. Another flashback has the man returning to his home. I think the man had to kill his wife who had become a zombie but I can't remember. There are LONG drawn out scenes of the man agonizing the loss of his wife and his missing son. The man goes out looking for his son on a horse. The man stops to get water at a creek and is attacked by a zombie who is hiding underwater. Well, the underwater zombie was pretty scary. Anyway, the man then sees what looks like a young blonde girl, but what, that's his long blonde haired son. So he has to kill the boy with a gun shot to the head. Then he burns the body. The problem I have with this movie is the narrator talking over the movie and the low budget of it all. The movie is a modern take on zombies I guess but it didn't do anything for me. This man is completely destroyed and devastated by what has happened. He shouldn't even be able to function. The zombies should have killed his ass long before. But still this man mopes around the zombie filled countryside on a horse focused only on finding his son. The man is lost in his agony. It seems like the story is over before it began. The movie has a very intense human and emotional impact. On the one hand the movie shows very real human pain. On the other hand the movie is very, very stupid. So the combination of real human pain and stupidity and the narrator just made this movie feel like a steaming pile of horse squeeze. Also, the movie is shot in some unreal lighting. It was just hard to watch this movie in the unreal lighting. To me zombie movies are about trying to survive. You can't be having a long, long, long drawn out emotional breakdown when zombies are afoot. And who needs some \\"Wonder Years\\" type old man narrator talking over the whole movie. The movie just kept jumping around from the past to the present in weird lighting with a narrator and with bad acting. For me watching this movie, which is very LONG, would have been very painful. Personally I think all you had to know was the company behind the movie. The movie is made by some small low budget outfit called \\"Bloody Disgusting\\". This company's name should have been a warning to me. I should have known that I was fixing to waste a dollar and some change. My reaction to this movie is Uggggggghhhhhhhh.
B006LSZECO|1.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" was one of the most profane and vulgar books I've ever had the misfortune of downloading. Sadly, the free sample chapters do not reveal how low the vulgarity meter drops, and so I purchased the book based on the interesting writing in the beginning of the book. If only there were a rating system on books to alert potential customers to extreme profanity and vulgarity. I would never have purchased if I had known in advance. I can tolerate some bad language when it feels as if it is essential to the character development. But the use of the F word on almost every page became an utter nuisance and unbelievable. What a sad commentary on our culture if this is reflective of how people speak in our society.<br /><br />Additionally, the plotline goes from attention grabbing to ludicrous by the end of the story. I'm an avid reader and have not come across a more ridiculous book ending in ages.<br /><br />Give this a miss.

B005LAIHR2|5.0|Rock of Ages shows Tom Cruise at his best. He completely has the 80s rock and roll persona down. When Tom's character, Stacee Jaxx is on stage, I believe he is a rock star. He has all the rock star moves and the rock star voice. I am so impressed with Tom's singing in this movie. Now whenever I hear Pour Some Sugar on Me, Wanted Dead or Alive, or Paradise City, I hear Tom's voice in my head, not Joe Elliot, Jon Bon Jovi, or Axl Rose. Tom has completely changed how people remember the 80s. Tom has brought 80s music back to the forefront. I have seen the movie four times and I never get sick of it. I can't wait for the DVD.

B007P6PLDI|5.0|First of all, let me point out that I am giving this 5 stars for the actual Pisces Iscariot album. I have many gripes with the 2nd disc of the deluxe edition, but I will get to that later. Pisces Iscariot itself is magnificent. The album consists of B-sides, outtakes and rarities from Gish and Siamese Dream. It is AWESOME. Though it is a compilation of odds and ends it is just as strong of an album as Gish and Siamese Dream... or any Smashing Pumpkins release! The thing is just that good.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. The bonus disc is... bland. It also sounds weird compared to the first disc because the sound levels on it are about twice as loud as the first disc. There is some great stuff on here, but the problem is that some of it isn't rare or hard to find at all! For instance, \\"Why Am I So Tired\\", \\"French Movie Film\\" and \\"Slunk (live)\\" are already available on the magnificent [[ASIN:B00006LSOI Earphoria Live]] album and they are the exact same versions! To add insult to injury \\"Slunk\\" has a great studio version from the Lull ep that isn't featured on here, but the track \\"By June\\", also from the Lull ep is on here. Most of the other tracks on disc 2 I found to just be dull. I think some live tracks from the Gish and Siamese dream era would have been a much better choice than what we ended up getting here. Another disapointment on here is the awful treatment \\"Glynis\\" received. The song \\"Glynis\\" originally appeared on the [[ASIN:B000002VNM No Alternative]] compilation album and sounded great. On here we get the '2012 remix' version which sounds bad. Really bad.<br /><br />I was able to get the digital download version of the album from SPRC which also means I was lucky enough to get the demo cassette bonus tracks as downloads rather than deal with the useless physical cassette that comes with the physical release. These tracks are pretty good and outshine most of the stuff found on the bonus disc, but they still aren't anything mind-blowing. Gish and Siamese Dream both had much better reissues so this was a disapointment.<br /><br />The real treat here though is the actual Pisces Iscariot album. I think the remaster sounds great (though \\"Plume\\" sounded better on the original release). \\"Starla\\" is the standout track. A true rock epic. All of disc one will rock your world. Just don't get your hopes up for disc 2.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I came to Serenity and Firefly late, having been busy being duped in marriage and working two jobs.  I saw the movie first and, telling my brother about it, I got the reply \\"Oh, that sounds like the Firefly series that was on tv.\\"  Well, you can all guess what happened next: off to finf \\"Firefly\\" dvd.  Couple of yrs later, I've watched \\"Serenity\\" about 3 times and \\"Firefly\\" about 4.  I wait several months between so I don't burn out,but I don't really think I can.  This whole storyline is really incomparable.  We all thought that about other scifi series until this came along.  Everything is perfect: the unique concept, the acting, even the design of the ship.  If you watch one dvd after the other, thru the whole series, you will feel you are living it.  Everyone involved in the production cared so much about their project, they bring you in and carry you along.  I believe that is one reason for its popularity.  We all felt so much a part of it, the cancellation felt as tho' they had destroyed OUR homes, OUR lives.  Can someone please! explain to me why they took away this incredible series--and give us crap like \\"Desperate Housewives\\" and \\"Jersey Shore\\"  Was it too intelligent and \\"they\\" want us \\"dumbed down\\" or was it too truthful about \\"control\\", experimentatio, subversive agencies!  What other reason would there be for them to quash a money-maker?  It's not the first time, even historically...remember Galileo, DaVinci, Diego Rivera. the whole Basque nation, Nixon and McCarthy? the list goes on and on.  Does anybody have another reason for one of the stupidest moves a network has ever made? Was it not patriotic enough or too provocative for the sponsors?  Who was behind the curtain this time?  Answers, please?
034580404X|5.0|I was so happy that Amazon offered these books in a 3-volume boxed set. I could not put these books down. I didn't just read these I devoured them. The content was a little rough at times, but it was a beautiful love story. If you want to read a wonderful love story these are the books you should read. Can't wait for her next book to come out.

034580404X|5.0|Highly recommend buying the trilogy together; the complete purchase enables you to continue through the whole story. These books are hard to put down, and I wanted to continue on as soon as I finished each book.
0812982622|5.0|I received a kindle two years ago and I have spent a great deal of time reading and most of the books were recommended on the amazon website. I have liked most all of them.  The Orphan Master's Son is one of the most engrossing novels I have ever read.  It left me exhausted and sad that General Ga could not have lived.  His happiness was caught in the few months he enjoyed with his make believe family.  I don't think I will ever quit thinking of the sadness,cruelty and depth of caring that the author has presented to me in his wonderful book.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is yet another review to start with \\"Why the hate?\\"<br />The case is VERY light weight, but that isn't a sign of poor quality in itself. It seems quite sturdy, and protects my Kindle Fire well.<br />Perhaps an improvement was made to the stand configuration as the slot provided to hold the lid in place provides plenty of purchase.<br />I'll revisit this review periodically as we find out how well this holds up. So far, so good.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|If you enjoy a gritty and suspenseful psychological page turner, read this book!!!  Elizabeth Haynes provides very believable characterizations,  real insight into the mind of an OCD sufferer and the harms of abusive relationships. This is quite an accomplishment for a first novel, I look forward to her second.
B005IQZB14|5.0|So well written I felt I was there on the trail with Cheryl. Inspirational and thought provoking, I couldn't put this book down. There were moments I was brought to tears or left laughing outloud. A definite recommended read!

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have been attending broadway shows since I was a child and have many original cast albums from Robers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Lowe to Jerry Herman and Andrew Lloyd Weber but this is absolutely the best music from the show.  The music and lyrics are amazing and the cast is extraordinary.  I love this CD and listen to it very often.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|Just heard through this latest release of Testament and my impression is that it pretty much sounds as expected. Every single song on this album could just as well have been on The New Order, on Practice What You Preach, or The Ritual - I do not find any musical development of Testament on this CD whatsoever. I, personally, don't care too much about this as long as the songs are good. After all, I wish some bands (e.g. Metallica) would have spared us their \\"musical development\\" (after the Black Album). Thus, I can live with this CD very well. But if you expect any surprises or if it is important for you that a band explores new directions with each new album, you are bound to get disappointed. Just sayin' ...<br /><br />The tracks on the album are all strong. Skolnick is still the same guitar god that he always was. Chuck Billy remains to be one of the best metal vocalists to date. The riffs are cool and the songs rock. The only little point is that I would have liked it if there were more faster songs on the CD. True American Hate is the only one here, and if I were to stand in a mosh pit and Testament were to play a song from the new album, I WISH IT WERE THIS ONE. It is my clear favorite!
0451208706|5.0|\\"The Man From St. Petersburg\\" is once again a great historical thriller from Ken Follet. Probably what's most amazing about it, is that this is the 8th book I've read read from Follet, so I know his style and formula pretty well, and yet he still shocked me and entertained me as if this was my first.<br />For most of the book, I was thinking of rating four stars, simply because I have read many Follet novels, so the book suffered only because the style and details weren't brand new to me. Four stars still means it's a very good book, but after just reading the last fifty or so pages, this book has to be rated five. What an excellent ending!<br />It always amazes me how well Follet blends fiction and history, as well as writing numerous storylines which all connect to one another. This book deals alot with London before World War 1, but also explores the anarchists of Russia as well.<br />This is evertything you would expect from Ken Follet: great characters, including a great villian, excellent suspense, wonderful historic details, and a story that demands to be read every minute possible.<br />If you're already a Follet fan, this book is a must read. If you want a great thriller set in London in the early 20th century, then this book is perfect.<br />Once again, I'm very happy to be a fan of Ken Follet. Great book.
B007JNR518|5.0|Again I am thrilled to see these good movies come out on blu ray. The blue ray with these quality movies are just a little more fun to watch and enjoy.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this book -- listened on Audible during two days on the couch with a summer cold and I couldn't stop listening even when I was desperate for sleep.  A fantastic book but the ending...it just kills you.  That being said, amazingly written, wonderfully plotted, and genuinely surprising but fair as a mystery - you guess the next plot twist just a second before it is revealed so you don't feel cheated.  You will definitely want to discuss it with someone after you are finished
B00846REIS|1.0|I wasnt ready to let Christian go...but seeing him rehashed as watered down Gidion Cross left me unsatisfied and feeling bad that Sylvia Day is earning money by blatently plagerizing EL James work.  While James writing could have been better, she made us sympathize and love her characters so much so that we`re all feeling a little lost without him.  Not so much with Sylvia days ripoff characters.  Sadly, the one thing she didnt deem worthy of ripping off, the emails, were what made the characters most endearing.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|Just what I was looking for - intelligent, but entertaining. Memorable characters.  I will look for more books in this series.
B00846TTDG|4.0|I had wanted to watch this movie when I heard the Seals actually were in the movie as my daughter-in-laws brother is a Seal and trains the Seals.  I was quite suprised at what they actually do and I cried at the end of the movie.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|I'm a big fan of Lewis and he didn't disappoint with this one.  He details the lives of several individuals that bet their fortunes on an impossible outcome and hit big.  I have a strong background in banking and day-trading and watch CNBC all day, and I was still puzzled but all of the terms and what went on.<br /><br />Lewis was able to break down the complex topics and in his classic style, intertwine them with real life people and their experiences.  It's a great read.  (I can, however, see why people without a knowledge-base in finance may struggle with some of the book . . . but for me it was a blast!)

B007MDB71O|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I'd never heard of this until I saw it always rented at the local dishbuster. So I grabbed the blu-ray when it was finally available and was surprised at how entertaining John Carter was. So I check good old Rotten Tomatoes, and what?! 52%?! I'd expected 80 at least. So I read the reviews and laughed at how few critics can just relax and enjoy well-made Flash Gordon-style escapism. Then I come here and voila, 4.5 stars. Why is it that the aggregate movie score here is SO often how I too feel about most movies? I guess my tastes are more typical than I'd like to think...<br /><br />John Carter is just fun, and great-looking fun. The leads are both very solid, with decent chemistry (somewhat Han/Leia-ish, but then Lucas took lots from ERB), and fine stage actors like Hinds and Purefoy (see them together in the great Mayor Of Casterbridge if you're a fan of great acting) add an unexpected amount of solidity to a very spacey story.<br /><br />I love Burroughs' style and read most of the Tarzans and his sci-fi as a kid, and I think this film really does him justice. I wasn't surprised to learn it was done by the guy who did Wall-E, the wisest animated film of the last decade. ERB's wild flights of fancy and crazy creatures come to life here, and who could resist a six-legged wildly loyal space-dog?<br /><br />Dafoe is perfect in his semi-animated role and the look of his species and this film in general is absolutely knockout on blu-ray. Incredible colors and detail. Along with the story, the eye candy and visual feel reminded me of so many of the best sci-fi/fantasy flicks, especially Star Wars and the first Indy, no small compliment.<br /><br />And I truly enjoyed Kitsch, who I'd never seen. His name must delight critics looking to be snide, but I found him fun and dead-on, like Buster Crabbe but better. And if you got that reference, dang you're old! If you didn't, go see what great kitsch you've missed. Director Stanton clearly did not, and made a film that's so epic and so fun that I think it will be a true cult classic as time goes by. \\"The one that the critics missed out on entirely!\\"<br /><br />PS The blu-ray is most fine indeed, with not only a perfect transfer but some good extras including a funny making-of that downplays the crazy 250 mil budget, but shows why the money turned into a truly mind-blowing visual experience.<br /><br />It ain't Shakespeare, but it's great Saturday-afternoon pulp sci-fi.a film that's so epic and so fun that I think it will be a true cult classic as time goes by. \\"The one that the critics missed out on entirely!\\"<br /><br />PS The blu-ray is most fine indeed, with not only a perfect transfer but some good extras including a funny making-of that downplays the crazy 250 mil budget, but shows why the money turned into a truly mind-blowing visual experience.<br /><br />It ain't Shakespeare, but it's great Saturday-afternoon pulp sci-fi.

0790731509|5.0|I got this DVD to replace a VHS video of this same movie. What can I say other than this is one of the 5 greatest movies ever made. Paul Newman is outstanding.
B00846TRHY|2.0|Another video I watched to the end only because I paid for it. Was this released straight to video? I really hope so, because I would not waste $10 to see it in a theater.
B003Y5H5BA|3.0|Some laughs but not enough, some cool moments but not enough, some funny performances but not enough of them either. The script never really delivers the goods, and despite good chemistry between Tatum and Hill, this one never really catches flight.<br /><br />The nods to the tv show have a few good bits, especially Depp's scenes and [spoiler, look away!] ridiculously Tom Cruise-flick-like demise. And there are a few chuckles, no doubt. But all in all it just felt kinda flat too often. If you liked the show, you'll get some laughs. If you like Hill, you'll like him here. If you see Tatum as a basic brooding action guy, you'll like his vaguely comedic presence. But if you like really funny movies that don't rely on weirdly non-ironic violence, move right along.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The author mocks small town life to create the dark, nasty, vindictive and secrets-bound environment which helps create the story's suspense. The antipathy Camille opines about almost all of the people led me to almost stop reading the novel, so much of downer about human beings, their motives, and behavior it depicted.<br />The story is a sad one: of the boredoms, and petty, and not-so-petty cruelties, of small town existence. It's also sad in its depiction of cruel, harried and ignorant parenting.
B008MEM24S|5.0|lots of fun for the kids.  can not wait for more fun free levels. This is a must have for parents with kids.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I have had this knife for a while now. I have Goloks, A prang, Kukries, Bowies and other knifes. This is the knife that is always with me in the field. Sure I may take the prang if I know I'll have to chop some big grape vines (wild river bank grapes) but this knife will do it in a pinch and is much more handy. I don't try to pick this one all the time it just happens! From making fishing rod holder sticks, cut bait, clearing a path, to making a fire. this knife is just handy. Plus it holds my Gerber multi-tool.<br /><br /> This knife feels great in my left hand and feels a little strange in my right hand. I'm right handed.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|As a serious fan of Theodore Geisel since 1968, I feel confident in saying he would ultimately love this film. Not for how it treats his source material but for how true it is to his world view. For all its flaws, this Lorax says more about what really matters today than any \\"toon\\" since Wall-E, and goes even further down our modren rabbit hole.<br /><br />Keep in mind that The Lorax was really radical in its time: a children's environmentalist book? It was not universally loved, to say the least. Stick to the cute cat in that cute hat was the consensus from the suits, because the Lorax was getting mighty close to the kinds of truths Those In Charge would rather us not discuss among adults, let alone the kiddos.<br /><br />But that's the secret genius of the best kids' toons and books and movies and tv---they treats kids like their best selves, wise human beings who see things we adults can't begin to because we're so lost in our little ego-driven dramas. Some kids are smart enough to know how lame our society is becoming, and this movie is for them, just as the book was. And for the many many kids who know something's not right with how the grown-ups live, but can't quite elucidate it. Enter the Lorax.<br /><br />As a huge fan of the book, I don't like DeVito as the Lorax. Too predictable and too twee; oh how I'd love to have heard Willem Dafoe instead. Or so many others with more gravitas and less wacky cute in their voice. But oh well. On the other hand Ed Helms is excellent (apart from his rather excruciating singing), and shows why he's heading towards epic star status in his own quiet goofy way. He gets this material and sells it perfectly. As it were...<br /><br />Selling EVERYTHING is what this book is about, and the movie takes that to the next level. Seuss was a visionary and saw the future we now live in, and this flick goes there and farther, into deeper realms of consumer and corporate greed. It baldly and hilariously/painfully exposes our daily selfishness as a society, so focused on our own marketing-driven \\"needs\\" that we're blind to the real costs that will inevitably bankrupt us, economically and morally, and are in fact making us go broke right now.<br /><br />Let's face the facts, it's only because things are so bad in this country now that this movie could even get made by a major studio. O'Hare Air is a brilliant metaphor for our economy, completely short-sighted greed for profit overriding all common sense. And common decency, which we seem to daily forget, decency towards our planet, the creatures we share it with, and ourselves. This movie really brings that home. And its endless attendant ironies are very entertaining on the meta-ugly level: the garish colors and standard characters and typically meh tunes. But some of the lyrics are cut from another cloth entirely, and it's those moments that make this \\"kids' film\\" so uniquely subversive. It looks all Diznee until you really pay attention...<br /><br />No doubt the characters could look better: less cutesy, new face-types instead of the soooo predictable rounded snub-nosed cutie-pie faces in all pixar etc stuff now. But then again, that archetypal look helps disguise the truly harsh message this movie and book is sending: WE ARE KILLING OURSELVES AND OUR HOME...MERELY FOR MONEY.<br /><br />Becasue this new Lorax gives undying devotion to that one simple, ugly truth, I forgive this flick all its cliches and flaws, because we desperately need this kind of truth, and fast, from all of our movies and art these days.<br /><br />The message here is WAKE UP, WORLD, this plan ain't working.<br /><br />And that they got this film made, and shipped out in shiny new 3-D thneed containers, is somehow both so perfect and so pathetic that the irony is priceless.<br /><br />Or, 19.99 for a good-looking blu-ray with plenty of entertaining extras to ponder as we whittle  and fiddle away the brief time until we chop our last truffula tree...maybe to print The Lorax?<br /><br />And you know that Ted Geisel, America's best doctor, would laugh heartily, and sadly.r /><br />And you know that Ted Geisel, America's best doctor, would laugh heartily, and sadly.

1475143389|5.0|Michael Matthews has achieved something special: he has taken his passion, and has translated it into the book you see before you. He is clear concise, and to the point - if you follow his advice, you will be happier and healthier. In two weeks I am planning on following his one-year plan starting, so this review will be about the information inside the book, Mike's supplemental year-one plan, and his personal follow ups. I will come back in a year to let you all know how it went!<br /><br />Pros: Mike calls you out, and shows you how it is possible to gain muscle and lose weight. He achieves this by educating you on proper diet, perfect weight-training form, and the thousand details you never thought you needed to know. As a result, I still carry this book around with me.<br /><br />Cons: Some people might not have the time and money to follow through with Mike's advice<br />- This was my excuse, and I forced myself to find a way to make it work<br /><br />1) Info inside the book<br />The book breaks down everything I always wanted to know, but was too lazy to go find out. For example, what is a calorie? I knew what a calorie was, but how did different foods change the amount of calories I received? What is the right number of calories for me to gain weight? to lose weight? How many calories do I need to pack on muscle? Mike answers all of the above, and so much more. He lists about 40+ more terms you know the meaning of, but have no idea what they are really all about. Additionally, Mike lays out schedules for eating, what to eat, how to lift PROPERLY, and so much more. This book substantially increased my body IQ - something I thought was pretty high to begin with.<br /><br />2)Mike's supplemental year one plan<br />If you buy this book, you have no excuse not to follow Mike's plan for at least 8 weeks. At the end of the book, he gives you a link to his Year-One.pdf which outlines your first YEAR of workouts. Additionally, he recommends multiple vitamins, supplements and work out gear to help you achieve maximum results. He also includes a few recipes that are friendly to his diet recommendations.<br /><br />3) Mike's Personal Follow Up<br />Mike contacted me via email (I submitted my email address to him when I downloaded the year one plan) and asked me if I had any questions. I replied with a question, and he responded in under 24 hours. He is friendly, approachable, and wants to see you succeed.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with my purchase, and I know you will be too.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It took my 9 yr old grandson to download it on my Kindle Fire.  I had no idea how to do it, since this is all new to me. He had it done in less than 5 minutes, and he told me that if I needed him to help me download more \\"free items\\" just call him. I wanted the Kindle Fire to listen to my favorite songs, movies and reading books, etc. I have been experimenting and having suggestions from friends who have one.  This is certainly a learning situation for me, and soon I will get the hang of it and really enjoy it.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|love the game but little slow going to get gold you need for equipment and upgrades but all in all its a great game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was sucha fascinating read that I went ahead and purchased the whole trilogy. I finished all three in a week.its erotic and  definitely makes you fantasize about Christian.we all want to be swept off our feet by a good looking, rich man.it gives way to the notion that a plain woman can be just as enthralling as a beautiful one.

B006PAO2FS|3.0|When I first heard Paul was going to do an album of standards I was excited. I figured  \\"with that voice how could it go wrong?\\". Unfortunatly the voice is the weakest part of the album. The music arrangements are wondeful & very well played  but every time  the singing brings it down. What should have been great is only good. At least with Ringo's you didn't expect much so it ended up being fun. This one is just no fun.
B0058VW36U|4.0|A cute game but still adult worthy.  It is not totally addictive ( like some other games that you cant put down and that make you late for appointments) but fun to play for a change of pace.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Scorsese does it again, this time capturing the heart and soul of George Harrison.  Harrison's love of music and finding the spirituality in life shine through.  The authentic voices of family and friends round out the biography and Harrison's own words through  each phase of his life elevate this to five stars plus!  A must see for music lovers and film buffs.  It will send you back through musical history and force you to find your old albums and CD\\"S.  The timeless music of Harrison particularly post Beatles is astounding and many themes resonate today in terms of the search for understanding, compassion, and peace.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This story starts out slow... becomes a bit intriguing,  only to end in predictability and disappointment.  The \\"Devil In The White City\\" chapter style interests, but pales in comparison  to the Erik Larson style.

B0050AV5MW|3.0|I have to say it's not a good buy.<br /><br />There are not any navigation problems (as I mainly read on reviews), but I think this is due to the latest kindle update. When you press \\"Go to\\" button, a pop up rises, and you can navigate through all of the four books, starting from the chapter you are currently reading. Also the chapter's title is also a link to toc.<br /><br />One problem I have found is the x-ray. You at Amazon, should do something about that. On \\"page\\" it's ok, but on \\"chapter\\" means the whole book and not the actual chapter. So you cannot find information mentioned at the current chapter, only a soup of information throughout the book. Then there is the \\"book\\" which means what it says (the whole series).<br /><br />If you are interesting in buying this ebook, and you are a US resident, you only have one option from Bantam. Otherwise you can buy Voyager's one where except the chapters's titles and the price, I haven't found any other differencies. Lack of information here.<br /><br />The price is also another issue, as it is more expensive than the printed edition<br /><br />The maps are unreadable on the Kindle's Touch screen.<br /><br />Finaly something that I am waiting response from Amazon, is the fact that on product's description it says there are real page numbers on Voyager's edition, but actually there aren't.
B0011MRKHW|5.0|This movie might not be as accurate as it should be but it's just a movie. Cate Blanchett is a wonderful actress and she portrays the part very well. I love watching this movie over and over just like Elizabeth 1998. Highly recommend this movie. You won't be disappointed
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I personally already own this film and absolutely love it! My brother mentioned wanting to see it, and not wanting to live without my copy I just bought him the film. Amazon is one of the most trusting and well established sites where you know you won't have to worry about who you are buying from and if it will come. I ordered the movie on a Sunday night and he had it by Tuesday! It was even free to ship and a great low price!
0815411839|5.0|This was a birthday gift to a friend and she loved this book. She said it was the most factual book about Monroe than any book she had ever read. She stated that this book portrayed Marilyn Monroe as a human with all her failings as well as all her positive attribute. This book made her very human & did not just portray her Hollywood life. The only negative thing that my friend said about the book was that she was not quite sure if she believed the ending of the book or not. But she liked the book as a whole and will start ordering other books by this author.
B005D51II0|3.0|Fantastically recorded discs, but Decca's packaging is quite poor.  The individual disc sleeves are thin, poorly printed and of low quality.  By contrast, the Mercury Living Presence set is top notch in this respect.  Don't hesitate to buy for the fantastic recordings, but realize that the jacket quality is quite bad - almost all have some color rubbed off or else bear the ink imprint from the jackets before and after as stacked in the outer box.  At this price, I expect higher quality printing.<br /><br />Hint: ask Amazon to package for you carefully.  Mine arrived loose in an outer shipping box and is likely in the worse condition for it.
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|While it took me awhile to get into the first book of the trilogy(The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), once the characters were established I found the trilogy a captivating series.  Since I did read the series from the beginning I found the catch up references a bit annoying and redundant however this would allow someone who only picked up the last book to get an idea of what had transpired previously.  If you are looking at this book on it's own, I would highly suggest you start at the beginning of the trilogy with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo followed by The Girl Who Played with Fire and then read this final installment.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this cover for my Kindle Fire. It is sleek and perfectly fitted, and does not interfere with operating the Kindle in any way. The stand is nice for hands-free use. The only thing that could be a slight negative (which may be a problem for most covers) is that the flap that covers the screen is what folds under the Kindle to create the stand. The result is that the soft part of the cover that protects your screen is directly touching whatever surface you set it on, so it can pick up crumbs, dust, etc. Just be aware of this and make sure you brush off any debris before you close the cover over your screen. This is not a big problem and overall I am glad I purchased this product and would highly recommend it!
0525478817|5.0|Sometimes you read books and you couldn't care less about what happens to the characters. Other times the characters in a book come alive and you feel like you know them. This book falls into the latter category. Augustus and Hazel seem so real. I laughed out loud at parts and got all teary-eyed at other parts. I bought the Kindle edition of this book. I rarely highlight quotes from books on my Kindle but I highlighted probably a quarter of the book because there were so many quotes I wanted to remember. This book definitely made me stop and think about life, which rarely happens with any books, even the so-called \\"good ones.\\" It is a great book and deserves the glowing reviews it has gotten.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|Harold's journey takes the reader on a journey through past memories, regrets, hopes and delivers one to a destination where Harold's life's circumtances and choices have been reconciled but not predictably so.  A great and thought provoking read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The first third and second book were very similar to each other. Each as easily predictable as the first. One book would have been enough to tell this story. First main character christian grey is more frustrating than inducing sympathy or care. And the constant fragile emotional state of Anastasia is just down right annoying. A morbid sense of happily ever after his controlling behavior is misinterpreted as love. If you have an affinity toward bad men you will love this book and its main antagonist.

B006M6NUBC|1.0|Hey folks, I guess there is more beer being consumed during this picture to get such high stars. Guess a lot of people seeing this movie were already lit by the time California's former do-nothing Governor made his cheap \\"cameo appearance\\". Why the producers let this movie get passed the editing room is beyond me, but maybe they were a bit intoxicated too by this all-star LackLuster bomb. Another waste of Bruce Willis' talent for jokes. This would have made a thrill-ride comic blast, but I think it's the answer to America's insomnia problems. Arnold should do more movies, yes, to refund the taxpayers for the bridge he couldn't even finish!
B007MJ9LA2|2.0|I was disappointed. This was billed as a tribute to American Indians. As one myself, I looked forward to the music as Carlos has always been a top notch guitarist and writer. However, after opening with a few moments of Hi-Ya-Ya-Ya hollywood-like \\"Injun\\" chants, this CD took off into several genres including yuppie elevator music and mostly latin music (Mexican, salsa, and Cuban genres). During most of the CD I felt as if I was in a Mexican restaurant, waithing for my burrito. At one point I could have sworn I head, \\"Lucy! Jou have some 'splaining to do!\\" Though Carlos proves he is still a master on the guitar, this CD is definitely NOT Native American (or whatever you call us these days).
0307970299|5.0|I bought this audiobook version of Cheryl Strayed's Wild because I wanted something easy to keep my mind occupied on a long drive.  I wound up listening to the entire thing long before the trip.  First, there's the fact that Cheryl Strayed is an amazing writer.  Her conversational style draws the listener (or reader) into the story in a matter of a few pages, and it's the kind of story--emotional, funny, touching, easy to relate to--that is hard to walk away from.  Though much of her experience will seem alien to the average reader, Strayed is so likeable and personable and tells the story so incredibly well, that it feels as if it's happening right now, and the reader is alongside through every heart-rending, touching, scary moment.  This is a book I'll go back to again and again.  Highly recommended!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I personally really like this CD a lot.  Some have commented on the quality of his singing voice.  Luckily there is a way for you to determine for yourself if you like the way he sings.  Most of the songs on this CD were featured in a Great Performances episode on PBS.  So go to pbs.org, click on \\"video\\", search on Laurie and watch the 56 minute show.  If you like it on your computer, you'll love it on your music system.  You'll also get a dose of the humbleness of the man, his deepfelt love of music and his awe of the New Orleans music scene.<br /><br />When you hear his piano on Swanee River, you'll be amazed at Dr. House's talent.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I cannot add a lot to the great Reviews on this CD. However, if you must choose between Adele's \\"19\\" and \\"21\\" -- choose \\"21\\". There are easily three or four major hits on this album, and quite a few great songs for any single album. Usually, you're lucky if an album contains 1 or 2.<br /><br />My favorites must be everyone else's -- \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" (which is slang for both being embroiled in a great, deep love and/or a painful break-up or despair over a love gone wrong) and \\"Someone Like You\\". \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" is gorgeous, as well. Methinks, Adele is the only person who can do justice to these songs since she wrote nearly all of them.<br /><br />My God! Such a great talent!

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've used this watch for already 6 weeks, on 2 days a week. I alternate this watch with a Forerunner 210 on other days in a week.<br />Here are my thoughts about the watch. For a start, as a GPS watch with HRM, its distance & HR readings are accurate, consistent & reliable. It usually picks up satellites within a minute, except on cloudy days when it might take up to 5 minutes. It picks up HR through the HRM even faster - well within 10 seconds. On the whole, the watch is ready to go with me on my runs very quickly. It tracks distance & HR continuously throughout a run without signal loss or drop.<br />I like it that I can break up by run into laps by setting laps on the watch according to distance covered per lap. After a run, the watch provides information as to HR, pace & distance for each lap, & sums up all laps.<br />I also like it that I can temporarily stop the chronograph timing whenever I need to stop my run temporarily, for example, at a traffic light junction or at an exercise station. In that event, distance & pace recording also stops for a time but HR monitoring continues. Distance, pace & timing recording resumes when I restart the chronograph.<br />Probably the best part of owning a Garmin GPS watch must surely by their website Garmin Connect. GC rocks! All data recorded during a run, including distance, real-time pace, HR & elevation, & calories burned, can be transferred to the site & can be retrieved later & at any time from time time for performance review. The route I took during each run is shown on a Google or Bing map on GC, & can be played back in fast-forward with distance, pace, HR & elevation readings as recorded along the route.<br />Battery life is decent & allows me two 15km runs in a week with GPS & HRM on, with a little life to spare. I like it that in time mode, I can toggle the display to show the remaining battery life which is indicated as a numerical percentage. The battery life is shorter than on the Forerunner 210, probably due to the 405CX having to run more features. On the other hand, the FR 210 does not indicate remaining battery life in numerical percentages but as a bar.<br />Lastly, it does not hurt that the watch looks good too. It is chunky but not too chunky. In a weird way, its chunkiness makes a certain fashion statement.<br />Not everything is positive about the watch though. A major problem is that the bezel, which controls menu scrolling & selection becomes totally unresponsive when it is wet. Duh! Didn't Garmin realise that people sweat when they work out?! I found I could avoid the problem so long as I held the watch facing up on my wrist, which prevents my sweat from flowing down to the bezel. I take it off when it would be turned upside down during a workout, for example, when doing sit-ups.<br />Another problem is that in time mode, the display does not indicate that the GPS is on when it is. That drains the battery unnecessarily when I forget to switch GPS off after a run.<br />Lastly, for my specific purpose, it would be good to have a countdown timer which is a common function in conventional stop watches, but not on Garmin GPS watches. However, this is not critical as I take along a conventional stop watch when I need a countdown timer. However, that means I carry an extra watch.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Excellent--very good book--recommend to anyone.  Love the author.  good story line--too much requirements to write a review on a novel..

B007KOMTUI|5.0|Season 5 of Man Men did not disappoint...the highly addictive drama about Don Draper's evolution as a man, husband and father continues to keep you coming back for more.  The cast of characters in the ad agency are followed closely providing you with your \\"groupie backstage pass\\" to watch their lives unfold.  The worst part of watching Mad Men is waiting for the next episode :)
B001AEF6C2|3.0|Weird Science was always one of my favourite movies when I was a kid. But it's the case of watching something from when you were a kid that you thought was really great, but not so much when you've grown up. Don't get me wrong. The movie is still an 80s classic, but being a kid watching it just gives it something special. The audio mix of this dvd is one of the worst that I've ever heard. It's tinny and flat with hardly any base or surround effects. A stereo mix would have gone a long way to making this a better dvd.
B00746O3X8|1.0|I only had it on for 5 minutes with one Pro camera but a short lens and already started feeling pain in my back.<br />There is nothing (like a belt in original) to offset the weight on the back. Maybe they expect people to where heavy backpacks at the same time to offset the weight.<br />I have Optech and Black Rapid(knock-off)and can carry 2 Pro cameras with one of them having 6lb lens attached and I can carry them all day long without being tired. That is because cameras positioned on the sides evenly distributing the weight.<br />So back in the box and back to Amazon it went.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I was looking for a Sudoku game that presented a challenge.  This product definitely does that!

Some other Sudoku products that I've played were easy at their hardest \\"genius\\" level and were completed in only about 6 minutes.  This product truly provides the different challenge levels that I was looking for.

I hope Season 5 can top Season 4 because hands downd, Season 4 has been the BEST so far.
B0086DBE62|4.0|This is a great movie for families with children 10 and under. Lots of laughs and a unique twist on the traditional story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Despite not being the author's target audience age, I was engrossed in this thought provoking triology from Suzanne Collins. I would highly reccommend this series for both teenagers and adults alike.  From either perspective, adult or teen, it is easy to get lost in the world of the characters and the terrible situations they must face in this futuristic landscape that once was the USA.<br />  The first book,  The Hunger Games introduces us to the main heroine of the series; Katniss Everdeen. She is still a child but so much older in will and spirit than her sixteen years. She bravely steps up and volunteers for her sister's place in the Capitol 's deadly yearly Hunger Game that each district must send two of its children into. From this point forward,  the reader is left with page turning cliff hangers as we tensely journey along with Katniss from District 12 to the capitol for training and eventually the deadly games themselves. There are 24 children aged 12 to 18 in the games and only one can win. Unfortunately winning means death of all other opponents in the areana.<br />  The second & third book,  Catching Fire and respectively Mockingjay,  continues the saga of our brave champion as she becomes a symbol of hope for the oppressed twelve districts that struggle and starve under the Capitol's rule. Just like before Katniss's will and bravery shine bright and strong. So strong that she is the girl who catches fire and sparks a nation to stand up and fight.<br />  Be warned this is a violent and bloody series. There are many deaths and none of them are peaceful. I would not reccomend this book for younger children. Despite the violence of this book, one's own mind paints a much more terrifying picture filled with horror that gore need not convey. It is almost impossible not to feel for the characters and their circumstances. Ask yourself, if this was your world,  how far would you go to survive?  What would you be capable of?<br />  Brilliant read all around,  from start to finish. Formatted beautifully for ease of reading on Kindle.m start to finish.

0451169514|5.0|Like in most Stephen King books, the actual plot of IT becomes almost secondary (which is not to say that it's not a great story, too) -- what makes King's books so utterly fascinating is his ability to take the reader on a journey so immersive and so rich in detail that the world around just fades away.  I am not one to get lost easily in books, movies etc -- but the spell King casts when he is in top form (and he has definitely had his weak moments too), is incredible and inescapable.  What I love about IT (or 11/22/63, or Hearts in Atlantis) is King's uncanny ability to conjure up images of America as it used to be.  Anybody who has ever read \\"Stand by me\\" or watched the movie, will know what I mean:  the sounds, the smells, the way people talked and walked...he takes you back to the good and bad old days.  To a life that was simpler, but also more stifling in its societal uniformity.  The America of Eisenhower and Kennedy, of Mickey Mantle (Sorry, Steve), Elvis Presley, hair grease, Buicks and drive-in theaters.  Whoever has a fascination with the 50s and 60s will like King's books that are set during that period.  King's other great strength is the devlopment of true-to-life characters;  no stereotypes, no flat Zombies.  The reader can feel with the characters because they act and think like most of us would.  In IT, that strength is even more pronounced because the adult reader will all of a sudden be able to again understand what it was like to be a 12-year old.  I grew up in a small town myself:  a place where nature is still rich and where magic seems real and close when you're a kid.<br />King books used to scare and shock me when I was a kid/teenager -- these days I read them because of his ability to evoke deep-seated, almost archetypical emotions, both positive and negative -- about places, people, things, and the reader's own past and present experiences.  King is a genius of American literature.

B000001ELL|5.0|KISS' seventh studio album (eleventh overall not counting the four solo albums) entitled Dynasty was released in May of 1979.<br />Dynasty was the band's first studio album of all new material since 1977's classic Love Gun. In between Love Gun and Dynasty, the band released the live Alive II, the best of Double Platinum, made their film debut in KISS Meets the Phantom (which aired on NBC in October of 1978) and each member recorded their own solo album (Ace Frehley and Gene Simmons' sold the most while Paul Stanley and Peter Criss' sold the least, I loved Ace and Paul's albums, Peter's was very good and Gene's was the one I liked the least) and tensions between singer/songwriter/rhythm guitarist Paul Stanley, singer/songwriter/bass player Gene Simmons, singer/lead guitarist Ace Frehley and singer/drummer Peter Criss reached a boiling point. The band reconvened at The Record Plant in New York at the beginning of 1979 to record Love Gun's followup with Vini Poncia producing (who produced Peter Criss' solo album). Peter would be sidelined for the album due to recuperating from injuries he sustained in a car crash during the making of his solo album in 1978 (Anton Fig would play on all but \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" who would be played by Richie Fontana and \\"Dirty Livin'\\" which Peter would play on and it's rumored that Peter also drummed on \\"2000 Man\\"). Also, Gene was absent from the recording as he was in a relationship with actress/singer Cher and only plays and contributes to two songs. Ace and Paul had to carry the ship on this album and they do (Ace and Paul played most of the album's bass parts and each contributed three tracks a piece for the album).<br />Rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Paul Stanley contributed the opening disco tinged rocker \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" (co-written with Desmond Child and Vini Poncia) which became a huge hit for KISS and the song that alienated many fans. Paul wrote this song only to prove that how easy anyone could write a disco tune but would come back to haunt KISS with the next album (despite the fact that this was the only disco song on the album). Paul also contributed the melodic mid-tempo rocker \\"Sure Know Something\\" (which stiffed as a single and co-written with Poncia) and the rocker \\"Magic Touch\\".<br />Lead guitarist Ace Frehley (still riding on momentum from his superb solo album) contributed three rockers to the album. First, his cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"2000 Man\\" (which Ace made his own). Then it's his own penned hard rocker \\"Hard Times\\" which showed Ace was now the main hard rocker of the band. He also wrote and sang the closing rocker \\"Save Your Love\\" which he sings with venom.<br />Bass player/singer/songwriter Gene Simmons only contributed two rockers to the album being the side 2 opener \\"Charisma\\" (penned with Howard Marks) and the self-penned rocker \\"X-Ray Eyes\\".<br />Drummer Peter Criss contributed the rocker with a disco beat out of \\"Dirty Livin'\\" (which he co-wrote with his buddy the late Stan Penridge and Vini Poncia). This would be Peter's last tune with the band until 1998's Psycho Circus.<br />I first got the Dynasty album on cassette in August of 1988 and upgraded to CD in January of 1993 but the sound was kind of bland and some of the tracks had a few seconds cut off from the ending on the song. The 1997 remastered CD had the album re-released with the original artwork and also all of the songs are restored to their full lengths like on the original vinyl LP and cassette issues and is the definitive version of Dynasty and sounds superb.<br />Dynasty saw the band splinter but the album is chock full of great moments but sadly was the last with Peter Criss who left the band in early 1980. The Dynasty album was once again a Platinum seller which hit #9 on the album charts.<br />This album is highly recommended!sco tune but would come back to haunt KISS with the next album (despite the fact that this was the only disco song on the album).

B006RUJST6|5.0|I have recently been in a reading slump and couldn't really find something to capture my interest after The Grey series. While I'm certainly enjoyed Christian and Ana, their problems were certainly not as raw and realistic as Will and Lake. After I reading a few reviews, I picked this book up around 10 last night and couldn't put it down until 2am. It's a fast read and worth every minute. The story is totally captivating with funny, heart wrenching, and romantic moments. Definitely a must read.
0307341550|5.0|This was the first Gillian Flynn novel I read, and I have to say I was hooked from the beginning. I've seen a lot of complaints about the implausible ending, and I can see where some of the things that happen do seem a little far-fetched, but if you're not approaching the novel expecting a fast-paced detective thriller, you won't be disappointed.<br />The novel is highly character-driven, exploring the characters and developing dynamics rather than having Camille running around putting together the pieces of a mystery. Honestly, I think that made it a better novel, because novels all about solving a mystery are a dime a dozen. This explores a mystery without having the main character be an unintentional detective, for the most part, and it's that much better for it.<br />Sharp Objects has a unique and gripping tone, characters that are definitely fleshed out (though not easily related to), and an amazing, well-written storyline. Some parts do seem implausible, I will admit, but if you're not reading it and expecting something that could happen to anyone (and, really, how realistic are most murder mysteries anyone reads?), it's an amazing read. I would definitely recommend it, along with the rest of Gillian Flynn's books.

031618201X|5.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Hits all the high points of the novel without any of the fluff. Soulless translates well into the Manga form with snappy lines and quirky characters.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: Mama, it says here that a new gentlemen's club opened last week in Mayfair.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />I'm going to start off my review with this note. If you are a manga fan, I highly recommend the Soulless Manga: Volume 1. It is funny, it's quirky, and it hits all the high notes of the novel without any of the filler. There are a few things that may cause problems for true fans of the Parasol novels. In the manga, all the characters are pretty and young (minus the wax-like man) and boob-alicious. I always saw Professor Lyall as middle aged but here he looks like he is barely twenty. I did feel like one thing was missing from the manga, since you weren't given the characters thoughts, it was hard to understand character motivations. The novel is full of each characters inner thoughts so it did feel like something was missing. Alexia never really complained about her Italian heritage or her father. Lord Maccon only mentions once that he is Scottish later in the manga, otherwise you would never know. I did read the novel and the manga back to back so I just filled in the gaps from memory.<br /><br />The manga also starts off differently than the novel. Alexia and her family are at the breakfast table reading about Alexia's adventures the night before from the paper. Although her family doesn't realize that the paper is talking about her. The vampire attack is played as more of a flashback in Alexia's mind, where you learn about Alexia's abilities as a Soulless. Her Soulless abilities allow her to negate supernatural powers, temporarily turning them human as long as she is touching them skin to skin.<br /><br />As I stated before, since there is barely any filler, the manga is a fast paced a fun read. This manga is a fantastic translation of the novel, scenes and dialogue match the book exactly. Lord Akeldama's flamboyancy translates perfectly into manga form (his character was definitely made to be drawn!). Soulless Manga, Volume 1 is a must have for the fans of the Parasol Protectorate series.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Yen Press provided me with a copy of Soulless: The Manga, Volume 1. No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review.tic translation of the novel, scenes and dialogue match the book exactly.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome game to play with my kids. We can build our villages separately and share how we are growing. keep up the great updates.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|it is really cool how it cost five dolla so I sold it and bought It and you get my point
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Have to say, the best book I`ve read in ages, I`m 65years old and really thought I would not like it, how wrong was I, took hold of me right from the start, could not put it down, beautifully written, easy to read, and a very compelling and believable storyline. Am about to start book 2 now, can`t wait, will keep you posted
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so cute and I love how all the original characters are involved. Great game for the kids just be aware that they cane easily charge some game goodies to your account if you are not supervising.....

1606995359|1.0|The book was returned for exchange the first time due to an odor and was already used.  Upon opening the book there was no resistance as with a new book.  The exchanged book had the same problems.  I didn't wish to go through the hassle again so I just kept the book.

B002RSDW80|4.0|Julie and Julia is a fun, lighthearted story of two women who found themselves by discovering food. I live in Pasadena, California, the city where Julia Child was born and raised. Although Julia found herself while living in Paris during a time in history where few women worked, she started a food revolution. No more Spam and Bisquick, but she actually taught women how to cook French food where ever they lived- without servants. Julie on the other hand admired Julia so much she created a blog about cooking one of Julia's recipes each day for a year. Although the two never met,, both women found purpose in their lives through food. 2012 marks Julia Child's 100th birthday in Pasadena, and the city is CELEBRATING one of their own this month with many local restaurants cooking Julia's food to honor her as well as city celebrations. Julia really made a difference. So did Julie as her blog and the movie based on it brought Julia to life as never before.I remember seeing Julia on television but I never really knew her. After viewing the movie I feel like she is with me in my kitchen while I cook recipes from her cookbook.What a testament to two women who made a difference.

0345803485|5.0|Wanted to see what all the hype was about Fifty Shades of Grey.  Let me tell you, E.L. James does not disappoint!  Not for the shrewd type to read - very sexually explicit.  I am now reading the second book, Fifty Shades Darker.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was pleased with order.  Book was delivered in good time.  Merchandise was in good shape.  I will order again.
034580404X|4.0|This series was recommended by female coworkers. I do not read romance novels before and never read an R to X rated series before. The author spins a very intriguing story with fleshed out characters and a compelling plot. Be Forewarned this is a series about S & M.  If you are conservative it will shock you. Its akin to literary porn.<br /><br />  Make sure you don't leave this book lying around. Its not something you want your kids to pick up. Also make sure your husband or boyfriend is close by.<br />You will definitely be in the mood and need an outlet. The handcuffs and restraints are optional!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Great app for free. Like that you can layer the sounds and that it has a timer.  Wondering how reviews for other apps get posted on this apps review??!
B001453LSI|5.0|This is a great song! I love Melody Gardot, her voice is unique and phrasing is great. I look forward to getting more of her stuff.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie is a Western that has aliens in it. It is not a science fiction flick. If you approach it that way, I think you will really enjoy it. It has all the characters you expect in a shoot em up western. It has native americans who are way more savvy than the ignorant and unimaginative cowboys.
B0074JODP8|5.0|My love for Joe goes way back and I think this is the very best so far.  I had seen<br />part of this concert on PBS and had to order it right away.  It's even better than<br />the concert at Albert Hall.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Works like a champ on my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S 3. Provides all the information I need for both my daily life and for planning for future activities. Includes current weather and detailed forecasts for out to 10 days. Also, has alerts for severe weather, vignettes on wx across the country, and beautifully illustrated and easy to understand graphics.<br /><br />Updated, February 9th, 2013...still working well. It provides excellent updates on severe weather warnings or advisories issued by the National Weather Service. Becoming more and more of an essential tool to have, day by day.
1401937519|4.0|I enjoyed this book and have enjoyed a couple of interviews of Ms. Moorjani on You Tube. I find near death experiences to be very interesting and of great value. In Anita Moorjani's book, what is more interesting than her experience itself, is the message she brings to all of us- the importance of being ourselves and enjoying life to the fullest. Living authentically allows us to reach our potential and play the part we have come here to play. This is a great message and one that is needed desperately to counteract the incessant demand that we fit in and conform to others' expectations of us.It also gives some insight into the mechanics of manifesting our destiny.
B0083EXW50|3.0|Sounds like a typical Fear Factory album but there is nothing special about it. Listened to it once and haven't felt the need to play it again.
0062197258|3.0|I have to admit that I do not care for split timeline stories.  The characters are kind of likeable at least for awhile.  Once Catherine has lived through a nightmare of abuse she is suffering from OCD and PTSD.  I could understand that but the personalities just take way too long to mesh and work together.  I must say I started and stopped several times and finally did give up entirely so take my review with your own skepticism in hand.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|I bought this to go on my kindle fire for a long car trip on a vacation for my daughter to watch.  It was great.  They are instant on the kindle fire and I downloaded it for her to watch offline while we were in the car.  It downloaded surprisingly quick too.  Then I was very happy to find out my xbox 360 had an amazon instant video app on it.  So now my daughter watches it on our tv through our xbox also.  Worth the money compared to buying a dvd.  And the movie is super cute!
B0063IH60K|4.0|overall it is a good app... sometimes hint goes into circles. it means that hint suggest something and afterward, it suggest opposite.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app has so many varieties of games and it makes you want to play over and over.
B007XF0X6G|3.0|The special effects, while present, were nicely constructed, but I expected to see a bit more from this movie, in terms of lay-out of plots.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game. my kids have a great time playing while setting around watching Tv. keeps then busy for hours.
0385342055|4.0|This book made me laugh so hard! Minnie is so cute! And for those that say she will grow up to be spoiler and rotten I ask you. If you had an only daughter and love shopping wouldn't you do the same? . I think I would spoil my daughter like that too, and new moms aren't perfect even if its a fictional character. I loved this book if you like a light funny and charming book I would recommend this.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is easy to understand.  The familiar charectors help make it fun. It still has some challenges and it fun to create a new world!
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|This book is one of my top favorite books. When I'm feeling down or at my best I read it sometimes twice in a row just because. I love the character Becky, shes funny and strong yet realistic. This book is wonderful if you are a shopaholic at heart.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved reading all three novels on the Kindle! It was so convenient. I didn't have to rush to get the next one at a bookstore but could scroll right through to begin obsessively reading 2 & 3! :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is definitely for the young and sex starved adults.  I had heard about this book from a passenger on the bus, (young adult).  I should have asked what it was about.  Read a sample.  Still was unaware.  Because on the kindle you don't have a front inside nor back cover.  Did not expect this book to be so erotic.  I did finish the book.  I will not read the other two books.  I did not like this book at all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This one is a page turner, kept me on the edge of my seat.  Always a new unexpected twist and turn.
0679890475|5.0|Lovely and fun book about a baby bird who has never actually seen his Mom, so doesn't know what to look for when he hatches. And the human at the end is touchingly sweet in coming to the rescue.This was the board book version. I actually like the hard back better because the story is stretched out onto more pages, but this is fine for a small child to hold and look at without ripping out sections.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I've been a fan for nearly a dozen years now - I had high expectations for this CD. I was not disappointed. With each play-through I find something new and incredible to love about this CD. There are certainly some differences from their earlier music, but they are positive additions. Highly recommend!
140521225X|5.0|Great book for preschoolers - few words, but most are the animal names. Uses color coding to match the keys to the cages and other little things you can discuss with a non-reader by just looking at picture details.Great humor - go wife!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so much fun if u love puzzles and figuring stuff out. get this get this get this and the best thing its all free no upgrades to pay more lots fun on kindle fire
B0055SWM08|5.0|Engaging mind puzzles. Great layout and calming music. Lots of levels. Younger children wish you didn't have to use coins to see hints. One of our favorite games.
B006P0FIGU|4.0|This was a fun updating of the beloved action classic full of youthful exuberance and outlandish costumes with a Matrix feel for the whole affair.  Porthos, Athos, and Aramis are played out as superhero agents of France's dolt of a king who's heart is really in the right place (and, oh, his horrid outfits are cringe-funny!) and who all come into contact with rash, young D'Artagnon who helps to restore their faith in the Musketeers and their liege.  Milla Jovovich (of Resident Evil fame) plays the scheming, double-crossing Milady de Winter in league with a fey Duke of Buckingham (played by Pirates of the Carribean's Orlando Bloom) and the costumes and outfits they wear are a huge part of this film's outlandishness.  The quite literal air ships are very cool and if only they would have been real!  Outlandish is a good word to describe this bit of fun fiction (directed by much maligned Paul W.S. Anderson) and for the action adventure film enthusiast there is a lot to enjoy.
1451627297|5.0|Jake Epping is an English teacher with a fairly mundane life. His ex-wife is an alcoholic and he now lives alone. But one day his friend, Al, lets him into a secret. He has found a portal in time where he is able to go back to September 9th, 1958. Each time Al goes back in time, only two minutes pass in the present time. Also, every time is a reset, so whatever happens, whenever he goes back, everything has gone back to normal again. Or so he thinks...<br /><br />Al is sick and asks Jake to undertake a task of massive proportion - to go back and save the life of JFK. Jake, naturally, is hesitant. There are too many 'what ifs' surrounding the President's assassination, too many conspiracy theories about the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, not acting alone.<br /><br />Despite all of his concerns, Jake decides to take on the mission. His journey into the past is more than just a mission; it becomes his life. In the years between his arrival in 1958 and JFK's assassination in 1963, he builds a life for himself, including falling for the woman who becomes the love of his life, Sadie Dunhill.<br /><br />But the past doesn't want to be changed. Nature it's self, together with a harmonising set of circumstances, all seem set to stop Jake doing what he plans.<br /><br />In my opinion, Stephen King is the master of long novels. Many people complain he is wordy, but for me he simply creates a whole world you don't want to leave. Much of the novel is simply about life in the fifties and early sixties, and while I was still a decade or so away from being born, I completely felt and experienced the era through King's writing.<br /><br />One highlight for me was when Jake went back to Derry and we met Beverly Marsh and Richie Tozer from 'It' again. I so wish he'd write something else about Derry; I'm sure he could create something with the same terror of 'It'. Anyway, I digress. Though '22.11.63.' is about a man trying to stop the assassination of JFK, it is also a love story. The relationship between Jake and Sadie is honest, real and heart-warming. I won't say too much about the ending of the book, but let's just say I shed a tear or two!<br /><br />Overall this was a five star read for me. Even though it is another brick of a book, I didn't want it to end and was sad when it did. This isn't horror by any means, but it's a wonderful story which encapsulates the political atmosphere of the early sixties, with the paradox of time travel, and true love between a man and a woman.<br /><br />I loved it.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|latest update wiped out all progress. Got another update. wiped out all progress again! I constantly get double updates from Amazon. seriously get your act together! wish I could get my money back and get it from Google play!
B0068FZ0ZG|1.0|When I received this I attempted to download the digital copy following the provided instructions. The download failed to process and I received a notice that the code provided was invalid. I attempted to contact Universal and received no response. I then emailed amazon and asked for their assistance. I was informed that this was not their problem that it was between me and universal. I did NOT purchase from universal, I purchased it from amazon and it is amazon that did NOT provide me with the entire item that I purchased! FAIL FAIL FAIL!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is awesome.  Great variety of games and even my 4 year old can play them.  Some games are a little cheesy but still fun. I also like the fact that the more you play the more games you can get.
B004ZISVWC|2.0|The \\"movie\\" started out at the very beginning with text claiming that these hours of tape were sent to a studio anonymously and that experts had spent a year trying to determine if they were genuine or not--concluding that they were genuine.  How stupid.  This was not a movie at all but was a fake documentary.  If you are a science fiction fan (as I am) but also don't mind watching shows about bigfoot you might like this.  But I couldn't stand it.  If I'm going to watch a documentary I would kind of like for it to be real.
B000001FFR|5.0|This is great thrash album i love AIR the first song on this album just tells ya how good Anthrax is. Anyways the whole album is good buy this and don't forget Anthrax's best album Among The Living. Spreading The Disease and Among The Living is Anthrax's best albums in my books. Great Thrash Metal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Easy read with footnotes and backup. Turns the \\"conventional wisdom\\" on its head. Uses and distills complex medical studies to explain his points. Not a diet book, but s road map to loose weight.
088103052X|1.0|The book is the same size and materials as a cheap paperback.  It just has a hard back cover, hardly worth the $12.51 price.  It was listed as large print and it is not.  Do not waste your money on this format.
030758836X|1.0|No idea how people could like this book!  I am trying to like this book, some parts are fine but the way it goes back and forth is annoying.<br />Slow, boring, thank goodness for fast forward!
B006C45CFG|4.0|I like this a lot better at home than I did in the theater for some reason .... actually watched it twice. The whole plot is clever, and the blend of old west with alien technology works real well.<br /><br />Olivia Wilde is ... well, Wilde. A rare beauty that can act.<br /><br />Craig is believable as a western hero, no English accent ... they guy can act with the best of them.<br /><br />Ford is OK as the gruff old geezer ... how many more action flicks can he make ... he'll be in a walker soon.<br /><br />The alien critters were suitably nasty, but familiar. It must be tough to come up with aliens that are fresh and new ... these guys looked made up from some bits from the original alien, some frog parts, and a smidgen of Ninja Turtles on LSD.<br /><br />All in all, pretty good fun.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is a page turner that has many unexpected twists.  Since it's hard to put down, it's a pretty quick read that is a murder mystery and more.  Is violence genetic?
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Honestly, SGU started out poorly.  Way too much conflict between the characters, for no good reason.  But as the first season developed, it just got more and more interesting.  And the second season was just phenomenal, with some of the best scifi stories of any series in years.  Visually, the show was amazing, and all that character conflict in the first season really started to pay off.  When SyFy cancelled SGU and Caprica in short order, they basically crushed the best scifi on television in years.  But the SGU folks went out on a high, as the final scene of the final episode was just brilliant, uplifting, poignant, and memorable.  It was a perfect ending to the series, and it also could've been the perfect setup to the next season.  Of all the series cancelled before their time, this one hurts more than most.<br /><br />BUT, at least SyFy could do something to mitigate their error in cancelling the show, by finally RELEASING SEASON 2 ON BLU-RAY!!!  It's just a slap in the face to the series' fans that it hasn't happened.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you loved the first two, than you'll love this one too.  I just had to know how it ended.  This story continues with our trio, a rescue, a murder plot, a war and finally peace.  Who does Katniss end up with?  I won't tell!
B000SW2F6M|4.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is one of those films that needs a caveat in the opening sequence: \\"Loosely based on events suggested by The Crusades.\\"<br /><br />It is that far off historically.<br /><br />But it is still visually impressive, has some quirky performances, manages to send several messages about the importance of symbols and the meaning of honor and courage.<br /><br />The performances are all strong with the role of the King of the Latin Kingdoms, who has a cancerous skin condition that is slowly killing him, particularly so.<br /><br />There is more than a little slamming of the role of religion, especially when it is misused to excuse the inexcusable, but even that is nuanced by those who represent faith as a calling together of humanity.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was hard putting it down. It was well written and interesting. I would recommend it it.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|\\"Super 8\\" is a well done film. The narrative is smooth and generally makes sense. The visuals are impressive with the film within a film device working particularly well. The acting is believable from start to finish. The \\"creature\\" turns out to be \\"someone\\" who is far from home and has been frightened into madness.<br /><br />At the heart of story is a boy who has lost his mother in a terrible work accident, a father who has lost his wife and, as a result, his son, and is trying to replace both with his job, and an alien imprisoned for many years by a combination of curious scientists, and nasty government types.<br /><br />The three are thrown together by a train crash and the film is mostly about them moving toward each other.<br /><br />At one point the boy yells at his father that \\"he does not get it.\\" At the end of the film, the dad holds his son in his arms and says \\"I got you.\\" A few moments earlier the alien, having grabbed the kid, and discovering that he has touched a kindred soul- lost, sad, in pain, angry- hears the words: \\"You don't have to stay.\\" after the boy's statement that sometimes awful things happen and you just have to move on.<br /><br />The boy gets it.<br />The dad gets it.<br />The alien gets it.<br />I got it.<br /><br />It's a powerful message.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun and challenging. I even got my dad hooked on it. a must have for puzzle lovers.
030758836X|4.0|What a great page turning, plot twisting, character driven book! My daughter and I read it at the same time, and when we ask each other questions it would be \\"what is Nick doing? Or what clue did Amy leave?\\" We were both drawn in, and then we'd say \\"you have no idea\\". it was a fast and fun read!
0553386794|4.0|This is certainly one sprawling, epic read but is nicely paced with short'ish chapters that briskly flows from one character's perspective to another, each ending on cliffhangers of sorts to keep the reader actively engaged and eager to continue plugging along.  Admittedly I did watch the HBO series before reading the book and came away surprised at how faithful the TV adaptation adhered to the source material.  Even if you've already watched Season 1, I still recommend giving this one a proper read especially if you're at all interested in learning more about the details and lore.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The better part of society as we know it has collapsed. In many ways the world has turned back the clock to a more agrarian society. Manual labor is the norm again, rather than the exception. The population is considerably lessened. How did all this happen? How did it get to that stage? That's the focus of this wonderful book by Max Brooks. Brooks imagines a world recently overrun by zombie hordes. He tells the tale through the eyes of a journalist/biographer who is collecting stories of survivors and their experiences, much in the way current WWII and Korea veterans are being interviewed to this day. Some of them were important people, historically speaking. Some were not. But all of them saw the war through different prisms. They all had something to contribute to the story of the zombies, aka Zed.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|A bit races for me, but the book just keep your interest and I could not put it down. At the end I had to buy book 2 to see what was going to happen as it left me hanging.
B001CDWFPC|3.0|I have a tough time with huge amounts of text on Kindle. You're constantly skipping through rather than reading straight through like a novel. That said, there are major pluses, too. I like the commentary that it comes with. It includes some great photos, too. It's funny though. You click on the cross-reference, then you keep reading, and it's as though that illustration disappeared. It's like a little mystery. Maybe next year you'll come across it again some time. You have no idea where in your e-book that stuff is kept.
B000UJ48SQ|1.0|I am an avid Kubrick fan, hell I even enjoyed Spartacus and Eyes Wide Shut, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this based on the name attached alone.  Although his directorial presence is still very much active in the cinematography and style of the work, the entertainment value to be found is nonexistent.  The way I would describe this film is, Gone With the Wind without any of the interesting bits.  A boring film about Irish aristocracy, the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are cinematographers and history buffs.  Do not be enticed by the intriguing DVD cover, for even the most die-hard Kubrick fan this movie isn't worth your time.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is far and away the best stylus I have ever used. I purchased it for my iPad, but now use it on my phone as well.<br /><br />The stylus is substantial--comparable to a crayola marker (with the lid off), and weighted like a high-end pen. Unlike other hard-tipped plastic models, this stylus has a smooth, slightly tacky rubberized grip. The tip is soft but sturdy rubber and has some give. When writing, the stylus glides across the screen smoothly and naturally. You won't have to worry about scratches and, best of all, the soft tip ensures that you don't get that plastic-on-glass tapping sound characteristic of cheaper, hard-plastic styluses.<br /><br />The Cosmonaut Stylus works brilliantly on the iPad. Selecting and copying text is a breeze, and the seamless writing experience transforms handwritten note-taking apps into useful tools. For my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3), I use the stylus instead of my finger when writing in Swype mode. I hated Swype autocorrect, but this stylus increased my accuracy and solved the problem.<br /><br />As a bonus, the Cosmonaut Stylus is not only functional, but beautiful--an excellent example of good design.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

But when Jonas starts training with \\"the giver\\" the veil on his world is pulled back and he learns the true price of his supposedly peaceful community.<br /><br />The Giver was the dystopian ya novel before dystopian ya novels were hip. I missed this book as a kid, but I've been hearing a lot about it lately.<br /><br />After reading it, I realize how big a debt Veronica Roth's Divergent owes this book and Lauren Oliver's Delirium as well.<br /><br />The difference with The Giver is Lowry's writing mastery.  The Giver's premise is revealed in a way that makes you walk in Jonas' shoes. You see the beauty and the logic as well as the horror of the dystopia he lives in. While the more modern dystopias sometimes skimp on explanation, the world in The Giver is very fully imagined, and therefore, seems more plausible.<br /><br />The Giver is a bit slower in pace, and since Jonas is only 12, the perspective is more innocent than something like Divergent, but make no mistake, this is a hard-hitting dark, dystopian novel, one that really speaks to that startling time in life when you first realize that the world is not what you thought it was.

0385342063|5.0|This book is my new favorite from Sophie Kinsella. She really captured the essence of romance in the digital age and the dialogue (the texts) were so fun and witty! I was really disappointed with Shopahlic and Baby, so to me, this book was a great comeback for this author. If you want a fluffy, smart, laugh-out-loud romance, I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This isn't a bad read at all - not 'tiring' like some of the similar books on the art of sniping by other writers.<br />The book lends fairly in-depth insights to the required mindset, preparation, training, techniques and considerations faced by modern day snipers in an arena where you would likely die if you aren't fully invested and on your best game.<br />The book does cover specific action situations but doesn't dwell on them excessively.<br />If you're looking for a \\"...Bang, Got Em!  Bang, Got Em!  ...I am the UberSniper.\\" action book, look elsewhere, but if you want a pretty fair narrative into the thought process and trials faced by this Navy Seal Sniper both on the job and at home, read on...

B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|Review of [[ASIN:B0085Z3B2Q Dr. Seuss' The Lorax Combo Pack]] (Two Discs: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)<br /><br />I preordered this movie set a while ago, with the expected delivery date by August 7 (as advertised).  The movie discs arrived today (August 7) as promised.  Thank you, Amazon, for keeping your word.<br /><br />  I was pleasantly surprised that the packaging was a standard bubble-lined envelope, instead of a medium/large box like the days of old.  Less packaging, less materials to have to send out for recycling (in the true spirit of the movie's \\"save the planet\\" theme).<br /><br />  I purchased the set that included blue-ray + DVD + digital copy + Ultraviolet access.  As soon as I received the text message that it was delivered, I came home to watch the movie again with my daughter.  She was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this movie, so suffice it to say that her hum drum summer day was instantly made by the opening of this package.<br /><br />  The blu-ray movie clearly shows the intricacy of the animation.  My daughter watches the DVD on her portable DVD player.  The digital copy is accessible to my HTPC (home theater PC) so that we can watch the movie from almost anywhere at home.  In addition, the ultraviolet copy allows you to keep a copy in the cloud, and to stream from any computer, iPad/tablet, iPhone, and more.  So we're good to go.<br /><br />  There are three new mini-movies included in the combo disc pack (\\"Wagon-ho,\\" \\"Forces of Nature,\\" and \\"Serenade\\").  These are available on both the blu-ray and DVD.  Also included are:<br />-The Making of the Mini-Movies<br />-Deleted Scenes<br />-Seuss to Scene<br />-Once-ler's Wagon<br />-Games<br />-Sing-Along<br />... and other things we haven't tried.<br /><br />  I initially thought the the DVD has the feature film + a few bonus features, and that no mini-movies are included on the DVD disc.  It turns out that the DVD in this combo pack also includes the mini-movies, as well as the other bonus features (the making of the \\"mini-movies\\" and other bonus features that are also included in the blu-ray disc).  It is possible that the 1-disc version (DVD only) only contains the feature film + bonus features, with no mini-movies included.  I did not get the 1-disc (DVD only) version, so I cannot attest to this.<br /><br />  The movie itself has been reviewed by many others here, so I will include a movie review with a later update.  For now, I will keep this review on the packaging and discs.<br /><br />  Yes, the movie follows the theme from the Dr. Seuss book, plus more.  Drop in the bucket... save the world one tree at a time... don't waste precious resources... any situation can be made into a song and dance number.  Take your pick.  I don't really care much for the songs, none of which I could remember even after watching the movie in the theaters.  Or maybe it's just me.<br /><br />\\"A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams. To find it he must discover the story of the Lorax, the grumpy yet charming creature who fights to protect his world.\\"  IMDB summary.<br /><br />  The character voice overs are made up of an all-star cast, consisting of Danny Devito (The Lorax), Ed Helms (The Once-Ler), Zac Efron (Ted), Taylor Swift (Audrey), and Betty White (Grammy Norma).

1439127700|5.0|If you like politics, especially presidential politics, like I do than you'll like this book.<br /><br />I enjoy reading behind-the-scenes stories, ones based on credible evidence, which the author's provide in spades. My favorite stories herein:  how Ronald Reagan taught Bill Clinton how to salute and the way George H. W. Bush conducted himself as a gentlemen during and after his presidency. Something I learned: how far Richard Nixon went during the 1968 presidential campaign (some say to the point of treason) to influence clandestinely the Viet Nam peace talks in Paris and thus the election. This was a precursor to Watergate or at least the unworthy character(s) that caused it.<br /><br />The President's Club is a study of the relationships of men who've served as President, with each other and with the current occupant of the White House. From Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama and his living predecessors the authors examine how \\"the club,\\" this unique and limited number of men (so far) have functioned in a world all their own.<br /><br />The watchwords of the club are competition, collaboration, and consultation. The club members' common goals: to preserve the credibility and power of the Office of the President, to protect America, and to advance, as possible, their own reputations and legacies.<br /><br />Hoover and Truman launched the modern club. Catching their partisan peers off guard they worked successfully in post-war Europe to save the lives of tens of millions of hungry people. Later, at Truman's behest the Hoover Commission helped transform the Office of the President into a powerful platform for leadership of the Free World. Later still, they surprised themselves and became lifelong friends.<br /><br />JFK and Lyndon Johnson leaned heavily upon Ike Eisenhower for private consultation about Viet Nam and much more. Nixon was a fatally flawed man, but his brilliant insights involving international relations helped Bush 41, even Clinton. Ford and Carter made amends and worked together off and on for over twenty years; they even tried to rescue Clinton, or at least his office, when Clinton became the second president to be impeached.<br /><br />Bush 43 kept a public distance (in terms of consultation) from his father during his campaigns and presidencies, yet their relationship as son and father was and is deep and forever. It was 41 who later created the opportunity for 43 and Clinton to partner in humanitarian relief, launching what many and even they call a special \\"father/son\\" relationship. Now, it's Obama and, after a testy time, Clinton, and surprisingly perhaps, Bush 43. President Obama sent Clinton and 43 to Haiti for humanitarian relief efforts that raised tens of millions. The club, all members have found, is useful politically and personally.<br /><br />There's something about the job of President of the United States, the crushing responsibility, tension and concern in the face of global threats, the loneliness in leadership that draws all who've held the position together. Who else can fully understand? And all, regardless of party and policy want the President and the Nation to succeed. Consequently, the Presidents Club, when it's at its best, represents one of the blessings of a free, democratic, and peaceful transfer of power.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested American politics, the presidency, or leadership.Ford and Carter made amends and worked together off and on for over twenty years; they even tried to rescue Clinton, or at least his office, when Clinton became the second president to be impeached.<br /><br />Bush 43 kept a public distance (in terms of consultation) from his father during his campaigns and presidencies, yet their relationship as son and father was and is deep and forever.

159413586X|1.0|this was a horrible book! I'm very dissapointed in Susan Collins. i loved the hunger games and catching fire, but most of this book was absolutely terrible. she ruined the end the most! i means killing some of the charaters that were there from the beggining. (im not saying who ;^] ) and the ending was very bland, it just feels like there needs to be a second series, because it felt like the was no ending. so i say this was an altogether bad book, Thank You

0142000655|5.0|Where do you begin with EAST OF EDEN, for it offers the reader a bounty of pleasures and ideas to contemplate?  The beautiful tone of the prose flows along like a gentle breeze, while increasing the intensity of dramatic moments.  Steinbeck's characters, as they always do, capture you, but even more so in this magnum opus, in particular Samuel Hamilton, the polymath progenitor from whom Olive and then John Steinbeck descended (the novel contains autobiographical elements), a man you wish you could spend an hour or two with; Lee, the highly educated, very wise, completely unassuming Trask housekeeper and companion, who gives rise to the central, hopeful theme of the novel, summed up in the Hebrew word timshel (thou mayest, Steinbeck's translation in support of the theme of choosing between good and evil); and Cal Trask, self-aware of the potential for evil and good within him, probably the most dimensional character in the vast cast.  Steinbeck renders the epic, sequential story arcs of good versus evil, with permutations, on the most personal level of family, in a way we can feel and identify with.  Yes, EAST OF EDEN is his greatest novelistic achievement, among the greatest family sagas of any century, and one of the best American novels by any American writer, and the best because, put plainly, it is a pleasure and inspiration to read.  If you haven't read it, please do yourself a favor and do so now.<br /><br />You'll also find the novel timeless.  After all, don't we all still struggle with good and evil; don't we all yet make choices that lead us down paths we wish we did not find ourselves treading; don't we all yearn to turn our lives around at some point but wonder how to do so?  If only we had a Samuel or Lee to nudge and guide us; if only we could grasp our plight and wrestle our nature into obedience as Cal will.  Well, at least you'll know you are not alone; you'll know you're just human.<br /><br />As you read the novel, and perhaps critiques of it as well, you'll find the central theme to be that a person has it in his or her power to choose between good and evil.  Adam and his son Aron are the symbols, the suffering symbols, of good.  Charles, Adam's brother, and Cathy, Adam's wife, are evil, and choose to be such.  Cal, who possesses evil tendencies, recognizes his predilection to evil.  He strives mightily to choose to be good.  But I 'd add that Steinbeck might be also telling us that with each generation we trend more to the good, making the individual struggle more hopeful.  You'll see this vividly illustrated in Cal, who appears to have descended from Cathy and Charles.<br /><br />Finally, should you explore information on the novel, you'll discover that readers have pulled many quotes from EAST OF EDEN.  It's that kind of novel, a place to find any number of thoughts meaningful to you and your life.  This passage, which I haven't seen quoted, struck me the moment I read it.  It demonstrates Steinbeck's keen understanding of the American character, a summation well worth keeping in mind today.  Lee addresses Cal after a devastating turn in the story (page 568, Penguin Centennial Edition):<br /><br />\\"We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left.  All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies.  It's a breed--selected out by accident.  And so we're overbrave and overfearful--we're kind and cruel as children.  We're overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers.  We boast and are impressed.  We're oversentimental and realistic.  We are mundane and materialistic--and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals?  We eat too much.  We have no taste, no sense of proportion.  We throw our energy about like waste.  In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture.  Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture?\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended as a vital, brilliant masterwork that will never lose it relevancy, as well as for its superb style.rwork that will never lose it relevancy, as well as for its superb style.

B0088X7YU0|3.0|\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion,\\" fourth feature film of the series, is a computer animated film directed by Shinji Aramaki, a Japanese animation director, best known for \\"Appleseed\\" (2004). Three principal characters from the Starship Troopers series, Carmen Ibanez, Carl Jenkins and Johnny Rico appear, but their roles are relatively small, in the film's first half in particular.<br /><br />The story goes like this. Earth Federation Force troopers led by Lieutenant Tony Daugherty (Sam Roman) are sent to Federation's outpost Fort Casey that was attacked by bugs. One of the survivors is Carl Jenkins (Justin Doran), ministry of Paranormal Warfare, who takes over the command of the Starship John A. Warden from Carmen Ibanez (Luci Christian), and leaves the bug-infested base without telling what happened.<br /><br />After the mission, Johnny Rico (David Matranga) - he is General Rico now - gives a new assignment to Carmen and the trooper team on the fast attack ship Alesia. John A. Warden is missing, and they have to find the starship and Carl.<br /><br />The story of the 89 minute film is fast-paced but sometimes confusing and cluttered with too many characters. The weapon designs (trooper's powered suit and Marauders) are impressive, and so are the production designs of the starships, but CG-rendered human characters leave much to be desired. The faces of the characters barely escape the so-called \\"uncanny valley,\\" but still sometimes look lifeless.<br /><br />The combat scenes are mostly acceptable, but don't expect intensity of Paul Verhoeven's live-action version, which remains the best of the series. The battle scenes with Arachnids get repetitious as the story goes on, and sometimes movements of bugs and humans look a bit awkward. And ... do we need a shower scene here? (The film includes nudity.)<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is executive-produced by Casper Van Dien and Edward Neumeier, the writer of all three \\"Starship Trooper\\" films. Casper Van Dien, who played Johnny Rico in the first and third films, does not appear in this animated film, which was shot in Japan in May, 2011, using the motion capture technologies. The film's visuals are by Sola Digital Arts, Inc., a studio founded in Japan in 2010. The script is written by Flint Dille known for his animation and video game writing.<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is an OK animation film with some nice combat scenes, undermined by the creaky storyline and occasionally ineffective visuals.
B005JSM5YW|5.0|First and foremost, this movie was never going to be in the running for an academy award. That said, Crazy Stupid Love was a surprisingly delightful movie, with hilarious twists one would never expect.<br />Prior to seeing this movie, I was not a Steve Carell fan.

She contracts a deadly virus that spreads like wild fire and is contagious by touch and body fluids (sneezing and coughing). Death comes within a few days and those who catch this flu have a 25 % to 30% chance to die.<br /><br />Governments are paralyzed in trying to find the source of the disease and a possible cure. Even if a cure is found how can you quickly immunize billions of people worldwide? Normal people are rioting and stealing from each other......<br /><br />This movie is a possible scenario of another Spanish Flu type epidemic where 50 to 100 million people died from 1918 to 1920 and 500 million were infected. Based on today's population the figure would be over 3.5 times worse. This movie is based on an actual potential disaster and it clearly shows how mankind is totally unprepared for such an event.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good and characters of Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) were played pretty well. Where the movie fell down is that there is just too much data thrown at the audience and it may be difficult for some people to get their arms around the storyline. The story also jumped in the timeline multiple times and you really have to follow closely or possibly get lost.<br /><br />I thought the movie was above average but not spectacular.

0307716988|4.0|When I received this book, It was the in the condition that I was told it would be in. It was on time, I wont hesitate to order from this company again. and it was a good read. I was hoping for more depth in the story, especially between him and his father. and little bit more about the early years. It really, relies alot on the pictures to tell the story, also the story is over before you know it. It could have delved into the business end of his life more. But was worth not hearing it from the scandal sheets.

B008OBMXPW|5.0|I have been a fan of Antony's since I first heard his music a couple years back.  I think the most accurate term I could use to describe Antony's work is \\" emotionally intelligent \\".<br />Antony is fealess in describing emotion and yet poetic at the same time. Hauntingly so.  Antony's work for me is more to be experienced than analyzed.<br />Beautiful .<br />Thank you for your offering Antony

B00028HBKM|4.0|It is great that we can see our savior bloodied up and beaten.  Why?  I really did not think Jesus was treated this harshly til I saw the movie and THEN confirmed the actions from the Bible.<br /><br />This movie complements but doesn't replace our daily devoution, testimony, and fath in Jesus Christ.  This movie did not convert me but helped me, along with my brother and his fiance (at the time), to consider the case for Christ.
0345803485|3.0|The writing is quite average, but then, so is mine. I think it's primarily the sexual fantasy that's selling this book, because the characters and events do not seem realistic. For those who like more realism than Fifty Shades of Grey, there's a book of ten short stories all based on real events called, Why Do Men Cheat? It's on Amazon, too. While also not a great literary piece, it's entertaining and informative at the same time because the stories are created from actual events told from the lives of real people's experiences. And, yes, it has juicy sex scenes tastefully written without foul language.

Jimmy Fallon is the other.<br /><br />Alabama Shakes are wonderful! Brittany Howard's deep, rich voice reaches into your soul and hugs it big!  Listen anytime, but especially on a road trip. It moves the miles along so that you arrive without realizing how long the drive was. Great!<br /><br />Amazon's prices and service are the best. I just disputed an unexpected charge and it was quickly resolved in my favor. A class act.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was reccomended to me by a good blogger friend of mind, Trini from A Book Lovers Review. (HI, TRINI) And I can't thank her enough for recommending such an awesome and amazing book! It stayed in my head for days :)<br /><br />The plot to this book is amazing. I have to admit, that I was a bit skeptical when it came to slamming. Unsure exactly what it was, I did not think I could not get into it. I was wrong. The author allows ample time to set into the characters, get introduce to slamming and BAM! You're in. Simple as that. With the first poem, I actually felt a bit nervous. Like I was the once on the stage, laying out my deepest fears and emotions.<br /><br />The characters of the book do some growing in the book. I like that theirs lives were not easy but had plenty of  drama surrounding them. I enjoyed being in their shoes, living their lives. There are many points where you feel you everything that they feel. The love, the hurt, the regret. I had to set the book down just to gather myself again. Characters are well built and beautifully written.<br /><br />The love interest will take you under. This love made me want, love, and cry. I can't get over how many times I gasp or how many times I was like,\\"No way.\\" Their love grows so much in the readers heart. The author does a great job in getting the reader invested in the characters fast. I wasn't even half-way through the book and my heart was already breaking into two.<br /><br />Slammed is an exquisite, fierce novel. The mind-blowing crescendo of events leaves the reader breathless and wanting the more. Slammed is the reason why books make you feel alive. It's loving and heart-breaking, bringing the reader to a point where you want to beg for mercy. And when you get to the ending, it's fitting and perfect. Slammed is alluring and invigorating. Nothing like it's kind, you must read this book.

B004J4XGN6|5.0|... but Eric Ries certainly qualifies for the title.<br /><br />In one sentence: \\"I wish I had read this before I started my first business and failed\\".<br /><br />The changes he proposes on the process of starting a venture are counter-intuitive but absolutely well-founded. As a software developer, I find it amazing that most of the practices he proposes, like small batches and iterative approach to construction, are actually being used with large success in software development for a while now.<br /><br />TLDR: Read this even if you're not an \\"enterpreneur\\" - it makes you think differently about every and any project you tackle in your life - personal and professional.

0440242401|3.0|This is one of those books where you picked it up and just wanted to get it over with. I wouldn't necessarily say it sucks but there's nothing great about it. It's a silly girl having amnesia forgetting the last 3 years of her life after a car crash. Woke up married to a multimillionaire thinking she's got the best life. Just to realized there are secrets, lost friendships & lies. She's desperately trying to fit into this new life yet desperately trying to remember what & how she got where she is now.<br /><br />Would I read it again? Nope. Would I recommend it to anyone? Nope. It's cute but the main character Lexi is annoying, gullible & naive as hell. Happy ending to an expected ending. I'm almost glad it's over & I only spent 4 days reading this. Hahaha

0345803485|1.0|So Fifty Shades of Grey has seemed to sweep the nation.  Given that it is porn in book form (saying literary porn is a far too generous term), it seems to be a more socially acceptable vice for a woman's curiosity.  So I decided to read it.  At first, it was nothing special, by no means a work of art or great writing, but more of a stream of consciousness, which was fine by me.  At first the story resonated quite well with me, the main character is a young woman graduating from college who finds herself both at the start of her career but also suddenly enthralled by a mysterious man.  Being somewhat of a romantic myself, I was familiar with the almost middle school like crush associated with something new and exciting, and in this case, just about forbidden.  So at some point we are told that Christian Grey is into the sadomasochism thing, an interesting twist.  At the beginning the attraction to the material is curiosity, what its like.  Some things play right into my fantasies.  As pathetically broken up as she may be, when it is revealed to Christian that Ana began sobbing in her bed after he left, he rushed back, slept next to her, holding her tight.  So that's the thing that makes your heart swell a bit.  One hundred pages later, a similar situation arises where Christian spoons her from behind, comforting her, except this time comforting her because he had physically beat her just moments before.  He wants her to be the submissive, to an extreme I had never heard of.  The submission he requires is not limited to the sexual activity in \\"The Red Room of Pain,\\" but extends to eating and sleeping habits, daily attire, even the concept of not speaking her mind in public unless given permission by the dominant.  So it becomes disturbing.  Aside from the revolting requests of Mr. Grey, this is when the atrocious writing becomes more painfully obvious.  As enthralling as James's description of an orgasm was the first two times, once you realize that she is incapable of explaining any sort of sexual activity or emotion in more than about three different phrases, the entertainment fades.  And any exclamation from the oh-so-aroused Ms. Steele is so hilariously persistent, we get it, your conscience and your \\"inner goddess\\" seem to be very opinionated on the matter.  No matter how many times she exclaims \\"Oh my!\\" she will still sound like a horny Judy Garland in the Wizard of Oz. If she ever even attempts to write something that could pass off as contemporary literature in the future, pray to god that she takes some sort of writing class or at least spends a good amount of bonding time with a thesaurus.  So back to the sex.  First of all, how can they possibly be having that much sex?  I mean what, they had sex three times before ten am one morning? Damn.  And while I suppose I applaud dear Anastasia for her apparently natural born talent of deep-throating, once again, what the hell? Perhaps, deceptively, she is portrayed as a stronger woman for a portion of the book, continuing to challenge and stubbornly refuse some of the ridiculous requests that are asked of her.  Christian Grey says with an air of disappointment that \\"he is beginning to realize that there is not a submissive bone in her body.\\"  Lies.  She wants and needs him so badly that she concedes to his itch to control and abuse her just in fear of losing him.  That is submission on a much deeper level.  And it's disgusting.  The end of the book, yay, she leaves him, after she allows him to ruthlessly \\"punish her.\\"  Perhaps it would be the thought of some to think \\"Yay Ana, you stood up to him!\\" but I almost think its worse and disgusts me even more.  For starters, he let her go, despite his constant pleas that she is the most important thing in his life and he is thoroughly incapable of living without her.  She tells him that she can not give him what he \\"needs\\" and lets her go because he realizes he can't function without the absolute need for sadism and torture in a relationship.  Well that's just lovely.  And maybe she leaves, but obviously if there are two more books to follow, she comes back to him.  So what a fantastic example of an erotic love story.  For anyone who even has a shred of self respect, if they really pay attention to what they're reading they have to face the question of whether or not they would submit to that kind of abuse simply to keep something that they are afraid of losing.  This is beyond the play of S&M, and extends to such a deep level of control that in no way, shape, or form, can it be rationalized.  So what are we really worth?  Thanks EL James, you've set an outstanding example.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|No matter what side of the political aisle your are on you will enjoy this book. To hear how former presidents still stayed in the game was fascinating.

B008BM9L72|1.0|Absolutely the worst book (trilogy) I ever read...sophmoric and predictable.  I could not bear the butchering of the English language.  The massive popularity of this book speaks volumes about what the vast majority consider \\"a good book\\"...sad, yet true.
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel. It was nothing special, in my opinion, but decent. The plot development could have been much better. I liked the characters; however, Ana sometimes bothered me because she was so unrelatable. She was cowardly and weak in much of the book, and that annoyed me. I think this book was a good start, and the next two novels in the series are much better. I would recommend this book to someone who isn't a heavy reader and wants something light, dirty, and enjoyable to read.
0345803507|5.0|This book was the conclusion to the triology.  It answers a lot of questions to the previous books.  It was a a little slow in the middle but very exciting in the end!

B00846TTDG|5.0|I just watched this movie last night and I loved it.  There's a lot of criticism of the acting and a lot of talk that the guys were emotionless, but I don't think people realize how realistic this was.  I think the guys showed emotion the way they actually do, because it's them, being themselves.  I realize people have become used to these amazing dramatic renderings of emotion as portrayed by professional actors, and yes, those portrayals are more polished and less awkward to watch.<br /><br />However, having served many years myself and having worked, on occasion, with spec ops guys in both the Army and Navy, I can tell you that the way they are in real life is not perfect emotional rendering.  They actually have to shut it down, and that is pretty much what it looks like from the outside.  These guys are great at what they do, but what they do is not acting.  I've been around some pretty intense operational moments, farewells before deployment, etc., and it doesn't look like what you would expect it to.  There is a lot of awkwardness, a lot of stuffed emotions. And operators in the spec ops world ARE absolutely, ridiculously calm (some might say emotionless) in extremely intense situations. For real.  It's NOT Hollywood.  It's also not some fabulously beautiful man baring his soul and letting you see just how much he's going to miss you.  It's things only his wife would know that show how he feels, but it doesn't look like what you'd expect necessarily.<br /><br />The scenes when they are planning the ops seem a little stilted, but not as much as you would think.  Dialogue in these meetings doesn't go down like something from one of the Bourne movies.  People don't actually talk like that in real life.  I think this was so authentic and honest, and people are so conditioned to seeing the cinematic version of events, they don't stop to think:  have I ever had a conversation at work or with my significant other that sounded that perfectly timed, that cool, whatever?  Nope.  Not really.  Not only that, the action is all real, and a lot of the bullets are real, and for people who don't get how intense and incredible that is, there's nothing anyone could possibly say to you to give you the proper perspective.  You'd have to go to a live range and live it for yourself.  It's a great movie, precisely because it's so real. I have no idea what all the negativity is about.<br /><br />People need to get this:  the reason we haven't had another 9/11 since 2001 ISN'T because there haven't been any more attempts.  It's because our military has been on watch and prevented them.  Doing just exactly the kinds of things you see in the movie.  And how they come off as actors is irrelevant.  I saw a review online that said the acting was so bad, the SEALs deserved better, to show them as they really are.  I laughed.  These guys ARE showing you how they really are, it's just not as set perfect as everyone wants to believe.  They had daily input into the script, and wouldn't say a line if it wasn't something they'd actually say.  The review also had issues with the interrogator, which I thought was also funny, because the interrogator is the real deal, and that is what he does, and how he does it, for a living, every day.  How many people has the reviewer seen interrogated in real life, I wonder?<br /><br />I imagine everyone whose real story has been brought to film has felt inside like they really looked good with that actress or actor portraying them, because they know it wasn't that polished in real life.  This is the real deal.  All those who are anti-military and who love to hate what the military does are going to find fault with this movie because it is completely unapologetic and it doesn't try to be Hollywood.  It shows you just how much our guys have to do to neutralize threats.  These are also the people who want to believe that threats only exist if we provoke them, and they would be terrified if they knew just how many bad guys areplotting against us every day, and would happily dispense with any of us in reaching their goals, in the most horrifying and gruesome ways possible.  Anyone who is caught up in grading the quality of acting from an artistic and theatrical perspective will also be disappointed, but if you can let yourself in on the secret that this is very much how things go down in the real world, you might actually enjoy it.  The filmmaking is outstanding and the story is a fictional portrayal of a real-world situation that absolutely COULD happen.  This movie rocks, and I salute the film makers and especially men who made it, as well as all their brothers and sisters in arms.  I am proud to have served with you.
0765316994|3.0|As Star Trek fans know, the \\"redshirts\\" of the title refer to those doughty characters that my mother-in-law referred to as \\"Mr Expendable\\"---the bit players who die painfully while on excursions with the Starship Captain.  Scalzi has worked this idea into an entertaining premise, but by itself, the premise is not strong enough to sustain even a short novel.  The book is just not *consistently* sharp enough or funny enough to make a good satire or parody at this length.  It does have some funny moments, but only one or two.  I found it nowhere near as sharp or funny as Scalzi's *The Android's Dream*.<br /><br />The \\"three codas\\" mentioned in the subtitle represent an admirable attempt to bring more depth to this parody, but they come too little, too late to rescue an otherwise relatively boring book.  Without giving too much of a spoiler, the codas \\"break the fourth wall.\\"  This is the sort of thing that Jasper Fforde does superbly well.  Scalzi is just competent.<br /><br />I can recommend this book to you only if (a) you are enough of a fan of Star Trek that you find the very idea of expendable \\"redshirts\\" inherently funny, or (b) you love work that breaks the fourth wall.  The book *is* competent, and fans of either genre will have something to enjoy, but it is not good enough to recommend to general readers.

B004LWZW6U|3.0|I just watched it on Blu-ray, in 2d, rented for $1.60 from redbox, much better than the $6.00 or $7.00 online streaming costs...  Fun movie, lots of skin, defintely not enough gore, althou the last scene with the kid is fantastic, and the scene with the guy and girl and he gets a piranha surprise is to rediculous to be anything but fantastically funny, I wish it been in theatre's. Will I buy it next month on Blu Ray, maybe if it has a lower price than whats on here now, becuase its such a short movie, plus the blu has no extras, not even a trailer. And if I can get Blu Ray with out paying for a 3d version. I have whats called lazy eye, so 3d does not work for me at all. It got 3 stars because you can't do a two and a half stars.

B001FW58D6|4.0|This is a good show with good story lines.  In the pilot episode, however, during the high action scenes, it looked like they were shot using a hand held.  It was a little dizzying to watch.  And Joshua Jackson is basically Pacey in a different job than he had on Dawson's.  I like Joshua Jackson, don't get me wrong. It's just an observation.  I struggled between giving this show 3 or 4 stars, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because it looks like it has good potential. I will keep watching, because the story and ideas are intriguing at least.<br /><br />I will say this, that you will be hooked long before episode 10, as someone suggested.  I was hooked by the 2nd episode and have loved the show ever since, except for the boring season 3.  I'm glad the first 2 seasons were good, otherwise I wouldn't have kept watching. And, thankfully, season 4 and 5 are MUCH better than 3, if you can slough through 3 then it's worth it.  I will be sad to see this show end.

1439192812|4.0|I think this book is miss-marketed for the 9-12 crowd.<br /><br />It is jammed with information, and wonderful illustrations, but it is very verbose. Each chapter starts with a question, which is nice, but each answer (i.e. chapter) is an average of 20 pages long. So, very informative, but too long. I don't know anyone under high school age that could stay focused long enough to read the whole thing unless they were really interested in the subject.

In the case of Floyd, it's this embarrassingly awful funeral home that was used to promote their late 1980s tour. Hardly delicate, listening to this album is like being stuck on an elevator hearing dinosaurs fart.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this album is that it is just simply BORING: dull, lifeless, uninspired and pedestrian to the bone. This is quite a shocker when you consider that Pink Floyd were one of the best live rock bands in the 1970s. There is nothing transcendent about this record; not even attempts by the band to innovate their classics on stage. Then again, that's probably a good thing because when they DO try, the results are embarrassing. Take note the hideous saxophone solo on \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" (Dick Parry, we miss you) and the agonizingly slow rendition of \\"Comfortably Numb\\", where Roger Waters' vocal parts were replaced by a bunch of average vocal harmonies that would make George Martin vomit. The worst offenders, by far, are \\"Money\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\": the former is extended into an insufferable jam featuring horrible bass playing by newbie Guy Pratt and the latter substitutes the original's eerie menace for macho chest-beating that is exhausting rather than exhaustive. Roger, where are you when we need you?<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the most listenable songs on this album are the ones from A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) but that's not saying much because most of the songs from the record were horrible in the first place. The only songs from this album that actually improved from their studio counterparts are \\"Learning to Fly\\", which removes that awful synthesizer riff from the original; and \\"Sorrow\\", which boasts even more impressive guitar playing than before. But whatever positives this album has (which is very few) are shattered by the negatives (which are plenty).<br /><br />Anyone who considers Delicate Sound of Thunder as the comprehensive overview of Pink Floyd concerts are clearly misguided; as stated before, in the 1970s, Pink Floyd were a force on stage and their best concerts rivaled that of Led Zeppelin. It's not just because they had Waters; when they were together, Floyd produced dazzling and unforgettable music. In fact, there are many bootleg albums out there to confirm this (most notably Animal Instincts). But Delicate is not one of those albums. Far from comprehensive, Delicate confirms the inaccurate belief that Pink Floyd were a boring dinosaur act whose reasons for touring were for financial rather than artistic reasons.<br /><br />Delicate Sound of Thunder is not the best place to start if you want to get into Floyd concerts, that's for damn sure. Check out Animal Instincts or even their Live 8 reunion and the difference in quality between those shows and Delicate are absolutely staggering. Avoid this Sound of Blunder at all costs.<br /><br />Strong recommendation to avoid.of Thunder as the comprehensive overview of Pink Floyd concerts are clearly misguided; as stated before, in the 1970s, Pink Floyd were a force on stage and their best concerts rivaled that of Led Zeppelin.

159413586X|5.0|Mockingjay is an excellent book that wraps up the Hunger Games trilogy quite well.  There are some dry parts of the book not seen in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and it didn't have the \\"perfect ending\\" that I was imagining.  However, it was a great book.  The Hunger Games trilogy are three of the best books I have read in a while.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I got this album for the wife as she is a huge Keane fan.  This is another great album.  My wife loves it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun, challenging app! A little easy in the first levels but gets better as you go along. For a free app, I highly recommend it!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|In the past others have suggested that I keep a gratitude journal, and sadly, every day I would struggle to think of 10 things for which to be grateful.  The Magic taught me different ways to express gratitude.  It expanded the areas in my life where I could find things for which to be grateful.  As I completed the month long gratitude program, I actually felt better.  Life seemed... brighter?  I can't say that all my wishes suddenly came true; a few small things did happen that made me go \\"hmmm.\\"  More importantly the book reminded me how fortunate I am.  Gratitude is a state of mind, and this book shows you how to get there. This does reference law of attraction ideas, but honestly, if law of attraction is not your thing, you can still use this book to expand your thinking about gratitude.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Just wanted to say this was a pretty informative book. Sounds like Mike knows what he's talking about. I've been following his advice for about a week now, (starting off with cutting). The first few days I was REALLY HUNGRY but, I'm used to it now and I'm starting to look at food differently. I also like that I'm in and out of the gym in about an hour (no more two hours or more). I know he says give it a year but, I'm going with 3 month intervals to see how I feel and if I see any changes in my body. I also think it's pretty cool that Mike makes himself available through E-mail to help you along the way (definitely going to take advantage of that). In a nutshell I highly recommend this book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The sounds on this app help me to wind down anytime I need to. It works great at bedtime also. The kids enjoy the songs and sounds. Very relaxing. Would highly recommend this app to anyone needing a quick relaxing go to app. We got this app when it was offered for free and love it! Nice for background noise when reading and doing homework.
B001DWNUCO|4.0|THORUGHOUT THE YEARS I HAVE ALWAYS PASSED ON PURCHASING THIS FILM, MAINLY FOR ITS BAD PRINT AND BAD DVD QUALITY: NON-ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN, BAD SOUND... I WAITED AWHILE TO EVEN BUY IT ON BLU-RAY, GLAD I WAITED!<br />  MALCOLM MCDOWELL'S BLUE EYES LEAP OFF THE SCREEN WHILE HE PLOTS HIS NEXT MOVE ON THE SENATE. HELEN MIRREN LOOKS AMAZING AS ALWAYS, PETER O'TOOLE'S STARE IS ALWAYS HAUNTING THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS! I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO REAL VIDEO DNR INVOLVED, THAT WOULD'VE MADE EVERYBODY LOOK LIKE CLAY! THE ALTERNATE VERSION SEEMS MORE TAME, YET SEEMS MORE COHESIVE ON VIEWING THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY, IT TAKES QUITE A FEW VIEWINGS TO FIND ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS THAT ROAM IN THE BACKGROUND AND SO FORTH.  WHAT I GET FROM THIS FILM IS A GUILTY PLEASURE OF WATCHING BRILLIANT ACTORS TRYING TO BRING A SORT OF DIGNITY TO A SINKING SHIP OF A FILM!  ALL THE STORIES OF INNERFIGHTING BEHIND THE SCENES ONLY ENHANCES THE EXPERIENCE. NO ONE IS QUITE SURE OF WHEN THE REAL VERSION THE DIRECTOR HAD IN MIND WILL EVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY, BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO DO! TAKE A CHANCE ON SOME FIRST RATE DECADENCE, IF YOU DARE!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great tool to have. It is easy to use and you are able to see the numbers clearly..AND IT IS FREE.
B00004YTIQ|1.0|I used this once. It blew off the pool with a mild wind. I ended up throwing it in the garbage. It is cheap and does not fit, even though it was the appropriate size for my pool.
B002RSOTSM|5.0|This is my favorite movie. I was delighted to be able to download it to my Kindle Fire.  The quality is excellent.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book started out fine and at least kept you reading. Then it seemed like the author just copped out. To say it was disappointing is an understatement. Waste of time and $.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Why do most popular android games update permissions like this? A simple game where you fling birds at poorly constructed buildings made by pigs. And the developer wants to know where you are when you're playing. This is getting ridiculous.
B00092ZL80|5.0|It is certainly worth the price brand new.  To finally put the voice of Robert Lamm in Beginnings to his real life handsome face was a revelation to this middle aged woman.  How he has stayed out of the spotlight to protect his private life over forty years is amazing.  That talented band still loves making music together.  I'm sure they are all wealthy beyond anyone's wildest dreams but they are not arrogant about it.  This dvd is just plain enjoyable.  I do not like every song for either band so just skip to my favorites.  Donnabellasdigest.com
B001F3FZVK|5.0|Cher has such an awesome voice it's hard not to like anything she sings. The songs are good and upbeat and always full of passion.
B0034G4OQS|4.0|I'm a sucker for Christmas movies that capture love, giving, redemption, and family. This one tweaked every sentimental nerve I had. It's a story that captures the intergenerational conflict of passing on the baton, the influences of modernity on traditional things like Christmas, and missing what's in front of your face because it doesn't look like you think it should. Add a pinch of Christmas magic and you have Arthur Christmas. It's great fun for kids and adults. James McAvoy does a great job!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one has a lot less violence in it preferred it a great deal more than book one. Love that it has lots of sex in it. The books have put a spark back into our married sex life.
B0084RSYEK|3.0|This will be the last movie that we will rent from Amazon.  It is not because of the movie itself (it had great potential but a little crass at times), but because we are Christian and believe in what God and his book (the Bible) says:  marriage is between one man and one woman.  This was brought about because we recently read where, I believe his name is Mr. Boce (Amazon CEO), came out in support of gay marriage and backed it up by contributing several hundred million dollars to this cause.  Since we cannot and will not support this behavior, and since Mr. Boce gets his funds to do this from us, we are exercising our freedom of speech and our religious beliefs to no longer support Amazon.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I enjoy this game. Just don't forget that it's free, and well worth the money. Want a better game? Then pay for it!!
B008ODZNLG|5.0|I think this movie is amazing! Anyone that eats sushi can appreciate this movie. The classical music used throughout the film really sets the mood of the film. I want to go to Jiro's restaurant in Japan now!

B006RUJST6|5.0|There aren't words to say about this book except...I LOVE IT! I laughed, I cried, I hurt for them, and I loved with them.  This was an excellent read, and I can't wait to read more.
030758836X|5.0|This book was pretty fantastic! I've read Gillian Flynn's other two novels, and I've enjoyed them. Although I don't know if \\"enjoyed\\" is really the right word. They are very dark, twisted and creepy. \\"Gone Girl\\" is no exception, but I did find it less dark than her first two, which isn't a bad thing. This book appeals more to the mainstream, but it's still pretty dark, and well-written, and okay I will use the word enjoyable. I kept turning to my partner to say, I have to tell you what just happened...<br /><br />The story is told from two different points of view. Flynn does a wonderful job of giving unique voices to these characters. There is a big twist near the middle of the novel. It wasn't totally surprising, but it does change the pace of the story, and things pick up after that.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. I still have to give it some thought to see how I feel about. Totally worth checking out, if you like mystery, suspense, and dark, twisted novels.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|He loves it so much that we bought 3, one to use at each grandparent's house. I like that it has a feature to lock it in place, also there are 2 volume control settings (or u can turn it off) which is good becomes sometimes the noise can become annoying. He gets so excited every time he touches it because it activates it to light up and make noise. Now that he is almost 12 months old I keep it unlocked so that it moves around more and encourages him to crawl towards it. Sometimes I catch him playing with his reflection in the mirror...Glad we bought this toy, it provides hours of entertainment:-)
B006CQLGXG|5.0|If you have not read this book to your children or have not read it yourself....you are missing out on the understated meanings behind this wonderful classic.  A must for any library!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Doesn't get much better than this. Great clarity, and I just wanted one of Adele's CDs. I picked this one with great results. Amazon did a great job packaging, delivering safely and fast.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|It was so poorly written that I struggled to connect with any of the characters.  Normally I would automatically buy any following books in a series but I won't be with this book.
B002RV01QI|5.0|It's a great CD to give to someone introducing them to what is termed New Age music. It's beautiful music to listen to while studying. It's ever-so calming. When studying, I usually listen to operetta, but some of it is distracting. This is just beautiful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is great and free. it is worth the download. it exercises your brain starts out easy but becomes harder
034580404X|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy Boxed set was truly appreciated by a prison inmate I sent it to. Once she's done reading it she can barter it to another inmate for basic toiletries or coffee. Charitable thing I did. You know, all they do is read. Said she was mesmerized by it. Killed a lot of time. She always looked forward to picking up one of the books in the set. Delivery to the prison by Amazon was top-notch and fast. Great company I've always used for myself or others.
043599445X|5.0|Two thumbs up --- this book breaks down the essentials better than any other. Even cellular respiration and myoglobin vs hemoglobin is easy to understand. Bought my own copy after getting the IB diploma because I felt it was so helpful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great series.  Just when you think you know what's going to happen it goes another way.  Very enjoyable despite being so heavy.  Great writing and thought provoking.  Highly recommended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its really helpful to see how much power your kindle has and helps to manage your battery. overall five out of five
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Through all 3 books I was pulling for the series to end a certain way.  It didn't end that way but rather than being disappointed I was overwhelmed and just speechless.  What a GREAT series!  Can't wait to see the movies!
B0085WA9OM|5.0|Paul Simon at his best!  Rock,  African, Cajun, social lyrics - what more can you ask of a modern artist?
0143119680|4.0|This book is well written until it bogs down about 2/3rds of the way through with an unusual love scene, between a witch and a vampire, that goes on too long. Then to spice up the plot the main character is snatched straight up in the air from her lover's garden by another witch-friend or foe?<br />I'm not done with the book, but if the dull scenes outnumber the exciting ones, I won't be buying the next books in the trilogy although I had looked forward to them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Although the first half of the book was stronger than the second half, I found this book to be well-written and well-plotted. It was the kind of story that, as new information was revealed, I wanted to go back and revisit earlier chapters to appreciate where the seeds had been quietly sown. I did find myself a couple of steps ahead of the central character in understanding what was going on and in solving the treasure-hunt clues and in figuring out exactly what had happened. But, this didn't interfere with my enjoyment of this engrossing thriller. It sent me off to find Flynn's previous novels.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app and use it almost everyday but it force closes every five minutes. Maybe its only on my kindle fire but its pretty annoying. anyway its still fun:)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My sister called me last week and as we both have sons studying film she was incredibly excited to tell me about this book, she thought it would make a great movie and wanted my son Josh to start a screenplay.  I went to google and immediately found out that Ridley Scott was securing the movie rights so figured she was probably right.  I immediately went to Amazon and purchased the Kindle Edition at an amazing price.  I spent the next few days reading most of it off my iPhone anyplace that i could.  I just finished it and must say that it was a great read.  I just purchased the next book in the series and can't wait to get to it.  the characters are well defined and as i read i felt like i was in that silo.  It takes great talent to take people places and I know that i will follow this author faithfully!!  If you have not read this yet, go buy it now!!  you won't regret it!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book elicits every emotion from happiness to sadness! It made me laugh, it made me cry and it left me awestruck by the end! Such an awesome book that not only has a good storyline but also teaches you life lessons along the way. There's romance, death, and everything else that when combined together keeps you captivated until the very end. I definitely recommend reading the second book, Point of Retreat, as well. Although, you may think after finishing the first that the story is great the way it is left, the second is just as good of a read. It gives a different perspective and continues the storyline right where the other book left off. I recommend taking your time to read this book so that you can truly enjoy it. I read it in practically one sitting and wish I didn't. Either way though, it left me wanting more and continuously thinking about it. I would recommend this book to anyone!!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I thought this would have been a good deal. $10 cheaper through amazon than instore.  Did not work quite as well as I hoped. The joysticks would stick, causing problems while playing. I would not buy this item online again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is a good game for time passing I had a couple of other games but since I downloaded this game I don't play them!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed it. Nice change from the norm. Yes, a lot of sex but not like the typical love story, sex books where the sex scenes are all the same. Bravo on giving Anastasia such a great personality. If you have an open mind, you will enjoy. Great page turner!
1594744769|3.0|This book has a great premise, and the promise of some very creepy and horrifying moments. To my surprise, it turned out to be less \\"The Woman in Black\\" and more Harry Potter. The mood shifts 180 degrees at a certain point, ditching the creepy factor and becoming more of a standard teen fantasy. Normally that's just fine, but the pictures are so eerie they really don't fit the ultimate mood of the novel. If it had been scarier, as the photos suggest, this would have merited a higher review.<br /><br />That being said, it's still a lot of fun. Give it a read, and ask yourself: who the heck takes pictures like these??
B008MEM24S|4.0|This game is somewhat similar to  &quot;Where's My Water?&quot; but in someways it's different. I like how they have the characters from Disney's Phineas &amp; Ferb interacting throughout the game. I  like how you get to learn about Dr. Doofensmirtz's inventions also.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app and it's what I truly needed it. Thanks for adding this app. Thanks a lot.
B0001Z53MY|5.0|This is a whole new experience hearing YBR in surround. I have a large collection of surround music and this is one of the best recordings. If you like old Elton John, you'll love this. PS: I think his newer stuff blows
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really love this game! Its kind of addictive,  super fun and easy for the whole family to play. I recommend it to fans of problem solving games.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great. I like the mechanics of the game. Wish we could sell old gear that would be awesome. I do recommend this game.
B0028RXXE8|3.0|To me this movie was to pornish, like any good story line and some of the scene's were quiet nasty.  No family honor at all and their was way to much blood......
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I think this book is highly overrated.  The only thing it had going for it was descriptive scenes.  Other than that I didn't think it was all that well written. I actually had a hard time finishing it.  The story line was pretty boring and without the x rated descriptions it was just another cheesy romance novel.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|This was a fab book, I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as me
B0086700CM|5.0|addictive.  I am too old to be playing this.  must hide in the bathroom so the wife wont beat me.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|This is a great book and it finished the series of well. I hope she writes more as interesting. enjoy reading it
0316017930|5.0|After reading this book, I've got a completely different outlook on life and on success in general.  I cannot believe what he wrote about how and why so many people are successful and why they are not.<br /><br />I am astounded about the correlation between peoples success and their birthdays.  About the number of hours they practice and their success.<br /><br />They seem so simple in hindsight, I just cannot believe that it took me this long (10 years into my teaching career) to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher, business owner, or in any sort of leadership role
0345803485|1.0|After hearing ever other desperate house wive I know rave about this \\"Mommy Porn\\", I just had to try it. First off, I could not for the life of me get into this book...the writing was that bad. I found myself skipping ahead to try to find something worth reading....only to be horribly disappointed. So many have said it read like it was written by a teenager, and I for one, would have to agree.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a great app! It works perfectly on my Kindle Fire, and now I have an update with even more levels. The beginning ones are easy, to be sure, but the harder ones are food for the brain (and I'm not spatially challenged as some people are). Thanks, developer. More please.
B0064W63XG|3.0|I give the story & art for \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Vol. 1\\" 5 stars. I love Alan Moore's work, and have since Swamp Thing. I, unfortunately, bought this for my Kindle Fire and the images are just too damn small, even in the 'magnified' mode, for my aging eyes. Really kills the enjoyment. Buy a hard copy or read it on something bigger than a Fire.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|FORMATION OF DAMNATION is one of the BEST TESTAMENT albuns!!!!!TESTAMENT got a lot of great METAL albuns like NEW ORDER, PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH and LOW, and this one is among their best moments!!!!!!Songs like HENCHMEN RIDE, AFTERLIFE, MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE, THE PERSECUTED WON[T FORGET, F.E.A.R and LEAVE ME FOREVER are just amazing modern THRASH tunes!!!!!if you like past TESTAMENT records i think this is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! TESTAMENT is a great HEAVY act, with a total solid career....BRAVO!!!!

CREEDENCE is such a brilliant band...people talk about Beatles, DOORS, Rolling stones, but CREEDENCE is the BAND!!!! WILLY is a collection of rock pearls like DOWN ON THE CORNER, FORTUNATE SON, IT CAME OUT OF THE SKY, DON´T LOOK NOW, FEELIN BLUE and THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL!!! man, this is really ROCK!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like old rock a la ELVIS!!!! REALLY GREAT!!! BRAVO!!!!
B006WAIUEK|1.0|Irvine Welsh's characterisation through written \\"accents\\" makes it very difficult to get into. I didn't enjoy it as much as trainspotting. Not my best purchase
B000006045|5.0|MEZZANINE is another masterpiece from MASSIVE ATTACK!!!! This is just the perfect music to relax and reflect about life...Its either great in a party!!!! It´s amazing!!! The mix of REGGAE, HIP HOP, eletronic and ROCK are worderful on MEZZANINE!!! A MUSIC MASTERPIECE!!!! Try BLUE LINES and PROTECTION too....WELL DONE, MASSIVE ATTACK!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was fast reading. There's a lot of erotic sex, but the storyline is good. You must read all three volumns to understand Christian Grey behavior. In this story the writer shows how strong love can be, and how it can change a person for the better.
B001AKTZOG|5.0|PENDULUM is the last album by the classic formation of CREEDENCE...it´s another rock masterpiece!!! All CREEDENCE albuns are similar, but they are filled with amazing ROCK pearls!!!! PAGAN BABY, SAILOR´S LAMENT, CHAMELEON and BORN TO MOVE are CCR classics!!! Wow, and it´s beautiful to see a great band ending at the TOP!!! i totally recommend the first 6 masterpieces by CREEDENCE, and even the criticized MARDI GRAS is good!!!! WELL DONE, CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Um...WOW!  I feel like  a tornado just blew through my mind!  This book was insanely addicting, the only thing keeping me from finishing the book in the first sitting was life (pfft who needs life anyways, right?).  I could feel the chemistry almost immediately between Abby and Travis and it kept building and building until both of the characters explode into some kind of frantic  and chaotic romance.  It was scintillating and disturbing all wrapped into one.<br /><br />Travis does have a total lack of self control, which in some parts of the books make you want to grab a sedative and inject it into his arm, because he can clearly be destructive to himself and those around him.  While it makes for a interesting read, I'd never want to meet him in person.  The books starts to slack off when Abby's past starts creeping up on her with her low life father and a one night trip to Las Vegas that ends on a crazy note.<br /><br />I would give it five stars but after rehashing some of the violence in the book and the strange ending, I have to take it down a notch.  Worth a read, but not everyone will love it!
B000UGG39Q|5.0|OVER THE UNDER is another masterpiece by DOWN...This band is just AMAZING!!!! I love NOLA and BUSTLE IN YOUR HEDGEROW, and this one OVER THE UNDER is on the same UNBELIEVABLE high level!!!! REALLY!!!! Phil Anselmo delivers great vocals, and his lyrics are brilliant...DOWN as a band is ANTHOLOGIC!!!! If you like BLACK SABBATH and PANTERA, you just got to listen to DOWN!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! ONE OF THE BEST ALBUNS EVER!!!!!! WELL DONE, DOWN!!!!!!!!!
B0050LJIRK|3.0|This album is nothing new on the ears.  If it was 2001 again, this CD would probably have creamed the charts.  It should be named \\"Hot Dog Flavored Water and the STarfish Dildo, Part 2\\"...cause it has the same identical guitar riffs, choruses and drum beats as that album.  It's like the band was frozen in ice for 10yrs....were chiselded out & told to make a new CD and \\"Gold Cobra\\" was the output.<br /><br />I mean, the songs in themselves aren't bad..they are just a generation behind. I dunno...I can honestly say having listened to the whole CD while enganging in a poker game, I can't think of any tracks where I thought 'damn, this song is cool'.....all songs seem like they've been played in other Limp Bizkit albums before. It's good background music, but nothing I would jam in my car today.  If you're a die hard Limp Bizkit fan (but who can freely admit that in today's standards), then I would DEFINITELY recommend this album.  Other than that...I'd rip it off the Internet for free. I bought my copy in a \\"bargain\\" bin on Black Friday at a local Best Buy for $3.
B0000634EV|5.0|After NOLA, DOWN recorded this great METAL album A BUSTLE IN YOUR HEDGEROW!!!! It's different from the brutal METAL assault of NOLA...It´s more in a HEAVY ROCK atmosphere, with some nice acoustic songs like LEARN FROM THIS MISTAKE, WHERE I´M GOING and LIES I DON`T KNOW WHAT THEY SAY BUT....Also some amazing HEAVY tunes like THERE´S SOMETHING ON MY SIDE, THE MAN THAT FOLLOWS HELL and GHOSTS ALONG THE MISSISSIPI!!!!! DOWN II is AMAZING like NOLA!!!! and it´s way different from PANTERA...it´s really a new band...and a GREAT BAND!!!!REALLY AMAZING!!!!! WELL DONE, DOWN!!!!! BRAVO!!!!

B000002J0G|5.0|LOW is another great album by the THRASH METAL legend TESTAMENT!!! and is one of their best releases... The title track, HAIL MARY, SHADES OF WAR, TRAIL OF TEARS, DOG FACED DOGS and ALL I COULD BLEED are METAL gens!!!! on LOW, TESTAMENT slow down their fast THRASH to a more PANTERA METAL, with some ROARS and screams from the great CHUCK BILLY!!!! i TOTALLY RECOMMEND LOW if you like HEAVY METAL!!!! A MASTERPIECE!!!! WELL DONE, TESTAMENT!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was captivating the whole way through! Definitely gained a great deal of insight into the mysterious life of Christian Grey!
0062183591|5.0|Social Scientist Dan Ariely's new book begins (on the dust jacket) and ends (on the last page of the bibliography) with an illustration of a magic mirror. It depicts a man with a Pinnocio nose peering into a glass which reflects a normal nose, that of  a person who has not told a lie after all. The transformation, which Ariely calls \\"the fudge factor\\", is the effort we make  \\"to maintain a positive self-image and to benefit from cheating\\". Easier said than done is the conclusion  you'll reach  from reading  this engaging and informative book.<br /><br /> It describes a series of carefully  designed experiments which  Ariely and his  colleagues carried out to  determine what encourages us to cheat and  what we and the people we deal with can do to discourage dishonesty. What is most effective in this regard?  Explicit reminders at the outset of the endeavor that honesty is expected of us when we fill out insurance forms, give expert testimony, describe damage,  take tests,  write term papers, etc.<br /><br /> To set the table, Ariely recounts  the Kennedy Center experience with the 300  \\"elderly, well-meaning, art-loving volunteers\\" who ran the Center's souvenir shops.  They were \\"run like lemonade stands\\" with cash boxes instead of cash registers and without  receipts. You guessed it. From annual sales of more than $400,000 worth of goods, the shops banked only $250,000. The thefts stopped cold once the manager instituted a system of inventory control, sales records and receipts.<br /><br /> Ariely's studies deal with the ways we cheat ourselves, using the way we play and score golf as an example. He also deals with  conflicts of interest; demonstrates that we make better (more honest) decisions early in the day when we're fresh;  with the adverse effect on our self-image from  buying and wearing fake designer goods; the way the dishonesty germ spreads from one bad apple to the barrel full; and the fact that working collaboratively may increase, not decrease, the likelihood of dishonesty.<br /><br /> Social science studies like those described in \\"The (Honest) Truth\\" are necessarily arbitrary and so raise niggling questions about the  methodology used,  the selection of participants, and the degree of peer review involved. These doubts may leave you wondering how accurately real world conditions are replicated in such studies. My conclusion. Ariely's experiments came up with useful insights even if the experiments could not fully match the circumstances that pose the opportunities for dishonesty we face in our daily lives.<br /><br /> End Note. \\"Lying  -- Moral Choice in Public and Private Life\\" (1999 Edition), Sissela Bok's definitive treatment of lying, will be subject of my next review.  Chapter XIII, \\"Deceptive Social Science Research,\\" provides an extensive discussion of the problems inherent in much such research.  The one set of  Ariely's experiments that might trigger Bok's concerns involve those in which the participants' honesty (dishonesty) was tested wearing genuine designer eye glasses which they were told were fakes. In for a dime, in for a dollar, those participants cheated more than the others. Such practices, Bok argues, may have a lasting adverse effect on the participants.
B001OBT3FC|2.0|Oh, what has become of the Berliner Philharmoniker? After the Emperor's death, the orchestra has just gone downhill (granted, the entire classical orchestra scene worldwide is showing the same pathetic decline). The inclusion of Tchaskovsky's \\"Pathetique\\" symphone is quite an irony on this program. It's played with such lethargy and anti-enthusiasm that I could hardly bear to watch or hear it. Ozawa, who was good a couple of decades ago, has definitely lost whatever edge he had held before. Mutter as the soloist just trashed Beethoven's supreme concerto; the sound was harsh and stiff, and there were tons of bowing errors. Compare this performance with hers under Karajan 30 years ago, it was night and day, this one night, that one day. (She's an over-rated violinist to begin with; so many of her countrymen, and countryladies, play the Beethoven concerto so much better.)<br /><br />Personally, I think to hear the Pathetique symphone done right, you have to listen to Russian recordings. Karajan's classic recording is good, but still not great, and the one on this program just sucks.<br /><br />The Blu-ray video here is clear and crisp with good color tones, but the camerawork itself is just average for concert videos; for example, why the h*ck did the director not start the video fo the Beethoven with the timpani beating the first motif of the 5 bass-D notes (so absolutely simple yet so absolutely haunting)? Mutter's entrance is given in a wide-angle shot; maybe the director thought the audience wouldn't want to took at her! The sound is done well, with rich tonality and very good balance. Too bad the concert itself is such a letdown.
0785152458|3.0|Good, but less so than the original Kick-Ass.  John Romita Jr.'s artwork is again top-notch, but Millar doesn't break any new ground here in his writing.  It's simply a this-happens-next story.<br /><br />There is always one scene in any Millar story that bothers me - one event where Millar pushes the envelope just a little too far.  It's as if with each book, he's saying, \\"See how far I'll go?  No one else would go this far!\\"  But at a certain point it comes off as a little juvenile, and the event in question takes you out of the story - it breaks the flow of the narrative.  Violence towards small children is a touchy subject with me, as is rape, and I cringed more than once while reading this.<br /><br />Hit Girl steals the show, again.  She is much more interesting than the character of Kick-Ass, the namesake of this book, and again, that pulls you out of the story, questioning why.  Kick-Ass 2 also has the feel of the middle part of a trilogy - the feeling that this is all mostly set-up for a bigger finale.<br /><br />I look forward to the Hit Girl graphic novel and Kick-Ass 3 (I assume is coming), but I probably won't read Part 2 again.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|I had never ordered anything on line, the steps were easy to follow and the product came within a couple of days. I would tell anyone to use this website as it is safe and secure, quick and easy !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finally decided to read the book after being recommended by several friends, multiply times. To be completely honest, I didn't think I would like this type of reading. Well before long I found myself reading late into the night because I simply could not put the book down.  I am entirely intrigued by every twist and turn of this book series. It is one of the best books I have read.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|We enjoyed this movie when it first came out and wanted to see it again. It is sad to say this movie is where we are headed as a nation if we do not change our ways.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I usually end up deleting these kinds of apps because they are so cheesy and sound so bad.  But this one is the exception!  Get it now before they get smart enough to charge for it.  Really, it is great!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it was great. I have so many different options for sounds. I have a hard time falling asleep but this sure helped.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app, should def come loaded on the kindle...since it's free, seems easy enough, great graphics and easy format as well
B0054JZC6E|4.0|we have only used this app for a short period of time and already like the varsity and challenge.  would like to see a little more refined touch response control.
0385360169|3.0|It is like reading a x rated Mills and Boone book, and if she talks about her goddess or  her hair one more time....... I think it has been marketed extremely well.
B008578H9G|5.0|Once an ardent fan I had not viewed the program for a couple of years, but when it came down to the last couple of episodes I realized I needed to see how it would end.  I was not disappointed.  It may be one of the best series wrap-ups ever!  I won't spoil it for you - see it.
B004SBULWE|1.0|I just recently purchased my kindle fire. it has always run smoothly and everything loaded pretty much instantly. I figured, ya know, if this app works great on my phone. then it should work great on my kindle! but that was not the case at all. with this app installed it made my device extremely slow, laggy, and just made it a piece of s***. do NOT get this application it makes your nice $200 kindle seem like a $4.00 piece of junk
B005O71C8I|1.0|I was not trying to buy this because I already bought the entire season.  I just could not get it to play so I think I ended up paying again.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|What makes them different is that you are looking for pieces to use unlock things.  not find find a bunch of hidden objects.  This game is like Myst.,  which I could not stop playing until it was finished.  Please make more.!!!
031603441X|5.0|I usually don't read biographies or non-fiction. I prefer to live and die for people that don't exist. But a Keith Richards biography is too good to resist.<br /><br />Keith is considered to be THE rock and roll superhero. I really cannot think of anyone more invincible than him. A good chunk of the book is basically about how he survived those numerous situations that would destroy any mortal like us. Keith is an interesting fellow. The story goes on like that: In the odd pages Keith is a sweet, tolerant, family man, full of life and in the even pages he is destroying himself like a maniac. His crazy wife was not that behind (or ahead, depending of your point of view).<br /><br />He always had the last laugh. Just like Bugs Bunny with a halo over his head. Maybe instead of a superhero, he is a Looney Tunes character. When a TNT explodes in Daffy Duck's hands, he may be unrecognizable but he is still there. One second later on the next scene, Daffy is 100% fit and ready for the next dynamite to shred his body into pieces.<br /><br />We want Keith to succeed. It would have been a waste and a tremendous injustice for a such a nice guy to die. The more he writes about himself, the more we want him to survive and be happy (just like the song).<br /><br />There are some inconsistencies and disappointments. I expected more of his side of the story about Mick Taylor departure from the band. He could have addressed the versions that have been flying around since then. I also didn't understand why he named his son Marlon after the actor, when their meeting in Rome could not have been more awkward. As for Marlon - the son - he actually became a very interesting character. He didn't write much about Angela and his relationship with his mom after he left home in the early 60s.<br /><br />The book has four acts: Childhood and the early Stones; the arrival of Andrew Oldham until the 69 tour; the golden and troubled years from Exile until the Toronto trial and the preparations ofthe 81 tour until now (with emphasis on his solo projects).<br /><br />Many of the episodes narrated in this book are known by most Rolling Stones fans. I wonder if anyone that doesn't know anything about the Stones would enjoy this book. I think it is possible. \\"Life\\" is quite entertaining and an easy read. I liked it a lot.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Too be honest about this review, I already have this same CPU Cooler Master in my Custom build.  I bought it off of a friend but there was a missing riser threaded sleeve and so I needed this one part to attach the fastening screw from the top.  I know it's sounds crazy to order a whole entire new fan for one piece of hardware, but at least now I have an extra fan in case my used one fails!  So far my 8 core Bulldozer AMD CPU hasn't gone over 27 degrees Celsius.  It works great!
0071762345|5.0|I ordered a digital version of this book on Amazon a few months ago and after attending a free webinar from Dave, I recently won the paper-back version. Both versions are invaluable to my business and are vital reference tools for me. You'll not find anyone more enthused about helping you learn everything you can about social media than Dave Kerpen. The guy is uber-social-media-savvy, a great writer, very personable and as I just found out, very accesible as well. (what best-selling author do you know that lists their personal cel number in their email signature...???) Facebook is extremely lucky to have him and this book out in the great wide world... and so are we!! Buy the book and you'll see why.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think this is a great game but u need to play it constantly. for it to get addicting but overall good game

B003EV6DBW|4.0|My mother and I are major whovians. LOVE the show! Love Eccelson, Tennant and Smith equally but for different reasons. IT IS MAGIC!! So when I ordered the sixth series for my mom on Bluray, she loved it so much I also ordered the fifth series for her...But the discs don't play! She has all of the newest updates and firmware, and a very nice player (samsung model bd6500). We returned the set, and had to buy a new one (this time order fullfilled by amazon). One week later, same problem! The discs are supposed to play in the USA right?? It says region 1, her player doesn't seem to be the issue because the sixth series plays PERFECTLY! Anyone else have this problem? I guess we're returning it again, much to our dismay...

B002XTXG1G|5.0|This is one of the most interesting, fun, disturbing and stylized movies I have see in years. I stumbled on to the trailer and was sold. I bought the DVD and have enjoyed it several times. Many of my friends have borrowed it and gave \\"Bronson\\" rave reviews. I highly recommend this film. See the trailer then buy the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the hes game ever I love this game so much ya ya ya ya ya ya ya y ah ayatollah. lol
B006LSZECO|1.0|What a disappointment ! Its a never ending and many times boring plot with the most pathetic and disappointing ending I have ever seen.  It's as if there is no  ending.  I don't know how this book ever got published.  It took me forever to read it because it was so boring.  It was a complete waste of my time and money.  I want my money back!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|\\"Holy cow\\"... E L James complete lack of imagination and sensuality cannot be understated.  To be honest, I don't think the author would know Erotica even if it came up and slapped her \\"down there.\\" \\"Oh my!\\" If you're a teenager, a virgin, or the hottest sex you've ever had is missionary position in your bed, with the covers on and the lights out, this might be the book for you; however, for those of us who have a normal, healthy sex life, the sex scenes in this book are completely anti-climactic... pun completely intended.  If you really want the muscles in your belly to \\"clench deliciously down there,\\" I suggest reading A.N. Roquelaure's Sleeping Beauty Trilogy instead.  This series definitely does not deserve the accolades it has received.  Complete rubbish!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. It is better than a regular calculator! I have 4 younger sisters and 2 of them lost my calculator so I got this one.It is GREAT!!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|An absolute timeless classic. This is simply a wonderful tale. Lovely animation, beautiful voices for the characters, classic songs you and your children will sing along to. This is so much more artistic and beautiful compared to most of the crap they put out today. My son adores this movie and it's rare as a parent you can go back time and again to watch a movie with your kids. Brilliant.
B007TVANDM|5.0|This is one of those rare books with a message in a delightful format. A friend recommended it to me, and said she'd bought copies as Christmas gifts for her adult family members. (I think I'm going to steal her idea!) I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire to read to my grandkids - a 5-yr old and 4-yr old twins. On the first reading, the twins echoed the words, giggled with laughter, and begged for more. While kids love Pete's adventure, the underlying message is \\"find your own happiness in whatever situation you're in\\" and that's appropriate for children of all ages.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Massive pretty much covers the feel of the BK2 Campanion, even with the 5 1/4 inch blade and just 10 1/2 inches overall. Like a mini bulldozer.<br /><br />Comes to hand extremely well thanks to a grooved thumb ramp on the secure, tight-fitting nylon sheath that helps pop the knife out. The Grivory handles provide a big, firm grip that feels completely natural and will help with long, repetitive chores, but they're also easy to choke up on for more control. I worried a bit that the 1/4 inch thick blade would make it useless for food processing, but it has a quick angle down from the spine, and the 20-degree edge seems pretty versatile.<br /><br />Not enough camp/chore knives come with hammer pommels in my opinion, and the full tang of the BK2 sticks out the back of the handle slabs to provide the hammering/smashing option that I find just as necessary as a good edge in a camp/utility knife. The handle slabs are screwed on, and anything screwed on will come loose eventually, but even without the scales this knife would be completely functional with some tape or paracord.<br /><br />It weighs a pound, so it's a heavy carry, but aside from the handle scales, it is practically indestructible and just kind of radiates confidence on the hip and in the hand. With it's size and blade geometry, it won't do anything perfectly, but it will do almost anything well enough to justify having it in the primary kit. Cut, slice, pry, chop, hammer, puncture, smash... it's a good, dependable tool, and the relatively low price compared to similar knives in this category makes it a great tool in my opinion.
B001MCYZJC|5.0|I've bought this album 3 times, it is that good.<br /><br />Once on vinyl back in the day.  Later I bought it on CD, somehow it got lost in a move, and finally bought the MP3.<br /><br />I was never a Black Sabbath fan, but Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio were a perfect match.  I think it is safe to say that this album is legend.

B005LAII08|2.0|The reason I gave it 2 instead of 3 stars is because neither I or my 3 year old liked it very much.  Not one that I will purchase. Watched Madagascar 3 a week earlier and it was by far the more entertaining movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids love this game.  just saw the movie and they love building new homes for the animals and chasing scratch.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Good Stuff! Worth the view!  If you're looking for a bit of innocent entertainment, then rent this flick.  Not quite sure it would make a great purchase, but definitely worth a one-timer.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was a good follow up to Pride and Prejudice. Some twists and surprises proved I did not know how it would end after all. A very good read.
B0063D7NNA|5.0|This was a good read.  I liked the plot, the historical background and the characters were well developed.  This is a well written book.

B007KZY1YY|5.0|After receiving a Kindle touch from my son for Mothers day.I just had to read the Fifty shades of grey  trilogy after all the publicity i just had to read them and i wasn't disappointed, kept me reading, wish these books were around when i was 30 years younger.
0307744434|5.0|Night Circus is a beautifully written, fascinating novel full of mystery, romance and fantasy. It takes you by the hand and leads you into another world of magic and illusion. I can't wait to see what this author comes out with next! This is one of those uniquely memorable stories.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I loved this book.  I'm not usually a fan of YA fiction, but took a chance on Slammed and am so glad I did.  I immediately fell in love with every single character.  The story made me laugh out loud, cry in several parts and definitely feel the love and tension between Will and Lake.  I thought it was very well written for a self-published author.  The only grammatical error that stands out is the occasional plural word apostrophe.  Point of Retreat is also highly recommended.  I'm looking forward to more from Colleen Hoover!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This game is great the grapics are great to. You should get this app. When you get this app you will be very happy.

0062082353|5.0|awesome. i bought 3 copies so far for me and my friends. i will be buying more for sure. what a patriot, father and husband!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love his game because it is so addictive its a good and bad thing but mostly good. its fun because my brother has it on his phone and I have it on the kindle fire and we would battle and see who gets farthest.
0385732554|4.0|This book is interesting with some life lessons.  Its a little like the hunger games, but i would not recommend  it for any one under 12. Its a little dark and some parts are inapproaite, but its gets better towards  the end.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I probably enjoyed it more as I have raised 3 children & understand that one never knows how a child will turn out. Realizing a child may do somthing that goes against everything you have taught him is a shock making a parent question what he/she has failed to convey. A good read!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|We all know that the world is moving towards wi-fi and away from wired connections. However, you never know when you'll end up in a hotel with a wired connection or be in a corner of your building where the wi-fi connection is terrible. We pay a price for our thin laptops by losing ethernet ports but this solves that problem. I recently moved to a new office with a great view and new furniture...and terrible wi-fi. Rather than having to wait for my university to speed things up I can just use the wired connection. This small adapter can be a life saver and for $29 is worth throwing in your bag.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|this a great edition to the Indiana jones movies. am suppised that harrison ford did so well with all the action
B00004YTIQ|3.0|I bought a pool cover thinking that I wouldn't have to refill the pool as often.  First of all, when the weather is warm, the cover is ok.  When it gets very hot out, the water stays at bath water temperature or hotter, with or without the cover.  The cover doesn't go on very easy and if it's not on perfect, it will sink down on top of the water and the stuff that's collecting on the top, falls in.  Needs to be a little bigger and a little easier to put on.  An elastic edge like the old fashioned bowl covers would be great.
034580404X|1.0|Ok, this is probably the worst series of books I have read, tried to read, gave up on.  They are very poorly written and the characters are shallow and unbelieveable, in a stumbling, flat way.  This trilogy should be titled \\"S&M for  Dummies\\", as in 'read it, and feel dumb for buying into the hype'.  I totally did not like this subject matter at all.  I feel it glorifies bondage and sex slavery between two people.  I feel (and remember, this is MY personal opinion, not a professional opinion that you paid for..), the story of sex between two characters in a book, or movie, should not be described in so great detail bit by bit every time the characters have sex.  This type of consensual S & M sex should not be glorified or made to seem desirable in any way or any time.  I grudingly read thru the first book, skimmed a wee part of the second book, and read only the ending for the third.  So, in my humble opinion, I hated the books.  I recommend NOT buying or borrowing this book.  Or watching any movie related to it.

0307272702|5.0|Taubes has confirmed all my intuitions and suspicions about the accepted wisdom regarding diet and nutrition... it is amazing how resistant we are to the truth about the diabolical marketing of refined carbs and (non)food products in this country.
0345803485|1.0|I agree with all the negative reviews I've read here.  The writing is not good.  The author has absolutely no clue about her subject matter.  Everyone has pointed out all the supporting evidence of this opinion except for one thing (at least I couldn't find it in a keyword search): always drinking European wine.  Grey lives is Seattle, so he would likely drink some of the fabulous wines from Washington, Oregon and California.<br /><br />I read all three books thinking there would be a sad ending.  There was not.  It was a Hollywood \\"hearts and flowers\\" ending.  Think I'll read some Anne Rice now.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great functionality. versions, live integration with sermons are great. search function and ability to take and track notes with text could be improved ( such as grouping notes for a topical study, viewing notes you've made and relevant verses, or collaborating for commentary or questions with someone) could be better.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Heard a buzz about this game from some of my peers. It's a pretty cool game. There are some minor issues I'd like to see fixed in future updates but otherwise, no complaints.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Most apps like this you get and they don't work. I got this and slept great, waking up feeling refreshed and awesome! Definitely reccomend this.
0345803485|1.0|Horrible, horrible, horrible!  The only people I can imagine liking this book are young adults and people who hardly read and think this is a good book because they don't know what a good book is.  If I could give it no stars I would.  Like everyone on here says, the whole biting her lip, inner goddess, etc is extremely annoying.  And if I were to read one more time about how beautiful and perfect Christian Grey is, I was going to puke.  And the constant sex.. seriously?!  I don't even read those parts anymore - I just skip them entirely.  And if they were to be deleted the book would be about 50 pages long. I finished the book and seriously wanted to throw it against a wall.  Stupid me wanted to find out what happens and bought the second one only to find it even more terrible than the first.  I am now reading the third one and it's just... bad.  I am skimming through the book hoping to just get through it.  I don't get what all the hype is about.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|I didn't really like this movie the 1st time I watched it, however it is so effectively creepy I decided to give it a 2nd viewing a few years later. I  guess I was too immature then to appreciate it. This movie is so well done I now compare it to other movies and they don't even come close.<br /><br />  Every scene is perfect, the music is hauntingly beautiful and Johnny Depp gives the best performance of his career. If you have a religious bone in your body it will give you chills. Even watching it now in 2012 it's still a powerful movie and I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is by far the most addictive game ever. could play this for hours on end. i absolutely love it!!
0596805888|5.0|I am an amateur cook at best.  I was looking for a book that would increase my knowledge about ingredientes, spices, techniques, and equipment in the kitchen.  This is the book for me.  I can read it for hours at a time, and will keep reading it over and over to learn all of the techniques.  The best part is that it explains what is actually happening with the molecules in the food, which allows me to apply the knowledge and techniques in unorthodox ways.  It is great to know things like why medium rare beef tastes best to most people, how to cook food to acceptable safety standards (I like some meat more rare than FDA recommended, nice to know options and risks.), and also great to know why some things fail in the kitchen.  The only bad side of this book is the interviews.  The book is probably 1/2 scientific techniques and knowledge from the author, 1/8 recipes, and the remainder 3/8 interviews.  The interviews are written in question/answer format, but can be very dry as many of them do not relate directly to ingredients or techniques in the kitchen.  I could read this book from front to back, except I fall asleep during the interviews.  And there are so many of them.  Only a few of the interviews have been useful in increasing my knowledge in the kitchen.  The rest just reiliterate topics that were already presented in very long winded manner, or have nothing to do with cooking (a lot of talking about creating food blogs...I am an amateur, I will not be writing food blogs, and do not feel that they are essential to the cooking process.).<br /><br />  Although I am not a fan of the interviews, the book contains enough useful information that it deserves at least 5 stars.  Very well written and scientifically sound.
0545091020|5.0|This was a great book on CD.  We really enjoyed listening to it and can't wait to listen to the Catching Fire (2nd book).<br />It was addicting and we couldn't wait to get back in the car to hear more.  When the movie comes out soon we will be watching that as well.<br />My 10 year old would listen on and off as she was watching her movie and she even enjoyed it (thought it would scare her but it didn't she was in suspense).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible app has everything a reader wants instead of trying to find where things are u just look it up plus you're able to make the app read to you! like I said best ever
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I guess I should give it more time, but the first 20% of the story bored the hell out of me.  Climbing down 100 flights of stairs and then back up again?  It's gotta be me, but I just don't get it. I'm going to set it down and try again later.
B008H6GH8I|3.0|So the first animated Resident Evil movie was good, this was not quite there, but thoroughly enjoyable.  I recommend this to any other Resident Evil fans!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very fun to play.but if you get this game you have to play it everyday.and there really isnt much to play on the game.
B0088X7YU0|3.0|So I bought this as I own the other 3 Starship Troopers, and it was good (not great, but good).  It was better than #3 and if you were a fan of the original, I recommend checking this out.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I just started using my tablet to read books, though I miss the experience of handling a \\"real\\" book, the smell and texture of paper....but if not for the Kindle app, I would never have discovered this book. It is shockingly well written, not just for the genre of sword and sorcery fantasy, but for the ridiculously low purchase price.  Others here have compared it to George R.R. Martin works and I have to agree. Though the plotting and diversity of character perspective are not as intricate and ambitious as Martin's, the quality of the writing is mature and subtle, very confident and so well crafted, you would think this author far more famous and widely read than he apparently is. It's not even a book available in print, strictly an ebook. I have had only one other experience with the Kindle store and a pure ebook and that turned out as I expected, meaning not very good. Prior to that disappointment, I had just finished the second book of the Wolf Hall series by Hilary Mantel, a marvelous writer. Not fantasy, but historical fiction, though based on great scholarship. A rewarding reading experience, which made the cheap ebook I took a chance on next even more painful by comparison. I had purchased that book at the same time as I purchased Raven's Shadow, just kind of rolling the dice with a couple of lightweight titles that had respectable reviews to see if I might discover a hidden gem. With the sour taste of the last book still leaving me grimacing, I started Raven's Shadow. And promptly lost myself in one of the best stories I can remember since finishing the last installment of Game of Thrones. If this is your genre, but you have above average literary standards, I highly recommend it. Yes, the 5 stars you see from readers were honestly earned. My kudos to the author and I sincerely hope he is finishing a sequel soon.
B005LAIHZE|3.0|So the book was great, and I was really hoping the movie would stick closer to the book, but sadly it did not.  Still, I wanted this in my collection, I am hoping there are some good bonuses on the disc.
0345803485|5.0|Book was good. A page Turner. Started to just skim through the sex parts because was getting redundant. But all in all a very good read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is amazing I love it so much you guys should download it asap no lag good strategy game and make sure to use your energy wisely in the beginning
0439023521|5.0|Book was a very good read. I read it in two days and immediately ordered the next two to read. Excited to see the movies now!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I loved the character and thought it was a great book. It is a good romantic comedy to read when you don't want anything too heavy.
034580404X|3.0|The Box holding the set of 3 books fell apart. The first book was a bit strange, but each book got better and better. Enjoyed the last book best of all.  Ticked off though, that after I read the 3 books, I couldn't fit them back into the box and in trying to, it fell apart.  I buy boxed sets all the time, and this box defeated the whole purpose of having a boxed set.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Repetitive and uninteresting. This book is all hype and doesn't come close to delivering.  I agree with  the other reviewer-it feels like it is written by a teenager. I hate giving up on a book... but after reading a quarter of it I can honestly say it is the worst thing I've read in a long time.
B0088WFZQG|1.0|The movie seemed very good BUT my viewing experience was AWFUL!!!.  The streaming was interrupted three times and I had to start over each time until I gave up.  We have streamed movies in the past with out difficulty but this time it was a BUMMER!!!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I was watching  netflix when all of a sudden battery HD popped up.I had to go back to netflix a few times and then I got sick of it and then deleted it.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|MMA fans will love this movie but moms will also too. It has drama and passion at the same time. Not only for the young generation. This movie is for everyone.
030758836X|3.0|I did enjoy this book.  Really I did, but...  I just found so many things so implausible.  In this day and age of forensics and criminal investigation, it is unrealistic to think that the police wouldn't have discovered more information.  And the ending??  Awful.  Just awful.  I get that she is \\"gone\\", but really now.  She's writing the screenplay for the movie to star Reese Witherspoon.  I\\"m not sure hollywood will like that ending--too anticlimactic.  Perhaps she'll consider an alternative ending.
030758836X|1.0|It is hard to believe this book would be on the N.Y. Times Bestseller List and for so long.  I hated the book (could not finish the book, but read the last two chapters).  Another reviewer called the book vulgar and it was, poorly written with no ending.  Do not waste your time and money!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|And way more addictive. New puzzles are added all of the time for long lasting time wasting. I mean entertainment.
B001FOPODS|5.0|Extras are great and the granddaughter loves.  A little scary at times (definitely not the Disney version).  Bought after watching snips off youtube.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Bear Grylls has made himself synonymous with quality products designed to take the knocks of the hard outdoors and this product is another good example of that standard. The bottle is a large 1 litre (2.11 US pints) capacity bottle made of strong plastic with reinforced ribbing for extra strength and added grip when holding. The metal canteen is easy to put on and pull off the bottom of the bottle and the heat proof fold-away handles are an excellent idea allowing you to use it for heating directly over a fire.<br /><br />My only gripe for this product would be that the carry case is a little too tight meaning the canteen gets stuck in the case when you pull the bottle out so you have to muck around pulling the canteen out separately if you wish to use it. But this is really a minor gripe as you would normally not take the bottle out of the case just to have a drink so your really only going to notice it when you need to get to the metal cup.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Love the oldest to newest, makes finding allot faster &amp; easier.  Very easy and fairly fast. Of course it's user friendly.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Product only worked in one of my DVD players. Im not sure why. I did not ask seller for a refund or exchange due to the fact that it worked properly in one of my DVD players.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! It's great to play with my friends. The little comment/chat feature is good. I can't draw but I am getting better.  I am playing the Kindle Fire- Free version. Currently there are ads for upgrades, more words that so far are not available for kindle fire. I hope Amazon hurries up and makes these upgrades available.  I would even buy the game if the upgrades were available there. If you play a lot like I do, you get repeat words.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|My expectations were so high with all the reviews. It took me forever to read this book. The plus side is I think it was well written. Other than that geesh...are women really not having sex in America? is there no passion in the lives of the people who made this book a best seller.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|This album is great, filled with soulful vocals and catchy beats. I enjoyed that fact that it's not a one note album, there are different styles of music all rolled into one CD.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The Good: This thing does what it says it will do and sounds pretty awesome. You will not use the full volume without doing ear damage, unless you already have ear damage. It successfully takes the underpowered Razor Maxx output and delivers excellent sound, while improving the range (bass.)<br /><br />The Bad: I don't know how they define \\"normal use\\", but 10 hours is a pipe dream. I'm lucky to get an hour out of it at perhaps half its volume potential. If they make a bigger one that holds a bigger battery, that would actually last 10 hours; I'd pay 5 times the price in a heartbeat... and probably 10.<br /><br />That being said; this thing is still worth every penny they're asking for it, as the price is very fair for what you actually get.
0061733199|5.0|This guide covers most any area of the world one might find themselves, so it does get a bit tedious reading through tips specific to those areas (for example: the arctic) in order to find information that might pertain to another area during a specific season (Montana in the winter). That slight inconvenience aside, this is an excellent book that I am very glad I purchased as one of the first steps in building a B.O.B. as it suggests items to include and provides knowledge on how to use them.
B0088RQ4TI|2.0|lots of exposition, two leads who could not have been less compelling if they'd worn bags over their heads, CGI monsters who didn't make the final casting call cut for the bad Star Wars films I - III, Avatar fying scenes with steam punk machines replacing creatures...<br /><br />No wonder this movie tanked.  Glad I only paid to download a showing, rather than have to look for a way to unload this turkey...
B0083EM24C|4.0|From a debut EP entitled [[ASIN:B001DSNG0O Chunk Of Change]] that was given as a gift to frontman Michael Angelakos's girlfriend to the 2012 release of the Columbia major label debut (and second overall full-length after 2009's [[ASIN:B0039S7EUO Manners]]) [[ASIN:B0083EM24C Gossamer]], Passion Pit has come a long way.  Add excellent Billboard 200 numbers (#4, 37,000) for the former-indie group, and things turn out just as `sunny' as Gossamer sounds.  Overall, Gossamer is enjoyable, well produced, and well written.  There are no overt misses, nor does anything ever grow too weighty. If there is any objection, it is probably the fact that Gossamer is too chipper!<br /><br />Opening with \\"Take A Walk,\\" a lush palette of synthetic sounds is employed.  After the mysterious, non-percussive opening, a highly percussive four-on-the floor pattern guides \\"Take a Walk.\\" Incorporating a guitar-driven sound, clear vocals by Angelakos, and the use of layered vocals, \\"Take A Walk\\" is an excellent way to start things off.<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Alright\\" keeps things going strong, opening spastically and busily.  \\"I'll Be Alright\\" employs a palette that includes strings, flute, cello and synthetic elements.  The songwriting is top-notch, particularly on the refrain: \\"But you should go if you want to/yeah go if you want to/I'll be alright, be alright/Well I've made so many messes/and this love has grown so restless/your whole life's been nothing but this/I won't let you go loveless...\\" Chivalry apparently still resides somewhere, ladies and gentlemen.<br /><br />\\"Carried Away,\\" a single from Gossamer restores the four-on-the-floor groove of the opener and continues nothing but optimism (no pessimism allowed).  \\"I get carried away/carried away from you/and I'm hoping and I'm praying/cause I'm sorry...sorry about the things that I said...,\\" Angelakos sings.  Add excellent use of supporting vocals alongside the fine production and \\"Carried Away\\" is another winner.<br /><br />On \\"Constant Conversations,\\" the sound can be described as indie-urban, if there is such a classification.  Regardless of label, there is an inherent nod to R&B (influence) on this cut, particularly given the lushness of the sound.  A solid record, \\"Constant Conversations\\" benefits from songwriting, vocal effects, and the overall sound.<br /><br />\\"Mirrored Sea\\" opens rhythmically and possesses a slick, synth-driven sound.  The chorus is bombastic, providing nice `separation' from the verses:  \\"Oh you mirrored sea/your waves they're haunting me/they're all I see...\\" \\"Mirrored Sea\\" doesn't dare outshine \\"Constant Conversations,\\" but is a consistent follow-up.<br /><br />Keeping up with consistency, \\"Cry Like A Ghost\\" continues in a sunny quality, despite the title or the lyrics (\\"Sylvia, Right back where you came from/you're a pendulum/heartbroken and numb...\\" A highlight is the hip-hop and urban sensibilities of the cut.  Specifically, the drum programming is superb here.<br />\\"On My Way\\" is a home run, featuring a `wall of sound' on the refrain.  An assortment of instruments help in the brilliant execution of this cut, including sax, celeste, strings, trumpet, and trombone.  Additionally, the harmonic progression, percussive patterns, backing vocals, and chivalrous nature of the cut contribute to it's brilliance.<br /><br />\\"Hideaway\\" opens darker than the majority of cuts, thanks to the use of distortion.  While listeners may be waiting for a minor key center, the key is soo established as major.  \\"Hideaway\\" is another solid cut, though not the `cream of the crop.'<br /><br />The brief :34 \\"Two Veils To Hide My Face\\" is as alluring as any full-length cut - a testament to its content.  The vocal arrangement delivers a beautiful, bubbly timbre.  The songwriting is great too, particularly given its brevity.<br /><br />\\"Love Is Greed\\" is as lovely and lush as anything else, regardless of Angelakos's lyrics of the contrary: \\"Love, love, love/love is just greed/it's almost taken me/but now I can see...a selfish little need/you follow or you lead.\\" Yeah, Passion Pit may be `bummed,' but even the `greed' of love seems optimistic here.<br /><br />\\"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\\" is a catchy penultimate cut while \\"Where We Belong\\" closes with an array of synthesized lines, samples, and loops - typical Passion Pit fare.  Add Angelakos affinity for falsetto and great songwriting and Gossamer is complete.<br /><br />Overall [[ASIN:B0083EM24C Gossamer]] is a solid indie-pop album. There are lots of well written songs and captivating productions to listen to and take in.  Perhaps Passion Pit takes a little to literally the `kill them with kindness' sentiment as even what should be drabber moments connote buoyancy given the bright productions.  Regardless of the minor complaint (major if you prefer darker music or prefer a mix of dark/bright), Gossamer is rock solid - no pun intended.ut now I can see...a selfish little need/you follow or you lead.\\" Yeah, Passion Pit may be `bummed,' but even the `greed' of love seems optimistic here.<br /><br />\\"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\\" is a catchy penultimate cut while \\"Where We Belong\\" closes with an array of synthesized lines, samples, and loops - typical Passion Pit fare.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|love it,  enjoy the soothing sounds of the music . I enjoy these types of games on the computer so I like this.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I just love these types of movies and this one wasn't half bad.  I think they could have taken out the love interest part just didn't come across all the great for me and the end was kind of hooky. The crazy guy was great he was really crazy great show of insaneness from him (if that's even a word). If you're looking for something to entertain yourself with and not a big mind bending movie go for it. Get it when it's at the .99 rental deal.
0783240236|4.0|If memory serves me well, my parents loved this movie and I remember watching it with them a few times.  However in this day and age the Birds is honestly mediocre at best but you know, I can't get away from the nostalgia that surrounds it, so my rating has to be an unconfident 4 out of 5 stars.  Anyway I'm pretty sure a movie released in 1963 wasn't originally in color, but the color really makes the film more watchable.  I actually didn't realize the movie was released over 50 years ago until the date flashed on my TV screen.  I thought it was more along the lines of a mid 70's movie.  Wow, are these actors still alive?<br /><br />Basically the first hour is complete overblown boredom with the typical kind of acting you'd expect from that generation of movies.  An attractive blonde-haired woman visits a man that (I guess) was flirting with her in a bird store where the woman was working and when the woman wants to deliver these love birds to his home, she finds out he's not there, so the woman makes the trip to his beach home.  A surprise delivery.  For the first hour, nothing but one boring scene after another occurs between the woman and the man she wants to have a relationship with, along with the mans mother frequently interfering and being nosey with HER feelings concerning the relationship.  This means one nonstop talking segment after another with *very* little in the way of suspense.  Don't even think about bird attacks occuring because it ain't happenin' folks! (and don't try to tell me the one scene where a seagull swoops down and attacks the woman during a boat ride is compelling enough suspense... please).<br /><br />By the way, how weird is it that the woman was flattering the man by sending *him* the love birds in a cage?  Usually it's the other way around with the man in charge and sending things to the woman he likes, especially with older films like this one and the time when women weren't normally the ones to make the first move.<br /><br />However when the movie finally gets going... well it doesn't initially happen the way it's supposed to.  When the blonde woman and another lady (who used to be the girlfriend of the man mentioned above) become \\"friends\\" while sitting together in a house and having a boring and fake conversation, a loud bang is suddenly heard at the front door.  When they open the door they see a dead bird lying on the front porch.  Now this is hilarious, but the dialogue here is unforgivingly horrendous and laughable.  The two women stare at each other after this one particular line that involves the full moon and the birds having enough light to see their way around, and it finishes with the two ladies staring at each other like the oddness of this dead bird on the doorstep is supposed to be the scariest most dramatic moment in the history of movies, LOL!  It's pathetically and painfully exaggerated, haha.  Just not believable enough suspense to create a feeling of satisfaction in todays world.<br /><br />Other than that, the second half of the movie is when things really begin to shine.  The birds are apparently attacking by the hundreds on this entire small town, including the kids.  Come on, not the kids!  Especially since all they want to do is run home from a horrible day of school!  The best part is definitely when the blonde woman, the man, his mother and the young daughter are all together in the house and they hear the distinct and disturbing sound of thousands of birds about to invade their home right above the roof.  This is actually REALLY good horror, and it's surprising to me how effectively well done it is for a 1963 flick.  The sound the birds make here is really cool and for anyone who fears isolation, this will really creep you out!  Another memorable spot is when the blonde is sitting outside the school building and firing up a cigarette, and behind her the crows gather round gradually on the playground equipment.  When the woman turns around and sees them... she tiptoes back into the school so as not to alert them.  Great stuff.<br /><br />Overall, you can actually avoid the first 45 minutes and not miss a single noteworthy thing, but please tune in for the remaining second half when the bird invasion intensifies.  These birds have the persuasive ability to take your mind away from the mediocre and outdated acting.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I just loved this movie and I'm not a big war movie person. The acting wasn't Hollywood acting it was the real stuff. I watched it twice and was amazed at some of the things these guys can pull off. Watch the movie, but don't expect any Matt Damon type guys these guys are straight up real. The end may make you cry (made me cry) and the song, so fitting. Enjoy!!!!

0765316994|3.0|It was all right *shrug*. I'm disappointed, to be honest. I'm a geekgirl to the core, and I appreciated Scalzi's nods to the tropes of many different fandoms (with special skewing of the STAR TREK fandom, of course), but his *wink, wink...nudge, nudge* delivery eventually started getting on my nerves. This story had a bad case of, \\"I'm smarter than you.\\" I'd been led to  believe that Scalzi was hilarious in his genre, but I'd still give that crown to Adams (and if you go a little further down the fantasy line, Pratchett or Gaiman).<br /><br />The idea of using a Sci-Fi given, namely that the secondary characters are cannon fodder, was clever, even mildly humorous at times, but became bogged down in underdeveloped characters,snarky, self-referential dialogue, and really shoddy editing (the sheer numbers of repetitive word use and clumsy sentence structure almost lost me right at the beginning).<br /><br />Still, for the sci-fi fan who enjoys a good skewering of his or her obsession, the laughs came often enough to make the book worth finishing.
0345525558|5.0|Delightful book filled with issues of social justice and the redemption of love. The problem of emancipation of young persons in the foster system at age 18 without any skill on how to gain employment and pay rent is highlighted in this book. It is well written and the language of flowers made the book totally delightful.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. Just wish I could figure out how to get more acorns! But other than that it is a lot of fun making all the animal families.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was one of them books I just couldn't put down. Loved it wasnt expecting the story to be good but to my surprise it was a great book. I still don't understand why people made such a big issue about it being some pornographic book that talked about nothing but sex. I personaly think the story line was great.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is not normally a genre I would read but I simply had to because of all the hype. The writing of these book is sophomoric and uber-repetative but I did enjoy the story. Steamy and romantic. I was surprised that there was a love story underneath all the sex but indeed there was! I didn't much care for Ana but Christian is another thing. I was afraid of an abusive relationship between them but that was not the case. I've recommended it to many as a light mindless summer frolic with some steamy sex scenes. I'm glad I read it.
B0073CNGCC|5.0|Lack of sleep.. Had to stay up to watch each episode, great cast, great storyline, cant wait for season three.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its great. Wish it had book shelves though. I also would like to<br />Be able for my wife to have an app on here for her account too.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am a Reader and never go anywhere without a novel in my handbag. That said, I have never been a fan of \\"outdoors/adventure\\" fiction. I don't read books about the climb to Everest, the trek to the Antarctic, the arduous journey to wherever. Just never interested me. So honestly, if Oprah hadn't blessed this book by making it part of her Book Club, I never would have bought it. And that would have been a shame, because it's an amazing story that deeply touched me.<br /><br />Oprah has never steered me wrong. Nearly all of her Book Club books have inspired me in some vital way. It's gotten to the point where if she recommends a book, I go read it. I don't even bother with reader reviews first.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews here that will tell you the premise of Wild and the story of Cheryl Strayed. I won't go into it. You shouldn't even read any of the reviews first. Just dive into the story and be prepared to suddenly find yourself considering your own journey--and the things in your life that brought you to that place.

0743454537|5.0|***** Ages 14 up? This book....Heartbreaking. Tear jerking. Moving.  Poignant, Touching, Tragic, Beautiful, terrible.      Basically, Anna sues her parents for the rights to her own body - medical emancipation - when they want her to donate a kidney for her sister Kate who is dying of acute something leukemia .About a family that is broken apart by a terminal disease but manages to glue itself back together again, all the while learning and discovering new things about each other.    It's a very complex story, and the reader doesn't know every aspect of the story and lawsuit. Anna has hidden reasons for the lawsuit that aren't known until the end of the book, and it will surprise you.    The POV alternates between Anna; the main character, Sara; her mom, Brian; her dad, Jesse; her brother, Campbell; her lawyer/attorney, and Julia; her guardian ad litem - she is brought in to see what the best choice is for Anna and her family. Each of the characters have such a developed backstory that it is conceivable to think that they had lives before Jodi Picoult weaved them into this story.    Sara's POV mostly consists of flashbacks starting from when Kate is diagnosed leading up to the present, which really explains Anna's past 'donations' and Sara's choices.    Anna is a very realistic character, wondering about things I wondered about when I was 13, like what age are we in heaven and more. She is mature but still a kid, and I felt such sympathy for her sometimes, like when she is not allowed to go to this really prestigious hockey camp with an Olympic champion trainer with a full schlorship just 'in case'. In case Kate is sick again, in case Anna is needed to give up another part of her body for her.    Brian's POV shows his uncertainty about Anna's decision: he kind of supports her and her rights, but hates to see this tearing apart his family. We also get to see Jesse's POV, and observe his life as the forgotten sibling: not the sick one or the needed one.    My favoritecharacter was actually Campbell. He had a great stinging sense of humor and sarcasm and had that whole mystery going on with Judge, his service dog. Every few chapters he would be asked what Judge if for because \\"You're not blind.\\" He always had some funny retort, and I wanted to know just as bad as his inquisitors. His History with Julia and their relationship was also another aspect of the book I enjoyed. Also, since we don't read from Kate's POV, we don't actually know how she feels until the end.    All the characters developed and grew and learned about each other and become closer. (I know, a serious need for commas in that sentence). They were my favorite part.  OH, THE ENDING! In the words of Draco Malfoy in the Prisoner of Azkaban, \\"Oh, it's killed me! It's killed me!\\" <-That's only 'cause you were idiotic and arrogant and confronted poor Buckbeak. Ok, back on the topic. I almost cried. Most people bawl, I've heard. It was a twist, for the book, and for my heart. In the back of the book, the author writes that after reading it her son wouldn't talk to her except to say \\"WHY?!?!\\" I wasn't expecting it, and ... I can't really say more without spoiling the whole book. FOR MORE GO TO [...]

B006OCM0G0|1.0|I've enjoyed playing TL games, bakery story, restaurant story, and farm story, for over a year. If you'd asked me what I thought prior to May 2012, it would have been a stellar 5 star review. But, recent harassment by adults & underaged players have made their games unpalatable. Despite repeated emails sent to team lava with screenshots, I'm still being harassed. I now fear that these players will take their harassment from the virtual world into the real world. Even more frustrating, I was suspended when I tried to fight back and also when I attempted to help others being harassed along with me. The harassers are still doing what they do without any disciplinary actions by team lava. For months, players have asked for a ban or an block feature on their walls so that they have the power in their own hands to stop harassment immediately. To this day, team lava has not provided it. Instead, they are busy raising the prices of items players can purchase. And, they work diligently to provide players every other week with new appliances that cost too many coins and cook too few recipes. Unless these critical problems are rectified, I cannot continue to support this company.<br /><br />If their unethical treatment of harassment cases were not enough, their games are full of gem \\"traps.\\" These are areas where you are susceptible to tapping on the wrong item and end up spending gems on things you did not intend to purchase. Gems cost real dollars and the fact that team lava has continued to ignore player requests to make accidental purchases using gems more difficult is another unethical way this company is making money off of us.<br /><br />My friend made a to do list for those who wish to have a block button installed.

0439023513|5.0|I have nothing new to add to the thousands of comments already posted, I just wanted to put my vote in for a 5 star rating.
0792163710|5.0|One of the very best Westerns.  George Stevens did a wonderful job (Took one year to edit).<br /><br />Dialog wonderful by A.B. Gutherie, Jr.  Palance deserved an oscar for his fine performance, and<br /><br />Ladd at least a nomination.  I hate the over-used term but there is no substitution for COOL as it<br /><br />describes Alan Ladds performance...especially his wonderful voice.  Beautifully constructed story<br /><br />with all the prime incredients for a first class western.  Remember...much of the story is seen<br /><br />through the eyes of a young boy.
1419703692|5.0|I got it today in the mail!!! I just finished reading the 1st chapter and it's so amazing! Jody Jesser's writing reads smoothly and draws you right into the minds and making process of Christopher Nolan and all the people involved making the Dark Knight Movies. The Pictures are great and goes along well with the writings. And I am okay that they didn't split up the books into the 3 movies, but rather having different chapters like: Screenplay, sound/music, etc. Buy THIS BEFORE THEY INCREASE THE PRICE!!! It is worth more than what your getting it for. $24 buck :) --4dao
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a great app! The only thing I would change is have more games to play on Ice Age Village! But other wise it is great!
140053271X|5.0|First let me say this nook is lightweight and simple and good for anyone who simply loves to read and wants to bring their library with them. There is no backlight which greatly reduces eye strain compared with other ereaders. The interface is laid out in easy to use functions and the pages actually look like those of a real book. Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends. All purchase books are your forever compared to other ebook services who may take the boom away when the publisher ends digital publishing. If you're looking for something simple without bells and whistles and are a true book lover, you will love this nook. Great for any age too! (Font sizes are adjustable. Yay!)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|If history were taught like this in school when I was going (many years ago) I would have learned much more as well as enjoyed the entire 'school' experience.  We were taught to learn dates and what happened, not the reasons behind the events.  Although I am now a woman of 50+ years, I have found a new love of learning about how this wonderful country of ours was formed and who were the actual leaders (and relationships to each other) who fought for our freedom.  I can not say enough about this item.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have the City Mini and I looked around for a while before getting this holder. I love it!!! It's nice because the drink holders will expand for larger drinks. It holds 2 drinks and I usually put my keys, wallet and cell phone in the center part and there's still room!! When you fold up the City Mini you don't need to take it off the stroller either.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. It is a great way to study the Word. The reminders for the plans are helpful. I really reccomend it.
B008CP93S0|2.0|A great cast can't save this stinker.  Tired plot, tired jokes. Got it as a bargain rental and still contemplated asking for a refund. Just not funny.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I put it on before I go to bed and it puts me out within minutes. I recommend chimes/rain/thunder/piano/'rain on roof' for a good combination :)
0374531269|4.0|This book was for my son's summer reading for school. I have not yet read it. I pan on reading it after he finishes.
1427201439|4.0|I love \\"Dune\\" and have read it more than a dozen times.<br /><br />This audio version is really quite good, but I'm baffled: It's advertised as \\"full cast,\\" but once I got past the first six disks, the \\"full cast\\" disappeared.<br /><br />In a way, this was fine with me, as I didn't much like Gurney Halleck as an American dock worker and the basso profundo of the Baron Harkonnen, who sounded more like James Earl Jones than the the sinuous and sinister Baron I imagine.<br /><br />At any rate, great listening - but did anyone else notice the great disappearing \\"full cast\\"?
B00008FKFF|3.0|This album is pretty good. It's not expensive and it's got one of my favorite traffic songs ever on it, medicated goo. While my record was delivered to me in much worse condition than advertised I still enjoy it.
1589944607|5.0|For any BSG fan, it's obvious that lying and tricking your way into having the other players believe that you're human, when you've actually woken up several times in a resurrection hub would constitute a fantastic game night. A couple beers, a couple BSG fans, and a couple hours to waste with this game makes a great evening. The only downside: the inevitable arguments and fights between players hell bent on winning.
1593157134|5.0|I was recommended by my mentor to read this book. WOW! read it again & again, apply it & you'll begin to see the results. My 12yr old is reading it right now & he just asked me why didn't I give this book to him earlier.
0984999302|5.0|I have been searching for a key resource to compliment entrepreneur development programming for a wide variety of entrepreneurs in many categories.  This is it.  I think this is a must-have manual for anyone with an idea and seriously looking to bring that idea successfully to the commercial marketplace.  Many may not realize that there are years and years of experience plus reinforcements across many thought leaders and case researchers to back up what Steve Blank and Bob Dorf have created here - let alone their enormous tacit understanding from their cumulative pasts. I love the fact that it can be engaged in a variety of ways for a wide readership, and the checklists in the back are a terrific idea.  RE: an e-book version - I have tested this in front of a roomful of advanced technology entrepreneurs and offered a different book in either the hard copy or the e-version of it.  100% took the hard copy (despite getting a couple comments on the feedback form about killing trees re hand-outs I had provided).  100% still took the hard paper copy of the book in a direct test with the target audience...just saying.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|On my daughter's recommendation, I ordered this and it is really a cute, funny take on Pride and Prejudice.  If you are a fan of Jane Austin, this is a must see.<br />Seller upped my shipping so I got in a couple days.  Highly recommend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|nice game to play no timers or rush just build up your city at your own pace. would recommend to anyone
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I love /loved it. My evo 3d recently received ics and i can now use Chrome as my browser. For some reason it does not play nice with chrome. It auto puts in multiple words and some times the keyboard becomes invisible.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is poorly written and it takes the feminist movement back 50 years. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I could barely finish it.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator 2 is my fav action movie. I'll never get bored of watching it! When I watched this blu-ray the video quality blew me away! It does look like a new movie not a movie from the early 90s! The audio quality is also fantastic! If you are reading this review to decide if you buy this blu-ray or not. Just go ahead and buy it. You'll get to see a great movie with awesome video & audio quality + some interesting extras for around 6 dollars only!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Don't give a bad review because of the shortcomings of &quot;your&quot; equipment. Complaining that it doesn't work for your Kindle Fire is like complaining  your bicycle doesn't go 80mph in top gear. The Kindle Fire is a glorified e-reader. Get a real tablet like the Nexus 7.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Even though it was in Japanese with English sub-titles it was still a great movie with wonderful sound affects, didn't quite like the ending of the Yamato getting blown up, but still a great movie!!!
B008EQIEWS|3.0|This movie was decent, I enjoy action and effects so it was worth watching but not nearly as good as the first!
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I refuse to pay for cable or satellite.  The prices are ridiculous!  So, I ordered one of my favorite show's complete series, \\"Will & Grace\\".  I was so happy...af first.  Everything about the packaging, presentation and graphics indicates that this is a genuine NBC original series dvd set.  HOWEVER, over half of the episodes DO NOT play on my Sony or Samsung Bluray players.  SO DISAPPOINTED!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual City Playground is a really fun game until you get to all of the facebook crape and advertising for the company.
B00563M11M|4.0|If you enjoy Terry Pratchett's mix of humor and philosophy, you will enjoy this one as well. Well worth reading.
B008K8U13K|3.0|I played this on a friends Fire and at first I loved it, until I tried some precise movements. If you just push right, its fine, but if you try more refined movements sonic just looks up or ducks. It's difficult to get where you want to go, and the size of the on screen joystick is way too small. The part that irritated me the most was at the end of each level, where Sonic has to jump into a giant ring to try and earn a chaos emerald. Because if the infuriating controls, he leaps like a moron all around it, but never quite at it. Its also timed so if you miss it twice, the level ends and you have to play the same level over again in order to try again. If the controls were fixed I would probably buy this game, but as it stands, no thanks. Its a shame too, there aren't many deep games on the store.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I really enjoyed this mini series. I like Tom Selleck in all the Movies, and TV shows he has acted in. A Very Professional Actor. Sad that this series has come to end.
B0041KKYCY|1.0|If you haven't seen the 1st version with Keaton, get it.  Don't waste your money on this version which doesn't deliver any rape scenes. [could have been PG 13 except for very brief nudity]--lots of explicit torturing of men--if that's your thing [In this movie violence against men--torture and murdering is okay with censors, but not against women, it seems--double standard?]. The only thing Keaton's version lacked was explicit penetration, but with censors paid to keep you ignorant, that's to be expected. And of course there is a revenge motif.  I guess the censors think that if they allow a rape then the do-gooders must see a bloody revenge...crime doesn't pay and all that BS.  No movie with rape as it subject will ever deliver. Please don't think me callous.  I'm just fed up with filmmakers treating the viewer as if he or she were twelve years old. As Thomas Wolfe wrote in his journal back in the 30's:  there's a lot of frank talk about f...ing but little frank f...ing.  It's not just sex that gets censored--but anything, in general, which would make you more mature and knowledgeable.  One must wonder, I suppose, why what the censors censor will hurt you but not them...*(note:  I didn't spell the F word because seeing it in print would drive you insane).  And, of course, you don't know what the F word is, right?
B004LROMWU|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be the same old story, but this show does have some great potential. Near the end of the first season is when I got really hooked and I can't get enough now. I would recommend this show to anyone that is really into alien/apocalyptic series.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|I remember seeing this movie back in college, experiencing the story and sound and music and dancing through the body and mind of my 20 year old self. Intense and profound I thought at the time. Well, I guess I was feeling nostalgic when I bought and downloaded this CD. I was not disappointed. After all these years, it is still intense and powerful and my 5o year old mind and body still loves it.
B0010X759U|5.0|The content of Feast of Wire, Calexico's most fully realized album, is 5 stars.  Like 99% of modern CDs, the disc is heavily compressed; Calexico's music needs range and room to breath--something which the vinyl accomplishes.  Besides increased dynamic range, three qualities make this 2 record set a must for Calexico fans.  First is the bass.  It is right in my tummy, not obtrusive or distorted, but rich.  Second is the natural sound of the acoustic guitars, bowed double bass & the cymbals.  Third is the very quiet vinyl.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is nothing but porn. I bought it without previewing simply because a friend posted on FB that she had enjoyed it. Won't make that mistake again!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great item. Saved me from storms on. My motorcycle more than once. Great for boating plans, since I live on a lake!
1594744769|4.0|I first heard of this book when my brother's fiancé recommended it to me. At first I was hesitant because of the book's cover, but you know the saying, \\"Never Judge a Book by Its Cover\\". It was not until my American Literature teacher recommended this book to the class until I started to read it. I could relate to Jacob because of the need of adventure. I could also relate to the disappointment he felt when faced with the realization that that he was just a normal kid who could not discover places. This book took a twist when he comes faced with the children of his grandfather's stories and also the monsters. Without giving to much away the book was very enjoyable with its photography  and plot.
B008MM9630|5.0|If you don't like this game you need your head examined because fairy farm is flippen awesom, cute, and animated!!!!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is a really good game to pass time on to be honest sure not an rpg game but it's good enough for me would buy the other games
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A great game for the kids. Wish the prices were lower for many items. You do have to be careful tho when the kids are playing the game as unintended real dollar purchases can be made with no verification. But other than that its a great game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this game thanks.its getting harder but I'm enjoying the challenge. I'm still on the first set but almost done. keeps mebusy I forget what time it is.thanks for letting us enjoy this game
B002KKCVX2|5.0|After several years of buying and replacing inexpensive athletic sandals, I finally decided to spend a little more and get some Tevas.  My only regret is waiting so long to do so.  The Tanzas are a comfortable, well built shoe that are great for the river or the beach and don't look out of place running around town.
0553213105|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading. The story & characters never get old, and although some adaptations & variations are enjoyable to read, nothing can ever be quite like the original. If you haven't done so yet, read it. Please. You won't be sorry.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator! It was free and I love the size of it. Big buttons make it easy to use and see.
B0089IGUP4|4.0|\\"What's your favorite song?\\" Brian Fallon sings on the title track of The Gaslight Anthem's latest album.  \\"That's mine, I've been crying to it since I was young.\\"  It's a simple yet potent lyric that speaks to the union of rock music and pure emotion that has always been a driving force among some of the most popular and acclaimed artists in the history of the genre, and it sets the tone for the soaring anthems that comprise the group's best album yet.<br /><br />Once again the band wear their hearts as well as their influcences on their collective sleeve.  The songs have an urgent sense of passion and yearning that draws comparisons to Springsteen as well as a ragged, careening sense of energy that is reminscent of The Replacements.  But this is no mere tribute album.  Handwritten is a fully realized rock record that practically bleeds with open hearted honesty and sincerity.  There isn't a shred of irony to be found and the album is all the better for it.  The band sounds better than ever as well, thanks to the tightend up production courtesy of Brendan O'Brien who has worked with some of rock's true giants.<br /><br />If there is a flaw with the album, it can be found with the running time.  The album contains 14 tracks including two covers which don't add much to the proceedings.  The record reaches its high point with National Anthem, a gorgeous and plaintive ballad that just may be the best thing these guys have ever done.  It feels like the perfect conclusion to everything that has come before it, but the album continues for three more tracks which feels like a  bit of a letdown after such a cathartic high.  That's okay, though.  Better to have a little extra juice than not enough and in that respect Handwritten more than delivers.
1469984202|4.0|I rarely write reviews.  This deserves one.  Great story, very compelling, and well written.  I am a fan!  I was hooked very quickly, which is a rarity.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is SO much fun and totally addictive.  If you have time to waste, this will DEFINITELY fill it and have you trying to run for more and more ALL the time.  I have to not open it sometimes because I know an hour will be gone when I'm done!
057809665X|1.0|The interesting parts of this book would fill five pages. The rest is boring filler. Trees died needlessly for this bilge. Sad.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Mad Men is one of if not the best show on TV in a very long time. It is so sophisticated so much happens with just a look, no words needed. If you have not seen the first four seasons it is a must....

B005723JSQ|4.0|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella's books.  It is short, funny and pretty easy to read. Love her humor.  I recomend this book if you want a good laugh
030758836X|1.0|This book was so disappointing on so many different levels. I kept reading on and on TO THE VERY END hoping it would get better, and it just didn't.<br /><br />Not going to get into plot or style. I will say that the characters have absolutely no redeemable qualities so you wind up being disappointed in everyone. I just felt grumpy through the whole thing.<br /><br />Don't fall for the hype. They are going to consider making this story a movie? That is sad. Just sad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I got this calculator for free on my kindle fire.I got tired of those solar powered ones not working.  This one has big numbers I love it. And I would recommend it to everyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If any book deserves a WOW, this is it.  The author bares his soul and paints his self portrait, warts and all.  Kyle is not what many non-military minded people would expect.  Yes, he's a patented hard guy but he is also a loving husband and father.  He describes his inner thoughts and convictions with nothing held back and no apology to those who wouldn't understand.  He's told enough of both the pain and action involved in training, and the dust, stink and blood of combat to outdo any fiction you might read.  But he includes enough personal insight into his mental and emotional processes to make this also a psychological case study.  I've never read a better first person memoir.  I really gained a new understanding of what it takes to be both human, and a warrior.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|This is really fun and cute. The only problem was it kept freezing and then it would delete my game. Hopefully it's just doing this because it's still new.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I loved this app, it was great to download all my Amazon MP3's directly to my phone, or providing the ability to stream them if I didn't want them taking up memory. Now Amazon has decided to make users pay $25/year to have as much music on there as you want, or you can keep 250 (Amazon mp3's not withstanding) if you don't want to pay for it.<br /><br />It was my go-to music app, but I don't like restrictions on the music I put on my phone, and I sure as hell won't pay $25 a year to access the music I already paid for or uploaded to my cloud drive on their site. If I'm paying for the extra storage space through Amazon Prime, I should be able to do what I want with it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|first of all this book made me cry at the end because it was so beautiful and i am not an easy person to make cry. i think suzanne collins couldve played up the romance a little more throughout this book but overall this is my favorite book ever. i could not live without the hunger games. i wish collins wrote another book about katniss and peetas life together with their children and stuff.in the book she could have alot of romance this way everybodys negative comments would have no point!this book inspired me to write my own book.thankyou susanne collins!!!!

B008B3H4VQ|4.0|it's tough to compare to their first album, and critics make it sound like this album is similar to the first, but it's different.  I like it and will continue to listen to it, but LP's first is still the best.
0345803493|1.0|I accidentally downloaded the second Shades book.  I don't know if the first one is better but I have had a hard time getting through it. I find it Boring with a capital B.  All the couple does is talk the plot is dull and the same sex scenes over and over. Even the suspense is disappointing. He is very controlling and would really annoy the hell of me if he followed me and made all my decisions for me as he does her.  I find the romance in the book \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" to be more my style. Who wants a controlling man with mental health issues due to past baggage and who likes to administer pain? I don't care if he is so good looking and rich.  The young girl is a puppet.  Even the romance in book The Notebook is so much more exciting.<br /><br />He is a nutcase and she is an idiot.  The other men in the girls life were far more exciting.  How can this book have the popularity it does.  It is really awful and I had to force myself to finish it, because I paid for it!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|It was freezing so I uninstalled it. However I tried to install it again but it said that it was still INSTALLED. But when I tried to opened it it wouldn't allow it. But otherwise a very fun game.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This phone case is pretty awesome and yes it is water proof i had a lot of fun on my trip to Florida with it. Taking pictures with no worries is awesome although people give you looks like you're crazy I saw plenty of other people with the same case too. At first it's a little hard to use the screen but you get used to it quickly and forget you even had a little bit of a hard time in the first place.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this product ... especially being able to sync my laptop, phone and Kindle! No more lists getting lost in pockets or under the couch!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is for mature adults with an open mind.we all may wish that Christian didn't have any bagages but every couple has their struggles and that kept them together. Great book,  very well written.
B008KTA64S|3.0|One of my favorite bands (any genre, any decade) have produced a piece of crap, oh well, it happens (tho, there are a few standout songs on this cd, but as an entirety, its not so good)...cant wait for the next one though! This release was waaaaay to trendy with all the \\"aye\\" and other 'fillers' in it that make it pop-radio friendly...TGLA, a band that is known for its soulful and sincere songs produced a collection of songs that are bombastic and very, very cheezy.  Something similar to a nickelback/jimmy eat world mash-up, its pretty top 40 generic stuff on this cd. Speaking of produced, stay away from a pearl-jam producer in the future fellas, ok? 3-4 songs on this cd gave it an extra star and kept it from being a complete waste of money...<br /><br />Btw I bought the...Deluxe Edition...imo, they are to far along in their career to place such WELL KNOWN songs (nirvana and tom petty) on their cd's...if YOU ARE gonna cover, go deep and find a forgotten or under-appreciated song. Bu then again thats the poin of this cd isnt? max-appeal..MAX..capturing a couple diff markets tom petty (singer-songwriter types) and nirvana (heavier/raw types). ONE WORD about that: 'shtick'.<br /><br />Thankfully, even if they dont release another good album, they have left me with 4 superior releases!<br /><br />And to all the haters of my review, you hate my review because in your opinion no one is allowed NOT to like this cd because YOU refuse not to like it! BTW, I wish you were as critical and demanding of all the 4 and 5 star reviewers with their glib and trite \\"awesome cd\\" reviews...you know what I mean???
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Great 3D to add to your library.  Enjoyable for all ages.  Makes you wonder why there are not more 3D movies.
B007SGM084|1.0|My friends suggested that I buy this series to read while recuperating from surgery.  What a waste! I regret spending the time and money; this series is boring and has no substance.  The dirty sex scenes are good. The way he controls her...not so much. I like a man to be a man but I will not stand for the domineering way this character manipulates her emotionally, mentally and physically. The next time I want to read a dirty sex book, I will go back to Jackie Collins. When Ms. Collins writes, you care and like the characters.  Who cares about a submissive and emotionally immature girl and her need for a cruel sadistic man. If she were my daughter, I'd be mortified.
0061743526|5.0|Loved it!!!! We read it for my ENC1102 class and it's more than a great story. We analyzed the situations portrayed in the book, as the Great Depression, social class, racism, and more. It was a great experience, and it is a book everyone should read at least once in their life. Unlike common belief, this is not a book for under 15yo, because they do not have the background knowledge (history, social classes and life durin the Great Depression) to fully understand the story and critically analyze it.
0345803485|3.0|I purchased this book a few weeks ago for a girls weekend where we would be discussing the book.  Everyone else had read it but me, so I decided I should get it so I could participate in the discussion.  I thought it was a decent book, but I could tell it was the first book she had ever written.  From her descriptions of certain things in the book, it appears that she had definitely done some active research.  This isn't really my genre of book, but it was interesting.  I like reading books that I can't put down, this was not one of them.  I could stop at the end of any chapter & not necessarily be compelled to read the next chapter.  I'm currently debating on whether or not to finish the trilogy.  My friends say that books 2 & 3 give explanations, more character studies & are much better in general than the first book.  So maybe I will, but I'm not in a hurry.
0596009208|2.0|This was the class textbook for a data structures course I took that was taught in Java. If you have a lot of time on your hands, the book could be an OK overview of Java, but it requires too much reading to get the point across. It also doesn't explain the basics of getting yourself set-up well. I instead relied on online resources to learn the language, and I could have done without buying this book.

1401235417|5.0|Im new to comics...Batman The Court of Owls was the first comic book storyline I have ever read.<br />Since I read it I went back to all of the Batman classics like The Long Halloween etc. But this<br />book is still my favorite.<br /><br />This is the Batman that I remember from when I was a kid. A brilliant detective and martial artits fighting<br />a new exciting villain. It really feels Batman has met his match, both physically and mentally. The book is<br />filled with superb writing, emotion, action, mystery and will keep you gripped the whole way. The art is<br />beautiful with great panels and intrikat design. Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo are a perfect match!<br /><br />This book is only part 1 of an already epic storyline which makes waiting for the final part a torture.<br /><br />This is Batman!<br />5/5  10/10

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I first came across this movie while browsing Netflix. The description was rather short and vague but it, along with the movie's cover art, was enough to persuade me to give it a watch.<br />In hindsight I'm glad I didn't watch the trailer or read reviews, I think this one's best watched without having too much given away ahead of time. All you need to know that it's a visually stunning movie with a beautiful funny/exciting/heartbreaking story involving characters which will pull you in just like you were when you were told stories when you were little. Just know that it isn't all feel-good and happy, there are some pretty intense moments but in my opinion they're part of what makes this movie so wonderful.<br /><br />I loved it so much that I ended up ordering a physical copy for my permanent collection.

B005PMNBNG|5.0|I had no idea I would love this album so much! I heard the radio songs a few times and enjoyed it, then I had the pleasure of seeing them live at Coachella 2012, then the album was on sale so I purchased it... and I am so totally in love. The songs are amazing and moving and I love to just close my eyes and fall in to them.

1451627297|5.0|Just finished listening to this on Audio Book on my IPod while commuting to work.<br />I believe this is Stephen King's best modern work!<br />Everything about this book was great, including the premise of going back in time to change a seminal event. However, as others have written, this is really a love story.<br />I think King did a masterful job in creating believable characters, and the setting was so nostalgic, even though I only remember the late sixties and early seventies. People were more honest, more ethical, and possibly, more gullible, when I was young.<br />The story did remind me a little of the \\"Back to the Future\\" movies, esp. since they also used a sports outcomes book to make money in the past.<br />The details about the JFK assasination and Lee Harvey Oswald were fantastic-I learned a lot about that period that I had never known.<br />The book proves that King is a master not only of horror, but also of \\"science fiction \\" and drama/suspense.<br /><br />Highly recommend!!!

B004Y1USV2|4.0|I first heard a bit of this live at one of their concerts before the album came out.  It caught my attention (even given the lack of Jon Anderson).  It had a classic Yes sound that really jumped back some years.  So when the album was released I listened to it online, and again liked what I heard enough to order the CD (for certain groups/albums I still prefer a disk versus a download).  It took me one or two good sit down sessions to really appreciate the sophistication of the album.  And I love that it is in fact a whole album, not just a random collection of songs.  It all fits very nicely together in the classic Yes style.  Is this going to replace or supersede any of the classic Yes albums?  No (esp not with out J.A.).  But it is great to hear these great musicians going at it in the way they play best.  Great effort!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|very entertaining, replete with hope and caring.  But I think *listening* to the story as an audio book would be the best!  Glad I read it!

B00457WZEI|5.0|This is one of two books I read a while back after a friend of mine loaned me his Kindle. I started to pass on this one because I knew that a film was in production- just wait for the movie here and check out something else, I thought. I started to pass on it again once I started reading...please tell me this is not narrated by the horse, I mumbled. Unfamiliar with Michael Morpurgo, I looked him up and discovered that he is an author of children's books. A kid's book? With that boatload of cynicism to back me up, I decided to finish what I'd started however, and I am glad that I did. Having read it, I eventually decided to take my daughter to see the movie. She loved it and I got the experience of loving it all over again. With so much dreck out there passing for \\"quality\\" fiction, this one stands out even more. Well worth the read!
0143119680|4.0|Debut author, Deborah Harkness, throws her name into the Urban Fantasy hat with A Discovery of Witches, book 1 of the All Souls Trilogy.  We meet scholar Diana Bishop, a witch who has spent her entire life denying her powers, who in the course of her research accidentally finds a bewitched alchemical manuscript which may hold the deepest secrets of supernaturals. This sends a beacon to practically every species from demons to witches to vampires, putting a big target on her back as they all want to possess this coveted book and only she has the power to unlock its secrets.<br /><br />Perhaps no one is more curious than Matthew Clairmont, a vampire geneticist who has been searching endlessly for this book to further his own research.  Crossing paths with Diana leads down a road neither one expected, and it's certainly not a road their respective species will tolerate.  This leads to Diana being forced to tap into her inner sorceress, but how much power is too much?<br /><br />I'm sure I'm not the first to comment on the length of this novel.  Though to its credit, I have read a number of books that are much shorter and yet they've felt even longer. So that is one plus about this series.  That said, I think it could have been a shorter book by 50 to 100 pages and the beginning and end suffer for it. It has a slow start and then by the end it feels like a chore to finish.<br /><br />The story offers shades of originality, blending storytelling, world-building, romance, and suspense.  Fans of the lead pair may have to be patient, but I don't mind the wait at all. Everything is a process. I actually wasn't expecting to read this novel and get a fairly substantial love story with good characterization.<br /><br />While it's a respectable literary effort, I felt there were a few flaws: the length, the length, and FANGLESS VAMPIRES!! I don't like it and I'm never gonna like it. In the novel, once it finally explains their feeding habits it's hard to picture what is actually going on. Fangs are a completely efficient tool so I'm not understanding why that important characteristic is starting to be omitted in novels.  Allergies to the sun? I can be flexible on that. Hott sex symbol vs. crazed ugly monster? I can be flexible there too if it's masterfully handled. I could even be flexible on their lifespans (prolonged vs. immortal), but I don't budge on fangs and this book didn't change that sentiment. You might as well create werewolves that don't transform. Vampires without fangs should simply be fae instead.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the second novel; however, normally I am motivated to read a series back to back.  For this one, I decided to pick up another book to get a break from this world.going on.

B000QUCPWU|5.0|I grew up hearing Booker T on the radio, but I never realized I was such a big fan until I heard this compilation. Each cut is wonderful. You've got \\"Time is Tight\\" and \\"Green Onions\\", but this trio can play anything. The driving rhythm of the drums and bass create the perfect background for the mellow keyboard floating above. I'll probably wear this one out.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Pros: 1. Nice looking but understated, and without all the stupid lighting effects seen on most crummy gaming rigs. 2. Roomy inside. 3. Built in (but also replaceable fans on the back and top with adjustable high/low rpm external switches for both. 4. Along with option to mount front vents for HD ventilation, also vents for optional fan mounting over PCI-E slots as well as under the CPU. 5. Decent cable management options. 6. Nice mesh dust filters for the power supply fan underneath and over the grill in front of the 3.5\\" slots. 7. Fit most heat sinks I can think of (does fine with my Noctua NH-12UP at 158 mm). 8, Includes the 20 pin single USB internal plug for the front ports, so if you have a new enough motherboard those don't need to be run to the back of the case. 9. Tool-free retention trays for 3.5/5.25 drives. 10. Well priced.<br /><br />Cons:  1. If you like glitzy rigs with windows and laser light shows, it's not for you. 2. The grommets for water cooling tubes are on the top and not the back of the case, which I think is odd but whatever. 3. While the retention trays on the 3.5 inch drives work great, if you plan to mount a 2.5\\" SSD in them, you will probably run into trouble as the pins on the trays require a full length mounting platform, and most 2.5-to-3.5 mounts that come with SSD's won't be long enough. I used a Silverstone FP55B mount (with the front bay plate taken off) to put 2 SSD's into one of the 5.25 slots instead, and that worked great, but I had to buy the extra mount. 4. If your MB has an 8 pin connection behind the ports on the back/top corner, there is no really nice way to handle the cable management on that. I used to run it behind the motherboard on my Coolermaster HAF 922 with an extension cable, which was a nice solution, but on the 302 there isn't enough room to get an 8 pin cable behind the base plate on this case. Instead I ran it over the back fan, tied to one of the vents on the back near the PCI slots, and it's fine I guess.<br /><br />Still, this is a great case and I do highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think it was a great mommy pron book.  I blew throw it no pun intended. It was a real page turner.  I would stay up all night reading it.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|First, I want to say, I really, really enjoyed this first book. It absolutely stunned me. There are a few mysterious situations after chapter 1 and from then on, you will just be hooked, like I was. I love a good mystery read and this was wonderful. I have not really read any mytseries that take place in the South, but I now have a deep appreciation for them, especially this one. As I was reading, it's like I can hear Rose Gardner's southern accent, and the others that live in Henryetta, Arkansas.<br /><br />The story itself is really intriguing. I always like to have an open mind when I read any story, so I was reading chapter 1, and was, okay, already trying to predict what may happen, but was actually shocked what did, and it was very unpredictable. There are a few mysterious discoveries that are in the story; one involving more about the death of Rose's Mom, and more into Rose's family.... Every chapter, there is definite humor here, and I could not get enough!<br /><br />I loved the characters, including twenty-four year old Rose. She has an infectious personality. I like that this is from her POV, as from her voice, I have a better understanding what she went through as a child to her present time, and I felt for her, as it seems like it was no picnic dealing with her Mother. Also, Rose has some sort of vision that is really intriguing to read about, and adds to her character. I like that she finally stands up for herself, makes decisions without anyone caring, and I really saw her grow up into more of an adult, from a sheltered and strict household. Other characters, including Joe were wonderfully written, and I felt that ok there was going to be a romance between these two, there just has to be, but there's something mysterious about Joe (who happens to live next door to Rose) that has you thinking if he is right for Rose or not. For some reason, I got a Desperate Housewives vibe when I thought about the neighbors, especially Rose living next to Joe situation. Anyways, you just have to read this novel and find out yourself what happens to them! Lastly, I just want to write that this was a creative, and again, wonderfully written story, and I'm so excited to read the next book in Swank's series. This Novel I definitely recommend!

B007TR1R22|5.0|If you love movies that quietly immerse you in a specific time and place, with every nuance possible; and you have suffered from a tragic love affair - this movie will resonate with you in so many ways.<br /><br />Terence Davies deposits his viewers in the still suffering London, about 5 years after the war's end. Hester (Rachel Weisz), a young woman in a sex-less marriage to the older and wealthy Sir William Collyer (Simon Russel Beale); leaves him when she falls desperately in love with former RAF pilot Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston). Freddie is no Sir William; but Hester takes a gamble on him with her life. \\"No dice\\" for Hester.<br /><br />James Merrifield and David Hindle are responsible for the gorgeous set design and soundtrack. Especially moving is the scene with the song \\"You Belong to Me\\" by Jo Stafford, with Freddie and Hester dancing. It evokes the themes so vividly that I was re-living my own tragic love affair 30 years ago.<br /><br />The movie did not have the same impression on my two friends who watched the movie with me; although they found it abundant with many of the qualities that I did.<br /><br />It's one of those films that just becomes a talisman for some people, like myself.

0345803485|1.0|I am an avid reader and apparently believed all the hype about this book.  It was a great reading disappointment.  I guess I expect more from a book.  It appears that a teenager wrote this book with quite waivering and low self- esteem emotions.  My wife had quite a statement to me about it being an \\"insult to self-actualized women.\\"  We won't be purchasing the other two books in this trilogy.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|i luv luv luv this movie i've watched it over and over and never gets old!! Yes there are a few sad parts but also some very happy luving moments too...i think my favorite part was the ending im very big on endings and if the movie doesnt have a very good ending then forget it u lost me i dont like the movie :/ but this movie by far best ending and a happy on at that!! im not gunna lie i appsolutly luv all the Nicholas Sparks movies/books but for me this was my fav! i know i keep repeating myself but i luved it, it was great :)oh i probably should mention the acting was pretty good too ;)
0345803485|1.0|Others have written far better reviews here than I could.  I have nothing against the erotica genre.  I do however, have something against THIS book.<br />Horribly written.  Romanticizes controlling men and codependency to the point that I wish this were banned.  Unfortunately, I fear this is going to be hurtful to women because of this rather than empowering them sexually.<br />The sexual empowerment aspect is arguable anyway, as the main character can't even refer to her vagina as anything other than \\"down there\\".  Give me a break!<br /><br />If this book interests you at all - do yourself a favor and buy just about ANY other erotica book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|looks great on the kindle fire. i have no complaints! the graphics look awesome. should get if looking for a weather app
0545265355|5.0|All of these books were great. Every chapter seems to end in a cliffhanger that makes you want to keep reading.  In order to stop reading, I started stopping mid-chapter, as I was too caught up in what was going on to stop at the chapter's end.

0446572764|5.0|Greatly enjoyed this book.  Insight to a nightmarish society, where nothing is as it seems.  Nice story with abundant twists and turns.  Best read for entertainment, not as a history lesson.  I'm not really interested in any of the sequels right now, but will probably get to them some day. This is a nice weekend read and warmly recommend it.
0316174483|5.0|Our family just got this book and it has already become a favorite.  The projects are easy to complete and it is easy to get good results.  I know that some kids get very upset when they can't recreate drawing projects exactly as pictured in a book.  That is no problem here!  Nothing has to be copied exactly and the projects can act as a springboard to completely independent work.  It's novel fingerprint approach adds to its charm and really draws kids in.  There are so many different types of drawings (animals, landscapes, etc.) that almost everyone should find something that makes them grab a stamp pad and a pen!  I'd recommend this book for all ages four and up.  It's so much fun that parents will enjoy these activities, too!

Stumbled upon it as a recommendation on Facebook from another self-published author and I am SO GLAD I purchased it!<br />As a fan of post-apocalyptical genre, this one is great.  Well-written, well-focused and a treat to find another author to support on Amazon.  I am now going to order all the rest of his books and see what other adventures I can dive into!

030758836X|3.0|This book is manipulative and annoying with unsympathetic characters but it keeps the twists and turns coming like a roller coaster ride.  I actually hate roller coasters but found this book entertaining enough to keep reading to the end.  The police \\"investigation\\" is not at all realistic, and neither is the rest of the novel.  The narrator(s) repeatedly slip in \\"new information\\" which means they've been withholding from the reader until then.  And a small aside - Amy watches TV and notes that all the commercials are for tampons and cleaning products.  Huh??? Maybe in 1960 but not now.  All I see are Viagra and car commercials.  Again, the author was wasn't being honest.  I think it was a clever idea but I didn't find the experience particularly satisfying.

0761169253|5.0|Anybody in a creative field deals daily with challenges in their head how they are going to be successful each and every day. How do I stay current, relevant, and on top of their game? Steal Like An Artist cleared up that confusion for me. Its simple, elegant and pure approach to unlocking my creativity was right before my eyes. Austin's humorous approach to simplifying your creativity and opening it up is priceless. This book should be in everybody's library, and read often.

1612183956|2.0|It was funny. In the Afterward the author says he was inspired to write this book by the Twin Peaks TV show.  By about the half way point I felt the book would actually have made a good TV episode.  Only I think it would have made a good Twilight Zone episode.  The 50s-60s half hour version. It is a good enough story that the right editor could have turned into a riveting 24 minutes of TV. The problem is not the kernel of the story which is interesting but rather the unending chases, escapes, drug injections and beatings the hero has to endure on his way through the tale. Half the book was the hero running, hiding and climbing. It all started to sound the same very quickly. I swear until I posted this I did not see the other Twilight Zone comments by the other reviewers.  Amazing.

B005603236|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie when it first aired on PBS as part of the complete Jane Austen celebration they had back in 2008, it was the movie where I first discovered and became a fan of JJ Feild and Felicity Jones who give great performances as Henry Tilney and Catherine Morland respectively, another standout is Carey Mulligan as the ambitious social climbing flirt Isabella Thorpe. I had however resisted buying the DVD when it was first released because I was aware of the edits it had on certain scenes that were perhaps deemed \\"risque\\" for Jane Austen fare, but in my humble opinion were necessary for the story/visuals, thankfully PBS has released the blu-ray version as uncut, so I didn't have to invest in a region-free DVD player to buy the UK DVD after all. Great Product and Image Quality.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard that this book was bad, but I thought it must have some reason<br />why it's so famous, so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br />To be honest, I couldn't finish it.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of romance novels, I would consider myself a little experienced in that<br />genre. And knowing quite a few really skilled and amazing novelists (who are much less known<br />than that old Lady \\"E.L James\\" who writes like me when I was twelve)- I am more than devastaded and<br />upset to find out, that they wanna turn this into a movie (which is clearly gonna be a porn)....<br />she even gets money for that crap, a lot of money.<br /><br />I'm just glad I had borrowed it from someone and not bought it.<br />This book is nothing but an insult for the entire history of literature.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|i had to keep reading although there is a sameness to it. author creates a little suspense. characters are well drawn but it is a cinderella story for adults. it is salacious reading but titillates, i think, women especially.<br />a romantic fantasy. prince charming has it all. cinderella , on the other hand is not only gifted physically but smart.
B004HY3BTC|3.0|Not having the original cast in the sequel really took away from what made it such a good movie the first time around.  Part 2 was a decent story, but clearly this was an attempt to cash-in on the success of the first one.

B005SCSL56|5.0|Being both a fan of Chris and of fairy tales, this book is a great combination of 2 of my favorite things.  And the icing on the cake is that Chris does the audio book recording himself.  I'm an avid audio book listener, and this is now one of my favorites, rivaling Jim Dale's Harry Potter recordings for the top spot (which I have listened to religiously for over 10 years).<br /><br />The story itself is amazing; fun and filled with adventure.  When I read it the first time, I fell in love.  But after listening to the audio book, it's become an infatuation.  I'm on my 4th listen already, and its only been out since July 17.  It really is THAT amazing.  He brings such life and personality to the characters, giving you more of an insight in exactly who they are and how he imagines them.  His voice(s) add a whole new level to his already incredible story.<br /><br />I recommend this book and audio book to any and everyone.  As the quote from CS Lewis states in the front, someday you will be old enough to read fairy tales again - and no matter what age you are, now is the time to read them again in the Land of Stories.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|There is nothing redeeming about this book. I can't decide whether I should be mad at myself for sticking through until the end (praying something worthwhile would unfold) or mad at the author for writing such tripe. Characters are trashy, there is no plot to speak of, and it feels like a low rent, cliched version of Twilight. Twilight had many things wrong with it, but at least it had some intangible spark that pulled the reader in with ease. I'm pissed that I spent $7.99 on this. I'm sure Gossip Girl or some ABC Family series would provide more drama and intrigue than this story.<br /><br />Disgusted! Not even worth the one star I'm required to select.
B001GS1DS8|1.0|I was trying out a logitech Review settop box and was unable to view this title. it would stop to buffer for 1-3 seconds 2 or more times a minute. That made viewing impossible.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|Dr Horrible's Sing Along Blog is a fantastic piece of entertainment, and a toe tapping good time. The only reason I don't gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, was because I enjoyed Dollhouse, Firefly, Serenity, and The Avengers (all efforts of Joss Whedon) even better, but that doesn't mean that this is anything short of spectacular. You can just watch it online for free, but personally, I enjoyed the commentaries and the behind the scenes footage, which made it a worthy 10 dollars spent. If you're not into bonus features and you have a working internet connection, I'd absolutely recommend checking it out online, otherwise, an excellent addition to your movie collection.

B0081G3MWI|2.0|Most progressive rock/metal bands end up evolving their music into something that is unrecognizable to their first works. The same is true for Baroness. Like Mastodon, their first 2-3 works were raw, repetitive, and a lot of yelling into the microphone. The Red Album (and for Mastodon, Blood Mountain) were the peak performances for both groups. Crack the Skye was a bit of a letdown for Mastodon, but still is overall worth buying. As for Baroness, the Blue Album was not quite as good as Red, but is much better than this one being reviewed. The Yellow and Green album is not metal, and in fact I would not even call it hard rock. It's more a collection of ballads with some semblance of guitar work. As mentioned above, it's not even recognizable as Baroness to their First and Second albums, and probably even the Red Album. I bought it without even sampling the songs. Oh well, I can always sell it back on Amazon...

0553386794|5.0|The first book in the books series A Song of Ice and Fire is the Game of Thrones,<br />by American Author George R. R. Martin. George R. R. Martin published the Game of<br />Thrones on August 6, 1996. The first book of the series has won many awards, including<br />the Locus Award and the Nebula Award. It has also received the World Fantasy Award<br />for best science fiction novel. In January 2011 the Game of Thrones became a New York<br />Times bestseller and reached the number one spot in July 2011. HBO has turned the<br />Game of Thrones into a television series which premiered on April 17, 2011 with huge<br />fan fest. HBO renewed the series for three more seasons. Season two will<br />be centered on book two The Clash of Kings and season three and four will focus on<br />book three and four A Storm of Swords and the Feast of Crows. Martin planned on<br />making this series into a trilogy, but later found that he would not be able to complete the<br />story in three novels. Martin concluded that the series could not be completed in three<br />volumes and decided he would write a total of seven or eight novels.<br />  The story of Game of Thrones takes place on the continents of Westeros,<br />Essos, and the Wall.  There are three main stories in the Game of Thrones who are<br />fighting for control of the Iron Throne after the death of the King Robert. The major<br />houses of Westeros are fighting for control of the Iron throne. The major houses of<br />Westeros are House Baratheon of Dragonstone, House Baratheon of Storm's End, House<br />Greyjoy, House Targaryen, and House Stark. The best interaction between the major<br />houses came between House Stark and House Lanister where Cersil Lanister was<br />mocking Edward Stark before his death, \\"When you play the game of thrones, you win or<br />you die. There is no middle ground.\\" The book has many elements throughout the book<br />such as violence, sex, political deception, and supernatural beings called the Others.<br />There is something in this book for everyone. It is a science fiction book, but that is not<br />the overwhelming theme of this book.<br />  As the Game of thrones follows three major story plots throughout the book, the<br />chapters are centered on eight different points of view of each house. The chapters are<br />written using this third person point of view, which makes the story flow. During each<br />chapters the readers are introduced to other major characters who will have big influences<br />on the main characters in their daily lives. What makes the book interesting is the<br />interaction of the characters and the interesting and unique story being told of their lives.<br />The gambit of emotions the reader will believe while reading the \\"Game of Thrones\\" will<br />make the reader eager to keep reading to discover what happens to the characters.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />  The book A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin is a fantasy novel based on<br />the battle for the Iron Throne. The book is very graphic from the fight scenes to the sex<br />scenes throughout the novel. This book is not recommended for anyone under the age of<br />18. The book was very enjoyable to read and the way the author has written the chapter<br />based on individual characters it made the reader want to discover what happens next.<br />After reading the first book of the series the next couple of books will bring more intrigue<br />to the characters and more science fiction elements into play.

030758836X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Flynn manages to convey real-world problems between spouses in a suspense setting, and maintains a delicate balance between the two. This book was different than many suspense novels; the characters were well crafted, but flawed. They were easy to relate to in some places and downright despicable in others, a balance Flynn struck beautifully. It is easy to make a \\"good guy\\" and a \\"bad guy,\\" but Flynn blurs these lines without leaving the reader apathetic about the outcome. It was refreshing to read such honest characters, even when the honesty was jarring.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|so you're given unlimited space to upload all your music, they give you time to create a bunch of playlists then out of nowhere decide to charge you a sub fee or else they scrub most if it off of their servers. I guess all the music I continually and exclusively buy from their site isn't enough? its a shame too since I really enjoyed many features and ease of use of the program. oh well, be prepared to lose a lot of business I suppose.
0439023521|5.0|Katniss is a young lady who is the sole caretaker of her family. She lives with her younger sister, Prim, and her Mother. They live in Panem, which is ruled by the Capital. They live in District 12 where they make coal. Katniss and her best friend, Gale, go hunting outside of the district on a regular basis to feed their families and to trade for other goods.<br /><br />Every year the Capital reminds the districts that they are in control by conducting the Hunger Games. Every child between the ages of 12 and 18 must put their name into a bowl at least once; they can put their name in more often for additional rations of food. The Capital picks one boy and one girl from each district to compete in the games. The games are televised and everyone in Panem is required to watch. The 24 children are placed in an arena and are forced to fight to the death until only one remains.<br /><br />When the names are called for District 12, Prim's name is called. Katniss cannot allow her to go, so she volunteers. A boy named Peeta, who Katniss has always been grateful to because he gave her bread at a time she didn't think she would live, is also called for the games.<br /><br />Peeta plays the audience by telling them that he has had an unrequited love for Katniss for as long as he remembers. The games begin and the excitement mounts. Katniss finds herself thinking of both Gale and Peeta and a possible love triangle ensues. With only one winner, there is no way that Peeta and Katniss can both come out alive, or is there?<br /><br />This is the first book of a trilogy. Initially I read this book only to see what all the hype was about, as I don't typically read fantasy books. This was a pleasant surprise. The tale starts with love of a young girl for her sister that is strong enough for her to give her own life. The whirlwind of the days before the games, then the action during the games, add a touch of romance (for the ladies), and it makes for a great read! I highly recommend this book and will definitely be reading the next two in the series.s book and will definitely be reading the next two in the series.

B0079TQHDO|3.0|I really liked the first book and couldnt wait for the sequel. While I enjoyed this book, it wasnt to the same standard as the first in the series. I will read any other sequels but hope that the story improves back to the authors usual high standard of having you hang on every word.

B007H9B8FS|5.0|I have been a Garbage fan since 1996, and my love for them has grown ever since. They are easily my favorite band, and their new album kicks serious butt. I lost track of them when they when on hiatus, then I stumbled upon NYKOP at Best Buy in early June. I couldn't wait to hear what Garbage sounded like in 2012, and I was blown away! I have not stopped listening to this deluxe cd since! Every song rocks, and I will eventually buy the Japanese version with the bonus track \\"Love Like Suicide.\\" Fans of the band should check out some great live performances on Youtube, as well as the video for \\"Blood For Poppies\\" and the band performing \\"Automatic Sytematic Habit\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Their song \\"Control\\" is even being used to promote the new Spiderman video game! Shirley sounds better than ever and the guys really tear it up in the studio with that over the top production that we all know and love. From start to finish this album is like an audio rollercoaster ride that overloads your senses! An absolute adrenaline rush! NYKOP has gotten rave reviews all Summer long and they are selling out concerts around the world. I really wish they would come to Ohio or PA, hopefully next year maybe? For more about the band check out Garbage.com and see some really cool interviews with Shirley and the guys. And all Garbage fans please help to spread the word on one of the most original, talented, and underrated bands of all time.

1609611543|5.0|My husband was diagnosed with Celiac 20 years ago, so I am very familiar with the disease and the gluten free diet. I went gluten free about 2 months ago to see if it would help my Shogren's. Since finishing the book (read it in 2 days - a record for me) I am more motivated than ever to stay wheat and gluten free. I found the book to be easy to read, even for a non-medical person. I've tried a few of the recipes and they are great - can't wait for the cookbook. The great thing about the eating plan is that the emphasis is on whole foods that everyone can get at the supermarket, not on the expensive (and starchy) gluten free prepared foods. I'm slim but alarmed at the wheat bellies and man boobs on my friends, so I've already sold a few copies for Dr. Davis. I just hope they will try it. Most people believe the \\"Healthy Whole Grains\\" government-promoted BS, so it will be a real challenge.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AND IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THIS EARTH AND HOW IT IS BEING CONTAMINATED BY STUFF THAT WE DON'T NEED. AND HOW VULNERABLE WE ARE AND IGNORANT TO BUY INTO IT. EVER SINCE WATCHING THIS MOVIE I FEEL LIKE IT IS MY DUTY TO RECYCLE AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY I KNOW AT LEAST GIVES IT A TRY, IT COULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WELL WORTH BUYING AT A STORE TO KEEP PERMANENT AND SHARE IT WITH YOU FRIENDS.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Firstly, do not think too much about the logic of these movies. This like so many alien invasion stories just will not stand up to it. All an space flying alien need do is go to asteroid belt and throw stones at us. There is nothing we could do about it.<br /><br />As an enjoyable movie though it is good. Alien fleet lands in the ocean and gets into a battle with the navy. The navy ends out using an old museum battleship, using some of the original crew. Some how this ship is still armed and can go. At this stage I was thinking this plot is just getting too unbelievable. Then the ship did some turns that I doubt any ship could do.<br /><br />Still overall I found it to be a good action movie.<br /><br />The acting was good. The characters were interesting.<br /><br />The filming was good as were the special effects.

Geeat job, great product, and great price. Thanks... a lot!
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I just think this is one of the cutest interesting movies I've seen in a long time.  My children, ages 3 1/2 and 20 months, love this movie.  We just rented the sequel, The Gruffalo's Child, and they love that one, too.  One reason I enjoy it so much is that we've played it probably 60-100 times now here and there and it's still not annoying to me.  Most of the kids movies eventually drive me crazy after a few times of seeing / hearing it in the background, but this one is by far, one of my favorites.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book, but I went to a book store and the book was $4.99,but that place is expensive,so I went to Wal-Mart and it was less than $4...like its a rip off especially when it's on the kindle. I give it a 4 out of five..but the book&storyline a 5 out of 5
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is very badly written. It is soft porn but not even good at that. People who enjoy it must never have read a good well written book. It is not the content that annoys me but that it is so sexist and unbelievable.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Lauren Oliver has a wonderful way with words. Her characters in Delirium were deep and well developed and I enjoyed watching them, particularly Lena, grow and learn and change. She creates a deep and fascinating world that looks at how different people would be without love. I also really enjoyed how she pulls you into her story by using beautiful, lyrical prose.<br /><br />One of the things I really liked about this book was that it had an interesting way of combining religion and science and portraying elements from both of these to explain why the people in this story think the way they think. Oliver took parts of religion and science and showed how people in this society twisted them in order to believe that love was a disease. She does it so well that you can really understand why they believe this.<br /><br />Oliver did a wonderful job of scene building and providing examples to explain the world she created. She makes it believable that it could exist, that it could be the world we live in some day. Part of what helped me believe in this world was the quotes at the beginning of the chapters and little phrases that Oliver created. They added a lot to the story and I greatly enjoyed them.<br /><br />I also loved how Oliver not only looked at romantic love but love between parents and their children and love between friends, and how these relationships change and even fall apart without love.<br /><br />The main character, Lena, goes on a journey of discovery in Delirium. She has to grow as a person to be able to see through to the truth. I enjoyed reading about her journey which started with her fully believing in the ways of her society and government. She accepted that people were cured of love when they turned 18 and the fact that your spouse was essentially chosen for you, she even appreciated these things. Then she started to learn about things that she never knew existed. She started to open her eyes up to all the things she was never supposed to know about. Watching her discover things like music, and love were wonderful and I believed every one of her reactions.<br /><br />All of the characters in this story were well written. I loved Alex and his relationship with Lena. I loved the way they grew together and that he had a reason for being drawn to her. Alex and Lena truly fell in love, this is not a `we love each other for no reason' kind of story and I really appreciated that. I also loved Hana. At first I thought she was going to be somewhat stereotypical of a character, she's beautiful and popular and perfect, but there was so much more to Hana.<br /><br />Every part of this book was well done and I look forward to reading more of this series and more from Lauren Oliver.ut.

B006YZOXHQ|1.0|I first saw this film as a teenager and thought is was the raunchiest I had ever seen. I had obviously embellished the film in my head since seeing it but on watching it as a much older guy, I find it rather an embarrassment. I am quite sure that Jane Fonda feels much the same way.
0451232577|5.0|I have read many Follett books and he just gets better.  If you enjoy well researched and historical reading you will love this book.

I may reread Fall of Giants just for a refresher.  They are thick books, but the read is a breeze! Enjoy!

B000FC10MU|2.0|I loved the premise of this book, it was creative and had so much potential.  The writing style was fun to read and delicately playful.  The characters were neat.  However, the plot dragged... and dragged and culminated into nothing....I was very disappointed because at the end of the day if the book doesn't tell a good story, well then it just ends up being a boring and horrendous waste of time.
B000N2HCM4|2.0|As I have said before all biography is a form of advocacy and this book is<br />no exception.<br /><br />For some Reason I didn't like the narrative structure that Obama choose to<br />us in telling his story. Because of the style I didn't find myself able to<br />emotionally connect with his story and It lowered my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />That being said I still Think that people should read this book because the<br />first step in figuring out what a person is like(i,e. vetting) is to read what<br />they say about themselves. Not enough people did that In 2008 and they have a<br />chance to do so now before the next presidential election of 2012.

B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I rate this and Alien as the two best sci-fi flicks of all time.  Both will keep the you gripping the armrests.  An android is sent back in time to kill the boy who will grow up to lead the resistance--before he can grow up and become a threat.  And the android is practically indestructible. Great use of the change-the-future-by-by-changing-the-past concept, and it comes with lots of excitement and action.  Absolutely, positively one of the best sci-fi flicks ever.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|The character development in this series is outstanding. The characters show their flaws, but also their redeeming qualities. Can't wait for season 3!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I can't believe how silly these birds are. How addicting this can get,too. But it's all a level of skill & logic-really fun to play.
B00782O7IY|4.0|Loved \\"The Artist\\" in the theater -- saw it once, then took the family --  but if any movie called out for a DVD commentary or extras it was this one.  Stunned that there is nothing, no background of the players, no chat by the art director or award winning composer, no image of the sources that were given homage, no extra pictures of (sigh) Berenice Bejo, no 1920's style short adventure of the hero dog a la Roger Rabbit, blah blah blah.<br />----------------------------<br />update of sorts: I saw a copy in my library that did indeed have a commentary track. At home I exposed my disk to tough questioning but still no extras.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The Potter movies and books are one of my very favorites.  I do watch them repeatedly.  I would recommend them to anyone.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is a great game to play with family or friends or random users... although some random users give you the words instead of drawing....
0812993292|3.0|I loved Pettigrew and was very hopeful when this book was compared to that one.  While this book is about an old English gentleman, there are not the intercultural parts that made Pettigrew so interesting and different.  It has a storyline but is just not as good in either the plot or the character development.<br /><br />Basically this is a story about an older couple who have grown apart over the years.  Harold's decision to walk across England without preparation or the proper clothing is the result of his alienation from his life and his determination to do something different.  It does result in some changes and seems to have renewed his marriage.<br /><br />But the story was a bit tedious in parts and was just not as interesting as I had hoped.  It is readable and suitable for men, women and teens, but it just was not the sort of book you stay up late to read more of.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Coming off my second read of the Hunger Games trilogy, it has been difficult to find a book that captured my interest.  Fifty Shades was a complete let down based on the hype, so I actually walked into this series with skepticism.  These books were wonderful.  The characters are well established and there is heart and truth in their stories.  I thank Colleen Hoover for giving me something good to read (and even a new curse word to use).  I butterflyingly love this series!
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Loved the story line as it continues from the original but with a little mystery to make me stay at the edge of my seat.
B0012EGERG|1.0|I don't know why I payed ten dollars for this album. Maybe five dollars would have been justifiable? There are very few decent tracks on the entire cd and almost all of them are just slight variations of each other. Half of the songs feel like my ears are being raped.
B0085G0DH6|5.0|Way back in 1973, while in my junior year as a music student at The University Of North Carolina, Greensboro, I wandered into Discount Records, a long defuncked record store chain to browse. They had on the speakers, Jarretts American quartet playing Death And The Flower. I had never heard of Keith Jarrett before. So moved was I, decided to by it, but they were sold out. I \\"settled \\" on a copy of Belonging, the first with his European quartet and it changed my musical life forever. I own every note Jarrett has every recorded and have seen him live in solo and trio numerouse times and consider myself one of his greatest musical admirers. When I heard that this release was to happen, I pre ordered it on Amazon and it came today. I spent the entire afternoon listening. I will not bother with a review. Just hear this album. Your soul will be renewed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the concept is great, play games to unlock more games. but the amount of points each game costs to unlock seems too high. I guess that's where they make their microtransaction money.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|At first it is a bit confusing, but as I got the hang of all the little tricks I soon became a pro at this editor. Now I love it and wouldn't want a different one :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have read all three novels by Gillian Flynn, and they are all wonderful. Gone Girl, however, is an outstanding book, with exceptional plot and characters. It was one of those books I couldn't stop reading once I started. The twists and turns of suspense kept me wondering to the end what was going to happen. My husband rarely reads, and even he was enthralled. Gillian is one of the greatest authors today in this genre, and I look forward to what she will write next. This book is highly recommended!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this helps me so much when I need to how much battery I have nd if your looking for another app like this you will never find it

B00005LC1H|5.0|My wife and I watch Fawlty Towers on Saturday nights as a relief from the negative media barrage.  The episodes have never let us down, and we hee-haw all evening.  We love to watch them over and over.  Great movies, those British sit-coms.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This show is so so so good. It was sad when it went off air, but now I own all of them in this box set. The box set itself has really cool packaging. Worth every penny!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  There were twists and turn and surprises throughout the book. Things I didn't see coming. It was really well thought out and a lot of detail, planning, and smarts went into this book.  It kept my attention through the whole book and I honestly did not know what was going to happen.
0062124293|5.0|I have to admit, I have no problem admitting that I'm a feminist. I have a grad degree in women's studies. It's a no brainer.<br /><br />Initially I did not find myself drawn into the book but oh man, I wanted to hang out at a pub with Caitlin by the end of the book.<br /><br />She takes a serious topic and humanize, no, womanizes it. She puts it in tangible terms with a delightfully twisted sense of humor. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions AND nodding my head in agreement.<br /><br />There were a few moments where I squirmed but respectfully so. We each come from a different worldview and Caitlin's is certainly unique. But the bottom line is: she makes you think and hopefully makes you answer the question: Am I a feminist? with Well, yes, yes I proudly am.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Was out before netflix, and cheaper then Itunes without waiting for a download. We were able to just buy it and go. As for the show kit was the best season so far, and can't wait until next season. Season 5 next month!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Again, a stunner. I just couldn't put it down and the ending leaves you hanging and craving more. Gives you an wonderful escape from the everyday. Just great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in two days!  I could not get my nose out of it and couldn't wait to turn the page..EVERYTIME! I highly suggest you get this book.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game is not worth playing! One of Teamlava's worst creations! They have better games....save your time on this one!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. My husband and I are hooked on it. Plus our 2 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb so he likes to try and play as well. Great game! Can't wait for more levels to be added in the future.
B000B8QF00|5.0|A Great variety of songs for a great price! My wife loves this! Every song is good. Good for listening out loud.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is what it is &amp; it's fine. The options are nice - especially the &quot;tap-the-card-to-move-it&quot; one. The pop-ups haven't bothered me.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Best note and calendar app in the store. I've used and deleted them all from my Kindle Fire except this one. Works great never a problem, user friendly and looks good. Clean smooth interface and good options. Must have for the Fire!!!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this is just like bakery story but the coin currency is much less and the food takes longer to cook for less coins
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It took me 2 days to read it (normally I would need half the time but other responsibilities did not alow me to). It's very easy to read, language is simple, no fancy words, or phrases (just like my review). If you want to read something like that, well  you have found it :) I just don't know why it is so popular because to me it is just like any other cheap romance with a lot of sex scenes...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the battery looks cool and tells you how much time you have left for different catergories of use. it's brilliant!
0439023513|1.0|After reading the greatly written Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I couldn't wait to read this book.  The final book of a series is often not as good, but the low quality of this book makes you wonder if the author wrote it in a week.  While the Hunger Games and Catching Fire made you feel that you were in the story with Katniss and Peeta, Mockingjay read like a bad book report.  I kept on waiting for the book to get better and it never did.  It is very boring and the writing so rushed that it felt like someone was telling you what happened like a poorly written high school story.  Shame on you Scholastic for printing this book as it is.  Shame on you Suzanne Collins for printing such a poor book after showing your greatness in the first two books of the series.  I guess Suzanne Collins and Scholastic that you really were just in it for the money.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Functions like it does on my phone. Haven't bothered with the maps portion but the rest works fine. Of the weather apps on my phone,  this one was the closest to my actual weather for some reason. So onto the Kindle it went.
1468161660|5.0|I have to be completely honest here. If it hadn't have been for all the MADLY raving reviews, I may never have picked up this book. And what a SHAME that would have been.<br /><br />It's just that I didn't have a CLUE what slamming was, and so I wasn't sure that I could really relate to this story. So, if you have this concern AT ALL, please let me assure you that this isn't a problem in. The. Least.<br /><br />Every once in a while I stumble upon a book that is original, compelling, interesting, and entertaining. A book that tells an absolutely beautiful romance story, but also has a great depth to it. A book that leaves me feeling like the last few days of reading weren't a collossal waste of my time, when I finish it. Slammed was all of that and more.<br /><br />I know that mature-for-their-age, late-teens and early-twenty-somethings are not at all common in real-life. In fact, I could go on and on about how I feel we enable today's \\"older\\" youth. (But I won't, so relax :) However, when an author writes a story, they aren't writing about \\"normal\\" circumstances. Because, let's face it, that'd be boring. Instead, an author writes about a unique set of circumstances, while incorporating aspects that the reader can relate to.<br /><br />Which is why I can get on board with Lake and Will. Will is twenty-one and as much of an adult as I am. And while Lake takes a little longer to get there, it DOES happen. Which makes the story that much more amazing, because I always want to see a character grow into someone better by the end of the story.<br /><br />While there is all this maturity, character growth, and enough heartache to make me weep, there's also that beautiful telling of a romance, that I wrote of before. From the moment Lake and Will meet there is a spark. A connection. And I wasn't exactly sure where it was going to go, where Ms. Hoover was going to take them.<br /><br />Let me tell you the ride is bumpy. From start to finish I was rooting for these two. Even after life just kept trying to tear them apart.<br /><br />With all of these AMAZING story-elements, I must say that I TRULY enjoyed the familial side to the story, as well. From Lake's relationship with her mom and brother, to Will's relationship with HIS brother, there was never any question as to what this story was about. Love of ALL kinds.<br /><br />I loved it so much that I read Point of Retreat the very. Next. Day.after life just kept trying to tear them apart.<br /><br />With all of these AMAZING story-elements, I must say that I TRULY enjoyed the familial side to the story, as well.

B00632HWOG|4.0|I don't like this as well as actually using Yahoo! mail with a computer,  but I feel that for mobile access and an app to boot,  it's pretty complete. Some things are annoying,  like deleting things, but I guess it's tolerable.
0446547646|5.0|I'm in love with anything Nicholas Sparks and this book made me cry. It's so well written and very engaging. I couldn't stand putting it down. I'd always be like \\"Ok, I'll read until the next chapter.\\" Then read like five more chapters before I could make myself put it down. Such an amazing book by an incredible author. You won't regret reading this book!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I have this app on my phone and it was the first app I downloaded when I received my Kindle Fire. I know there's a way to &quot;root&quot; the Fire without actually rooting it or whatever and then I could have the widget feature like on my phone, but I don't really want to do that. Other than not having my stickies on my screen, the app is great! I'm glad it was included in the app store.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app so much because of the awesome fetures. It also has really cool animals from the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. Feels like a spatial workout on some of the more difficult levels. Some of the puzzles require creative thinking in order to complete. Definitely recommend. Especially with the all the extras included in the free version.
B008B1W3V4|5.0|I love this Albulm. Maroon 5 is awesome! Would definitely recommend CD to my friends and family. Worth the download.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a awesome game I spend every minute I possibly can playing it that's how good the game you just have to get  lots of points
B007L3BMGA|5.0|great book for those of us looking for a mind getaway from routine of married life, work, children, etc. I m usually a deep writer reader (Ayn Rand kind of) but this book just had me from day one. Read it in 3 days and can´t wait to read the next one. Totally recommended!
B007HNFREW|2.0|Come with a story and not with the gory!!  Can this be what people are craving? Ridiculous .<br />Over the top gore, if you like that thing get it.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I listen to this album all the time. Every song is good and each song is different enough, that you don't feel like you're hearing the same song over and over again. This is a great album to rock out to in your car or throw on with your headphones at work.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|Meryl Streep is as good as ever and has the accent and mannerisms spot on.  Unfortunately,the movie is more boring than watching grass grow.  But I don't think it is the script or the directing-the life story told is just not interesting.
B007SAKSF2|5.0|I bought this set after only owning a couple of Blur albums. I have always been interested in Blur, but never got the chance to explore their whole discography (until now). Onto my review:<br /><br />The packaging is good (not great). The CDs are housed in very nice looking cube in which the front end of the top lifts open. The book, 7\\" single, and download card are in the very back of the box. The CDs slide into individual slots. At first this looks awesome, until you unwrap all of the CDs. Once you free the CDs from their very tight shrink-wrap, you can then take the discs out and open the gatefold. The CD cases are the digipak (no tray)/cardboard sleeve types, in which you have to slide the discs out. You could potentially scratch your discs this way, but if you are careful it shouldn't be a problem. The problem with the CD cases, however, are the gatefolds. They do not stay closed all of the way. If you lay them down on the table, one end will always be slightly open. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, but since you have to slide them into these little slots, it does become an issue. To insert them into the slots, you have to hold the case together relatively tight (to prevent the gatefold from opening) so they will fit in all of the way. Not really a big deal, but whatever.<br /><br />Onto the content of the discs. All of Blur's studio albums are here in 2-disc special editions: Disc 1: Original album; Disc 2: B-sides/bonus tracks. It should be noted that only the first five albums have been remastered. I compared the original Parklife to the remastered one. The remaster is slightly louder (volume wise) and the low end is clearer. None of the remasters are victims of the loudness war. I don't think the remasters will trounce your original copies, so if you get this set, don't get it for the remasters. I am willing to say that these are the definitive editions of the studio albums.<br /><br />Now, the rarities discs. You get four rarities discs spanning theirentire career. I wasn't really intrigued by discs one and two, but three and four were amusing, I guess. It was interesting to hear early versions and demos of some my favorite songs of theirs. The rarities discs were a nice addition to this set, but I wasn't blown away by any of them. I was very happy to see that Fool's Day and Under The Westway were included.<br /><br />The DVDs include two live shows and a video rarities disc. The live shows are nice to have. Showtime was only released on PAL on VHS, and the Wembley concert was previously unreleased. The quality isn't great, but it's great to have two more live Blur shows. The rarities disc is a bit different. It includes \\"13\\" live and other promo videos. This disc almost seems like a companion to the \\"Blur: The Best Of\\" DVD. If you own \\"Blur: The Best Of\\" DVD, you will now have all of their music videos if you buy this set.<br /><br />Also included is a book. This very nice hardcover book contains an interview and many high quality pictures. It was nice to read the interviews that corresponded with each album. The 7\\" single is worthless, sadly. I didn't feel like busting out my record player just to listen to this, but I listened to it online, and it isn't very good. It is terrible quality. Two things baffle me about this: One, why would they put a vinyl single in the CD box, but not in the vinyl box? Two, why isn't this track (Superman) on the rarities disc?<br /><br />You also get a download card to download all of the CD (not DVD) content onto your computer with some bonuses such as archive footage and every issue of Blurb magazine. As other reviews have stated, this is set is missing some previously released content. I'm not going to go into detail, like other reviews have, but I will say I was slightly disappointed when I realized \\"Colours\\" wasn't on this set.<br /><br />In conclusion, I really enjoy this set. It is excellent to have all of Blur's albums in one place along with some worthwhile extras. The price may seem big, but come on, you get 21 one discs, 6 which include previously unreleased content. As I stated earlier, if you buy this set, don't buy it for the remastered albums if you own the originals. It is up to you to decide if you want to buy the whole set for the rarities discs, DVDs, and the book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun app and I play it almost every day. it is a really good way to waste time when your bored. but remember it starts with 10 games and it takes a while to get every game but that's the fun. get this app!
0345803485|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  I finished all three already, and have actually purchased another set for someone.  You need to have an open mind when reading this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it is awesome I always play when I'm bored I even play it in the middle if the night
0061122416|1.0|Imagine Joel Osteen trying to be Hermann Hesse, and you will have a fairly good concept of this novel.<br /><br />Whatever in this book is not sanctimonious platitude is simplistic parable.  Read Siddhartha instead - Hesse understood suffering, as opposed to Coelho, who denies its existence:<br /><br />\\"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,\\" the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.  \\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.\\"<br /><br />That this gibberish is presented with an error of tenses - it should read \\"...has ever suffered when it [has gone]...\\" just sums it all up.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so fun I love this game I love the sloths. chasing you I am so amazed by this game
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Whilst Fifty Shades of Grey is receiving huge publicity and making record sales it is one of the worst books I have ever read. Forget the titillation, that does not worry me, its poorly constructed, the story has no flow, it lacks credibility all in all I could never recommend it to anyone else, I will certainly not be reading the rest of the series. This book is not literature its rubbish.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I love Angry Birds, but lately every time it updates I lose all my progress! I was halfway through with all 3-star scores, and now I don't even want to restart because I'll just lose it again.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Making Mirrors needs more radio air play. I bought the CD for \\"Somebody that I used to Know\\", but all the songs are great.<br />It's a refreshing sound that I like more each time I listen to it.
034580404X|5.0|So glad I purchased! Very intriguing and easy to follow. There's not a whole lot to say other than its a guilty pleasure. Great series and great transaction. Thank you!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|enjoyed playing this game. I put it down and came right back to it. highly recommend it for download by all people.
1419703692|5.0|Amazing book, well designed and very insightful. The different view points from the various production heads is fascinating, and the whole effort comes off as very personal. Must buy for the fan!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game is ok but it gets REALLY boring. i thought it was fun the first couple of times. i dont mind it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Combining the mystery and intrigue of LOST with the dynamic and storytelling the new Battelstar Galactica, the WOOL Omnibus is something not to be missed. This is one of the best Sci-fi works that I have read, even up there, and dare I say better, than the brilliant Enders Game by Orson Scott Card. From the first pages I was enthralled to Know more about the characters, each of them well written with their own distinct personalities, and how they would all fare in this mysterious Silo. The writing brought me into their world capturing the feeling of being down there with the people of the Silo. Having now completed the Omnibus I have started on book 6 of the Wool series, The First Shift, which so far is Just as good! My first thoughts after completing the Omnibus were what an excellent Movie / TV series this would make.. and then I came across a post on Hugh Howeys' website, (Just google WOOL The Movie) If his initial ideas are anything to go by, and ensuring he has final say, WOOL on the big or small screen would be amazing.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I was shocked to hear a reviewer say they watched this movie several times, out of respect mind you.  This is a really sad movie that brought mean to tears and anger.  I wanted to protect this guy from the abuse he went through in this film.  I couldn't and will never watch it again though I'm glad I watched it once.  I spoke to a girl at work and asked her if she ever saw the movie, she gave me a look with her mouth hanging slightly open and said &#34;It was so sad...I don't want to even talk about it&#34;.  What I'm really interested in is the opinion of the actors in the film who acted like heartless bullies because they did it so well.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Terrible. Absolutely terrible. The 4 and 5 star ratings here are shocking, but I assume you are rabid Stephen King fans who were re-living the book as you watched the movie. I didn't read the book, so the movie had to stand on its own. This is no reflection on Stephen King because his books are so much deeper and more complicated than can be portrayed in a movie, nevertheless, this is still terrible.<br /><br />Yes this movie is \\"old\\", but that's no excuse for this. The characters were weird, the acting was bland, and the ending was laughable. I only watched the end because I had so much time invested in it. No doubt the book was exponentially better than this movie. How couldn't it be? I have read enough of his books to know that his supernatural horror books have rarely translated well into movies (with a few exceptions). Misery, for example, was a great movie, but it was a thriller, not a horror movie.<br /><br />My recommendation is to skip the movie and read the book; or spend 3 hours cleaning your gutters, it'll be much more satisfying.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this to protect my investment and it hasn't disappointed. It fits perfectly and leaves adequate opening for the on/off switch and USB charging port. The edges can dig into your hand a little bit but it took no time at all for me to get used to holding my Kindle in a way that this was not a problem.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|Far better than Omen, but still hardcore, growly and thrashy grungy metal slogging along and grinding your face in the dirt in the best possible way.  Arguably one of Max's best works.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a wonderful book! If you're a prude obviously this book isn't for you lol I'm on book 3 now and really wish more would be written!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is one of the best concert videos I've ever seen! Phenomenal guitar work, harmonies with Graham Nash and David Crosby and keyboard and vocals by the late, great Richard Wright of Pink Floyd fame. I can't remember how many times I've watched this and can never turn it off until it's through!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|So my husbands work sponsors marriage retreats now and then and they USE this book for almost all of them, and i was having a hard time understand why he had been acting so negatively lately, which caused me to be a HUGE B*&!H, and we just kept going in circles. Well i read the book and LOVED it, the 1st 2 chapters are more of an introduction but the rest of the book is GREAT, so great in fact we downloaded the audio version(Mens Edition), so we could hear it and sit together to listen to it.  He may have save our marriage who knows if that rotten circle continued how many more years we would have really been married with out it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Mockingjay is by far the worst book in The Hunger Game series, however for fans of the first two books it is a must read in order to get a sense of resolution and closure for the characters and story lines. To a certain extent, it seems as though Suzanne Collins gave up in writing this book. The focus seems to have become almost entirely political and action sequences and character development that were present and enjoyable in the first two books seem to be left to the wayside in this one. While it would seem superfluous to describe a book where issue one of the series focuses on children being forced to murder each other as \\"dark,\\" there seems to be quite a lack of silver lining moments in Mockingjay.<br /><br />On the plus side, we do see solid, if a bit rushed, resolutions for the characters that we have come to love and hate over the first two books, as well as an answer to who has Katniss's heart.
B005M0X078|5.0|I knew that I shouldn't have rented this....I should have bought it!!! And even though I just saw it last night, I will indeed purchase it today.<br /><br />If you have seen the live show, you may think before viewing this that a DVD could not possibly do justice to something that so captured your heart live on Broadway (or wherever you saw it live). I had the same thought too. I have seen the live show with several different companies on Broadway going all the way back to 1990, and every time I saw the show it affected me unlike any live performance that I have seen to date. From the spectacular stage design, to the talented performers, to the pure emotion emanated from every song, the show took me in, pulled on every heart string and left me dying for more. Now with this DVD I can attest that any preconceived notion that I had about it not living up to the live performance has evaporated.<br /><br />Clearly some of my enchantment with the DVD is because I have seen the show live. The bar is set very high for what I expected out of the performances of the actors/actresses, and what I expected from the sound quality and filming direction. And all of my expectations were exceeded!<br /><br />The performances are unforgettable in this DVD. Any actor/actress looking to play the respective roles of The Phantom and Christine Daa&eacute; has to fill the shoes of original cast members Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (and the scores of talent that succeeded them). After all, you can have all of the elements in place to put on a Broadway show, but if you don't have the talent that makes you believe and puts everything that they have into their performance...it just won't work. The performances on this DVD have it all. Most importantly, Sierra Boggess in the role of Christine is outstanding...amazing...beautiful...and unforgettable. And lesser known Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Hadley Fraser as Raoul could have won the lead roles back in 1986. The performances are just phenomenal and the entire cast shines; everyone stands out in their own roles.<br /><br />When seeing a live show the booming sound of the live orchestra behind the performers contributes heavily to a memorable experience. The sound on this DVD is perfected and presented in DTS Surround where if you have a home theater that plays in 5.1 or better and crank up the volume...well, you will think that you are literally at the live show.<br /><br />And finally, as far as the film direction for this performance...the camera was right where you would want it to be at every moment. Long, perfect angles for each shot with no inappropriate jumping around. The camera moved as if it were your own eyes moving to where they would move if you were in one of the first few rows of the show.<br /><br />As somewhat of a bonus, at the end of the show after the cast takes their bows, Andrew Lloyd Webber comes out for a bow too, and thanks everyone involved in the production going back to the beginning. The highlight being when he brings out Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. Webber says that Brightman has agreed to sing, and she proceeds to perform Phantom of the Opera with several of the past Phantoms....except for Crawford! Word is that Crawford didn't sing because he had just finished performing in a matinee of The Wizard of Oz at the London Palladium...Um...so?!? If there was a disappointment on this DVD, that was the only one.<br /><br />So do not make the same mistake that I did with viewing this DVD. I rented it. Don't rent it....Buy it! I am adding it to my Cart now.enomenal and the entire cast shines; everyone stands out in their own roles.<br /><br />When seeing a live show the booming sound of the live orchestra behind the performers contributes heavily to a memorable experience.

B006DZYM0A|2.0|Was the movie thought provoking?  Yes.  Were there good actors?  Yes.  But this film studio should have hired a better editor ... or an editor at all.  Apparently, this was such a work of love from the film maker, he couldn't stand to cut a minute of what he considered a masterpiece.  Two an a half hours?  It could have been an hour and made its point!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm usually not a fan of mysteries, but I had heard so many good things about this book that I decided to give it a try.  I won't go over what the book is about since other reviewers have done this, but I have to say that I was hooked from the first two chapters.  Aside from how wonderfully written this book is, the plot kept me on pins and needles.<br /><br />The ending --- even now, weeks later, I'm still unsure what I feel about it.  It was strange -- as I had told another person, it left me a bit disturbed.  I do wish the author had found another way to end what was a very good story.
0790729350|4.0|...this will kindle fond memories... or nightmares, depending upon your experience.<br /><br />For the rest of you, it gives you a glimpse into the whole blended music and peace movement, everyone wants a better world and music will help make that happen ethos of the time.<br /><br />This version is not the 40th anniversary version. It is the director's cut. It is my understanding that the 40th anniversary edition will include \\"revisionism\\" that I find unacceptable.<br /><br />I can't vouch, but I have heard that musicians are coming back and re recording parts to make them more \\"perfect\\", correcting mistakes and stuff. For example, I've heard that Santana supposedly is going to correct some bits that didn't come off right.<br /><br />Folks, a concert is not a recording. It will not be perfect. Some of the best concerts I have ever been to have had mistakes sprinkled throughout. They did not detract from the performance.<br /><br />Going in and screwing with a historic documentation of a historic event is sacriledge. Yes, I said it. We lose the essence of the event, we lose the substance, the immediacy of the time, the day, the moment. A lot of people were angry with George Lucas for messing with his films, which were actually just fine as they were.<br /><br />So, what... Are we going to go into the document \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and remove the violence and murder that took place that day at Altamont? That concert, by contrast with Woodstock, was the polar oppposite, a horrible experience. But we need to see the dark underbelly of the movement we older folks often romanticize. It wasn't as great as we remember. One should never alter historic documents because they make you uncomfortable.<br /><br />While the director's cut contains a bit more music and such, I think it is definitive as you can expect. And you just should never \\"change\\" history because you didn't like how it \\"turned out\\", how it \\"sounded\\". History is not clean and neat, it is often messy and tangled and fraught with errors.<br /><br />Avoid the 40th, and get this one. It's more honest and true to the event that was pivotal to the whole \\"peace and love\\" movement of the 1960s. Sorry for the rant, but you need to be aware of what is being done to historic documentations, how they are being changed and no longer truly represent the moment - which cannot and should not be altered to suit some misguided sense of God know what they are thinking.fraught with errors.<br /><br />Avoid the 40th, and get this one.

0399536108|1.0|Going in I heard that this book was a confused mash-up of motivational double-speak, self-employment championing, and independent travel advice. However, this book is insultingly shallow. Other reviewers have noted the condescending tone, the contradictory recommendations, and the ripped-off content. To me, these faults were not even the worst parts of the book. For potential purchasers I would like to highlight two other major issues that should force you to reconsider your purchase and your time.<br /><br />First, Chris Guillebeau is not changing the world. He has found ways to \\"use his small army\\" (read: his fans on his blog) to make tons of internet money. Chris is very scant on the details of his income, but certainly isn't benefiting the world at large. Instead, Chris is so self interested in making money as easily and effortlessly as possible so that that he can jet around the world. (Note: he recommends selling stuff on eBay.) Other than his work in West Africa for a medical non-profit and donating to charity, Chris appears to have done nothing with his life. I do not consider unlocking people from their lives of being \\"average,\\" through this book and his blog, a world-changing endeavor.<br /><br />Second, this book is dangerous. All of Chris' advice centers around avoiding responsibility. He recommends never buying a house, taking out a student loan, starting a family, starting a business with a physical location, etc. The whole book is about how Chris has chosen to put his well-being above all others and how that has freed him to travel. Well, most of us would like more time and money to travel, but there are many other realistic considerations that Chris flippantly dismisses. For example, Chris claims that college was a waste of time and money. He doubled his courses to finish early & did the bare minimum to pass through courses. He barely scraped by, ignoring the coursework in any class he found to be irrelevant to him. This is ridiculous - Chris was taking easy, basic courses at community college & state schools; avoiding having a real college experience; and forming the habit of finding the easiest, most meaningless way to accomplish goals. College isn't for everyone, but Chris has shown his true colors in \\"going to college\\" in the most pathetic way I have ever heard of. This clearly became a pattern for his life as he avoids busywork he hates, people he doesn't like, and any challenge that pose difficulty. This is NOT non-conformity - it is laziness.<br /><br />Speaking to both these issues: most laughably in this book, Chris repeatedly recommends blowing off meetings that people expect you to be at. He describes a time he didn't go to a meeting he was supposed to be at and how freeing it was, even though people were mad he ditched them. He tells the reader that they should evaluate how much trouble they will get into, how much time they might waste, and whether or not they like the people in the meeting before they decide to ditch it. This is perhaps the most selfish, and purposeless advice Chris offers. What gives him the right to leave others hanging when he is expected? Why should he be skipping important meetings to play when others are trying to accomplish something collectively? It is just laughable.<br /><br />In the end, I did not learn anything helpful from this book and I cannot recommend it.ing easy, basic courses at community college & state schools; avoiding having a real college experience; and forming the habit of finding the easiest, most meaningless way to accomplish goals.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster was the first book I read when I finally decided to pick myself back up off the ground after my Christian Grey hangover.  It was recommended to me through iBooks as a similar read.  And I know that's what a lot of people consider it: a Fifty Shades lite.  I don't really see that, though.  I must say, I did absolutely LOVE this book - especially that crazy, bad boy who I felt like I shouldn't at times!<br /><br />Travis Maddox is a womanizing, underground fighter, walking sex machine...with a temper. Abby Abernathy has come to school to get a clean slate.  She needs the antithesis of Travis, however, they're drawn to each other after their eyes meet at one of Travis's fights one night.  She couldn't be more \\"uninterested\\" in him, and he could not be more intrigued by said lack of interest. A bet is made: she wins, he has to go without sex for a month; he wins, she has to live him with for a month.  Well, I'll spoil one part - he wins.  Through their living together, there's plenty of drama, a little romance and lots of really heartfelt interactions.  He wants more; and she thinks she does too, but knows she needs to stay away.<br /><br />Their crazy love story is up and down and all over the place.  There's drama and plot twists I didn't see coming, and plenty of angst.  There's also some steamy and passionate moments, which really heat up the story!  I think what makes Travis and Abby's story so remarkable is that they are both hot-tempered (he, more than she), but you can't hate him for it.  Their anger at each other and with themselves just makes it that much sexier!  There were times I wanted to yell at Travis for being a psycho, and then turn around and freak out at Abby for being such a damn moron. And to me, that makes a great book!<br /><br />I give this crazy love story 4.5 stars and recommend it to anyone looking for an angst-filled, sexy romance.  It will leave you wanting more - which is why I'm so super excited for Travis's POV to come out next year!  I think it'll be so great to see this whole story unfold through his eyes!is's POV to come out next year!  I think it'll be so great to see this whole story unfold through his eyes!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever.its the first game I play on my kindle.you should download this game.I rate it 5stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Next in the Fifty Shades series, Fifty Shades Darker was simply perfect. I must say, I do think that I enjoyed this book even more than the first in the series.  While it's titled Darker, I would say that really it does feel lighter to me.  There's more of a different kind of drama in this book, but it's still so wonderful! I immediately downloaded this book after finishing the first one, and couldn't wait to see what happened next. I'm glad I hadn't read these earlier on, because I'm not sure I could have handled the suspense that was the end of the first book.<br /><br />Darker picks up where the first left off - except this time, Christian comes to Ana with a different sort of proposition. More compromise, if you will. I will say that while there was still plenty of hot and crazy sex in this book, it wasn't the same as in the first. Ana wasn't going into the relationship as his sub, so therefore, while there was still plenty of \\"kinky\\" it wasn't nearly the same as the first. There was definitely more of a romantic connection between Christian and Ana, as both have realized that they don't want to be apart, and they must find some sort of middle ground in terms of how they can function together as a couple, rather than as Dom/sub.<br /><br />I loved all the suspense and different twists and turns in this book. Most of it was so unexpected, I literally couldn't put this book down. Everytime I thought I could take a break, there was some new intense moment and I had to keep going. And for those that might be worried that Christian's gone soft in this book, being all lovey dovey and what not - don't worry, he's definitely still super bossy and very in control. He just picks his battles, so to speak.<br /><br />Ms. James did a wonderful job in this book of further developing both Christian and Ana's relationship, as well as showcasing more secondary characters with outside interaction. There were so many wonderful moments in this book, that it would be hard to pick a favorite...so I have a few that just stand out always for me:<br /><br />-- Like Fifty Shades #1, I love the emails...shows so much of Christian and Ana's relationship and their playfulness and even their love.<br />-- Every instance of \\"Laters, baby\\" makes me want to die. In a good way!<br />-- When Christian returns from his helicopter fiasco and finishes speaking with his family - Ana is standing there and he says \\"I'm going to say hi to my girl now.\\" For some reason, it has always stood out to me. What follows is probably my favorite sequence in the book - the keychain, the love, the yes, the shower, all of it.<br />-- And lastly, the final dinner party to the time in the boathouse...from Mrs. Robinson, to the hearts and flowers at the end. Love that whole part.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars and highly recommend it. It is an intense, emotional and still very erotic read. It will have you stressed out, falling in love and wanting to cry all within a few chapter span.favorite...so I have a few that just stand out always for me:<br /><br />-- Like Fifty Shades #1, I love the emails...shows so much of Christian and Ana's relationship and their playfulness and even their love.<br />-- Every instance of \\"Laters, baby\\" makes me want to die.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game if your trying to pass time but found myself addicted one particular game and couldn't  stop playing it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read Fifty Shades of Grey after being in the most horrible book slump - and to say the least, that book slump has been completely abolished. Since finishing this book, I've read about 45 more in the last 6 weeks. And re-read the Fifty series a couple times as well. This book was recommended to me by a few different girlfriends, and after a particularly long day at work (aka at home, where my toddler has suddenly turned into a screaming banshee), I told my husband I needed a minute to myself. I went in our room, downloaded Fifty Shades of Grey on my iPad and started reading. It was definitely a shock to my system...in more ways than one.  In about 5 days I had the series completed, and I felt like all my friends died and I had the worst book hangover!<br /><br />I knew nothing of the BDSM lifestyle. I knew that people were into it, and some vague ideas about how it all worked, but to say this was a lesson in that lifestyle, would be entirely accurate. I must say, I was unsure of how I would like the story because of this aspect. I wasn't sure I would want to read something so graphic, and this is your warning if you haven't read it yet...it's extremely graphic, not just in the sexual content, but also in the language. So there, you know now, if you didn't already assume.<br /><br />In terms of the characters...I'll start with Ana. Dear, sweet innocent Ana. This chick is very naive when it comes to not just BDSM, but really just sex in general - and sometimes just life, too. Christian, smoking hot Christian Grey couldn't be further from naive. I swear, Christian speaks to some deep down part of me that just wants someone else to be in charge. Can't blame a girl right? Christian wants a submissive - with a list of rules to follow and behaviors to abide by...with an actual contract. Ana, she wants the hearts and flowers, which Christian is so against. While he does make this clear to her in the beginning, he starts to come around to her side of life. Something about her grabs his attention and he can't get away. And surprisingly enough, she isn't completely scared away when she gets a first glimpse into his lifestyle.<br /><br />While this book has a lot of very graphic sexual encounters - there is a romance in there, too, and that is what I think draws so many people - and just the hottness of Mr. Grey. I personally loved the way that Ana was able to soften Christian in a way that he never thought possible. He was SO incredibly closed off. Ana brought about feelings in him that he had spent his entire life pushing aside and this both excited and upset him! They go through this amazing push and pull in order to find the compromise that is their relationship.<br /><br />A couple specific things I loved about the book - how Christian could sometimes be so sarcastic and throw in some dry humor. So unsuspecting and I just loved it. Also, loved their emails back and forth. Really helped develop not just the storyline but both characters.  The author does such a great job of describing specific scenes, events, smells, clothing, etc. that you can visualize so easily what you're reading.  Loved that!<br /><br />This first book does end on a cliffhanger, and if you're anything like me, you'll not waste one second getting the next book, Fifty Shades Darker, so you can know what the heck happens! It's too intense not to.<br /><br />I rated this book 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an erotic, romantic, intense story! Also, if you're anything like me, be prepared to feed your family crackers and cheese and maybe not wash your hair until you're through with the series. And if you're not like me, pretend you didn't read that and don't judge... :)er grabs his attention and he can't get away.

034580404X|5.0|This was one of my absolute favorite book series. I was very sad that it came to an end. I will be reading this story over and over again. You can't help but fall in love with both characters in the story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />The final book (for now, at least) in the Fifty Shades series, Fifty Shades Freed was excellent. I have read quite a few reviews where readers were less than pleased with the final book - I can't complain, because honestly, who could about Christian Grey.  I flew through the entire series in about 5 days, and even though I really wanted to savor this last book, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I don't want to give away anything about the state of Christian & Ana's relationship, but I'll say during this book they still grow individually and as a couple.  It seems in every area that they take a couple steps forward, they inevitably take some hits and fall a few steps back.  There was some heart-wrenching drama in this book, and I found myself holding my breath at times - and wanting to scream at others.  As far as you might have thought Christian had come, there were times in the book where it felt like he had never grown - and that usually pissed me off.  Not enough to turn my back, though.  Can't stay mad at him for long.<br /><br />There was more of a \\"villain\\" in this plot and that really added to the story in a great way.  It created a whole other set of problems for Christian and Ana to overcome, and it really created some seriously intense action towards the end of the book.  My stomach was in knots and my heart was in my throat!<br /><br />As can be predicted (and as was the case for me, hoped for), there's still hot sex, plenty of drama and lots of bossiness from Mr. Grey!  Another favorite for me (throughout all the books) would be the music!  Love the music choices.  Can't hear classic music now, without thinking of Christian & Ana.  But I do love how well Ms. James incorporated music into their lives and actions.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars and highly recommend it.  It ended absolutely perfectly (if that's even possible, given the fact that I never wanted it to ever end..like 20 books in this series would ever be enough)...and the way Ms. James gave us that small glimpse into Christian's perspective gave me hope for an even hotter spinoff from his POV later on!  A girl can dream, right?!James gave us that small glimpse into Christian's perspective gave me hope for an even hotter spinoff from his POV later on!  A girl can dream, right?!
1439192812|5.0|My 3.5 year old grandson selects the iPad version of this book again and again, without any prompting, despite many other \\"age appropriate\\" apps that he could select.  He is mesmerized by the interactive features and the artwork that moves, and asks many, many questions.  Even though he probably does not fully understand the material, he is fully engaged in thinking about it, and it gives us an opportunity to learn along with him.  A wonderful concept!  We are extremely pleased with this eBook.
1439153663|2.0|I didn't think the plot was bad nor the characters.. but when reading it I always felt a bit jumbled.<br /><br /> Felt a bit chaotic the whole way through I just wanted it to come to a conclusion.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I have very fond memories of seeing the original, 2 dimensional animation rendering of Dr. Seuss' fairly controversial short story \\"The Lorax\\". It was faithful to the original story to a fault, simply quoting the book verbatim throughout its duration, pouring out a message of consumerism gone awry and short-sighted, fly-by-night economics that is often denounced by both Austian Free Market proponents and Environmentally minded socialists alike. In short, it paints a picture about as grim as what was the reality for many communities in America during the Industrial Revolution, but it comes up short in pointing out the government complicity in aiding the crony corporatists in violating the natural rights of the less industrial property holders of said time period. It's more of a simplistic, man vs. nature poem that leaves much more up to the imagination.<br /><br />This re-make, which is quite a production, fills in a lot of the blanks that were glaringly present in Dr. Seuss' original, almost to the point of becoming out and out fan fiction in the process. Where before the story consists primarily in a singular storytelling session by the former industrialist dubbed The Once-ler with a young listener, here an entire town of plastic, corporatist consumerism gone haywire sets the stage for the tale of the Lorax, removing some of the intended holes in the story for the purpose of making it more dramatic, but also bringing out the more sympathetic aspects of The Once-ler (who also gets his own biography of sorts weaved in with the story of how he ruined a once pristine forest) and presenting a more odious villain who takes on The Once-ler's place as a short-sighted profiteer; charging money for the clean air of the town and subjecting the entire town to a sort of 1984 styled surveillance police state in order to keep trees from being planted to cut into his bottom line.<br /><br />The voice cast of this film is where the movie scores a lot of its points, as the vocal talent of Betty White as the protagonist's eccentric grandmother is sure to bring a smile to the faces of all viewers, young and old. Danny Devito's handiwork as The Lorax is also quite a treat and ads to the light-hearted nature of the pastoral reminiscence of The Oncer-ler. And the vocal talent of Taylor Swift (admittedly a one-trick pony in the pop/rock/country songwriting department) is brought into play to do for this film what Tiffany did for the full length movie \\"The Jetsons\\" about 22 years prior. The musical numbers are about as bubble-gum oriented as High School Musical, but definitely play up the comedy factor quite well and provide good segway material to keep the film flowing. Special note should also be made of how well the animators of this film were able to capture the desolate, broken world where the now ruined forest once stood.<br /><br />But the ultimate charm of this film is that, unlike the original story, a more detailed depiction of how The Once-ler and the absolute absurdity of consumer fancies is presented in a manner that is not necessarily anti-progress. One can't help but note how the environmental catastrophe that resulted from short-term binge harvesting could have been avoided with a gradual harvesting approach rather than just slashing and polluting the entire capitol source. Likewise, the whim-based nature of the Thneed product and how it caught on is reminiscent of how many fads begin, are milked relentlessly, and then discarded like the evening trash for someone else to clean up.<br /><br />This is among the better computer animated flicks I've seen in a few years, and it's a good all around fun fest with a reasonably nuanced message that is common sense for anyone who desires a quality world rather than a quantity based world of ephemeral highs and hangovers. Highly recommended.ent of Betty White as the protagonist's eccentric grandmother is sure to bring a smile to the faces of all viewers, young and old.

0553801473|2.0|In addition to all the other reviews complaining about how nothing actually progresses, this book and AFFC to a slightly lesser extent, were obviously written for the small screen.  Now while it is great that HBO series brought so many more fans to the series, it is a big disappointment to me that GRRM seems to be writing an extended screenplay rather than an novel.<br /><br />The quality of the dialogue and the subtlety of plot from the first 3 books seems to have gone straight out the window to suit the blunt instrument that is a TV and it's bigger, dumber audience.  From someone who has reread the first three books numerous times digging for details that might have been missed the first time around, this book is the equivalent of a literary cheez-it.

B008ALAHA4|5.0|I purchased this adapter to eliminate cables around my desk. I have an old white MacBook and a new MacBook air. I like being able to switch between charging either computer with the same chord. It really cuts down on cords around my desk and makes it look nicer. Now I can keep my other power adapter in my laptop bag so I do not have to unplug it when I travel. The only downside to this is that it is a bit expensive for something so small with only one function. It is worth it though if you want to use your old adapter and use your new one just for traveling. The magnet is surprisingly strong and I do not have problems with it falling off. I would recommend the product. It is a handy little adapter! Rating: 5/5

B003K1EYM6|4.0|This camera connection kit only works with the iPad. Unfortunately it does not work with the iPhone 4S (or iPhone 4), as I plugged in and it said it is not supported. Still, it does its job very well and it's convenient to have especially if you like to store pictures on your iPad. One thing to note, you cannot view pictures on your SD cards until you have actually transferred them to your iPad. You can see small thumbnails of all the pictures on an SD card, but you cannot make them full-size. I was hoping this could read directly from an SD card because that would massively increase my storage area for photos when my iPad is full or when I cannot access my laptop or the Internet. Unfortunately it does not do that. If you need a lot of storage for photos where you do not have Internet or computer access, I would recommend buying a wireless hard drive or highly compressing your photos with iPhoto before you transfer them to the iPad. The second option will not actually give you more space, but it will reduce the file size of each picture so you can still store more pictures. Rating: 4/5
034580404X|5.0|The books are great.  The dynamics of the relationships of the characters just makes you read that much faster.  I just wanted to know what they were going to do next.  The characters felt like real people and not fictional characters.  The books have taken scrutiny that was harsh.  The book will not be for all readers but those who have an open mind to life will enjoy.  I hope the movie is as good as the books were.
031603441X|2.0|My general aversion to memoirs would have prevented me from reading Richards' but my husband gave it to me last Christmas. I found the first 200 pages quite engaging. Richards' earliest memories of the post-war England of his childhood are of bomb craters and ration books, features of wartime deprivation that remained until the mid-50s. He describes a rambunctious childhood -- lots of ramming around on bicycles -- and typical early education -- a bully who is eventually bested and a 3R regimen that ignores huge swaths of human potential. His brief love of school coincided with his membership in a choir that took a lot of prizes, one he was booted from when his voice broke. He credits one teacher for steering him into art school, where he took up the guitar, the first step toward legend as the composer of the Rolling Stones' most amazing riffs. And it's the early days of the Stones which held the most interest for me. How from the first their marketing was carefully counter to the goody-goody image of the Beatles. How the Stones and the Beatles scheduled their releases so their new singles wouldn't hit at the same time. How their earliest gigs were revue shows which had them on stage three times a day for 10 or 15 minutes in three different towns. How they debuted in a music scene dominated by croon-tunes from the Everly Brothers and Beach Boys as the rawest part of a teen tide that simply swept those crooners away. Richards' recapitulation of the history of that amazing teen tide, which swept the entire western world, is definitely worth reading, worthy of three stars. The rest -- not so much. Richards' descent into heroin addiction turned him into a truly pathetic parent and the junkie story of getting hooking, finding the smack, eluding convictions, etc., offers no new insights into that misfortune. In fact, Richards never explains why he became a junkie and evades even asking himself the question. Why is a question he evades most of the time. Why his penchant for partners who are arm candy, even while he snickers at other rock-star cliches? Why he fell in love with the two women who bore his children? The last 350 pages are pretty tedious -- junkie tales, detailed explanations of chords in some of the later Stones' songs, gossip about Jagger and dish on their disagreements, yadda, yadda, yadda -- and typical of celebrity memoirs. That bit earns -- barely -- a one-star from me.partners who are arm candy, even while he snickers at other rock-star cliches? Why he fell in love with the two women who bore his children?

0553582038|3.0|This has been my least favorite of the series so far.  Too hard to keep up with some of the plot lines and missing a lot of important people, I just couldn't get into it like I could the others.  If you haven't read the first three books please don't waste your time with this review.  Start at book one or be hopelessly lost.<br /><br />When last we heard of them Daenerys was conquering people, Jon Snow had become the head of the Crows, and Tommen was ruling with his mother close beside him.  And many other people were doing many other things.  In this book, we are introduced to several new characters and even get a glimpse of Tommen's sister and her life, although only a glimpse.  Cersei is ruling for Tommen and not taking kindly to those who would oppose her, she's hatched several new plots and none of them kind.  Sam has left the wall to travel with Maester Aemon and a girl called Gilly so that he can join the Citadel and become a Maester himself.  And Arya has crossed the sea to Braavos, where she isn't sure what fate has in store for her.<br /><br />Arya is probably the best character in this book.  I was ok with her before, but really, her story is the most interesting here.  We hear nothing of Tyrion and Daenerys, who are my favorites.  I know they're supposed to be in the next book, but perhaps a mix and smattering of them here would not have been out of place.  As it is there were a bunch of new characters added that I just didn't care about and who really didn't add to the story for me.  Maybe they'll serve a purpose later, but they just made the book tedious as is.  Cersei continues to be unlikable, but we always need a good villain I suppose and she fills that role well.  Likewise, Petyr is always walking that line between good and bad and I can't figure out if I like him or not because of his cunning.<br /><br />The plot was all over.  With the amount of characters and the lack of major battles or plotlines, I just couldn't keep track of anything.  And it seems like we were told about things more than shown them in this book.  There are a good several woundings of important characters and we hear about them after the fact, which is unusual in these books.  Like all of Martin's books there is rape, murder, violence, torture, regular sex, and everything else that could make people cringe.  It's not for those people who like their books tame and might even offend a few.<br /><br />I'll continue reading of course, but I just didn't like this book as much as the other three I've read.  It served its purpose for continuing the plot along, but not as enjoyably as the others.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows<br />Copyright 2005<br />684 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B0070NSPCU|3.0|This is a good, engaging story in need of some editing. Some other reviewers have done a good job detailing the word usage and punctuation errors that detract from the story, so I won't repeat it all here. The author has potential, and I'll probably read book 2. But as for the preponderance of 5-star reviews - I'm suspicious as to their legitimacy. This is not Tolkien.

B001F7MSG6|5.0|Hellboy 2: the Golden Army is even stronger than the first. Hellboy is a sarcastic, smart ass of a superhero who doesn't take himself too seriously and is great fun to watch. The storyline for this one is much stronger and less campy than the first movie. The visuals are lovely, and Del Toro's directing is wonderful. Nuada was also a great and complex villain who is really more an antihero than an outright bad guy.
B007PBL9KC|5.0|If you listen to this album for the first time, each song you find to be your favorite as opposed to the previous song. That says a lot about an album. The fact that Little Talks is the song that went mainstream was simply because it was their single. Mountain Sound, Dirty Paws, Six Weeks, King and Lionheart, Lakehouse, or even Slow and Steady could easily of been hit singles. No need for me to elaborate on how amazing each song is and what makes them great. Just go listen to a few songs on youtube and come back and get this album. I can almost guarantee you'll be killing to see them in concert after a couple of weeks of owning their album.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, I saw them last night. They were flawless. Unbelievable energy at the show, and it was easily the best show I've been to.
B003O86FMW|4.0|In the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy we pick back up where the first book left off.  Katniss is finishing her tour of the districts with Peeta while struggling to come to terms with what her actions in the arena have done.  Katniss is forced to choose between her heart and what she knows is necessary to save the people she loves.  Even though Katniss throws herself into her role as girl-crazy-in-love she is unable to shake her label of girl on fire.  She has become the spark that lights rebellion in the district and President Snow chooses her to be the focus of his wrath.  As the Quarter Quell Hunger Games begin, and the mind-shattering twist is revealed, the districts rebellions come to a head and the mysterious District 13 is finally revealed.<br /><br />Opinions on this book have been very split.  The high-school age readers I've talked to loved the whole series, the adult readers seem to be more critical.  I've heard everything from the last two books are slow, to boring, to not worth reading at all.  Personally, I really enjoyed Catching Fire.  While the first book of the series is the only book that can be read as a stand alone novel, Catching Fire adds depth to the story.  In this book we see how Katniss handles her celebrity, and her struggle to do what's best without knowing which path to take will lead to the perfect outcome.  While Collins does spend a lot of time discussing the love triangle of Peeta-Katniss-Gale it's important to remember Katniss is only 17.  While she's forced to deal with adult problems, she is still a teen and Collins's focus on this love triangle only strengthens the fact that our heroine is forced to deal with problems far beyond her maturity level.<br /><br />This book focuses on the anger and tension in the other districts and exactly how bad things have gotten under the rule of the capital.  It shows the big differences between the haves and the have nots and gives the reasons behind the districts' revolts.  Collins also goes into more details about the other district and while the focus stays on District 12 we get to hear more about the other districts while Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour and through the other competitors in the Quarter Quell Hunger Games.  This is one of the things I wished book one had gone into in more detail, so I was happy to see that Collins had fleshed out Panem a little more in this book.<br /><br />I did find the ending a little rushed in this book, but it's really mean to be more than a bridge book than a stand alone story and it plays its part well.  You are left with too many loose ends to not pick up the third book and finish out the series but you get enough of a plot you don't feel your time has been wasted with this book.  The Hunger Games trilogy is popular enough you shouldn't need my recommendation to go read it, but just in case you've been living under a rock ... these book are good.

0470450266|5.0|Hey there!<br /><br />I don't have enough words to describe what this book is! Where should I start? The book is perfectly structured! The way Scott Spencer is explaining is not dumbed down like you see on some learning sources, but in the same time is clear as tear drop. He is not wasting any word, instead he manages to touch upon every aspect you might think of. While reading some chapters, certain questions were poping in my mind, but every and each of them were answered eventually later in the book.<br />The videos are made in the same manor. Clear, on spot, supporting you with everything he can (models, Ztools, reference images, proportions literately drawned by him ready for you to take them into Maya or Zbrush with you while you build your base mesh and many many more).<br />All in all, I must reiterate this, it is the bible you need when you start learning Zbrush and modeling. It is a resource that you will use to start with and, I'm sure, you will get back to later on just to use as a reference to whatever you might sculpt.<br />Now, the DVD issue. I know some people complained about Sybex quality on the DVD... I share your opinion in some way but I found a solution and it worked for me without any problem. Here is what I did: Inserted the DVD, opened the autoplay, clicked on Chapter 1 which opened a window with the files allocated for the given chapter. I selected them and copied in a folder on my hard disk. After this, I did the same with everything. When I was done copying all of them, I extracted the files on every chapter and there it was: good to go and being on my hard there was no waiting time what so ever. I saw some guy complaining about the sound... There is no sound issue! So if you find this problem than it has to do with your codecs (TIP: use VLC player since I find it to have a higher max volume than BsPlayer or Windows Media Player. Usually at 60% in VLC is louder than 100% in BsPlayer.).<br />The last bit, I recommend everything Scott Spencer did. I also got his other 2 books and they are the same. Start with this one since this is the foundation you need in sculpting and than move ahead and continue with the other 2 books. On top of this, if you can find his Zbrush 4 Introduction from Gnomon Workshop you won't regret. I watched it quite late, after I was already quite familiar with the program and it still showed me quite a lot of things I didn't know.<br />The only problem I have? A negative side of what Scott Spencer did? He has only 3 books out... He is only one...<br /><br />P.S: Subjects touched in his books that I could not find in other resources or I couldn't find a decent way to understand them:<br />DISCLAIMER: This is from a personal point of view, and from what I searched so if there are other sources I didn't manage to get to feel free to correct me.<br />1) UV mapping - Character Creation: Advanced Digital Sculpting<br />2) Normal Maps, Displacement Maps, Texture maps and Uv Master in ZBrush - Character Creation: Advanced Digital Sculpting<br />3) Topology and remeshing in Zbrush - ZBrush Digital Sculpting Human Anatomy<br />4) A well structured path from easy to complex when it comes to Anatomy, Body Landmarks and Anatomy terminology in sculpture - ZBrush Digital Sculpting Human Anatomy<br />5) All the proportions across the body you will ever need in humanoid sculptures and even in creature developing - ZBrush Digital Sculpting Human Anatomy<br />6) A logic way of explaining STRUCTURE and why is so important (or in other words, how to avoid a lumpy look when you sculpt) and the other two most important considerations when sculpting: Gesture and Proportion - ZBrush Digital Sculpting Human Anatomy<br />7) Small techniques that are implied in various places but no one is bothering with explaining them in an elaborate manor and even further, demonstrate their utility - ZBrush Digital Sculpting Human Anatomy<br />And many many more!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do! Happy Sculpting!<br /><br />Regards, Dan Mihaila
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Ghost's songs to me sound like satan-worshipping gospel intertwined with melodic and thrashy metal. Quite unique and unorthodox, yet it works on so many levels. Some things to note about this album:<br /><br />-The cohesion of all the sounds. You could tell a lot was put into it when everything seems to mesh well, especially the blend of bass, guitars, drums, and organ. One instrument does not outshine the other, they are in complete harmony and balance with one another. This harmony is something a lot of current bands lack, but Ghost has it. Of course the backbone instruments are the guitars and drums, it wouldn't really be metal if it wasn't, but everything else seems to have a valid presence.<br /><br />-The catchiness. I could not get most of the songs out of my head for months. The one song in particular I cannot forget is 'Elizabeth', one of the heavier tracks. When listening to a song like 'Con Clavi Con Dio', I imagined myself in a satanic ceremony every time I sang along.<br /><br />-The use of organ in metal. Ghost has to be one of the very few metal bands that incorporate organs heavily, if not the first. And it works brilliantly.<br /><br />-The tone of some songs and vocals has a giddy, almost happy, and ceremonial vibe, yet the lyrics are lurid. Quite a unique blend, but hell, it works.<br /><br />-Expected growling vocals? Nope, they are sung cleanly for the majority of the album. The range is limited, nothing crazy like King Diamond, but it fits well here. I would've liked the vocals to be more rough/powerful (yet still clean). But alas, the clean \\"pleasant-ish\\" vocals attest to the songs being so easy for anyone to sing along to, which added to them being stuck in my head for months; as well as adding a pop sensibility. If I tried to sing along to Mercyful Fate (which I freaking love) songs, I would rupture a lung, but here, since the range is continuous, I have no problem. The vocal style also has quite a resemblance to Voivod's early 90s' style.<br /><br />-Speaking of Mercyful Fate, and also Blue Oyster Cult, here the dark melodies of the guitars, drums and bass are for a great portion of the songs a great likening to their styles.<br /><br />-Another thing about the lyrics is that they are so incessantly satanic that it's almost humorous to the person hearing them for the first time. When combined with the instruments it creates a volatile mixture that cannot be explained, but I think makes the atmosphere more \\"fiendishly-evil\\".<br /><br />-The riff from the song \\"Ritual\\" is unfortunately quite similar to Megadeth's \\"Symphony of Destruction\\", yes, but the song itself as a whole is quite different and still wonderful.<br /><br />-Some songs have a \\"scooby-doo\\" (if you've ever seen the show) sound to them, most notably the song \\"Stand by Him\\", among a few others. But instead of it sounding completely silly, it added a retro 70's doomy vibe with the top-notch musicianship.<br /><br />-If Castlevania had a soundtrack, I think this would be it. The dark mood fits that game brilliantly. When I listen to songs like \\"Elizabeth\\", \\"Death Knell\\", and the instrumental \\"Genesis\\", I sometimes think they are the backdrop of a castle in which vampires and demonic creatures are being hunted by a guy with a whip.<br /><br />-To the people who are offended by the lyrics, they are not meant to be taken seriously. I mean, this band consists of dudes who disguise themselves in black robes and the front-man is a 'demonic pope'. Do you think they'd want you to take them seriously? No, no they wouldn't, it's just all for show and presence which only adds to the great quality of the songs. All that really matters here is the music...and it rocks.<br /><br />To conclude, this collection is truly a masterpiece of catchy, doomy, poppy, dark, evil, humorous metal. I would've liked the theme to be a bit more versatile than just 'Satan, Satan, Satan 24/7' and also I would've liked the singer's voice to be a little more powerful (to be more suitable for the thrashy songs). Nevertheless, nothing more devilishly delicious-sounding could come from Sweden. I can't wait until the next album (should be spring '13) comes. Enjoy \m/
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|I would never have been inclined to read a biography about a computer geek - but I am so glad I did. It was a fascinating read about a modern day genius. I use the term loosely because I don't think his talent is extra-ordinary, however, I do believe his creative flair combined with his ruthless drive are unparalleled and are what have made apple the almighty success they are today. Steve jobs is definitely one of the most controversial yet inspirational people I have read about in a long time. He is so contradictory on so many levels. This biography did not shy away from any of his flaws, and there are many. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The app is very similar to the one that is free with windows 7. Its all aound entertaining but I don't know if there are levels of difficulty yet.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone calm down with your mind-orgasm for just a second.. All of the negative reviews are ridiculous.. Open your mind to the book and stop comparing them to twilight.. Edward Cullen is a fairy, not a vampire. Vampires drink blood, can not come into day light and glimmer, and do not have relationships with humans... Fairies can..<br />CHRISTIAN GREY IS NO EDWARD CULLEN!!!! SO SHHHHH and keep your narrow minded comments to yourself spoilers!! I LOVED THESE BOOKS AND COULD NOT PUT THEM DOWN.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|(I uploaded some pictures showing before and after the g155)<br /><br />I have been carrying my hardware on the astro mission bag for over a year.  I got what i used to call my \\"mobile command unit\\" which is based on the PS3, X360 (on a separate backpack), A40s and the vizio 15 inch led.  It was fine and all, and since the G155 was not released when i decided to go mobile it was the best solution i could think of at that time.  Throughout this past year i saw the G155 and all the great reviews kept pilling up.  I was tempted, yet i decided to be satisfied with the vizio and the mission bag.  Time kept passing and the more i used my solution the more obvious it became it was not mobile at all, just decent.  So now i have the G155, and this is my story.<br /><br />I use the [[ASIN:B0015YWKYY Ultra High Performance HDMI Switcher, 3to1 Switch]] to connect my X360 (inside the G155) and the PS3 (outside the G155) simultaneously and the experience has been a HUGE upgrade in simplicity and easy mobility.  I still use my mission bag for the PS3, A40 and other accessories, with the G155 next to it.  When open i like how the G155 has space on both sides of the console to put the controller when not in use, the A40 mixamp and the charging cable for the controller.  It just looks clean.  I used to have the vizio and a bunch of cables flying around and it was all just a mess.  Now i got the G155 and it provides a personal environment for a neat and beautiful gaming desk.<br /><br />As for the G155 itself, i have put it on marathons with the X360 and PS3 and the performance of the screen is just awesome.  ZERO lag, fps are fluid and look great.  Skyrim looks awesome.  The screen performs as advertised and then some.  The speakers are better than expected, no gimmicks here is all about performance.<br /><br />The case itself is just right.  Hard plastic, rubber feet in the right places, stable in vertical position, console sits tight and safe with the straps.  At some point i likeusing my x360 on the G155 than on the big TV.  for some reason i like the up close and personal feeling the G155 provides.<br /><br />In my opinion, the G155 is not exclusive for mobile action.  If you are in college, or have one tv in the house the G155 can provide a perfect solution for that gamer in the house that needs to get its gaming fix.<br /><br />Great product, great company, once you buy it you will know why the great reviews keep pilling up.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I have been using the ps3 with my g155 and noticed that the fans were getting way too loud and the heat build up around the console worried me. Because the ps3 does not allow full games install it gets pretty hot.<br />My tip is to take the storage pouches that come with the g155 and fold them in a way that when put under the ps3, one in each side, the ps3 is lifted just enough to allow better air flow through the side vents and the bottom is not compressed against the cushion. Also with this adjustment he usb ports are more accessible for charging the controller and using the ps3 wireless headset.  The straps will keep the ps3 in place, so dont worry about that. Hope it helps
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought the book was great.  I really kind of got a sex education from it but it was also interesting to see why Christian was like he was and why she was.  When I was finished with the books I was disappointed I wanted more.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I agree with the one reviewer that Pink Floyd is NOT a \\"greatest hits\\" type band.  I think just about every song they ever did was a GREATEST HIT!!! But I do like this CD because it keeps me from having to grab 3-4 Floyd CDs on my way out the door to work, ect., and I can just grab this ONE, and it has plenty of Floyd for a 30 minute commute.  Now, if I am sitting at home, I grab a COMPLETE CD, not this one.  But kudos for adding in some of the old hits, and some of the new hits, too. No one, maybe just me, loves The Fletcher Memorial Home! So, it is a great \\"sampler cd\\" of Pink Floyd's career.  And the songs it has are AWESOME.  ALL of them. Period. So, for 8, 9 or even 15 bucks, you get a great cd that you will no doubt wear out.  P.S.  Just caught Waters' The Wall Tour about a month ago in ATL., and let me say this: I'm Glad I Was There!!! HaHa.  A surreal, life-impacting concert/experience/memory, that gave me the chance that my age (44) did not give me in 1977.  Get the CD you cheapskates! LOL!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game on really any device, although on the kindle (it may just be mine)  it does seem to lag quite a bit which makes it really hard to play. I find myself running off of the end not being able to turn in time due to the lag. even through this I still enjoy the game.
0143119680|5.0|I purchased this after hearing a review of Shadow of Night on NPR.  I felt I should start at the first book.  WOW!  This book is just incredible.  I couldn't put it down!  It is an engaging story (how can one resist witches, vampires, a mystery manuscript, forbidden love all set in Oxford and France!)  and is extraordinarily well written.  Ms. Harkness' s descriptions bring the characters and their environment to life from the first page.  The story moves a bit slowly initially as the stage is set, but then takes the reader on a fascinating ripping ride through the developing relationship between Mathew and Diana and the marvelous variety of characters who populate this book.  Others have written about the plot so I see no reason to add to that.  I can only say that it is wonderful to read a erudite piece of fiction that is romantic and gripping with well blended facts, history and the present day, as well as enough rivalry and animosity to make it a non stop page turner!  Read It!  Oh, and you might as well buy the sequel at the same time, it will probably drive you nuts to not have it ready to go when you finish this one!  At least that's what happened to me.

B004FPZ2G8|3.0|It's another great book of Jane Austan. I really enjoy her writing and endings,especially this one of Jane's. This is (I think) the last book Jane wrote before her death.
