B000002TQV|5.0|Pablo Honey that  had few good songs on it and one hit single Creep that has become Radioheads signiture song. To follow-up Pablo Honey they decide to do something very different. Released in april 1995 The Bends made the music critics stand up and take notice because here was an album not like anything ever heard. Radiohead made something very special a brilliant album that to this date is one of the most played album in my stereos. With gorgous melodies, brilliant hooks, amazing guitar riffs and quirky lyrics The Bends stands out as one of the most essential and best albums of the past 20 years. The muscianship and the production is flawless and not to mention amazing cover art. Overall a classic album 10/10.
0743244249|2.0|I wanted desperately to enjoy Cosmopolis. Having read every one of his previous novels, I revered DeLillo, even for his earlier and less accomplished gems. I had been anticipating Cosmopolis with febrile excitement for months. Sadly, I was only to be disappointed. He has, for once, made a mistake. You've probably read enough about Eric Packer's cross-town limousine voyage and his exorbitant wealth to excuse my exclusion of a synopsis. So let me tell you why Cosmopolis is a failure. <br />A narrative thrust powerful enough to propel the reader forward is lacking. Almost every character, and the protagonist in particular, are unrealistic and fail to engage. His writing is moon-bleached and cold. The pacing of the novel is much like that of a traffic jam, a gridlock of stop-starts. As each implausibility unconvincingly unrolls, as each lobotomised character finishes blabbering in hollow argot, Cosmopolis slowly implodes. There are sparks that remind you that DeLillo is a genius- the denouement is compassionate and satisfying, as is Eric's inevitable haircut at the barber's. However, their impact is muffled by DeLillo's stubborn dedication to a style that wants to flaunt its wealth when it is in fact bankrupt. He drowns his message and intent here in unfocused claptrap.<br />He has forgotten what makes him such a brilliant writer. Suddenly self-conscious and faux-visionary, he writes like a man who doesn't know when to end his sentences. Potentially beautiful imagery is shattered by futile wordplay. He can't simply write about surfaces and textures. He insists on imbuing everything -from a soiled latex glove to a cluster of chauffeurs- with significance and poetry, obfuscating his meanings and rendering previously crystalline descriptions hazy. This is lazy, injudicious writing.<br />There are so many false starts that by the time something occurs that we should be affected by, we don't even flinch. DeLillo loses the reader's trust. His realisation of Eric's day is toounreal to be believed. Where is the verisimilitude, the truth? Life isn't a series of elysian crests and apocalyptic troughs, all in a single day. It isn't about epiphany after epiphany provoked by things like someone saying, \\"Your prostate is asymmetrical.\\" Sure, sometimes the quotidian does transcend the banal, but not at the rate of ten times a page, twice a sentence. One needs to carefully balance the absurd with the believable, the visionary with the mundane, semantic frenzy with repose. The nervously overexcited prose never pauses for reflection or silence. The result of his hyperactive writing style is a book that feels, strangely, very grey and very dull. <br />Cosmopolis could have been a superb and incisive satire. Unfortunately, DeLillo was unwilling to jettison the sombre gravity of something more serious. Cosmopolis looks like a satire trapped in the body of a gravely existential tome and it ends up succeeding as neither. There are some humorously perceptive comic segments, but they are incongruously slotted between slabs of solemnity. He used to know when to write a parody and when to write a tragedy. Here, he is just confused. Does DeLillo want us to laugh or cry? It seems that even he isn't certain. <br />Cosmopolis hasn't put me off DeLillo. His status as one of our greatest living writers has already been irreversibly cemented by such works as The Names, White Noise, Libra, Mao II and Underworld- some of the most important novels of the 20th century's latter half. I just hope that he is sensible enough to do himself, his wonderful gifts and intelligence justice next time.
B000002H6C|5.0|how appropriate the 80's ended with this masterpiece of an album. with the 90's began metallica's change and in the later half their spot as the kings of metal was forever tarnished by 2 bastardized cd's called load and reload. but that is another review. in the 80's there are 4 metallica cd's that you must hear and each one gets better and better each cd, but this is by far one of the greatest metal albums of altime. every song on this song ... is a great song. this is metal my friends. the riffs are so incredible and some of the solos on this are just so good you won't believe what you're hearing. if you've never heard metallica you need the 80's collection. this is a neccessity in any metal fan's collection. if you don't know who metallica is go find out now. unless by some miracle st anger brings some kind of retribution back to a once amazing band this is the only metallica you need to know period.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|About A Boy is quite the swell movie! Having read the titular book by Nick Hornsby, I was a little afraid to watch the movie in fear that it would go against the book. I was a little surprised that it stayed faithful to the book throughout the entire movie. Albeit it is a movie adaptation so some things were changed, but nothing to make me regret the film.<br /> Hugh Grant is Will, an actual good-for-nothing who lives off the fame of his father's famed Christmas song which he despises. During a scheme to pick up single mom's, he becomes involved in the life of 12 year old social outcast, Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult. The Weitz bros., the directors, took Hornsby's novel and made it perfectly viewable. The transition between scenes has a great pace and the playout of the evolving fatherlike relationship Will begins to have over Marcus is shown with heart. Hugh Grant handles the part of Will with charm. He showed a great performance. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus was a great choice for the role. I hope the kid has much more opportunities in his future; however they'll probably be British productions. Toni Collette (Very quirky in an off way in this film) and the beautiful Rachel Weisz also costar.<br /> The DVD is a hefty one. Picture and audio transfers are great. The supplemental material is satisfying. Especially neat is the \\"English to English\\" which is a featurette on British slang.<br /> About A Boy succeeded to be touching and enjoyable as both a book and a movie. The two make a perfect pair, although I suggest reading the book before the movie. Or perhaps not, for more effect on the film. Either way, they're both wonderful.

0375707972|2.0|What if you fell in love with someone and later discovered that your lover had been a Nazi years ago.  Would you still love her?  Perhaps this is the idea behind Bernard Schlink's 1995 international bestseller The Reader.<br />In The Reader, Schlink presents a story that is only shocking in its attempt at nazi sympathy. A sexual relationship between a willing 15-year old boy and an older woman is not news today or yesterday. What disturbs me is the basic premise of the story.  Are we to feel sympathy for this woman simply because she's illiterate?  Does her ignorance somehow lessen her crime? Does being illiterate explain her inhumanity, her ignorance of evil?  Not guilty by reason of illiteracy?<br />It's easy to believe that Hitler's ranks were filled with illiterates and miscreants. The idea that an illiterate woman kept the delicate, sickly girls from being gassed at Auschwitz to read to her (until she was through with them) isn't far-fetched.  Disgusting, yes.  Surprising, no.  Hanna's illiteracy and her attempts to conceal it make her brutality no less inhumane; if anything, it makes her worse because she's as proud as she is cruel.  She has no remorse about her actions.  But she's prideful enough to hide what she finds shameful-not that she's a cold-blooded killer, but that she can't read.  Outrageous.<br />Schlink's language typifies the German stereotype-stark, austere, harsh.  What's interesting is the philosophical questions he poses and his thought processes as he tries to think his way through a problem to the best conclusion.  But what is \\"best\\" based on, other than man's own system of values?  Isn't that what Hannah obeyed?  In her case, it's generally agreed that those values were of a madman.  When the protagonist wrestles with philosophical issues, he goes to his father, a philosopher by profession.  He comes away with no insights and no answers.  In the end, the story neatly concludes itself, and doesn't answer any moral questions.<br />The Reader is thinly veiled nazi sympathy, and that is ultimately the most shocking thing about Schlink's novel.  Schlink knew his case was indefensible; hence, the brevity of the novel.  If there were some deeper point he was attempting to make, it must have gotten lost in translation.ader is thinly veiled nazi sympathy, and that is ultimately the most shocking thing about Schlink's novel.

B00005NWRS|5.0|There is nothing I have ever heard that is more incredible than this CD.  Ryan Adams is a genious.  He is the only person that is able to get by with what he does and he knows it.  This is the only album I can listen to over and over and over and not get tired of.  There just aren't enough words to describe this brilliant record.  Check out track 11, Gonna Make You Love Me.  That is the best song ever recorded!
B00005JKPF|5.0|The coolest comic book heroes hit their groove in this excellent episode in the X-MEN series.  I was a sort of comic collector from 1980-90 and the X-MEN comics were always chock full o' great characters, complex stories, and great action.  Both movies have delivered those qualities and more.  It would be nice to see a comic book turned movie actually start a series instead of a few haphazard sequels that get sillier as realeased.  This movie rocks.  X-MEN was a nice intro for XAVIER's gifted students, in X2 the mutants really strut their stuff, both dramatically and with a fine showcase for their uncanny abilities.  Some great action set pieces highlight this crafted flick as well as a story that unlike most super hero movies is engaging and intelligent.  I can't wait for X3 to see what will happen next, how many sequels these days can you say that about?  Not many at all.  HUGH JACKMAN was born to play WOLVERINE, one of the best movie characters in years.  A good new fashoned comic book film with it's head and heart compounded in good storytelling and style, to me that's a great movie.
B000089RVX|4.0|I first heard their two songs on the Daredevil soundtrack,and quite liked them.I haven't got or heard the album,but just for those who like Amy Lee's vocals but consider the music over-produced/samey/rubbish,then really check out Sarah McLaughlan-she sounds almost identical to Amy Lee but mellower-in fact when I heard the song in Daredevil,I thought it was Sarah McLaughlan.<BR>I'll give what I've heard 4 stars,but I can't really pass judgement on the whole album,as I've only heard Bring Me To Life,Tourniquet and My Immortal.<BR>Probably the right mix of loudness and melody,but could it a bit produced.
B00005JM93|4.0|A few of the reviewers on this page seem to have been totally overawed by the violence and missed the brilliance behind this film. The violence is the most horrific and realistic screen violence I have ever seen and I don't deny that this is probably to an extent for shock value, but how else will a foreign language film get noticed without kicking and screaming in this American dominated film industry.<br />This film is basically about one event and its consequences and how they can totally destroy your life (hence irreversible). In the film the event is the rape and its consequences are the violent killing of a pimp with a fire extinguisher. If these two events where not as violent as they were would the point of the film have been received with as great an impact? <br />This film is played backwards therefore we see the consequences before the event. When the film starts it is very frenetic, a man is rushing in and out of doors in a night club there is a lot of shouting going off the music is very loud, dark and dirty, the lighting is red, and the camera is moving about all over the place. As the film progresses back to the beginning before the rape happened the camera settles down, the lighting becomes white and the music is light and happy. There is even a scene where the couple obviously so in love discover they are having a baby.<br />This film shows how one minute your life could be perfect and you couldn't have a care in the world and how it can all be taken away from you in 9 minutes (length of rape scene). To me that is far more terrifying than watching fictional on screen violence.<br />One additional thought I had about this film was its classification, I was warned several times by different members of staff at the cinema before watching this film, but I don't think that is the cinemas responsibility. I could not understand how the film \\"gangs of new york\\" could be given the same classification as this film.
0345457684|5.0|I'd never read Morgan before.  It's always risky investing in a book by a new author.  This time the risk paid off.  This is a delightfully convoluted science fiction detective story.  The characters are well developed and multi-faceted.  The detective element has just the right mix of honest hard bitten cynicism.  You can hear Bogart narrating in the background.  The setting, and premise are wonderfully unique and twisted.  Definitely worth a read.
B00008973A|1.0|The day the film version of \\"A Chorus Line\\" opened across the country, director Richard Attenborough was interviewed by Jane Pauley on the Today Show.  \\"And what's this film really about?\\" asked Jane.  Sir Richard answered, \\"It's about kids trying to break into show business.\\"<br />And there you have everything that's right and wrong about the film.  Some have enjoyed this film (as you can see from some of the other reviews), and even been inspired by the inside look at young professionals trying to make it to the top, or even just get in the door.   I'm very happy for them.<br />The only problem is, that's NOT what A Chorus Line is about - at least the Pulitzer prize winning stage musical conceived by the late Michel Bennett.  And if the movie's director is that far off base, well what you end up with is confusing series of characters and stories that don't seem to have a lot of point to them, other than all these folks are auditioning together one afternoon.<BR>  <BR>Kids breaking into show business?  No, A Chorus Line is (was) about top-of-their-career professional dancers trying to get one more lousy job to keep food on the table and injuries at bay, letting them work one more year.  And asking the question \\"Is it really worth the physical pain, humiliation, and invisibility?\\"  Most had already let go of the dream of being a star - that would have happened by now if it was in the cards.  No they were dancers - but what did that mean?<br />Although the creators thought they were putting a project together in workshop that would appeal only to the Broadway community - audiences strongly identified with the dancer's stories.  The audition became a metaphor for any place where people are treated as interchangeable commodities, whether its on a stage, in an office, or in a factory. We're all \\"on the line\\".<br />It's this core that is missing from the film.  The stage musical has three pivotal group numbers: the opening \\"I Hope I Get It\\", \\"Montage\\", and \\"What I Did For Love\\".  The rest are individual character songs.   (The popular number \\"One\\", is really outside the plot, more of a curtain call than a book number.)  \\"What I Did for Love\\" is practically the emotional climax of the show - the dancers reaching for an answer to the inevitable question of \\"why do this?\\"  In the film, however, it's a love ballad for Cassie, musing over her former love for Zach.  On stage, the heart of the show is \\"Montage\\", a single musical number about 15 to 20 minutes long takes the characters stories from the pain and wonder of childhood related in the first half, through puberty, and into young adulthood.    It contains the song \\"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen\\", as well as several other themes.   It's not in the movie - replaced with a new (and much less ambitious) song \\"Surprise\\".  That leaves only the opening number, which thankfully is still there.  Unfortunately it pails in comparison to Bob Fosse's \\"appropriation\\" of the idea that he used to open his film \\"All That Jazz\\" in 1980.<BR>  <BR>With the major themes shuffled off to the background, what you are left with is the dancer's colorful stories, and the Cassie / Zach failed love affair melodrama pushed to the fore.  The love story isn't any more compelling here than it was on Broadway, where Bennett wisely kept it in the background, only using to add an extra layer of tension to the proceedings.  But it is good to see the individual dancer's stories and songs can still impress in the film.  The late Greg Burge is riveting in what, on Broadway, was the tiny role of Ritchie.  The film gives him his own number, the aforementioned \\"Surprise\\".  Michael Blevins is sweet as the young Mark, experiencing his first audition.  Janet Jones lights up the screen in the tiny part of Judy, demonstrating why she was the sole newcomer to go on to other films (and to marry star hockey player Wayne Gretzky).  Broadway veteran Terence Mann (Cats, Les Miserables, Man of La Mancha) is memorable in the small part of Larry, the assistant choreographer with a heart of gold.   Cameron English gives a heartfelt rendition of what is probably the greatest piece of writing in the canon of American musicals: Nicholas Dante's story of Paul, the young gay dancer who's family disowned him after seeing him perform in a drag show.<BR> <BR>Others don't fare as well, however.  Audrey Landers is exactly the WRONG type of vixenish actress to play Ms. Dance-Ten, Looks-Three.  The song comes off as vulgar and slutty.  It only worked on stage because these shocking things were coming out of the mouth of a petite blond Drew Barrymore look-alike in disarming pigtails.  And Alyson Reed, a wonderful dancer, doesn't really register as Cassie.  Perhaps if a star had been put in the part, it would have justified all the extra screen time devoted to Cassie's chorus girl to star to chorus girl story.   But Alyson doesn't have the right charisma or face for the camera.  Choreography was handed over to Jeffery Hornady, who was the man of the moment after the success of his Flashdance numbers.  Big mistake.  Obviously Mr. Hornaday had never see a Broadway show, for the dances look like outtakes from a Wham! video.<BR> <BR>So there you have it - add this one to the list of landmark Broadway musicals butchered on film, along side Gypsy, A Little Night Music, and Man of La Mancha.  Maybe someone can convince Chicago film director Rob Marshall to give us a television version of Chorus Line?  It really deserves a do-over.<br />Back stage note:  When Universal studios bought the rights to Chorus Line in 1976, they also hired Michael Bennett as producer (and implicitly as director).  Michael spent over a year and a half working on various versions of the screenplay, but eventually got tired of \\"taking meetings\\" and left LA for New York where he went to work on Dream Girls.  One concept for the movie was to depart from the original setting and make it about dancers auditioning for the film version of \\"Chorus Line\\".He had already approached two hot newcomers to participate.  He wanted Mikhail Baryshnikov as Zach, and in a gender switch, Saturday Night Fever star John Travolta in Cassie role.  Already that sounds like a more interesting movie.
B000083C49|5.0|I saw this opening weekend with the love of my life (to that time; I was only 15).  For the first 30 minutes of the film I kept trying to get her to hold my hand, but she wouldn't take it.  So I settled in to enjoy the rest of the movie, just as it was taking off.  The theater was packed and the audience was having a great time.  There aren't too many movies I remember where the audience was with the picture the entire time.  And, as history has shown, these weren't just Trekkers.  These were normal, everyday people looking for a good time at the movies (my band director was among them).  It was one of the few communal film experiences I've ever had.  When Kirk and crew approach their new assignment and see it's the Enterprise-A, there wasn't a dry eye in the house.  The whole auditorium cheered.  And when the credits rolled and the lights came up, there was nothing but smiles, warmth and good vibrations leaving the theater.  When was the last time a movie did that?

B000002UD0|5.0|Something that's never been said enough of John Lennon, if at all, is his musical ear.  The arrangements on this album and the preceeding &quot;Mind Games&quot; suggest a complexity that even Lennon never credited himself with.  This is a great funk and blues album in the 70's axiom.  There are rousing horns and slick strings underlying the always melodic tunes.  Lennon always maintained he was strictly a rocker with no more ambition than his inspirations, Elvis and Buddy Holly.  But he clearly has the talent of a major pop composer, perhaps gleened from years in the company of the likes of George Martin, Phil Spector and, yes, Paul McCartney.  (Suprisingly, this album is much more cohesive than McCartney's work of the same period.)  With such great session musicians working with him, I envision Lennon working much in the way Brian Wilson did with his Wrecking Crew compadres in the mid-60's.  The result is a strong piece of work with a singular sound and great, great songs.
B00008AWOD|5.0|Sleeping with Ghosts is possibly the best album Placebo have ever released. I have looked forward to this album since the very first time I have listened to 'The Bitter End', a cracking, rocking tune which is probably one of the best singles released this year. <br />Brian has once more proved his song-writing skills with this emotional album. 'Protect me from what I want', 'Plasticine' and 'English Summer Rain' are my favourites songs from this album, which is probably the most emotional album released so far in 2003. <br />I also liked title of the album that very clearly symbolises what Placebo are all about. If you're a Placebo fan, go and buy this record. You won't regret it.
B000001DVD|3.0|Def Leppard's second album \\"High 'n dry\\" (1981) is quite good but not as good as the debut \\"On through the night\\" released the previous year. The production is rather raw even `tho it was produced by Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who later helped Def Leppard abandon anything good they had in the beginning. The first two songs on the album is nothing special at all, but when the captivating \\"High `n' dry\\" comes along and is followed by the beautiful ballad \\"Bringin' on the heartbreak\\" the album begin to take off. \\"You got me running\\" is a good melodic tune and \\"Mirror, mirror\\" have a bit of hit potential. \\"No, no, no\\" is the fastest and most rocking number on the album, and it have a slight connection the Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock and roll\\". But the real highlight on this effort is the very attractive \\"Lady strange\\", in which the band manage to create a rock tune with a very catchy chorus - clearly one of Def Leppard's best songs ever!<br />The albums \\"High `n' dry\\" and \\"On through the night\\" both show a raw and unpolished approach from a young and hungry band. These two albums stand together and represent the early Def Leppard era of their own. As we all know the third one: \\"Pyromania\\" was the real start for Def Leppard's journey towards what they are today, even if Def Leppard on \\"Pyromania\\" still could rock.
1577311523|5.0|\\"This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness...\\" <br />Eckhart goes right to the point.  Clear, simple, and on target.  <br />The noise is constantly whispering pain:  the self-image in a time-dream nightmare of defenses, regrets, and anxiety.<br />Surrender.  Completely give up.  You cannot get out of concepts with more concepts.  Surrender the self, stop conceptualizing.  Selfing and thinking are not two different things, they are the same process. <br />There is another way to understand reality.  There is another way to know.  Concepts are not enough.  Concepts get on the way.  Concepts are the obstacle.  <br />Get out of the conceptual mode, and syncronize with the concrete experiencial reality.  Then you get rid of the self image, the time, the neurosis, the craziness, the mental illness.   <br />Mindfulness.  The Budha's way.  Out of concepts and into reality. The same message.<br />We teach the conceptual nightmare to our kids.  We give them concepts and, indeed, a self-image.  Then we put them in competition.  Low self esteem is born.  Worth related to accomplishent is born.  Anxiety is born.  Pain is created.  This is how the disease is transmitted. <br />Eckhart did it.  What extraordinary book!
B000001F7R|4.0|Def Leppard's \\"On through the night\\" (1980) was their debut as well as their best effort. It's hard to believe it's the same band that later released weak and popish albums like \\"Adrenalize\\" and \\"Slang\\". Back in the early days, Def Leppard showed hunger, enthusiasm and love for the music which can be heard from the opening riff of \\"Rock brigade\\" to the closing slow guitar picking of the epic-like \\"Overture\\". In between, Def Leppard gives you a fair amount of heavy metal rock guitars and melodic hooks. In \\"Hello America\\" there's straight ahead hard rock (with a slight touch of Beach Boys in the middle section where there's only drums and vocals), while the semi ballad \\"Sorrow is a woman\\" show the band's softer side. In \\"It could be you\\" the \\"tempo\\" change during the chorus manage to upgrade the song from average to good, and tunes like \\"Rocks off\\" and \\"Wasted\\" is sheer heavy metal. Def Leppard was also capable of bringing on the groove, something that's obvious when it comes to \\"It don't matter\\", and It's a real pity that Joe Elliot & Co, aren't interested in writing songs like the heavy \\"When the walls came tumbling down\\" anymore. I would say that this album is without doubt one of the finer from the time of New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. <br />Maybe the reason for the transformation from a promising heavy metal band to an uninteresting commercialized pop group, have something to do with the fact that Def Leppard started out with a different line up. Pete Willis (guitar) got fired and Steve Clarke (guitar) died from an overdose. Drummer Rick Allen lost an arm in a car crash and along the way came producer Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange. Despite what Def Leppard have become, there sure was a time when this band really rocked!
0553573403|4.0|As one of the reviewers suggested, I read the reviews here from the order of the least favorable first. I found that a lot of people complained about how Martin kills off too many of his interesting characters, about none of them are completely like-able or hate-able, about how depressing and graphic his writing is. I thought this was interesting because these are basically the reasons why I *like* his books.<br /> Martin makes Jordan's characters look as flat as carboard. His characters are *so* real. In real life, it's hard to meet people you absolutely adore, or that you absolutely hate. Very few people are absolutely good, or absolutely evil, and it's like that in this book (and the following books) as well. The numerous viewpoints do get dizzying sometimes, but I like it because I feel that all of the characters get to tell their side of the story. I don't like Catelyn Stark at all, but I do feel sorry for her at times. Jamie Lannister used to disgust me, but now I see he's not altogether such a horrible man.<br /> Ok, I was very pissed when some of my favorite characters were killed, but I have to say that I like the way Martin keeps you on your toes - by which I mean that all you can expect is the unexpected. The plot twists just as you think you know what's going on. And unlike Jordan, you get the sense that the plot is actually GOING SOMEWHERE!!<br /> The only reason I'm giving this series four stars instead of five is that, like many others, I feel that the \\"fantasy\\" element is somewhat missing from this fantasy. At times it's just *too* realistic, although it does have a smattering of dragons and random magic. And I also agree that Martin does seem to dwell on unpleasant details too much. But the story itself I found to be fascinating, and well worth a read.
6303394000|4.0|I was flipping through the channels late at night, and I stumbled upon this film. I was prepared to toss it aside as a late night \\"B\\" flick- but I was immediately swept into the story line. I was so engrossed, I hardly noticed the length of the film, and was disappointed when the credits began to roll. The sheer artistry of the movie is enough to grip even the most non-musical person. Fosse's choreography is intense and beautiful every step of the way, and it is riveting. It is easy to get wrapped up in the story, and you find yourself unsure of whether you want Joe Gideon to live or die. Roy Scheider plays Gideon brilliantly, and it is almost a shock to see him fit so well into the roll. This film is a must-see, and I will not hesistate to add it to my collection...and I don't even LIKE musicals!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was having lunch in a vegetarian restaurant in Seattle when I heard this great song being played over the restaurants sound system. The singer sounded like he was accompanied by the philharmonic orchestra. I asked the waiter what was playing and he said; Beck's Sea Change. The song playing was Lonesome Tears, and I know that much because after finishing lunch I went right out and bought the CD. I am over fifty years old and mostly listen to folk music (hank dogs, hem, gillian welch, folkers like that)so buying a Beck CD was kind of out of my range. I have discovered that in the most unusual musical way that Sea Change is actually addicting. I would put a label on this CD: Warning, may be habit forming! I see that it has been referred to as a downer, a bummer, that Beck is in transition from some dark place. Do not let that steer you off course from Sea Change. The music just takes you along on this sea of sensation, and not once have I felt brought down by it. Infact it seems to put me at ease, as if I have surrendered my anxiety. I can listen to it on my way to work in the morning and last thing at night and its effect seems to have the same results, I want to play it all over again. Thank you for sharing your formidable talent,Beck. I expect your next CD to be something entirely different as that is your apparent musical nature.
B00001QEE7|5.0|The Little Mermaid was the first movie I ever saw in theathers (i was two.) And it was extremely enchanting, still. I love this movie: the music, story, and characters.<br />Ariel is not your normal mermaid princess, she longs for a life above the water. Her father openly disapproves her dream, but Ariel still fights for it. ANoneyand even accomplishes it when she sees Eric, the handsome land prince. She falls madly in love and turns to the evil sea witch for help. Ariel has only 3 days to make Eric fall for her. Easy, right? Wrong, in exchange for legs, ariel must give up her voice.<br />the movie is delightful for all ages. Girls will love the romance and Ariel. Boys will love the action. And parents/adults will love the good, clean, wholesome fun their childen are watching.
0060537639|3.0|Menzies makes a very convincing argument that the Chinese had a very strong seafaring tradition for over a millennium and that tradition had a very abrupt end in the 1420's.  Menzies makes an interesting, but a little less compelling argument that the Chinese left artifacts of their travels throughout the world in the form of maps, buildings, animals, colonists, and carved stones.  What Menzies doesn't do convincingly is explain why the reader should believe that all these maps, buildings, animals, colonists, and carved stones should have originated during a single 2 or 3 year period, as opposed to the preceding thousand years.<br />That said, I love this sort of speculative, what-if type of history.  If Menzies somewhat overstates his case in an attempt to wrap everything up in one neat package, then that is more than compensated by the importance of the core of his proposition.  It is my recollection that the theories of Alfred E. Crosby and Henry F. Dobyns were greeted with a good deal more skepticism than this book has been.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This box set is note perfect. Looks great, sounds great, and is great.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Ok....my opinion....I have 2 kids, I watch all \\"their\\" movies w/ them. I was alittle curious when ice age, lilo & stictch<BR>, spiderman, etc got won out by a movie......I HAD NEVER HEARD OF....I consider myself a <BR>genius when it comes to these movies (forget the 'adult winners', no time :)) BUT!!!! When I saw this, I was absolutely blown away. This move FULLY deserves the awards its recieved..... as an artist, its gorgeous, as a parent, the story is fantastic, incredible, laugh, cry....etc. My 5 yr old loved it, I just bought on amazon, so we can watch over, and over, over.......but, I don't mind this is animation, art, storytelling, moviemaking at its finest!!!!!! Thank you....oh, rented alll his other films, just as great!!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is the grandaddy of 'em all.  The greatest hip hop CD out of NY and arguably anywhere.  If you call yourself a fan of hip-hop, and you do not own this CD, then your collection is missing the key element.  Just listen to &quot;NY State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Halftime&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;.  Actually just listen to the whole album, and you'll hear what all the fuss is about.  This album is the real deal.
6305426651|5.0|I am reminded of the words of Leo Tolstoy: &quot;The secret to being happy is to be...&quot; &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; is about living a passionately happy life which makes others see the beauty of it. This movie is so Beautiful!
B00001IVOF|5.0|Just like the preceding CD, &quot;The Infamous&quot;, this album is a classic.  This album starts off with &quot;Animal Instinct&quot;, and if this song doesn't get you going, check your pulse.  What follows is the same formula used on &quot;The Infamous&quot;, just done better.  &quot;Drop a Gem on 'Em&quot; the vague 2Pac diss, is a great track with a perfect beat.  There are so many good songs on this CD that I really go on forever.  Instead I will just tell you that if you liked &quot;The Infamous&quot;, any Mobb Deep song, or good NY hip-hop, then you should own this album.
0385504209|5.0|This is my first book by this author and I was really drawn into his story. This genre is a little out of the norm for me; I usually read Sci-Fi/Fantasy books. This one came recommended and I took it with me while on vacation. Near the end of the book, I could not put it down and was up into the wee hours of the morning reading it (even though I had a long drive ahead of me). I was fortunate enough to be traveling overseas and was able to see Roslynn in person within a few days. I loved how this author used many facts in his story to weave a web of mystery and suspense.<br />I am glad I was introduced to another genre of writing and I look forward to reading more of his books.
B000089RVX|4.0|Okay... Here's the background.  I'm a progressive rock dinosaur, walking through Tower Records in Yokohama, looking for something they did not have (Karnataka).  Suddenly, this music comes over the store's speaker system.  It rocked, and suddenly, this unspeakably gorgeous voice comes through the mix like a searchlight through the inky darkness... I stopped dead in my tracks, and after finding out who it was, immediately bought it...  I may never find the Karnataka, but this was really good.  I'd recommend it highly, and hope to see another release from this band.  This would be a strange recommendation, but here goes:  IF you recall Grace Slick's voice fondly, and have not already gotten too old to appreciate the new Rock, then you will enjoy this! Buy it, turn it up, share it with the neighbors!
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is great! His beats (Eminem & Dr. Dre) and lyrics combined make the greatest hardcore gangsta rap album to come.<br />1. Intro (0:06)(N/A): 2 quarters fall on a table, a gun being loaded then cocked. Period.<br />2. What Up Gangsta (2:59)(9/10): This song is great!! No the best... but it lives up to the rest of the 50 cent stuff.<br />3. Patiently Waiting (Feat. Eminem)(4:48)(10/10): The longest song on the album. Eminem contributes TONS to the song<br />4. Many Men (Wish Death)(4:16)(10/10): \\"Many, many, many, many, many men-- wish deaff 'pon me\\"<br />5. In Da Club (3:13)(10/10): The first official single off the album really lives up to 50's rep. <br />6. High All the Time (4:29)(9/10): ...50 Cent and the marijuana!!!<br />7. Heat (4:14)(10/10): This one is my 3rd favorite song on the album!!! It's about guns and stuff. And I was surprised when i wuz lookin at my friend's 'Get Rich..', that 'Heat' was taken off it.<br />8. If I Can't (3:16)(9/10): All my friends love this one, but i like it a BIT less.<br />9. Blood Hound (Feat. Young Buck)(4:00)(11/10): The BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. A CATCHY CHORUS. AND A SWEET \\"RRRUFFFFF\\" AFTER EVERY 2 LINES. YOUNG BUCK DOES PRETTY GOOD, TOO.<br />10. Back Down (4:03)(10/10):  A JA RULE DISS!! ... This one's good. The last \\"RRRUFFFFF\\" from Blood Hound carries into the beginning of this song. The ending is hilarious!!!<br />11. P.I.M.P. (4:09)(10/10): From the steel drums to the upbeat lyrics... a Pimp classic!!<br />12. Like My Style (Feat. Tony Yayo)(3:13)(9/10): This one is ok. But Yayo doesn't get enough of anything in this song.<br />13. Poor Li'l Rich (3:19)(9/10): A high rating, yes! But actually the worst song on the album. But still getz a 9.<br />14. 21 Questions (Feat. Nate Dogg)(3:44)(10/10): This one has a meaning, being a song for 'Shorty', the girl. Nate Dogg has never failed with his appearances on song to bring the best chrouses.<br />15. Don't Push Me (Feat. Lloyd Banks & Eminem)(4:08)(10/10): This is my second favorite song. Em has the best few lines at the end- ...P>16. Gotta Make It to Heaven (4:00)(9/10): Eh... the music is amazing and the chorus is pretty repetitive but still good.<br />*17. Wanksta (3:39)(9/10): This song got way TOO much hype its not THAT good...<br />*18. U Not Like Me (4:15)(9/10): This one ain't too bad at all, not bad for some old 50 material.<br />*19. Life's On The Line (3:38)(10/10): The oldest of the bonus tracks, but the best!!!<br />Finally!! The End. This BETTER BE HELPFUL!!! ...F-F-F-F-Fifty!
B00008PX8P|5.0|what can i say but awesome just buy it
B00006J3WH|4.0|Hmm... that is what I, as well as I'm sure many others thought upon first seeing the much-anticipated musical episode. But after watching it about 10 times, and listening to the CD much more, my Hmm is now a Wow!!! Anya turned out to be a talented singer, as well as Tara.  Of course Spike was hot singing rock 'n' roll (but then again, he's always hot). There were some low points, such as Buffy's voice -- which wasn't too bad considering she is an actress, not a singer!! And Willow's voice- hey, there has to be a reason she only had about 3 singing lines the whole show! Otherwise, very unexpectedly great! Only other complaint is, where's Anya's song from Selfless, 'Mrs'??
B00005V1B2|5.0|&quot;Mirage&quot; was a risk for me.  I'm cautious about the music I buy, and I had never heard of Camel before purchasing &quot;Mirage&quot;.  This band deserves to be better known, I was spellbound by Mirage's entrancing melodies.  <BR>Now I have &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, equally deserving of Mirage's greatness.  Camel is a band that can create just as much feeling as a band centered around a vocalist, displaying this ability superbly in &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;.  I get absorbed into Camel's compositions with every listen, I can't wait to hear &quot;MoonMadness&quot;, Mirage's supposed close counter-part.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This cd is amazing and such a great addition to anyones cd collection. Godsmack really came out of thier shell with this cd. the songs range from hard bass drum rythem to bongos and congas this cd is really a great piece of art, if you dont own it yet GET IT i promise you that you will enjoy :D i know i did
B00008J2DQ|4.0|With two very solid hard rock albums, comes faceless. Godsmack's third album, and really with steady musical evolution.  Faceless basically picks up where awake left off with its hard, crunchy riffs, whaa distorted solos from Rombola, throbbing bass lines from Robbie. And now comes along new drummer Shannon Larkin. In a few aspects, he in my opinion is even better than Stewart, just listen to \\"dead and broken\\" and it's as if he has like a Neil Peart like skill.  So, I guess I'll get to the album overall. I usually don't review albums unless I have heard then a number of times and get familiar with the material enough to make a honest and non-bias judgment.<br />The Lyrics: really, nothing has changed all that much.  The same old cliché driven lyrics as the first two have delivered, and \\"I f------ hate you\\" is the best example in a modern day rock band you can get, really.  Then again, Sully Erna never considered himself much of a songwriter to begin with so no wonder.  Although, there is a spot of lyrical growth on \\"serenity\\" with is like a mix between black Sabbath's \\"planet caravan\\" and \\"spiral\\" from awake, very melodic and mellow, and a hint of change.<br />The music:  Well, really.... is there any musical growth? Not really but for godsmack in general it seems to work very well with the formula they are using.  AC/DC has been doing it for 20 something years, why not godsmack?  It's hard to explain, faceless is a solid album through and through but certain songs are merely just replicas of the tunes off the previous album, \\"dead and broken\\" might as well as be \\"mistakes\\" pt 2. And so fourth.<br />The band:  With the new drummer Shannon Larkin, he has put a new dimension on the symbols that at times overshadows Stewart.  I will say that sully in a handful of songs has a very good vocal range, \\"re-align\\" in which the whole band shines with one hell of guitar solo that exceeded my personal opinion on Tony Rombolas guitar skill, and has acquired more since awake. Although he could just back off the pedal a bit, it's all good. Sully has a very good vocal range in \\"I am\\" and in \\"make me believe.\\"  <br />In conclusion, faceless is pretty much an awake pt2 and if you liked awake (like me, in fact awake is one of my all time favorite hard rock albums) you will definitely like this album, nothing too much has changed, and some has with vocals, drums and guitars. Or, if you just want a simple, plain old hard rock album as well. Don't get me wrong, I really dig godsmack and there really is no disappointment, just a bit more of the same and it would be ill logic to try and pin the notion that they rushed this album, because they certainly did not. However, I hope and if the occurrence does become realality that godsmack in future albums truly go onto different musical landscapes.  But, if they make the same album by their 5th and assuming they make it to their 5th, then it's clear that they are a band of who is unable to move on musically.
B000089RVX|5.0|These guys are here to stay. Through their perfect usage of Amy Lee's beautiful voice and memorable, heavy guitar work, combined with stunning electronic backing, Evanescence has proven to me that they are far beyond a &quot;simple pop band&quot;. They have something to say.<br />Unlike what others have said, I have found that Evanescence's lyrics are quite good. &quot;Call my name and save me from the dark / wake me up inside  / bid my blood to run / before I come undone / save me from the nothing I've become / bring me to life&quot; is the overplayed segment from the single, but other songs on the album have far more powerful and moving lyrics.<br />The thing worth repeating is Amy Lee's voice... she has a haunting, stunningly forceful sound that I honestly haven't heard anywhere else. She's Sarah McLachlan with more passion; a Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor who's not afraid to scream; and someone unlike any other singer in the world. She, and her band, are truly unique in their message and meaning.<br />&quot;Going Under&quot; is a great opening, although it's less like the other songs. This is where listeners first get a glimpse of Amy Lee's incredible voice... very good song, but it's not particularly inventive.<br />&quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, the single at the moment, will certainly give you an idea of their potential, and is unquestionably one of their best songs, but the rest of the album shows how much more they can do. I did not find any of this repetitive or unimportant--every song fits perfectly in the mix.<br />&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; is an angry, powerful song that shows this band can rock with the likes of Linkin Park just as well as they can break your heart with a ballad... like the next one.<br />&quot;My Immortal&quot;, a piano ballad, is one of the most breathtaking new songs I've heard in a long time. Amy's voice evokes every emotion at once, and the heartbreaking piano backing her is simply superb.<br />&quot;Haunted&quot;, my favorite song, isfilled with absolutely astounding technical expertise--echoes and twisted bits of sound flow throughout thepiece. Amy's voice lends a credence to the roar below her, and turns this song into an instant classic. When that little beep comes in, breaking into a heavy rock chorus, you know you're in for a treat.<br />&quot;Tourniquet&quot; is another breathtaking work, with more heavy Christian undertones. I didn't mind them, even though I'm pretty much anti-religion, because I figure, hey, if it led these people to do this, what's wrong with them wanting to talk about it a little? Fortunately, there really isn't much of this at all on the CD unless you're trying to look for it. This song features a very memorable guitar line and chorus, and will probably be stuck in your head for quite some time :)<br />&quot;Imaginary&quot; is simply breathtaking. Amy's voice is just exquisite, and the melding of piano and hard rock sounds astounding.<br />&quot;Taking Over Me&quot; has their best lyrics, I think. &quot;But who / can / decide what they dream?  / and dream I do.. / I believe in you.&quot; One of their very best songs--with everything you could possibly want; great instrumentation, great vocals, great emotion displayed, and that gorgeously anthemic sound that Linkin Park is so good at. Then again, that describes all of &quot;Fallen&quot;... this is a fabulous album!<br />&quot;Hello&quot; is heartbreaking in its honesty and haunting slowness. The way she says &quot;Has no one told you / she's not breathing? / hello...&quot; is a lesson to all vocalists alive at this moment on how to put emotion in your lyrics. This song stands alone as one of the most breathtaking Evanescence may ever do, and a prime example of why this band will stick around... they are extraordinary!<br />&quot;My Last Breath&quot; is the most Sarah McLachlan-esque of any of the songs, but backed by an incredible guitar line it becomes so much more. Piano fades in and out of the lyrics, giving the entire thing a poetic sound far more potent than all the loud guitars in the world put together.<br />&quot;Whisper&quot; comes up too fast--suddenly you realize the album's almost over! Nonetheless, it has the same infectious melodies and fabulous instrumentation that makes Evanescence such a great band. The addition of violins and chanting in the background gives this a more ancient sound--fabulous.<br />If you're a fan of Linkin Park's &quot;Meteora&quot;, do yourself a favor and buy this gem--it is every bit as good, if not better.
B000000OAC|4.0|Let's face it - 'A Day At The Races' was always going to be a hard act to follow for Queen. So, when they released 'News Of The World' the year after (1977), it was under a lot of pressure to succeed.<BR>When most people think of 'News Of The World', they immediately think of 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - but that's a little sad. In fact, I barely listen to 'Rock You/Champions' anymore - it's the rest of the album (and one, very late song in particular) taht really captivates my attention.<br />'Sheer Heart Attack' is a good track (except for the sonic equivalent of continuosly flashing lights at the end) and is full of Roger's trademark style. 'All Dead' is in the vein of 'Long Away' from 'A Day At The Races'.<BR>Then, there is the second best track on the album - John Deacon's amazing 'Spread Your Wings'. This should've been the front single from the album, as it's an amazing track that no-one should live without hearing. It's a narrative track, and I know some people hate that, but I personally absolutely love it.<BR>Roger's vocals are resurrected on 'Fight From The Inside' - I always kind of liked Roger's talents, as his voice is all...different from Freddie's and Brian's, I guess.<BR>'Get Down Make Love' is a track that only Freddie could write, it's a good bit of fun.<BR>Time for a bit of a departure from the first half of the album with a completely different style for the second - 'Sleeping On The Sidewalk' is a Brian May track somewhat reminiscent of '39' on 'A Night At The Opera', if without the half-ballad theme.<BR>'Who Needs You' is John's second contribution to the album, and it takes on a distinctly Jamacian style. (You have to listen to it to get what I mean)<BR>Finally, we come to the very best track of the album - it really should've been the last track. 'It's Late' by Brian May, it the perfect ballad - it's electric guitars all the way. A beautiful song, I first heard it after a break-up, and it was such a great reminder of how thingswere.<BR>Finally, 'Melancholy Blues' is a nice track, but ultimately falls short of 'It's Late'.<br />It's a top album, and not because of 'Rock You/Champions', more in spite of them.<br />Songs Of Note - It's Late, Spread Your Wings, All Dead
B000069CWE|3.0|&quot;Opening&quot; is beautiful. It raised my hopes... probably too much.<br />As much as I'd like to say this is a fabulous album, it's only &quot;good&quot;--and that's gotta hurt, coming from a real Linkin Park fan.<br />What was good? When the electronics got used to their full capability in songs like Pts. Of. Athrty, Wth&gt;You, Frgt/10, By_Myslf, and especially 1stp Klosr, the songs were dramatically enhanced by it. The newer beats and more complex backing was a major improvement. When two great vocal talents collided in the stunning &quot;Krwlng&quot; mix, it was beautiful, powerful--everything the original was not. For these songs, Linkin Park can be commended.<br />However, all is not good on this disc. Linkin Park is a great band because of their ability to combine rap with excellent rock; both work because they have a good rapper (Mike Shinoda) and a fabulous rock singer (Chester Bennington). I've never been a fan of the rap side of it, but it works.<br />On Reanimation, however, the band saw fit to let other random artists put random tracks in random places on this exceedingly random CD. &quot;X-Ecutioner Style&quot; is a good example. It starts off with a few mangled samples of &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, and moves into a rap song. From a different band. With no other mention of Linkin Park anywhere in it. What IS this?<br />That song, more than anything, got me extremely annoyed at this album. Why did they decide to let some random band create a completely unrelated song on their CD? Oh, I forgot.. they use the words &quot;Shut Up!&quot; from One Step Closer as their chorus. Does that qualify this as Linkin Park material? Or even a remix? No.<br />Likewise, H! Vltg3 is a through-and-through rap song. At least Mike is a good rapper, but still.. this is not at all what I wanted to hear.<br />Throughout the entire CD are phone messages left on Mike's answering machine--another example of completely pointless filler that has NOTHING to do with the musicat all.<br />And then comes the song which totally ruins it for me. What they have done to &quot;In the End&quot; is just inexcusable. They have taken a song that was undoubtedly the best on Hybrid Theory and have proceeded to tear it apart piece by piece. First, the gorgeus piano in the first is replaced by a honky-tonk. Next, the soaring vocals of Chester are gone, and the entire thing is redone by a random rapper named &quot;Motion Man&quot; who completely changes the style of the lyrics into something far less meaningful than before. Next, they speed it up a bit, losing all emotion whatsoever. And finally, &quot;Motion Man&quot; has to let everyone know that &quot;in the beginning, there was Linkin Park, and then came funkmaster Flex with a remix&quot;. This song makes me just want to strangle &quot;Motion Man&quot;, as I'm sure many other fans feel the same way.<br />Don't buy this album. Buy Meteora, which thankfully is extremely good. This one hopefully won't be remembered as one of Linkin Park's, as it basically isn't thanks to &quot;Motion Man&quot; and whoever the Executioners are. After completely ruining the album for me, I can't possibly recommend this.
B0000931OG|5.0|Blur has created a subtle masterpiece with \\"Think Tank\\", a logical progression from \\"13\\". The fact that this album is so good without longtime guitarist Graham Coxon simply shows that Blur is indeed Damon Albarn's band. Although I'm a fan of Mr. Coxon, I barely notice his abscence from \\"Think Tank\\". There's still plenty of guitars on this album but the three remaining members construct sonic tapestries with all sorts of instruments and equipment. WIth the exception of \\"Crazy Beat\\" and 1 or 2 other tunes, this album does not jump up and smack you in the face - it invites you to absorb all the subtle details of each track. Each listen provides further introspection to the lovely melodies and vocals. Damon's lyrics and vocal talents continue to improve with each album. This is a long way from \\"She's So High\\" or even \\"Song 2\\". I thought \\"13\\" was a superb effort but \\"Think Tank\\" surpasses it. It is a real pleasure to watch a great band evolve and progress.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Let's sort out one thing first. Hybrid Theory was a good album. Maybe it wasn't perfect, but it had its moments, and it was those moments--\\"One Step Closer\\", \\"In the End\\", \\"Papercut\\"--that brought it to the top and kept it there. Scattered among its tracks were several astouding examples of New Music That Rocked.<br />Meteora is those examples, intensified and perfected. No, it's not Hybrid Theory--it's better. \\"Don't Stay\\" opens the new sound of Linkin Park with a haunting new vocal style, combining some of the best elements of Hybrid Theory... Meteora is more powerful, more dynamic, more complex, more memorable and far, far more addictive :)<br />Compared to Meteora, Hybrid Theory just seems so flat and lifeless--there is so much more here to enjoy than there was on HT, so much more to learn and to experience. Sure it's only a half hour; but it's an astounding half hour of completely perfect tracks. Even \\"Nobody's Listening\\", the lone rap-only song, got my attention despite my general dislike of rap music. Leave it to Linkin Park to get me into a genre I would never have thought of otherwise!<br />I pirated the tracks when they leaked on the internet (a few days before the release)--and I was so impressed with them that I was one of the very first people to purchase the CD in stores the day it came out!! Few albums are THAT persuasive!<br />If you liked Hybrid Theory, you'll almost definitely love Meteora. If you've never been a Linkin Park fan, this is the best time to start. With songs like Numb, Session, Somewhere I Belong, Figure.09 and the soaring Somewhere I Belong, Linkin Park shows that they have what it takes to stay in the biz. These guys truly rock!
B00006J3T4|5.0|A gentle album that humbly puts pop music to shame.
B00008K7AM|4.0|...otherwise, you might want to catch some other flick.<br />The hot chick is an unpretentious little comedy about body switching, starring SNL alum Rob Schneider. The basic story is that a bitchy, head cheerleader type has her body changed with that of a 30'ish down on his luck burglar and all around loser (Schneider)...after that, hilarity (mostly) ensues.<br />It's your typical fish out of water comedy (or should I say fish in someone else's body comedy). We see Schneider as he tries to find a way to revert things, while hiding from her boyfriend, friends, family and school authorities, with the help of a few of her girlfriends (including Anna Faris in a hilarious role as a not so bright cheerleader).<br />While it'll never be in any AFI comedy lists, you get to spend some good times with this film. Just plain comedy, &aacute; la Rob Schneider.
B0000029GA|5.0|this album is already 5 stars out of 5 average, so it doesn't really need any help from me, but i'll give it 5 stars anyway to even up the wack review &quot;'A Music Fan' from USA&quot; gave it...<BR>one of the most streetwise, dead on, lyrically hungry albums i've ever heard...<BR>sure to only impress hardcore heads, you actually have to LISTEN to this album to like it, not keep it in the background and expect to be won over by some whoosy rap-singing over an R&amp;B beat...<br />HAHA, you can tell i hate jigga...
B00005QXXO|4.0|This EP is one of the best value Radiohead albums out there. Most hard core fans have seen the band live at least a couple of times and understand that live the songs take on a completly different meaning. The songs take on a new meaning when they have to make them work live. And boy do they work.<BR>Buy it now and listen to it loud with headphones on...<BR>But remember &quot;true love waits&quot;
B00001MXWX|4.0|The show is better with repeated viewings... It successfully shows a Zion like community and perhaps all that idealism is reflected in Picard where he deals with an issue that's just as pertinent as survival, how we use our power.
0156027321|1.0|I bought this book based on all the positive reviews I read on Amazon.<br />This book failed on many levels:<br />1. Does not inspire you to believe in God as it promises.  In other words, the philosophy it wants to reveal is lost, just as Pi was lost in the Pacific.<br />2. Very gory.<br />3. Slow reading.<br />4. Lack of character development for Pi.<br />While I can see why some people liked it, it is neither great literature nor inspirational.  Do not waste your time.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is one of only 3 performers to have charted singles in the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and 2000's.  Five decades of hits in this one CD - what more could one want?
B00008J2DQ|5.0|...and better than ever! The familiar sound that is Godsmack, along with the new added energy of drummer Shannon Larkin meld perfectly to create Godsmack's best effort yet...With Sully's aggressive and addictive vocals, to Shannon's strong in your face beats, this cd is the Total Package! The Lineup of tracks is amazing with songs like I F*cking Hate You and Dead and Broken that contain a graceful rage that only Sully Erna can deliver.  Also on this cd is a truly mesmerizing end track entitled Serenity that overflows with tribal beats and haunting vocals and harmonies.  Serenity is to Faceless as Voodoo is to Godsmack and Spiral is to Awake...a Godsmack trademark!  This cd is a MUST have for your Godsmack collection, or the perfect starter...this is a cd you can listen to from beginning to end, something you can't do with most of what's out there...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for...a long time, and I must say, this is definetly the best installment in the Next Generation movies.  Perhaps nothing could measure up to the original movies, but his movie is great!

B00001U0DP|5.0|Probably the best film I've seen in my life. It has everything... a very original plot, humour, pathos, love &amp; harsh reality. The period has also been captured beautifully. A once-in-a-lifetime creation. Mr.Benigni will find it very difficult to make a film like this again.
B00005JLH3|4.0|If you are looking for great acting or a compelling story don't look here.  But if you want to see some incredible music and beautiful directing looking here.  Charles Stone III should have received an Oscar nomination for this film or at least it should have received a cinematography nomination.  As a white boy in Alabama I knew about these bands, but I did not know the culture surrounding them.  Drumline will give you an appreciation for how hard these kids have to work to make such beautiful half time shows.  On another note I would like to thank Mr. Stone for not making the white kid in the movie the typical stereotyped goofy/can't dance/liberal guilt type of guy.  Instead the white guy is there because he wants to play music (but first he tells his roomates that he is there because he really loves black people.  Very funny line).   This is a beautiful movie and I highly recommend it.   I would give it 5 stars, but the story is only so so.
B00005AWMF|5.0|One of the greatest cd's ever.  Sade has a voice that is so wonderful and sexy she could sing about the time you broke down by the side of the freeway with a flat tire and you'd think you had a great time.<br />Every song on this \\"best of\\" cd is worth listening to over and over.<br />Sade gets into your mind and heart and soul with her voice, this cd is a must have.
B000002HAF|5.0|I am still in shock when I listen to each song on this album. Truly amazing. How the heck did this come out in 1988? So original.
0553106635|5.0|This book &amp; series is so amazing thus far thats its un fricken believable! Ive read PLENTY of fantasy but, Martin's deft skill at &quot;believable&quot; character development is supreme in my opinion. I think i truly like each character &amp; how is that??...oh except for the Freys &amp; Joffrey.(lol) what makes the series so great is that it delivers on ALL aspects. There isnt a weak point.  NONE! The plot &amp; the way in which the story moves is just as strong &amp; in depth as the characters themselves.  How can somebody give this less than 5 stars??? There isnt a series out there that can even come close to touching it. &amp; Yes it's for a more mature audience...so what! Thats what the genre needs...frankly im tired of the touchy feely long lost hero garbage that can be read by 7 yr olds.  This is true writing skill...i can go on &amp; on. <BR>            Speaking for the first 3 books....  <BR>         If your looking for the best~LOOK NO MORE.
0553573411|4.0|I enjoyed these books much more than I expected to. They're solid, workmanlike fantasy, not works of literary genius, but fun to read.<br />Sentence-level writing is smooth though not particularly artistic. Characters are generally appealing, and I like the way the author develops a limited number of people over time rather than constantly adding more \\"names\\". The protagonist is believable and has a solid first-POV voice. Generally, the characters seem real and human. Two exceptions are the wolf, whose behavior doesn't quite match with real wolf biology, and Regal, who is too much of a cardboard villain, though he does get some motivation in this volume.<br />Plenty happens in the plot, but overall the book is too long and becomes slow; it could have stood to have quite a bit cut. But at least the things that happen are exciting and make sense, and the end is dramatic. The setting isn't as detailed or vivid as I might wish, but it does go beyond the standard pseudo-medieval pap.
B00003CX6P|4.0|A great movie - taut screenplay, astounding cinematography. The beauty of Mediterranean Europe &amp; the period have been captured beautifully. Jude Law is amazing. He is so expressive... every look, every gesture!<BR>If there is a flaw, I think it is Matt Damon. A little too wooden for my liking. Matt Dillon would have been a better choice as the sinister Mr. Ripley. Or Leonardo DiCaprio. But still, a great film.
0141301155|5.0|This book needs very little encouragement. Its fame transcends any critical reviews that could never do it justice. Dahl's imagination is truly justified in this fabulous rags-to-riches children's tale. I highly recommend this to any young readers. Parents do yourselves a favor and read this to your child before you share the movie with them. Although Gene Wilder and the colorful sets and actors couldn't have been outdone by any other reproduction of this classic, it is better to read, then watch, than it is to watch, then hope for them to read. They'll thank you for it later. Happy reading!
0385507755|5.0|This is an amazing, powerful book. Some of the poor reviews that are posted must be from readers who just don't get it. James Frey is incredible and I enjoyed every minute of this emotional book. Buy it now, you won't be able to put it down!
B000000JO3|5.0|You don't have to be a punk, straight edge, or whomever to appreciate Minor Threat. Great vocals and energy make this album a must have. It's also interesting to see the band develop musically from the first track \\"filler\\" to the last track \\"salad days\\". Also, \\"salad days\\" demonstrated the end of an era in DC hardcore. Luckily, Ian M. when on to great things with Fugazi.
B00008VGL6|5.0|OK, I'm gonna be honest so that people don't get confused since we have all these Depeche fanatics reviewing this album.<BR>The album sound NOTHING like Depeche Mode and is not supposed to. It is basically Martin Gore's visions through other artists' tunes that he enjoys. <BR>It is NOT supposed to be listened to in a car, or in any noisy environment whatsoever. It is simply an album to turn off the lights and get really stoned. And you know what? It really works...it is just as druggy as Pink Floyd, for example. So buy it for that reason. Very nice job by Martin.
0553573403|5.0|I will not/cannot review this book due to the fact that any info given will ruin the story.  Martin unfolds twist after twist and it will absolutely captivate at every page turned.<br />You will never want to read another series again.  Ever.
B000059XUO|3.0|The Crow is a fine movie, but not great. It is a very dark tale surrounding a man who returns from the dead to seek revenge on the killers of his fiancee and him 12 months earlier. <br />The Crow's popularity arguably stems from the tragic death of Brandon Lee only days before filming was completed.  I remember when the film first came out - people flocked to see it because they had heard of the trick photography used to complete the scenes they still needed Brandon's character for.  People were curious to see if it was noticeable.<br />The actual crow adds much appeal to a seemingly dull storyline.  I have to agree with another reviewer that this bird was the second best actor in the film besides Brandon.  Where did they find that clever bird?<br />The DVD I saw was an early release of this film and the transfer was appalling.  I am sure fans of the film will be pleased to hear that a new DVD with excellent transfer, sound quality and extras is now available.
0141301066|5.0|In the Fourth Grade, my elementary school hosted a book fair on the night of Open House. Because my parents posessed little money, I was used to the idea of not getting anything frivolous other than on my birthday or Christmas. Needless to say, I was surprised when my mother asked me which one I wanted. She told me she was proud of me for never getting into trouble and for getting good grades at school, so she thought I deserved to get something, even if money WAS tight. Looking over shelf after shelf of books, I spotted a group of books that looked somehow familiar. The year before, I had been introduced to chapter-books, starting with a short book entitled \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", by Roald Dahl. I had loved that book so much that not only did I finish it before the rest of my class, but I read it twice before giving it back. So when I saw these groups of books by the same author, I knew I had to pick one. All of them looked good, but the one that stood out the most was \\"Matilda\\". I read the first 5 pages just standing there. This was the book. I had to have it. At only the age of 9, I read that entire book in only four days. Since then, I have read it more times than I can count. At the age of 20, I have introduced the very same copy to my 10-year-old niece and she, too, is hooked. To date, I have found no other book, (children's novel or adult), that has given me more joy to read than \\"Matilda\\". It's perfect for any little girl.
B00008DDXC|4.0|As most would certainly agree, this film outperforms its predecessor.  The action is a bit livelier, with some unpredictable jolts that can shake a viewer in a dark room.  The producers manage to keep the plot entertaining for a range of ages by peppering it with adult humor, as well as ageless action scenes.<br />Unless the name &quot;Harry Potter&quot; draws a scowl from a family member, most any person with children, or the heart of a child, will want to add this movie to their collection.  Even if you don't buy this one, it's worth renting.
B000083E79|5.0|There have been several Cher &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilations over the years, but this one is the best.  While I would have preferred they dropped the 2 songs with Sonny and included a few more of her hits (e.g., &quot;The Way of Love,&quot; &quot;Love and Understanding,&quot; &quot;We All Sleep Alone,&quot; &quot;Living in a House Divided&quot; and &quot;Train of Thought&quot;), and put in the original version of &quot;A Different Kind of Love Song&quot; (far better than the remix version on this CD), I nitpick.  This is still a good representation of her songs from the 60's to today.  The range of music is pretty amazing, and only Cher can carry it off.  She's not technically the best singer, but her voice is distinctive and sounds appropriate for rock, country, pop, and dance.  Everyone I know that has listened to this CD has loved it.
B00008LDPU|3.0|The animation is fantastic. Any animation fan should see this work, but also should pay attention to how, even with the best animation, good voice direction and dialog writing can make a piece weak. <br />In \\"Program\\" , it is the most apparent. Some of the most beautifully drawn animation I've ever seen with flat uninteresting dialog in the writing and delivery.<br />This reminds me a bit of Final Fantasy. Again, a piece of excellent ly done ground breaking animation, but the voice direction was weak and writing terrible.<br />I hope this opens the doors for most animation and maybe, someday, we'll get our cake and get to eat it too.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I came across quite a few reviews bashing this movie as being too scary for children, because those morons at Disney tried to market it as a kid's movie. Well, it is suited towards more mature tastes as it has a charm and creative style that Disney only wishes it could emulate. Oh, and all you people calling this movie \\"too weird\\" shouldn't even bother with Miyazaki movies, why don't you watch something stupid, trite, and generic like Pocohantas and other such Disney trash, since your closed minds can't stand new and exciting ideas.
B00003CWTH|1.0|Yes, it's a greatly crafted film, but I'm just f___g sick and f___g tired of hearing the &quot;f&quot; word every other f___g sentence, especially for three hours.
B000089A07|4.0|This latest release continues the tale of Dr. Hannibal Lecter through a vicarious interaction with an obsessive killer.  The movie captures the past and present day life of Hannibal while providing the viewer, atleast those who have not read the books, with some of the background on how he was caught.<br />The movie maintains the suspense of the original, though certainly not as chilling as the Silence of the Lambs.  A very solid rental. With the exception of the advid fan, most movie buyers should pass on this and save thier money. ...
B00005YW4H|5.0|Now all these negative reviews are given mostly because some individuals jump on any artist who gets enough hype, and then becomes confused with what was the big deal. People have different tastes so you can't expect an artist to be well received by EVERYONE. But the truth was Norah herself didn't expect to receive this much attention. It's just that the praise and awards given to her was based on her giving music another outlook instead of the way it seemed it was going. Every year after the next, music became more commercial and less about ACTUAL talent. But then came Norah with her mellow, beautiful sound that's not easy to place in one specific genre. And that's a good thing! <BR>    For people who are are not sure to get this album, you should be told that this is not for everyone. It has a country/folk/jazz vibe that not everyone can get into. And unless you really LISTEN to the album and not just hear it, the whole album will sound the same to you. It's not an album you can jump up and dance or groove to. It's more of a smooth album that you can relax to and listen while you try to get in a calm mood. It's mostly slower pace, but the truth is that our pace of life is so fast today that we need somethings to take things down. And that's what this album does.<BR>It's not easy to get into. But if you do you'll realize that maybe all the praise she got was well deserved. This album is simply beautiful! <BR>  <BR>Note: Previously I gave this album 4-stars. But after listening to it again I realized that this album is now one of my favorites, and it's deserving of 5-stars. There's so many great songs on it. It doesn't stop with \\"Don't Know Why\\". \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", \\"Come Away With Me\\", \\"Painter Song\\", \\"Lonestar\\", \\"The Nearness of You\\", \\"I've Got to See You Again\\", \\"Feelin' the Same Way\\" are definite standouts. I know I listed almost all of the songs but this album is that good! They all continue to stick out in my mind. She has just gained a devoted fan.
B000060MY6|1.0|After reading all those good critic reviews I decided to the film. I tell you it one waste of my time and money (thanks to God I didn't buy the tape I just rented it- still a buck is a buck). The movie starts so well - crime, suspence, a little detective story. What the hell happened after the scene in the theatre? I didn't understand a single thing. <BR>I am sure that I will never watch any of Lynchs films, never.
B00000099Y|5.0|It is very difficult to select a single Tool album as the best, because all of them are tremendous.  Alongside Lateralus, I'd have to say this is my favorite, though.  Many people claim that Tool is the greatest band of all time, and I won't dispute that, but I don't believe that most people who say that have any clue as to why it is true.  As far as originality goes, Tool is very original, especially with their layered guitars and strange beats.  Maynard has an amazing voice, capable of soaring vocal solos and quiet whispers that sound great and blend well with the music.  On Aenima, though, it sounds as if they were trying to change their sound, and it worked out for the better.  Opiate and Undertow are also superb, but of all their songs, Eulogy strikes me as a masterpiece.  It is, of course, a eulogy to Jesus Christ, but it is hard to tell if it is sincere or a mockery of Christianity.  The idea is similar to \\"Judith\\" from A Perfect Circle, which is equally mystifying.  Anyway, I'm sure that anyone who is reading this has heard at least one Tool CD, but if you have not heard Aenima, get it today.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is excellent for many reasons. Not only does it have fantastic martial art special effects but it also has a somewhat beleivable story. Who knows we could be living in a matrix because you can't know. If you die you can know if there really is a heaven or a hell but iff you die you can't know if there is a matrix. nobody can't know and the story is multidimensional. Its a love story a sci-fi story a everybody story. Everyone who sees this movie will love it.
B00006F7IM|4.0|The best in the series of the Major League series.  A little corny and predictable but entertaining.  Berenger plays the role of a veteran catcher and Snipes and Sheen play characterful rookies.<BR>But I am a baseball fan and could be considered biased.
B00005JL78|3.0|I agree with most of the other people who rated the content of this movie.  It is a great movie, and I have it on DVD.  However, the DVD quality is sub-par, especially by today's standards.  This DVD looks about as grainy as DVD's you'll see of movies released ten years ago.  I am not exaggerating here...and what is even more amazing is that the actual movie section of the DVD is 5.54GB, which is more than enough for excellent quality.  I assume that the original filming of this movie was not all that great, although it looked fine in theaters.  Oh well...I would give the DVD 5 stars if it wasn't for its poor quality.
0440237688|4.0|I would like to start off by saying that I've never in my life read a book quite like this. I've read many kinds of books and this book is very unique.<br />This story's main character is a boy names Jonas. Jonas is a smart boy and I liked his personality. Jonas lives in a community that is unlike any other; his community is under what they call Sameness. No color, no differences, no snow, etc. Such things would make it boring to live their. But, of course, no one knows of those things, so they're perfectly happy.<br />There is one person though that knows about all the joyful and painful things of the normal world, the world they call Elsewhere. He is called The Giver and was chosen to hold all of the memories of the past that no longer exist in their community.<br />Now, Jonas has been selected to become the next Giver, and he must face the difficulty and pain of receiving memories.<br />The reason I only gave this book four stars instead of five was because of a weird and creepy ritual. You'll figure out what it is.<br />If you're getting bored of normal fiction books, I would suggest to read The Giver.
B000002AVF|5.0|I listened to all of my old cd's and ran across Mariah's Daydream CD and it reminded me how good of an album it was.  I enjoyed listened to the whole CD, but the standouts where Fantasy, Underneath the Stars, One Sweet Day, Always Be My Baby, and Forever.  But out of all the songs on the CD, my favorite is definitely Melt Away, a Babyface-produced song that really captures Mariah's singing ability and her vocal range.  It's also very addictive!!!  After I heard it for the first time in years, I listened to it about 5 more times!!  I don't know why she didn't release it as a single, but I oh well.  I would highly recommend anyone to buy this album if they don't have it by now.  And check out #9 (Melt Away)...you won't be disapointed.
B00005JLD4|4.0|Based on a true story, this film tells the tale of Gracie, Daisy, and Molly (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, Laura Monaghan), three half-white, half-Aborigine children who, in acordance with official Australian policy, were kidnapped from their home and sent to a boarding school to train for life as domestics so that they could enter the white world, thereby &quot;rescuing&quot; them from a supposedly inferior black world.  Unwilling to endure the seperation from their loved ones, the girls dedicate themselves to escaping back to their home.  The three untrained child actors deliver stunning, authentic performances.  Kenneth Branagh's performance as policy director A.O. Neville is chilling because he honestly seems to care about what happens to the children of the Stolen Generations, as they are called, even though his policy is based upon dangerous, vile racist principles and total disregard for the humanity of the aboriginal peoples.
B00006GA4C|5.0|\\"Nothing is the Same\\" caught my interest the most. The demo they recorded here could have been released, and stood a better chance of being a \\"hit\\" record, than the \\"filler\\" they turned it into on the \\"Closer to Home\\" record 6 months later. Of course, had it been released in its earlier form, they would have maybe stood the chance of being sued by Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce, because Mel's 'shadow' lead bass to open the song sounds suspiciously like he's plaing the riff to \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" on bass! And the way Don Brewer then joins in on drums sounds like Ginger Baker! Hmm, sounds like an original bass intro was in order before the song could be released for good! Otheer than that, this version of the song sounds so much more upbeat and happy than the latter version--the 'joy' of learning a new song, perhaps? But after 5 months of re-tooling it for the next album, the fire that was had here seemed to go out of the latter performance. True, Mel found an original bass line to open the song, and Don's drumming on the \\"Closer to Home\\" version has a little more style and finesse, but the arrangement here still sounds better--especially, with what Mark did with his guitar playing. There's just more guitar on this one, and it sounds more exciting that way. Toward the end, Mark just says \\"to heck with it\\", and starts thrashing out power chords repeatedly that remind me a lot of Neil Young at the end of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\". Like I said, this version would have been great to be released \\"as-is\\", and would have fit in perfectly with the rest of the songs on this album (especially between \\"In Need\\" and \\"Winter and My Soul\\"). This bonus track was the main reason I bought this album, even though I already have the \\"Grand Funk-Import\\". I liked the song from \\"Closer To Home\\" and was interested in what an earlier version sounded like.<BR>The extended version of \\"Mr. Limosine Driver\\" is okay--it's got more guitar parts than the \\"edited-for-release\\" version. Of course, anything that has extra guitar parts from Mark Farner is exciting to listen to! Of course, the guys can't be blamed for being ripped-off themselves--I'm referring to Black Sabbath coming out with their own \\"Paranoid\\" 6 months later. Make no mistake, the \\"Paranoid\\" here IS the original, and in my opinion, was sonically the loudest, heaviest song to come out in 1969, and FAR heavier than even the one that rip-off group Black Sabbath came out with later. But that track is still my personal highlight of this album, and sounds even better after the re-mastering! That, and the early version of \\"Nothing Is The Same\\" makes my favorite hard rock album of all time even better than before!
B00005JKPF|4.0|Although still a bit cluttered and slow-moving in parts, this was a vast improvement on the first \\"X-Men\\" film, which I thought was a complete dud. A couple of things are happening: first, obviously, special effects technology is finally catching up to the imaginative stretch of the early comicbook artists, and the action is starting to look cool enough to be convincing and fun. The opening sequence with the teleporting Nightcrawler is a good example -- not true, perhaps, to the character's original power as seen in the '70s, but very cool onscreen.<br />Second, the studios are starting to get a sense of how to pace these things. For some reason movie producers who take on comicbook plots always seem to feel the need to endlessly stop the plot dead so we (the audience) can stare at the heros and bask in their awesome presence, a legacy, I'm afraid, of the uber-dismal \\"Batman\\" franchise. Personally, as a longtime comicbook reader, I just want them to get on with it and hit me with some action! I'm way over the point where it's amazing to me that these characters are on screen -- I want to see them do stuff. This film did a pretty good job moving in that direction. They assumed a fair amount of familiarity with the various characters, and that the audience for this film was prepared to see amazing and uncanny powers manifest themselves onscreen, and the tendency to explain, explain, explain was minimized in favor of action. The pacing of the action was a bit slow (it felt like they were just padding the movie at times) but in general they seem to be getting the idea. At the end of the film I thought, what they really need is to get to the point where making these blockbusters is as routine and as fluid a process as producing the comics -- if we were up to, say, X-Men Movie #12, I bet things would be a lot smoother and more fun. I've got my fingers crossed that this is the direction we're headed.
B00003CX5P|1.0|George Lucas, Inc. has just showed how farhe will go to make a few extra million for his empire (yes, kids, George Lucas is on the Dark Side).  This was the most garbage pulled together into 2 and 1/2 hours since B-movies were in theirhaydey. A cast devoid of any character and personality, unconvincing computer generated special effects, and a trite science fiction plot leave this movie with few redeeming qualities.  <br />This is an excellent case study for business school school students interested in marketing:  A prime example of brilliant marketing of a mediochre product.  Therein lies the talent of George Lucas ,et al.  Only Disney could compete with George Lucas for such sheer marketing gimickry.<br />Yes. we have every right to be bitter with George Lucas!
0452282152|4.0|A nice read. Short, simple story and yet one that will likely almost haunt you a bit after you have read it.
0679735909|5.0|Much literature is inspired by -- and helps us cope with -- the inconvenient fact that sexual love escapes management and intrudes violently into life. A. S. Byatt stands out for her celebration of characters who face this emotional challenge with humanity and intelligence, and who in many cases make literature out of, and for, this confrontation.<br /><br />Possession is immersed in this endeavor. It is populated with a largish number of people who pair up into couples (about seven overlapping couples, depending on how one counts them) and who have the common trait of using literature to understand, express, expurgate, and even conduct their sentimental lives. Their relations with literature range from living out profound Breton myths, to vulgar (needless to say, American) mercenary aggression. Possession's portrayal of contemporary academia, especially of life in the stacks, is at least as compelling as its gothic passages, and indicates more accurately than the plot's romantic elements the audience that Byatt is implicitly writing for.<br /><br />Readers are mainly impressed with Possession's over-fullness, and yet Byatt chose restraint on some subjects that might easily have grown into novels of their own. The handling of the romantic poet's wife (Ellen), her rival's partner (Blanche), and her eventual biographer (Beatrice) is in each case discrete to a point that could be maddening for readers who think that the personage deserves a larger volume of sympathetic ink.<br /><br />I would speculate that this discretion is partly the result of Byatt's desire to let light have at least a moral victory over darkness in Possession's final balance. A consolatory ending seems meant to vindicate the principal couple's decision to accept the tragic outcomes that might be (and were) the cost of reaching for transcendent experiences.<br /><br />This optimism, along with the luminescent emotion of Ash's and LaMotte's moments alone in nature -- their meeting in Richmond Park and their afternoon at Boggle Hole -- are what may well propel Possession into the ranks of the works of high literature that are read decade after decade and that are considered the Great Books.<br /><br />Possibly Byatt felt this.

B00008V2VM|5.0|This move takes place in a post-World War III society (named Libria) where feelings and emotions are prohibited by law and its citizens are kept under control by state mandated drug use. John Preston (Christian Bale) is Libria's top enforcer and is ruthless in his enforcement of Libria's code of personal conduct until one day he forgets to take his required drug dosage. Preston then develops feelings for a woman he arrests as well as begins to appreciate the arts, crafts and books that he had no regard for as a Librian official and then joins Libria's resistance. The action is almost non stop throughout the film while it addresses many philisophical issues as well regarding personal freedom and tolerance which have been seen and addressed in other movies before. This film has elements from movies like &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;THX-1138&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and packs a whallop action-wise. All of the elements work out as far as I am concerned. It all comes together and is done very well. You won't be disappointed with this film. I wasn't.
B00005YW4H|5.0|this cd is great for any mood. i love norah jones' bluesy music. its a great variation of slow bluesy songs w. jazzier ones. its great music for driving because it just makes you so happy, there will be no road rage when you are listening to norah!
0312305060|5.0|&quot;The Hours&quot; is an incredible book. If you are up for it, try reading Virginia Woolfe's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; first. It is not an easy read, but it's a short one and even if you dont make it all the way through I think it really adds a lot to &quot;The Hours&quot; to understand the parallels Cunningham draws between his own story and Woolfe's.
B000000993|3.0|this is, in my opinion, tool's weakest album, but it's not bad.  it starts off strong with \\"intolerance,\\" \\"prison sex\\" and \\"sober.\\"  it slows down a little for the mediocre \\"bottom\\" but gains momentum again with the pretty good \\"crawl away.\\"  but then it's back down again with \\"swamp song.\\"<br />this album's weakness is tool's tendency to get \\"bogged down\\" with the song structures.  some of this was intentional due to the subject matter, but just because a song is called \\"flood\\" or \\"swamp song\\" doesn't mean you should feel like you're hearing it from inside a swamp!  they should have added more interesting parts to the songs like on aenima (my favorite tool album) or even made them straightforward hard rock songs like on opiate.<br />so.. 6 great songs + 3 OK songs + 1 song that's not even a song (disgustipated) = 3 1/2 stars.
B0000009SY|5.0|I wasn't into Zappa at all until I heard Act I on the radio (which prompted me to buy the Album). All the songs on Act I are just great and extremely witty! On vinyl Act I was a separate release (Acts II &amp; III were later released as a double LP).<BR>I was slightly dissapointed by Acts II &amp; III but they do have some good songs and great guitar work. Act I however has no equal anywhere and is an album I listen to again and again. Warmly recommended.
0316666343|4.0|i love the point of view... the little girl killed in this story tells us how it went down from her place in heaven. although this book didnt make me think &quot;I CANT PUT THIS DOWN!&quot; it was an interesting read, very sad but a good read. i reccomend this for anyone.
B00008LDPU|5.0|State of the art anime with the best talents from this world, mixed with the extreme storyline of The Matrix, unleashes a cool to watch and very amazing collection of short stories.<BR>Theres no need to say the first animation, called The Final Flight Of The Osiris, is one of the best animations ever made.  For the fans of the Matrix, The 2 episodes of The Second Renaissance reveals in depth plots and background about this visionary trilogy.  And also the last episode A Kids Story, reveals the history behind a character which appears in the second movie The Matrix Reloaded.  It is obvious who it is when you watch it.  So, it is a must buy if you like animation, both japanese or aeon flux style.  Specially if you have a good home theatre set at home, to experience the digital sound.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Rarely is the second movie as good as the first. This one was actually better! X-Men could readily replace Star Trek (and most definitely Star Wars) as the new sci-fi movie franchise. I am looking forward to a third (any rumours?).
B00005UKE0|5.0|All Things Must Pass is an excellent album put together by the most under rated artist ever. The album consists of several songs that you will never get sick of. This is a CD that you will listen to many times and still feel the original pizzaz when you first bought it. While it is easy listening and calm, All Things Must Pass still has that rock and roll characeristic to it that I love. This CD is better than all of Paul McCartney's and John Lennon's solo careers combined. YOU MUST GET THIS.
B00004U2G4|4.0|Jeff Beck's most innovative and creative work was made between the years 1965-68, beginning with the Yardbirds and then with the first lineup of the Jeff Beck Group, who recorded their debut album &quot;Truth&quot; in 1968.  On the basis of these few years alone, Beck deserves a place as one of rock's two or three greatest guitarists, and &quot;Truth&quot; gives the listener an example of his genius when he was still a groundbreaking pioneer.<br />&quot;Truth&quot; basically sounds like a blueprint for Led Zeppelin's<BR>first album; you have the supergroup formula of previously<BR>unknown virtuoso singer, thunderously heavy rhythm section and<BR>amplified psychedelic blues heroics laying the groundwork for<BR>heavy metal.  The two albums even share a cover of &quot;You Shook Me&quot;: play them both to compare.  &quot;Truth&quot; is only slightly less impressive than &quot;Led Zeppelin I&quot;, although it gains points for having been released a whopping seven months earlier.  Rod Stewart *never* sounded better, particularly on epics like &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot;, where his sincerity and unpretentiousness is a stark contrast to his current image.  Nicky Hopkins plays some brilliant piano, and Micky Waller's thumping drum style very much parallels John Bonham's.  Speaking of Zep, both Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones appear with Hopkins and Keith Moon on &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot;, a soaring psych instrumental recorded when Beck was still in the Yardbirds and a truly tasty confection that remains a high point in his<BR>entire career. <br />Beck's guitar work essentially picks up right where he left off on The Yardbirds' 1966 &quot;Roger The Engineer&quot; album, with the addition of an ear-shattering wah-wah on tracks like &quot;You Shook Me&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot;.  The blues quotient is also a bit higher, and he lays down some fine licks and solos that fit right in with the heavy atmosphere of the time.  A coverof &quot;Shapes Of Things&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot; provide moments of psychedelic greatness, while &quot;Morning Dew&quot; features some very sensitive, emotional playing.  Beck's unique style colors even his interpretation of &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, which  foreshadows the acoustic interlude sections of later metal albums (think &quot;Orchid&quot; on &quot;Master Of Reality&quot;).  <br />I still slightly prefer &quot;Zep I&quot;; Page's band was a little<BR>tighter, the production was a little better, and Plant was even more awesome than Stewart.  But for anyone who likes The Yardbirds, early Zep or early metal in general, this is an easy pick and the best tracks here (&quot;Shapes Of Things&quot;, &quot;Morning Dew&quot;, &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot;, &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot;) are about as good as rock gets.

B00005JLRT|4.0|This is a really good action packed &quot;star trek movie&quot;.  The story is really well thought out, and i don't have anything bad to say about it.  It could have been a little longer maybe, since it goes by so fast.  One thing i did notice is that a lot of star trek stuff lately (including nemesis) deals with &quot;what it means to be human, and 'human qualities'...&quot; Which is one of the climactic statements made in the very first movie when Vger merges with a human to become more than just a machine, which incidentally is what has been going on with data since the very beginning.  I am almost sure that there will be another star trek movie, and i hope they choose to go in a new direction with the movie.  Some work in the Delta or Gamma quadrants would be nice, and incorporating other characters in a grand scale would really bring in viewers and satisfy the fans.  WE'LL just have to wait and see.
0140072187|5.0|I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed this book until I read it again with my 13 year old son.<BR>Mason's experiences place you into a world unknown to all but those who were there. His vivid recollections of war, flying, fear, and the balance needed to survive the daily routines and extream personalities left me with a deep respect for the veteran soldier. I'm happy to say that my son enjoyed \\"Chickenhawk\\" also, and has most of his 8th grade friends reading it.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead have taken elements of the past - Pink Floyd, John Lennon, elements of jazz, progressive Brit guitar pop (Pale Saints, Catherine Wheel) - and turned them into something completely new. They've written their own Rhapsody in Blue to the modern age, to the cities, to the destruction and regeneration of the society that lives within them.<br />They create sweeping symphonies of lush despair (\\"Pyramid Song\\"; \\"Morning Bell\\"; OK Computer's \\"The Tourist\\"; Kid A's \\"How to Disappear Completely\\"), jazzy odyssies (\\"Dollars & Cents\\"; \\"The National Anthem\\"), and prog rock freakouts (\\"Knives Out\\"; Kid A's \\"Optimistic\\"; OK Computer's \\"Paranoid Android,\\" \\"Lucky\\"). I wouldn't say they dabble in electronica, since even some of their chillier moments of electronic distortion and madness (\\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\"; \\"Everything in It's Right Place\\") make sense in the future-forward worldview of Radiohead. As do hauntings of the past - the Tin Pan Alley/phonograph recording of \\"You And Whose Army,\\" the speak-n-spell vocoder of \\"Packt Like Sardines In a Crushd Tin Can.\\" All of it works together, to construct and define their vision of the future, built from the past.<br />But even with the use of such traditionally analog instruments as piano, strings and horns, Radiohead still manages to sound completely alien. I think it's Thom Yorke's voice. He reminds me of Peter Gabriel. Not that he sounds like Gabriel in any way, but that his voice, like Gabriel's, seems to come from a completely alien place. Where Peter can sound, at times, almost beastly and tribal, Thom always manages to sound not quite human - a nearly indecipherable alien whine. Floating atop a cushion of piano and strings (\\"Pyramid Song\\") or acoustic guitar and effects (\\"How to Disappear Completely\\"), it can comfort and chill at the same time. Chopped through a vocoder, he sounds like how you might have expected 2001's Hal to sound had it not been impregnated with megalomaniacal feelings.  Does a starship computer really need to feel?<br />I have been endlessly impressed by these records - OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac. They have erected skyscrapers in my brain, glass castles in the sky, and shown me the way our future will look and sound. For them, it may be escapism. For me, it's a destination.eally need to feel?<br />I have been endlessly impressed by these records - OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac.

B00008CMR6|4.0|Rio Lobo is a good John Wayne western that borrows from several of his previous movies.  The story is about a Union colonel trying to find out who the traitor was in his unit that sold information about gold shipments to Confederate guerillas.  Along the way he helps a town escape the wrath of a rich landowner and a corrupt sheriff.  The story may seem similar, but this still is a very entertaining movie.  What John Wayne movie isn't?  The story blends action and story together in this exciting western.<br />  The Duke is great once again as Cord McNally, the Union colonel in pursuit of traitors.  Jorge Rivero is awkward as Pierre \\"Frenchy\\" Cordona, the Confederate guerilla who helps Wayne.  I don't know whether it is actually Rivero talking or someone dubbing his lines in, but it just sounds funny.  Joining them are Jennifer O'Neill, Christopher Mitchum, Jack Elam, and Victor French.  Elam is great as usual in his role as the eccentric old man in the town.  The DVD has a good widescreen presentation that looks cleaned up compared to the one shown on TBS.  Otherwise, there isn't any extras added on.  This was Howard Hawks last western, and he made a good one.  Good story and exciting action.  Deserves a watch if nothing else for those who haven't seen this late Duke western!

B00008DDSC|5.0|Be surprised, for this is a love story. I don't want to say twisted. I don't want to say that it's a journey to self fulfillment. Yet, it is. After all, this is Hollywood.<br />Don't be put off by the movie posters. Don't be be turned off by the ad pictures of Spader and Gyllenhaal. Do not step away from the S&amp;M.<br />This is a very, very dark comedy. It can be so much so that it is not immediately obvious that it is a comedy at all. The romance is very strong, yet unconventional.<br />For a submissive character, Gyllenhaal's Lee becomes exceptionally strong, far stronger than Spader's E.Edward the dominant. Here is the heart of the movie, Lee's pivotal strength that pulls both of them from their fears and confidence oblivion.<br />Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack has been said to pinpoint the Lynchness of the movie. The music is excellent yet not as powerful in its involvement as it was in David Lynch's movies and TV. There is a great importance to the lack of music in a number of scenes, drawing the audience into what is happening most electrically.<br />Miss Holloway, come into my office... and bring this movie with you.
B000059TEQ|5.0|This movie is for people with real emotions.I read the book few yrs back and it really touched me .I was very curious to see the cinematic adaptation of the book and lemme tell you folks the movie was as good as the book<br />  Eric Segal is a master of such stories. I suggest that you read his book &quot;Doctors&quot;.

B00008PX8P|5.0|The Red Seas have parted and in comes the Great Led Zeppelin!! (I'm just following the editorial lead...)Seriously, this is truly amazing, I just bought this DVD and sat through most of it. As a Zephead from the '80s, when my adolescence took place, I came to know this material existed. A 15 year wait has come to an end! And I just feel 15 again! It's hard to feel this enthusiastic about music after one reaches the '30', but this DVD has done it. From the photos I always knew they were the coolest looking band, and the video shows why. Plus, it has restored my faith in Led Zeppelin as a live act. The Song Remains wasn't great, and I have bootlegs in which they play horribly, bordering on amateurish...but this DVD shows that when Led Zeppelin rocked, everybody rolled! ;-)
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I saw this movie after having just watched the excellent BBC miniseries production of Pride and Prejudice. It gave me a really bizarre, jarring feeling of disorientation.<br />In this movie, it's sunny all the time, as if they'd filmed it in Los Angeles, not England. The clothes are all technicolor bright and vivid, not the proper drabness of the period. The lighting is electric light-bright. The score is frantically popping in all the time to give you Pavlovian cues of how funny everything is. And everybody is overacting.<br />It's the full-on stereotypical Hollywood treatment, and it's a big disappointment. I couldn't even finish watching it. After you have seen tasteful, mature BBC productions of Austen's works, watching this is like a saccharine, over-the-top schlock-fest. It leaves me anxious to see the BBC Emma; I'm sure that it will be much more to my taste.<br />(That's not to say that Hollywood is incapable of doing Austen right, though; just check out Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility. He really nailed it. What a great director that guy is.)
0385504209|5.0|This book's plot twisted and turned and as I got more and more engrossed in the story, I realized that not everything was as it seemed.<br />I love mysteries and puzzles and this book wove both together flawlessly. I also checked out the Davinci Code's website after I finished reading the book and was delighted to solve the puzzles that led me into the site. You can't enter the site without solving them first. I was impressed that finally an author knew how to offer more to his readers on the web than the typical author bio and reviews of the book!<br />I couldn't put this book down and would recommend it for anyone who loves a good mystery, and a good puzzle.
B00005OAE6|5.0|Bob Seger was on a roll when he cut STRANGER IN TOWN. NIGHT MOVES and LIVE BULLET were both great albums, and, with the exception of the annoying, overplayed \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\", this one is their equal. \\"Till It Shines\\" is a great inspirational number, and the last two songs, \\"Brave Strangers\\" and \\"The Famous Final Scene\\", are, on the surface, about doomed romances. However, dig a little deeper and you'll realize that they could be about ANYTHING that you once held dear yet now find nothing in. This interpretation has led to me skipping my old school's Thanksgiving Dinner so that I can look good for a number of pretty actresses. The fact that Seger, like virtually every other Midwestern, Southern, and California rocker, advocates efforts to free people unjustly imprisoned in foreign countries, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B00008S2VG|5.0|The Material Girl, to the Maternal Girl, to the Mature Girl! Madonna is sensational on this album, and it is the best in years! I would stongly recommend it not only to long-term fans, but to those who have never considered madonna as a serious artist.
0316666343|5.0|What an incredible book.  Once I started reading, I could not put it down!  The extremes of emotion that overwhelmed me while reading this book reflect directly on the talents of the author.  One of the best books I've ever read.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Drone and slur your words, and it must be art, right? Wrong. It's just boring.<br />Two years from now, reviewers will be looking back at this turkey and saying that it was one of the weaker Audioslave disks. Or maybe they'll be saying that it spelled the end of the group.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Nearly 50 years after his first                          recordings, Johnny Cash continues to produce                       music that is as vital, authentic, and heartfelt as            when he first appeared on the scene. This is                    another in a series of albums that Cash has                       recorded on the fittingly named American label                    under the caring ear of producer Rick Rubin.                      Once again, it seems, Rubin's task has been to                    help Johnny come up with suitable material,                       provide him with a band of crackerjack but                        unobtrusive accompanyists, and to get out of                      the way. We all know that Cash could sing the                     alphabet and give it the weight and authority of                   a classic, but these songs seem especially well                  chosen. As one of the few artists to be                           enshrined in both the Country Music and                          Rock&amp; Roll Halls of Fame, Cash stays true to his                  ecumenical tastes with an array of songs from                      such diverse writers as Lennon/McCartney, Paul                   Simon, Sting, Hank Williams and himself. The                      oddest, most daring and most compelling                           selection is his moving rendition of 'Hurt&quot; by                    Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. Cash's voice,                      always a unique and complex instrument which                      paradoxically blends strength and vulnerability,                  is, like the man, more fragile now. Thus these                    songs take on a special poignancy and value.                      We are reminded that, although his music will                    always be with us, the man himself will not.
0312265859|1.0|I had been hearing about Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series for a while, and last summer, borrowed Hard Eight from a colleague for my first-ever Plum read. I started with real anticipation.<br />What a total disapointment. Hard Eight was the lamest book I read all year. Hard to believe that the state of New Jersey allows someone so dense to carry a gun. After a while, so many zany characters in one book can turn into a huge cliche all by themselves. By the end of the book, I kept wishing they would all be packed into one car and blown up.<br />I could almost feel my brain cells dribbling out as I read this train wreck. When I returned the book, and told my friend of my utter incredulity that a publisher would actually produce this, she said that I needed to start at the beginning of the series. Thank you, no. If book number 8 doesn't hold up, then that's a series that should have ended a long time ago. For example, you can pick up James Lee Burke and his Dave Robicheaux series at any point and have a good, independent reading experience. A series should not be dependent on starting with book one. (Yikes, can't believe I mentioned Stephanie Plum in the same paragraph with Dave Robicheaux.)<br />This turkey was flimsy, light-weight, and a waste of time.
B00003CXIY|5.0|I too expected this to be one of the dumb dry teenie-go-round movies and even refused to watch it back when it got released. but, hell what a laugh I missed!! this movie is worth watching it when you really want to spend a couple of hours of fun. the new-comers acting refreshingly different and jokes sometime hillarious (and also, sometimes quite low) let the plot speed along. I really like this one :)
B0000019PA|5.0|[...] I do believe that it is awesome.  The songs are catchy... And the lyrics don't make sense... which is what is fun about them.  They are buried so deeply in metaphor that half of what is great about listen to them is figuring out what the hell he is saying.  And even if you can't figure exactly what he means, you still get the feeling behind his voice.  And yes, he can't sing entirely well.  Not that he is bad, he's just so different and insane sounding that it isn't the traditional \\"good\\" singing that we expect.  [...]

B000001G99|5.0|Wilhelm Kempff's Schubert Sonatas are an interesting contrast with his Beethoven Sonatas.  Both sets are stellar, but  Schubert is more oblique than Beethoven. As Kempff indicates in the liner notes, Schubert makes most of his points in the pianissimo segments of his works.  Schubert meanders to his endpoint, but what a beautiful journey he takes!<br />This discs grow more enjoyable with each pass through the set; there is something new to discover every time.<br />  Of note , the pieces are arranged in reverse chronologic order. It is instructive to listen to the evolution of his music as he attained his mature voice.  Of note is the fact that Schubert only lived to be 31, and that much of his music moldered in cabinets and drawers throughout Europe, unpublished for decades following his death.  This collection of Kempff's 1960s performances feature  splendid DG sound; these interpretations of Schubert will afford permanent listening enjoyment.
0333907221|5.0|This story is great - how a little tiny mouse beats off 4 potential predators with sheer wit - and the tape is hilarious, with wonderful attention to detail which just makes it that much easier to hear for the 456th time!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Wake up and smell the good Ole U S of A!!  This is selective for a reason, it's a movie about the brotherhood of soldiers for Easy Company during WWII.  This is not a movie about other countries and their forces. Just like \\"Blackhawk Down\\" is a movie about U.S. special forces in Mogadishu.  This is a movie about a US unit, it will be from their perspective and memories.  So don't be trying to bash this movie, cause it is centered on US unit it's going to be about a US unit. It pisses me off when you Europeans bash our war movies.  They are our war movies about our US units, thus the movie would be from our soldiers perspectives. Just like \\"IWO JIMA\\" \\"TORA TORA TORA\\" or \\"Battle of Britain\\" don't make references to all the other WWII units involved.<br />This isn't a movie about The German 1st SS Panzer \\"Leibstandarte\\", 5th SS \\"Viking\\", FJR 1/FJD, 1./LL STURM RGT, Fallschirm Pionier Batallion 1.  Neither is this movie about the Russian 49th Guards Rifle Division, 89th Guards Rifle Division, 8th Guards Mechanized Corps, 36th Motorized Rifle Division.  Nor is this about the British 3rd Para Brigade, 8th Army, the British 3rd Division, the 50th Division, the 6th Airborne Division King's Shropshire Light Infantry, the East Yorkshire, and Devonshire regiments.  These countries could make their own movie about what their forces did during WWII, I could care less.  They have a right to make a movie from their soldiers perspectives with them as a center piece, doesn't mean I'll bash it for not showing the US side of things.<br />This movie was centered on one company, Easy Company part of 506th PIR \\"Parachute Infantry Regiment\\", which was part of the 101'st Airborne.  Other main units that were part of the Normandy airdrop were 3rd Battalion 502nd PIR, 506th PIR, and even the 82nd Airborne.  Then came Carentan, Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge, and the Siege of Bastogne.  There were other units involved in all those fights, but this movie wasn't about the other units.  Remeber this isn't about all the other WWII units, this isn't a documentary, its the story soldiers experiences from mainly one company during WWII.<br />And oh by the way, my dad is a US Vietnam Vet.
B00005JKCH|1.0|This movie was mediocre at best.I was reading the other reviews & didn't know if I should laugh or cry.One guy was saying how Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast;I've seen more emotion out of a brick.The people that say the effects were so seemless should rush to the optometrist immediately. I mean come on,I thought I was watching a video game...from a few years ago.This movie is only slightly better than the FF movie from a few years ago.I can't believe the same company that did the effects for LOTR did these effects.Clearly they put all their energy into the far superior LOTR.Thank God Daredevil & X2 came out to wipe the bad taste of a poorly done superhero movie out of my mouth.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I've never been a huge fan of Britney Spears, but this CD helped me to dislike her less. I have heard her other two albums (\\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Britney\\") and am not impressed. There are actually some good moments on \\"Oops...\\", however. The title track sounds too much like her first single, and I usually skip that one, but \\"Stronger\\" is a good pop song with a fun beat; good to dance to. <BR>     \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" is mediocre, probably a filler track, but \\"Satisfaction\\" is a spirited remake of the Rolling Stones original, with Britney adding some sass ...to the otherwise droll song. <BR>     I love \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know,\\" which was co-written by Shania Twain; you can definitely hear the country diva's input in the song. Britney sings it beautifully, which is remarkable considering I could never stand the way she growls on ballads. <BR>     \\"What U See(Is What U Get)\\" is another fun pop song produced from the machine that seems to spit out these predictable songs; however, if you ignore \\"Oops\\" and \\"Stronger\\" you can pretend you've never heard this style before and have fun dancing around to it. <BR>     I know \\"Lucky\\" did all right as a single, but I don't care for it; it does have a few things going for it though. It has a unique '1950s' sound, if you will, and also has a good message about the emptiness that lies beneath the glitz and glamor of Hollywood fame and fortune. <BR>     \\"One Kiss From You\\" is an okay pop song, but the melody is at times indiscernable, and the drum beats get a little annoying, but I do like the lyrics. <BR>     \\"Where Are You Now\\" is Brit's second attempt at singing a ballad on this disc, and I actually like this song a lot (but I prefer the way I sing it, haha). It's a really pretty song, and her voice sounds decent on it. <BR>     \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\" is yet another Max Martin product, and it sounds just like \\"Oops,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" and \\"What U See,\\" but I still like it; in fact, I like this one best- gofigure. <BR>     \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" was written by the phenomenal talent Diane Warren, but I was disappointed with this number. Of course, you wouldn't expect that songwriter to give Britney a song of Celine Dion's caliber, but I still expected more; after all, Diane wrote a great song, \\"All Or Nothing At All\\" for that horrendous boy \\"band\\" O-Town. She could've given Britney a better song. This one features two verses of Brit talking in a breathy voice (ugh!) and a nice, sweet melody in the middle. The result? Terrible! The only thing going for this song is the string part in the background. <BR>     Okay, moving on... Britney's second disc concludes with her self-penned \\"Dear Diary,\\" which I thought was way too juvenile a song for someone of Britney's age, considering the sexy hints she's made on previous songs. The melody is pretty, but the song is made of fluffy substance; I wrote better songs when I was eight years old, and of more mature content. I can't believe it took two other people to write this song with Britney. <BR>But despite the negativities on this CD, it is still far better than her other albums. Unfortunately, with Britney what you see really is what you get, and the over-tanned, over-dyed, overly made-up songstress is only capable of producing overly-manufactured pop songs. On the other hand, Britney is trying to sing, dance, and have fun; she's not trying to be Mozart, or even the next Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey. <BR>     Britney Spears is good at what she does. I do like this CD; it's good to drive around or dance too. You have to be in a light, happy mood to listen to it, because there's really not a lot of substance to it. I'd still recommend it to cheerleading or pom pon squads in need of routines (mine did \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Oops,\\" hahaha!) or happy poppy people. Celine Dion this is not, but it is still fun, and it's the best I've seen of Britney so far, so it deserves four stars on a fluffy pop music scale.
B000002GK1|5.0|I just recently got back into this CD after a long hiatus from early 90's Seattle scene music.  Though I did grow up on stuff like this and other Seattle bands, this album holds a special place in my heart. Badmotorfinger is truly incredible, not as gritty or raw as Louder Than Love, nor as turned down as Superunknown, or that lousy Down on the Upside, it really hits you.  The music is excellent, and as ever Cornell and Co. play off each other to a frenzied pace that leaves a lot of so-called nu-metal in the dust.  Who cannot but remember the classics &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, but every song on this album sounds entirely different from the one that preceded it.  While some friends of mine have tried to convince me, somewhat successfuly, that a lot of early Soundgarden involved politics, this album tunes those down just a hair from Louder than Love, or the Fopp/Screaming Life era.  Although think closely about the lyrics on &quot;New Damage&quot;, or the blasphemous notes on &quot;Holy Water.&quot;<br />Just listen to Thayil's crushing guitars on &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot;, or on the preceding track &quot;Searching with my good Eye Closed.&quot;  Overall this album was not as well known about given that it arrived on the scene at the same time that 'poppish' Nirvana released the over-played &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  Though Soundgarden put out the better effort back in those long past years when Seattle music ruled the scene.  From the same era I would also heavily recommend Alice in Chains Facelift, Dirt, and Sap albums, along with Louder Than Love by Soundgarden.
B00002E23E|1.0|[Bad] concert footage and self-indulgent bio spots that say and do nothing, but that is what Led Zeppelin is; stated better than I,  \\"Zeppelin are the most important band to say nothing\\".  <br />Compare to the \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" and you then see what it should be about.<br />signed,<br />Led Zeppelin fan, but not a Led Zeppelin freak
B00006CXXU|4.0|So here it is, the CD that all Christina Aguilera fans have been waiting for for nearly 3 years. I didn't think it was bad, I thought many of the tracks were nice. <br />BEWARE: If you're looking for happy, upbeat pop songs like \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" or \\"What a Girl Wants\\" do not go buy this CD. Many of the songs are ballads or R&B types. Don't expect to find teenybopper songs, because from this CD, you can tell that Christina is branching out from pop into mainly R&B. <br />There is a bit of cussing on this CD, and some of the pictures in the booklet with the lyrics feature Christina [out of her] clothes. However, there aren't cuss words on every song. I don't think this CD would be appropriate for anyone under 12, especially beacause of some of the words and lyrics. <br />Now for the songs: If you hated \\"Dirrty\\" (one of my favorite tracks on the CD), and you make an assumption that every song will be like this, you're wrong. Like I said, there are mostly ballads and R&B songs here. \\"Fighter\\", \\"Make-over\\", and \\"Can't Hold us Down\\" were great songs, and I loved the powerful feeling of \\"Cruz\\", \\"Soar\\", and \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\". \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Infatuation\\", and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" were also nice. The rest of the album's content were mainly ballads and interludes. <br />Overall, this CD would be a good buy, but not for people expecting (and wanting) teenybopper pop songs.
0789723107|5.0|The only website design I've done is for two sites of my own (one small-business, one for hobbies and such), plus family-photo-type sites for a couple for family members. (The fact that I learned to do this stuff in late middle age seems to astonish people, especially those much younger than me.) But I'm a heavy web-surfer and I'm always interested in design issues generally. Krug has a knack for pointing out things that seem obvious in retrospect, and the wit to keep your attention even while you're making mental notes. He takes you through the process of figuring out what people want in a website -- and then discovering what they *really* want -- but he doesn't take sides in religious arguments (pull-downs, Flash, top vs. side navigation bars). Rather, he describes to look at the possibilities and discover what works best when. The book itself is also very &quot;usable&quot; -- short enough to read on a plane trip, filled with real world examples, amusingly but helpfully illustrated. And I already have a list of changes I plan to make to my own little covey of websites.
630157401X|3.0|I was mightily surprised to see the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this film. Sure, it's wall-to wall high-octane action, but there is a distinct sense that we've seen it all before, and you know what? It was in the first film of the series.<br />I know, I know - Indiana Jones is a paean to the matinee action-adventure films of Spielberg's youth, and it isn't meant to be clever (just as well, because it sure ain't) but any sense of pacing, storyline or (god forbid) acting is ditched in favour of big set pieces and pedal-to-metal ACTION.<br />Indy engages - across several continents - in down-to-the-wire fights on trains, planes, airships, motorbikes, speedboats, tanks and horses, shags the obligatory blonde vixen (who - quelle surprise - turns out not to have his best interests at heart), defeats the Nazis (again) and patches up things with his estranged Dad and never once do you get the feeling that anyone was in this for anything other than the money.<br />It's like about four bad Bond films rolled into one - even to the point of featuring Sean Connery! Indeed, I doubt it was far from the director's mind that Indiana Jones might supplant the long standing (but, by 1990, very tired) 007 franchise as the bankable high thrills, no brains, lotsa-formula blockbuster for the 1990s.<br />Fortunately, Harrison Ford had better things to do.
B000002JOH|5.0|pantera is my favorite band and all 5 of their studio albums are classics.  My favorite pantera album is Far Beyond Driven.  However, lyrically, this is pantera's best one.  There are some songs on here that could be considered thrash.  It also has it's ballads which end up heavy anyway.  Some of dimes best solos are on here.  This, is, however, my least favorite pantera album.  Nothing wrong with it but I just like the other ones better.
B000092T56|5.0|Salma Hayek recieved a well deserved academy award nomination for her fierce performance as the artist Frida Kahlo. It took her many years to get this film made and it was worth the wait. Frida Kahlo had a bus accident that shattered her entire life and would continue to pain her throughout her life. She then met and married Diego Rivera, a fellow artist. She felt she could change his cheating ways, but in the end couldn't, and when she realized this she went into a downward spiral. Then, towards the end of her life she realized that painting was her one true love in life and she becomes a sensation. Of coarse Diego comes back to her because they were meant for each other. The music is fantastic and the costumes are to die for. Alfred Molina deserved an Oscar nomination, but didn't get one. The rest of the supporting cast is brilliant, especially Valeria Golina and Ashley Judd. Salma Hayek and Julie Taymor [director] are at their personal best. It's a shame Salma never recieved a single award for her performance. She has recieved my award though. She was just flat out amazing. I have to admit before I saw this film I didn't think she could really act, but then I saw this film and she just exploded on the screen. Keep up the good work Salma. <BR>WINNER OF 2 ACADEMY AWARDS: BEST MAKEUP, BEST SCORE<BR>NOMINATED FOR 4 MORE OSCARS: BEST SONG \\"BURN IT BLUE\\", BEST COSTUME DESIGN, BEST ART DIRECTION-SET DECORATION AND<BR>                 BEST ACTRESS-MISS. SALMA HAYEK [SHOULD HAVE WON]
B00005JLRT|1.0|I saw the movie and it was horrible; I saw the deleted scenes and thought what the hell are they thinking....Who the hell is in charge over there at Paramount....WHo cares if the movie is 3 hours long...Those scenes should have never been deleted....what a mistake they made!
B000001FV1|5.0|Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood & the gang serve up another barnburning Traffic set with 1973's \\"Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory.\\" The title track is a phenomenal full-throttle rocker, one of Traffic's most powerful pieces. \\"Roll Right Stones\\" is a nearly 12-minute, laid-back jazz-popper, with great melodies & musicianship throughout. \\"Evening Blue\\" is a beautiful ballad, Chris Wood's \\"Tragic Magic\\" is a tasty, funky instrumental, and \\"(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired,\\" despite the downbeat title, is actually a very uplifting tune, filled with great spirit & fine words of wisdom. Steve Winwood & company totally cook on this one: \\"Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory\\" is another jazz/rock classic from Traffic.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I remember getting the SACD of Let It Bleed for my birthday last year (thanks, T and K!).  I listened to it on my way to work in the midst of a traffic jam and I thought the horn honking on \\"Country Honk\\" was an impatient driver honking at me!  But it wasn't, just a prime example of the sound quality on the SACD!<br />That said, on with the review.  LIB is a transitional album of sorts.  During the recording of this album (early-mid 1969), guitarist Brian Jones had become a non-entity (he appears only on \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"You Got the Silver.\\"  Throughout most of LIB, the Stones carry on as a quartet (with cameos from others)as Brian had been asked to leave a month before his untimely death.  Enter Mick Taylor, a versatile guitarist who was able to learn the classic Stones' songs in nearly no time (Mickey T only appears on \\"Country Honk\\" and \\"Live With Me\\").<br />The anarchaic \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is the opening track.  Mary Clayton's backing vocals at the intro almost sound like mourning angels.  Mick Jagger sings of a \\"fire sweeping my very street today.\\"  The chorus warns \\"Oh children, it's just a shot away,\\" but surprisingly ends on a hopeful note \\"Love your sister, it's just a kiss away.\\"  This later became, appropriately, the title of their 1971 documentary (I think most of us know what happenened at Altamont, that's another review!).<br />\\"Love In Vain\\" is almost a relief.  Mick's vocals sound lamenting on this Robert Johnson cover and Ry Cooder provides a lovely mandolin solo.<br />\\"Country Honk\\" is an acoustic version of \\"Honkey Tonk Women,\\" with alternative lyrics, a fiddle (Byron Berline) and an acoustic slide by Mickey T.<br />\\"LWM\\" features Keith Richards on bass, fine guitar duelling between Mickey T and Keith, a tasty sax solo by Bobby Keyes and a great horn section arrangement by Leon Russell.   \\"My best friend shoots water rats and feeds them to the geese.\\"  Indeed, the Stones' transition is complete here.<br />\\"Let It Bleed\\" sounds like a honkey-tonk orgy.  Ian Stewart is featured on the piano.<br />\\"Rambler\\" is one of 2 \\"epics\\" on LIB.  Mick plays the part of a proud and ruthless assassin.  The music starts out with 12 bar blues and speeds up, then slows down, then goes back to 12 bar blues.  Charlie Watts' drums sound fast and furious here.<br />\\"Silver\\" features Keith's lead vocal debut.  Nicky Hopkins is featured on piano and organ and Brian is on autoharp.  Featured in the movie Zabreskie Point.<br />\\"Monkey Man\\" features vibes by bassist Bill Wyman, which blend well with Nicky's piano and Keith's guitar.  Mick's lyrics are surreal at times \\"I'm a cold Italian pizza, I could use a lemon squeezer\\" and other times, apologetic \\"I hope we're not too messianic or a trifle too satanic.\\"<br />Finally, there's the classic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\"  Here, the London Bach Choir is featured at the intro, making it sound like a church hymn.  Al Kooper is featured on french horn, piano and organ and Charlie relinquishes his drumkit to producer Jimmy Miller.  Mick sings of a woman with a \\"footloose man\\" and his friend, Mr. Jimmy who shares a soda with him at the Chelsea Drugstore (\\"my favourite flavour, cherry red\\").<br />Let It Bleed came at the end of the 1960's just when the illusions of flower power were about to be dashed.
B00005JM03|4.0|Trust everybody, just not the devil inside.<br />The stage is set at Venice and the target is thirty-five million dollars worth of gold bullion.  John Bridger, a master safecracker, is about to pull the last job of his career.  Only this time he isnt running the show, that responsibility has been passed on to his successor Charlie Crocker, the mastermind behind the whole scheme.  Everything goes according to plan, until one of them decides to doublecross the rest of the group.  Now, a year after that unfortunate incident, Charlie finally locates the traitors trail.  He enlists the help of Johns daughter Stella, who happens to be an expert of safes and locks herself.  Together with his former cohorts, they will attempt to reclaim what is rightfully theirs, as well as exact revenge the person that betrayed them.<br />Admittedly the plot of The Italian Job follows the same set up as most caper films: a crew get together, then comes the obligatory introduction of the important players, with the explanation, the preparation and finally the completion of the heist.  Despite the formulaic scenario, director Grays execution was so energetic and thrilling that such contrivance can be easily overlooked.  There were a couple of story elements that were never fully explained to my satisfaction.  Even so, these irritations did not dampen my enjoyment for the film.<br />There are two kinds of thieves in the world: ones that steal to enrich their lives, and ones that steal to define their lives.<br />Mark Wahlberg is likeable enough as the main character Charlie, but lacks the charisma to carry the movie himself.  Luckily, the rest of the cast was more than capable of picking up the slack.  Charlize Theron exudes confidence and a kind of recklessness in the role of Stella Bridger; her charm is unmistakable here.  Edward Norton, on the other hand, seems to lack his usual intensity playing the villainous Steve.  Seth Green is again relegated to be the token wise-cracker, dont get me wrong, the guy is funny and does a good job as the computer wizard Lyle, but I think he is capable of much more than just the comedy relief.  Jason Statham is dynamic as Handsome Rob, and Mos Defs Left-Ear is quirky.  It is a shame that Donald Sutherlands part is so small, even though his character, John Bridger, is an important aspect of the story.  I confess that for most of the film I was dreading the cliched romance between the two leads that is usually found in these movies, and to my surprise the writers never resorted to it.  Choosing instead to ride the adrenaline rush all the way to the end, and The Italian Job benefited greatly because of that decision.<br />The Italian Job is full of kinetic energy with well-staged speedboat and car chases, it is an excellent film and a fun movie with a lot to offer for fans of the heist genre.  I was pretty much caught up in the excitement after a few minutes into it, and what followed was one heck of a ride.  This is what summer blockbusters are all about, having a good time.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple plan has produced a cd with a great amount of enthusiasim.  Every track is upbeat and fast.  If you are in a bad mood or are just bored, this is a great cd to listen to.
B00006IU73|4.0|Being a metal head i heard about this band on the opeth cds i own.  deffinatly a good cd and i don't like a lot of prog out there (dream theater is yucky to me).  one of my main gripes with alot of music in this genre is the voice of the singer.  I love this guys voice not to high pitched and the accent comes through just alittle.  Good prog for people who like metal.

B00004YYWI|5.0|This was my 6th opeth album that i bought so i am a huge fan of course.  The first track is my favorite i love the spacy guitar work tword the end.  It is to bad the last track is such bad production so i can't give an accurate opinion on that.
6302859204|1.0|This movie is supposed to be based on one of the most famous UFO sightings and abductions ever recorded.  Although movies can stretch reality a little bit, the real life encounter doesn't resemble what was shown in the movie.  The aliens in this movie are violent and stick tubes down the main character's throat.<br />In real life, this incident never occurred.  In fact, in real life, the abductee actually scared the aliens away.  But, nonetheless, hollywood has to destroy everything for the sake of entertainment.  To be honest, the real life story is more interesting than this movie.  Check out the Nova documentary on UFOs.
B000092Q4U|4.0|This Is on of the greatest albums of the year, i Like Their First Cd More but this album still demolishes any other poser, nu-metal, emo band out there.
B00008WT5E|5.0|\\"Powerage\\". The title says it all.<BR>For an album that is compiled of only nine tracks, <BR>each recording put down on the master tape is classic. <BR>Who could forget the hooky guitar patterns of <BR>\\"Rock And Roll Damnation\\", accompanied by <BR>Bon Scott  ranting \\"...It's a rock and roll damnation! <BR>Ma's own whipping boy!...\\"? Great song. Next, <BR>\\"Down Payment Blues\\". This little number is a depressing<BR>song about unable to pay your dues. One line in this<BR>great says it all \\"I got myself A Caddalic...but I can't<BR>afford the gasoline...\\". Not the best song, but good.<BR>At first thought, \\"Gimme A Bullet\\" sounds like a song<BR>about ammunition, but in fact, is a ballad about heartbreak<BR>and loss. One of the better songs. <BR>The arousing \\"Riff Raff\\" steps up to bat afterwards,<BR>and is one of the three best songs on `Powerage\\".<BR>The rapid clatter of the guitar introducing the song,<BR>with a slowly rising bass and rhythm line, explodes into a <BR>fast-rocking piece of music, which makes you hair stand<BR>on end. The gambler's lust for a good night in Las Vegas<BR>is apparent on another killer, \\"Sin City\\". The intro<BR>is good, plus a nice guitar pattern for a great song.<BR>\\"What's Next To The Moon\\": Good song, not the best,<BR>but what the hell? Wonderful poetic lyrics, and a chorus which<BR>makes the song better. \\"Gone Shootin'\\", a song which is<BR>good, but not great (I.E.: Riff Raff great), but worth a spot<BR>on this album. \\"Up To My Neck In You\\" precedes the closing<BR>tune, and is a wired rocker, good song as well. <BR>Closing up this electrifying CD is the totally screamed <BR>\\"Kicked In The Teeth\\". It begins with Bon Scott's lone<BR>voice screaming at the top of his lungs \\"TWO FACED WOMAN,<BR>WITH YOUR TWO FACED LIES!!!\\", and continues to morph<BR>into what is a song, in traditional AC/DC style, closes<BR>the album with a major kick and bite.<BR>\\"Powerage\\" isn't their best, as I said before, but<BR>still. Three of the songs listed \\"Rock AndRoll Damnation\\",<BR>\\"Riff Raff\\", and \\"Sin City\\" are worth the buy.
B00006IX0R|5.0|The Crainberries are unique in so many ways they inspire you and make you feel different emotions that are beautiful and yet elegant they bring back memories they encourage you but in every song there is a story you have to understand the song says something they are sending out a message yet there songs to me cannot be described I love them so much and they will always be my favorite band.
B00008BXJG|5.0|A year before the masterpiece \\"Back In Black\\" was<BR>recorded, the main men of heavy rock put together this<BR>collection of great songs. And on the new re-master<BR>CD, it all sounds raw, pure, and you don't miss a note<BR>of music. I wasn't around long enough (I'm only 13) <BR>to remember the original vinyl LPs, but still,<BR>this sounds just right. As soon as you hit the play<BR>button on your stereo, with this little disc inside,<BR>you get blown away by the immediately recognizable<BR>guitar intro of \\"Highway To Hell\\". You happily immerse<BR>yourself in each moment of each song, as it goes through<BR>each track. \\"Girl's Got Rhythm\\", the next song after <BR>\\"Highway To Hell\\", is a tune with good lyrics, <BR>a great rhythm, beat, and so forth. \\"Walk All Over You\\"<BR>is a gem. It's tempo shifting and potential screams<BR>of Bon Scott make it a classic groove, with a rapid-fire<BR>solo put out by Angus Young. With \\"Touch Too Much\\" we get<BR>a song which has a rhythm-groove of the highest kind, and great<br />guitar dynamics working on both ends of the Young brothers<BR>scale. (As usual.) Following is a number which has a<BR>well-paced, classic rock feel to it. \\"Beating Around The Bush\\"<BR>is well worth listening to, and the raunchy guitar makes it<BR>one of the best songs here. \\"Shot Down In Flames\\". A killer song,<BR>and a major staple of AC/DC's live performances. The trademark<BR>sound of AC/DC is all over this song, and has a wonderful<BR>intro to it, which again, is an instant-recognize-formula.<BR>\\"Get It Hot\\"; the head-bobbingly, foot-tappingly good roadhouse<BR>rock song, is another great, with it's cosmic bass playing <BR>by Cliff Williams, and the way the drums fill up the song makes<BR>it a great dance number. \\"If You Want Blood\\" is one of their best.<BR>Sweet backing vocals (AC/DC always had the best back-up vocals),<BR>masterful songcraft, and guitar playing any guitarist would cut<BR>off his right foot for. The closing tracks \\"Love Hungry Man\\"<BR>and\\"Night Prowler\\" are both good as well. \\"Love Hungry Man\\" has<BR>a breath catching hook to it, while the boys of AC/DC take<BR>on their own approach to the Rolling Stones' \\"Midnight Rambler\\"<BR>with the slow, haunting bluesy feel of \\"Night Prowler\\", which clocks in at 6:14. All in all, this is another essential purchase. Worth every penny you saved to buy it.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I'll start by saying this; I've always loved Rage Against the Machine, but I never got into Soundgarden. When Chris Cornell took Zach De La Rocha's place and formed Audioslave, I realized it'd either be awesome or it'd suck. I'm sad to say, it's leaning more towards choice B.<br />Let me get this out of the way real quick; The singles \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Like a Stone\\" are great songs. That easily sucked me in to getting the album. \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" isn't too shabby either, and \\"I Am The Highway\\" is a great song.<br />Now for the negatives. The album starts great with \\"Cochise\\". I can warn you...the 3 songs after \\"Cochise\\" will make you know if you'll like the album or not. For me, I hated those 3 songs. Each one featuring the trademark annoying Chris Cornell yelp! \\"Shoooow meeee hoooow tooo liiiiiiiiiivveee!\\" \\"Burn a little gasoliiiiiiiine!\\" \\"Now I'm Freeeeeeeeeeeee!\\"<br />At that time, I then remembered why I never got into Soundgarden! Because Chris Cornell is horrible! I cannot stand that dude singing! Listening to those 3 songs countless times (I tried to like this album) has given me nightmares!<br />After \\"I Am The Highway\\", every song is not as bad as songs 2-4, but they were all pretty forgetable and seemed like throwaways.<br />So whether it's Chris Cornell or the easy to forget songs, no matter where you look, this album was a disappointment. Go ahead, click on the negative vote for this review. You probably already have. But just remember that if you refuse getting caught up with all the superstars in the band, you will realize that this is an extremely forgetable record.<br />Where's Zach De La Rocha when you need him?
B000002JS0|5.0|Damn right! This is, considering it was their debut album, one of their best. Tracks like \\"TNT\\", \\"Rock And Roll Singer\\", \\"The Jack\\", and \\"Live Wire\\" are undiluted examples of the howling force that AC/DC made of themselves. With \\"TNT\\", you can't help<BR>but shout \\"Oy!\\" along with the intro, and you can't resist but to chant \\"She's got the jack!\\" with the chorus of \\"The Jack\\". <BR>(A song which also helps people realize that Angus, Malcolm, and Bon where perhaps the best writers of double-meaning lyrics.) <BR>The bluesy sound of \\"The Jack\\" is competed by an amazing guitar solo. \\"Live Wire\\", a classic song, and the show-opener at many early AC/DC gigs, is another great.<BR>On \\"Rock And Roll Singer\\", we get more power chord explosion, and the chorus is, with both verses, preceded by Bon whispering things like `But I had other plans\\", or \\"And I'm all ears...\\" is gripping. Another unforgettable song is the one with Chuck Berry-ish blues/rock chords, and lyrics which tell of picking up chicks at school, or at shows; \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl?\\" <BR>And \\"It's A Long Way To The Top\\" tells of the perilous <BR>life of a rock star on the road; I.E.: \\"Getting beat up, getting<BR>stoned, getting robbed, broken boned\\" Another classic.<BR>I'll close up this review with a comment the late, great <BR>Bon Scott said of AC/DC's music. \\"There's been an audience<BR>waiting for an honest rock `n roll band to come along<BR>and lay it on `em. There's a lot of people coming out<BR>of the woodwork to see  our kind of rock.\\" Very true, and if Bon Scott wasn't remembered for his outgoing charismatic attitude, then he will be remembered for the parts he played on each AC/DC record he lived to do. And this album is one of them which best helps to do so.
0375414932|4.0|When I finished reading this book,  I felt as though I really knew its main character, Logan Montstuart and I found myself  missing him.  As a fully realized personage, Montstuart may be right up there with Pickwick.  A major diffence of course is that Montstuart endures some heartbreaking losses along the way, and these leave deep marks as he lives through each decade of the twentieth century.<br /> So much in the book rang true to me.  Other reviewers have commented on  the vividness of Montstuart's encounters with personages and events through the  20th century.  To these remarks I can add that it makes perfect sense that a man educated in England, with a literary bent, would be skeptical of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline and other luminaries of abstract expressionism (those championed by critic Clement Greenberg who also gets a mention).  A decade or so later he is drawn to artists of a more narrative bent (Larry Rivers, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauchenberg).  I guess it's a sign of the breadth of Boyd's creation that you can approach this literary invention from so many angles.  I am sure that British readers and those that lived through the second world war would come away with other aspects that are most striking to them. <br />There is something exhausting about this book.  Boyd takes you to so many locales and puts his protagonist in so many different situations that sometimes I found myself wishing  that Montstuart would just stay put.  Still, it's a rewarding read, sometimes incredibly sad but also very rich.

Since I bought this dvd it has been extremely helpful to learn some techniques and to make my own interpretations of the role. Of course it goes without saying that this is a great movie and the Actors in it are outstanding!!
B0000024SI|5.0|One of the finest albums in rock history, Dylan's seminal 1965 masterwork is also arguably his best. Brimming with captivating, stunningly sophisticated surrealistic lyrics and raw, effective instrumention, this seamlessly crafted album contains no weak areas, and even includes two of his greatest classics (Like a Rolling Stone, Desolation Row). Although it can be intensely debated what is Dylan's essential work, this certainly is a leading candidate, and my favorite as well.     Kicking off this tour de force collection is 'Like a Rolling Stone', which many consider his best. While it may not be my pick, it certainly is a genuine great classic, and deserves the acclaim it receives. The other uptempo numbers here are 'Tombstone Blues', (an extremely fast-paced blues piece highlighted by Bob's deliciously uncanny lyrics and axeman Michael Bloomfield's flavorful licks), 'From a Buick 6', (also fast and enjoyable but far less innovative overall), and the title track (hilarious and entertaining, thanks to Bob's brilliant writing). The lesser known but indisputably fascinating bluesy tracks here are excellent additions, with exceedingly palpable emotion making 'It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry' and 'Ballad of a Thin Man' standouts. Finally, the last two tracks are worth the price of the album alone. \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is absolutely wonderful, with a great piano and more of the Bard's masterful wordplay.  Yet perhaps the magnum opus is 'Desolation Row', an ingenious, thought-provoking work of staggering proportions that showcases some of Dylan's best lyrics and supremely engaging guitar work.      Overall, a tremendous LP that perfectly captures the essence of Dylan. Highly recommended.
0385504209|5.0|this was one of the best books i have read in a long time.  It is not for everyone though.  One needs a open mind and a good imagination.  This is not for someone who is content with the church, Brown has a lot a controversial points.  Im at this moment finding all the books i can about the Holy Grail, and The Priory of Sidon etc... Definately a book hard to put down.
B00005AQAW|4.0|Prior to releasing three previous albums which, to be honest, have not done an awful lot for Feeder (despite being wicked cd's), this is finally the work which will guarantee them mainstream mtv success and sales with future records.<BR>This is a wicked cd. I have found that there is a song on here to suit my every mood. Sure, there are elements of Coldplay here, but remember, Feeder were there first! 'Buck Rodgers' is one of the most infectious records I have ever heard. As soon as the bass line hits in it has you hooked. Generally, this is a very positive, reassuring cd. The lyrics of songs such as 'We Can't Rewind' and 'Seven Days in The Sun' are guaranteed to put a smile on your face, and of course, the chorus to Buck Rodgers - \\"I think we're gonna make it, I think we're gonna save it\\". <BR>From a female perspective, it helps that Grant and Jon are drop dead gorgeous (buy it just for their pictures on the inlay cards), but this is a great reflection of Feeders past career peaking, demonstrating how their skills have matured over time to produce such a magnificent album. It truly is a piece to be proud of. There are no wicked guitar solos or notable rock'n'roll moments that are going to go down in history, but tak it on face value and don't compare their skills to other musicians and you will find a goldmine hidden within this cd.<BR>Like this? Check out Coldplay, Radiohead, Muse and Delirious?. Buy it. You won't regret it :)
B00005B36H|2.0|This band just came to my town about 6 months ago, and everybody here likes them now, and it's making me sick.  Let's not forget the fact that MTV and all the &quot;rock&quot; radio stations ran Schism into the ground. They really don't sound as original as most people think.  I mean, sure they have that &quot;freaky&quot; sound, but Marilyn Manson has that sound too, and he is so horrible I'm afraid I would have to pick 3 Doors Down over them. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because of Danny Carey.  He is one of the better drummers I've heard recently. But, I would consider buying Mudvayne or System of a Down (one of the greatest bands ever) over Tool.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|[MY REVIEW FOR THIS FILM IS 4.5 STARS, NOT JUST 4]<br />After doing the cult classic \\"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,\\" Peter Weller would go onto another film that would be labeled a sci-fi classic alongside \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Aliens.\\"  \\"Robocop\\" was an unexpected hit which starred Weller as Alex Murphy, a cop who is brutally murdered by a gang of criminals.  The government decides to reanimate him by fusing his body with mechanical parts and weaponry and essentially, he was born as Robocop.  While his former partner (Nancy Allen) is trying to determine if Murphy is still himself and the bad guys are out causing havoc, Murphy still hangs on to his last shred of humanity and overrides his programming to eliminate the creeps that \\"killed\\" him.<br />Electrically charged action and a rather sick satire about our government in control of our lives are enhanced by director Paul Verhoeven's bloodlust.  Back before \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"Total Recall\\" became famous, Verhoeven kicked off his success with this one.  Weller is truly an underrated actor as he we see him become tormented by his humanity literally being taken away from him.  The action would please even today's action buffs and its view of society is unremittingly bleak and ugly, which enhances the mood of the film.<br />Of course, with Verhoeven at the helm, this film is bloody.  Don't be fooled by the fact that this film is old, it's relentlessly bloody and violent (remember the acid scene?  yuck!).  Other actors that deserve praise: Ronny Cox, fresh out of the first two \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\" films, portrays an evil tyrant here and with menacing taste.  Kurtwood Smith (currently on \\"That 70's Show\\") portrays the evil gang leader, who killed Alex Murphy in a bloody death scene.  Nancy Allen is vulnerable, yet tantalizingly tough at the same time.<br />The special effects were done by Phil Tippett and he proved his worth with the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Dragonslayer\\" films.  Basil Poledouris once again provides a dramatic musical score.<br />All in all, this is definitely a classic.  Its grim view of satire and society is not for the weak-hearted and some of the gritty, ultraviolent scenes might turn you off.  But if you want a good action/sci-fi to view and especially a fan of older action films like \\"The Terminator,\\" you will definitely enjoy this.  A unique action film that's been countlessly ripped off and unfortunately spawned some sorry sequels.amatic musical score.<br />All in all, this is definitely a classic.

B00005YW4H|5.0|When Norah Jones burst onto the scene and people talked about how much they loved her, I was like, &quot;What is wrong with you people? She's awful!&quot; But listening to her repeatedly, I realize how wrong I was. It's enchanting and wonderful. If you could call an album a classic, it would be this one.
0393057658|5.0|The story is about how the Oakland A's became one of the best teams in baseball year after year despite spending much less than half as much as their competitors. However, the real story is the triumph of objective reality based on statistics and past performance over player appearance and traditions. This book has universal application in all fields. Lewis does a great job telling this amazing story.
0385504209|5.0|This was the ultimate read for me. Religion and symbology combined to make an exciting cluefinding adventure...and I even figured out some of the clues! This book contains so much information from books that I have studied over the years; I commend the author for his obvious extensive research and fact-finding. It's always a pleasure to read fiction based on fact. Read it yourself and enjoy.
6304712936|4.0|It is hard not to love this movie.  I give it an &quot;almost 5,&quot; only because I can't help but compare it to &quot;Immortal Beloved,&quot; a film that struck me as superior both in tone and subject matter.  (I prefer Beethoven to Mozart, and also tend to favor Beethoven's brooding presence and inner demons.  I also like Gary Oldman a great deal more than either F. Murray Abraham or Tom Hulce.)<br />But make no mistake.  This is a beautiful, rich film that centers on a personal conflict that ought to resonate in most of us--the conflicting admiration and jealously we often feel for those who are both better than us and so naturally gifted that excellence seems effortless to them.  Salieri shows the worst of human nature in a perform that is both true and revealing.  Hulce's Mozart is an audacious character, and whether it is true to Mozart's persona (a frightening thought, suggesting that silliness, arrogance, and genius go hand in hand) or not, is interesting and engaging.  But Abraham is the star here.  He is the heart of the movie.  And if I had to point out one flaw, it is that the character of Mozart simply isn't sufficiently fleshed out.  He ends up being a caricature in many respects, which is disappointing.
B00008PW2D|3.0|When a show is as good as Sex And The City had been for four seasons, it's bound to take a fall. And when a show is as popular as Sex And The City is, everyone's bound to notice. That's what happened with Sex And The City's Fifth \\"Bonus\\" Season. The bonus word thrown around in an attempt to distract us from realizing that the whole season (only 8 episodes, but thank God cause who could have put up with more?) was spent reaching. The well had officially run dry. What's really a shame is that the whole season wasn't so terrible, but because SATC fans are so used to perfection, it seemed like a train wreck. <br />The most obvious problem was the stories. SATC, a TV show known for diving into the problems of four single 30 something New York ladies, quickly became a story about four bitter aging women who's fears had come true. Since the show's beginning they had feared becoming old, tired maids and that's exactly what happened. <br />On the season's premiere episode, Anchors Away, the ladies all but throw Miranda in a Taxicab so she and her baby can go home and they can go live it up at a party with the sailors. All of this would have been fine when the show first began, but later there's a shot of Carrie, Samantha and Charlotte walking to the party and instead of it being sexy, it was so sad. I actually felt embarrassed for them. The show has always been mostly true to life, but if three single worn out looking women pushing well into their 40s went to a party looking like they did with a bunch of 20 something guys, they'd get laughed at.<br />Miranda and Carrie's nostalgia quickly echoed ours as the viewer began to realize this was a preview of things to come. Out of all 8 episodes, I only enjoyed 2 of them and I was only really happy with 2 of the characters. <br />Carrie being sent to work for Vogue was a terrible idea. The fifth season saw her become more self centered than usual. I haven't always agreed with Carrie's choices, but I've respected them up until thisseason. Her selfishness pushed past its final limits and answered to pretty much everyone but her as to why she's still single. As for less important things, her hair looked God-awful. Her face was way too pale this season and the way they tried to hide Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy was just absurd. From everything to hideous dresses to giant magazines, it was quite noticeable and would have been more believable had she just \\"gained weight\\" from the stress of her book. <br />Samantha was a terrible disappointment this season. As someone who's deliciously decedent and so much fun to watch, I can see why the writers wanted to make her more human and see her fall in love, but what they did to Samantha's character was unforgivable. First she's in love, then she's afraid, then she's insecure, then she gets a broken heart, then she forgives Richard, then she's insecure again until finally she turns psycho and accuses Richard of cheating again when he wasn't. Later in the season she practically tries to kill two of Richard's houseguests when they won't leave because she's throwing a party in his house which she wasn't even given permission to do. <br />Charlotte stayed most true to herself than all of the other characters. She remained to be the \\"eternal optimist\\" and really kept the show alive for me. Watching Charlotte be herself amongst a group of people who weren't being themselves gave me a little sliver of hope. I enjoyed watching her fall in love with the hairy lawyer who's so not her type and I enjoyed watching her not give up on love. Kristen Davis was incredible this year and deserved a nomination, which she has yet to receive.<br />Miranda also made me proud acting like the only adult on the show. She had a baby, her and Steve tried their best to get their lives together and raise Brady as best as they could. Miranda often felt left out by her friends, she was. Miranda often had tough choices to make concerning her baby, moms always do. I liked watching Miranda struggle with this as it brought the only realism to the show.<br />As for the episodes, most of them were lacking. In one episode, Carrie freaks because she runs into Aiden's ex and she makes a face at her and Carrie realizes Aiden must have told her some horrible things about her. Oh no! Could she really have hurt him so bad, she later asks Steve, Aiden's best friend. Hello! She dumped him twice and cheated on him. How Carrie can be THIS selfish and THIS dumb is beyond me.<br />Also in that episode, Heather Graham shows up for no reason which becomes a theme in this season - things happening for no reason. Miranda asks Carrie to be her baby's Godmother instead of Charlotte. Carrie decides out of the blue in one episode, she needs to get laid. So she returns to Mr. Big. Why he sleeps with her after she made fun of him in her book makes no sense and gives guys like me a bad name. <br />This season was a big let down for me. Not only did it make no sense, but it was a slap in the face to those who adore the show. Uninteresting stories, new uninteresting characters (one who's name is Burger, don't ask) and favorite characters changing into paper thin shadows of their former selves made this a very forgettable season of Sex And The City. <br />The only enjoyable episodes were Unoriginal Sin, an episode where Miranda gets Brady christened and I Love A Charade, the season finale where Charlotte falls in love and a little Zsa Zsa Zsu is put back into the show.
0446608955|2.0|it was alrite but it got very boring as you got into it. it was too schmalzy and too focused on her sickness and the depressingness of the book.. towards the end all they do is read the bible together.. it gets just sooo stupid. <BR>the movie, however, was sweet. it moves faster and is just a nicer version of the story much less focused on religion and does not attempt constantly to make you cry to the point you want to rip it up..
B000002H8F|5.0|Some find this album to be less than their previous ones, because it's less \\"raw\\" & punky.  While this is true, there is also an element of evolution happening here, which is a sign of a much longer-lasting band had they stuck together!  Make no mistake - this is STILL post-punk, except it's taken to a new level!  Higly recommended!
B000002H70|5.0|This is a masterpiece!  Very few albums come close to this one.  This is the one that got me into The Cure in the first place.  ...
B000026C3T|5.0|When I first heard Led Zeppelin a few years ago I didn't really care for their music, I guess because of my age, and wanted everything hard and heavy. Now, that I am a few years older I can appreciate this bands music, and this album helped me. <BR>  This album is a shortened version of the 4-disk box set, that as you'll notice has the same cover. So, if you don't want to shell out that much on the box set, this 2-disk album should be your second choice for newcomers to Led Zeppelin.<BR>  The song selection is excellent, but missing a few gems that are included in the box set(this is why the box set is my first choice). Die hard fans don't need this, as you probably have all their albums.<BR>  Overall a great intro into a great band.
0399134204|4.0|I was browsing the library for a book and because I was in a hurry I picked up the book nearest to my hand and made my way to the Librarian's counter.  It is difficult for me to get into books and even more difficult to stay with them; I am always busy with school.  I took The Joy Luck Club home and read the first couple of pages before I went to work and I fell in love with it.  I came home and read about the mothers from China, telling their interesting stories.  I've never read anything like it!  One of the women married a boy much younger than she--I was so suprised at the things she went through!  Another had to escape with her twin babies to avoid and attack from the Japanese.  And those were just two of the many stories told. The culture was so different and interesting I couldn't put the book down.  I've been on a reading vivaciously ever since.
B00008WG3U|2.0|NoFX is so bad.  I'm not kidding.  You can tell they really like punk rock, but they are nowhere near as good as their favorite bands, like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Youth of Today, etc.  If you don't know who these bands are, then please check them out.  You simply cannot be considered punk if you don't know who they are.  The only reason this album gets two stars instead of one is We got 2 Jealous Agains and 13 Stitches.  These two songs really reminice about the glory days of punk.  Listen to we got 2... and buy all the albums mentioned.  Also buy stuff by the Dead Kennedys, and Bad Brains, who for some reason were never mentioned on those songs, despite them being simply awsome.  Nofx is stupid...listen to real punk!!!  Black Flag, Minor Threat, Misfits, etc.  thats the good stuff.
0316548189|4.0|A Long Walk To Freedom is a book filled with information, power, and perseverance. This is the first autobiography that I have read, and I must say that I chose a great example to start out with. <BR>     This book takes readers inside the life and times of the political genius Nelson Mandela. It starts out with a wonderful description of Nelson's childhood in South Africa.               Telling a story about how he was a normal \\"free\\" African boy, able to fun in the dry fields and swim in the cool streams. Nelson had the rare opportunity as an African boy to become educated. This allowed him to explore opportunities and politics. <BR>     Nelson met many people on his long journey that taught him how to be a good leader, negotiator, and debater. He became a very influential and powerful leader of the African National Congress, and President of Africa. He arranged many strikes and rallies to encourage freedom of Africans.<BR>At a young age Nelson learned that he was not even free in his own country, and that the white Africans had no freedoms. At first Nelson wanted freedom for himself. He was a young boy who wanted to be able to live where he wanted to, eat where he wanted to, and say whatever he wanted to. As he grew wise he realized that he not only yearned for freedom, but he yearned for the freedom of his people. He wanted freedom for his brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors, and even for his enemies. He set a goal, to unite and free Africans of every color. <BR>     This is a story of a freedom fighter. A man who's goal in life was to free others. This one man changed the history of South Africa, taking this country into his own hands. He often faced court hearings, banning, and lost his tight family connections through his struggle, but in the end, he prevailed.<BR>     If you are interested in politics, South African history, or Nelson Mandela, I suggest reading this autobiography.

B00005JLO2|1.0|Truly awful. It seems to be a common theme with trendy directors to belittle the achievements of previous generations and make pointless comparisons with modern attitudes. Having seen the classic 1939 version, whose attitidues seem laughable \\"dervishes and fuzzy wuzzies\\" by modern politically correct standards, this film really plummets the depths of hopelessness. The 1939 film culminates in the massacre of Omdurman, a British Victory, this one in the British defeat at Abou Clea, a fact that makes you wonder about the relative motivations of the different directors. While the battle scenes are reasonably well done, the jumps in the film don't really work - from the Desert to Southern England in a flash leaves you with a sense of being unfullfilled. The directors attempts at explaining this (and his obvious anti-British sentiments) are pathetic in the extreme, but then bashing the brits seems to be a modern participant sport for those with a chip on thier shoulders.

6305126062|4.0|I first saw this movie when it came out five years ago. At the time, I was stirred by its quiet, gentle beauty and moving, realistic performances. I have seen it several times since and have enjoyed it every time. \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" delivers peace into my crazed life.<BR>The story centers on a high powered Manattan magazine editor (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and her family. Her daughter becomes involved in a very serious accident with her horse, which results in the loss of one of her legs, the death of her best friend, and severe emotional and physical injury to her beloved horse. Several months later, her mother, at her wits end with her daughter's emotional state, drives the daughter and the horse out to Montana to visit a Horse Whisperer (Robert Redford), a man who can heal the most severely wounded creatures.<br />Of course, it is not just the horse or the daughter who need to be healed, but Scott-Thomas's character as well. However, the movie never verges on the maudlin and instead treats all of its characters and their issues with respect. The cinematography is gorgeous. Every time I see this movie, I want to get into my car and drive out to Montana.<br />I would recommend this movie to moviegoers who enjoy serious, modern stories. There is a strong romantic undercurrent to the story (inevitable with Redford in the lead) but it does not overwhelm the movie. I would not recommend this movie to individuals who need a lot of action or humor or adventure in their films. This film's beauty lies in subtle, quiet moments not overly dramatic scenes or heart stopping adventure.

B00005JLSE|5.0|I was sorely disappointed to see the release date for this DVD moved until AUGUST.....but I guess the movie's still quite popular, and continues to be screened in theaters (still in the top 20, five months after release), so I'm not surprised that they'd like to milk the theater audience as much as they can before turning to us \\"faithfuls\\" for another influx of cash later in the summer.<br />There have been a lot of comparisons to Moulin Rouge, which are not totally fair. There are some key differences:<BR>1) Moulin Rouge has modernized cinematography, with blindingly-fast zooms and the like--Chicago is much more a classical movie, with absolutely no special effects (that I can remember, at least)<BR>2) MR had a much more pop element to it, with old Elton John classics incorporated into the soundtrack. Chicago retained the original score, with a few modern additions only available on the CD soundtrack.<BR>3) MR relied much more on its cinematography, elaborate sets, special effects, and even some camp, to make it appealing. Chicago relied much more on the songs, acting, and some clever choreography, but it didn't exactly hit you in the face with its brilliance--you had to think about it for a while.<br />The cast is what really made it for me in this version, as well. While I adore Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, the cast in Chicago is really spectacular, all around--not a stinker among the bunch. As far as I'm concerned, Catherine Zeta-Jones was the best, truly a natural on stage; rarely has there been a venue to fully showcase all of her talents. It's no wonder that she won an Oscar.<br />So see it in the theaters if you haven't done so already, and rent/buy the DVD once it comes out! You won't be disappointed!

If you can appreciate the melodic and complex rythms created by Tool, coupled with some awesome vocals from Maynard, then the chances are you will like this. If you're into a more straightforward sound or aren't a fan of Maynard's vocals, then don't buy this!

038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a strangely written book. It is a tale of discovery, a quest for knowledge, and also the end of the world. I feel that Cat's Cradle is a great book, although I am not familiar with the rest of Vonnegut's work, I have the need to read more of his work after reading Cat's Cradle. The characters in the book have a varying depth to each other, and at times it seems like some characters are constructed in a somewhat shallow manor (Angela), some are deeply based and have a lot of back-story behind them (Frank). I really enjoyed the plot as well, this book truly takes the reader on a ride, where they have no idea where the ride will end. It was a great feeling, after reading this book, to look back to the beginning and remember that the main character (Jonah/John) had originally set out to write a book.<br />The book begins with our main character (Jonah/John) setting out to write a book about the day in which the nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Jonah's task is to gather as much information as he can about the so-called father of the atom bomb (Dr. Felix Hoenikker). Hoenikker, however, has passed on, so it is up to Jonah to obtain information on the doctor, through his three children (Newton, Franklin, and Angela). After correspondence with Newt, Jonah travels to the research lab where Dr.Hoenikker previously worked, and we are introduced to Dr. Asa Breed. Breed talks with Jonah about Hoenikker's work habits and his behaviors. And then, the topic of Ice-Nine comes up. Without giving away too much, Ice-Nine is capable of causing the end of the world. In a quest to find yet even more information about Dr.Hoenikker, Jonah attempts to track down Frank Hoenikker, who is believed dead. The search for Frank leads Jonah to a small remote island. The rest I will not spoil.<br />Perhaps the most prevalent theme in the book is Bokononism, a fictional religion. Bokononism really is the backbone of this book, especially the elements leading up to the climax of the book. I will give away this much about the book, Bokonon teaches that all religion is lies, and that there is no way to truly know what God wants or what his will is. The purpose of the whole Bokonon angle is irony. I will give away no more. <br />Cat's Cradle could very well be considered a masterpiece. Plain and simple.
0844663662|4.0|The Reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because I read this book in a short period of time so I did not get what other people got out of it I also thought that this was a crazy story and I related this to the fact that Kurt Vonneget is a bit crazy if you don't mind me saying and that this book is far out of the ordinary. This book has a new type of writing which is different to the ordinary prose that is common in most books. The book has an unusual beginning because it starts off by Kurt Vonneget telling us about how he tried to write a book about Dresden and how he had alot of trouble getting it started so he decided to write a book about Billy Pilgrim a man from Ilium, New York who becomes unstuck in Time. In this book Billy travels through times to many important events of his life like his birth and his struggle in the POW camps in WW2 and even the time he thinks he was abducted by Aliens from the Planet Tralfamadore. The time on the planet is a split second in earth time but on the planet it is a couple of months. Thre a couple of themes present in this book that can be easily discussed here. The first which is an obvious one which is the time travel which occurs in Billy Pilgrim's world. There is another theme that struck me as odd was the way that he did not sho any emotion of sadness during the war and when his wife died he just said So it goes. There are many reasons that this book was banned for example the use of vulgar language and the use of blasphimus language that there is in the book. There is also a sex scene that occurs when Billy is on Tralfamadore and this would be the grounds for the banning of any book from a school or library. So this book has been banned in many places for these many details but Rye High School didn't ban it
0767827716|4.0|Christine is such a cool movie I mean a car that drives itself how can you be wrong the only movie of this genre about cars I belive is better is The Car staring James Brolin I find it to be more unique but this I saw this movie when I was 10 and for the next month cheked around corners for driverless cars lololol
0844663662|4.0|I read this book over a short period of time so I don't think I got as much out of it as most people would. When I read this book I can honestly say that it was not the best book I have ever read and that is why I gave it 4 it is a completely new type of writing compared to the normal form of prose writing. The story of Billy Pilgrim's crazy time travel if you will is a very outrageous story and shows how Kurt is quite a crazy author and he maybe a little screwed up in the head. Something that I found interesting was at the beginning of the book how it is a autobiography of how Vonnegurt was trying to write abook about Dresden but he could not get the book started so he starts to tell us about Billy and how \\"Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in Time\\" It is crazy because he goes from being himself back to his childhood and then he goes into the POW camps and then to a mysterious planet called Tralfamadore which is inhabited by the Tralfamadorians where he stays in a zoo for months in theie time but on earth it is not even a second it is  moment in time. The obvious theme is time travel which Billy does seemlessly because he is unstuck in time. Another theme which is part of Billy's personality is the way that whenever something bad happens he seems to let it pass when any other person would cry he lets it go \\"So it goes\\" asit says. This book positively contributed to literature because it is a different type of writing and it is a new and fantastic way of writing and it is a cool story a little crazy but cool. This book was banned because it used vulgar language in places and there is a scene when he has sex and there are some references that are some phrases of blasphamy which would mean banning the book in religious schools.
B00005JKCH|2.0|Oh boy, I was such a huge Spiderman fan when I was a kid, so this movie came as a total disappointment.  Very disappointing.  Very, very.  Maguire is terrible as Spiderman; he's almost like immature...  The special effects are too obvious to be entertaining.  Just a poorly made movie.
B00000DCHI|5.0|This 2 disc set is an excellent summary of Billy Joel's biggest hits from 1973 to 1985,starting with his signature song &quot;Piano Man&quot; then rounding up FM radio favorites &quot;Capitan Jack&quot;,&quot;The Entertainer&quot;,&quot;New York State Of Mind&quot; before his 1977 commercial breakthrough &quot;The Stranger&quot; made him a household name.Two bona-fide classic album cuts from it(&quot;Scenes From An Italian Resturaut&quot; and the title song)are included.From that point there's no stopping the hits-&quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;,&quot;She's Always A Woman&quot;,&quot;My Life&quot;,&quot;You May Be Right&quot;,&quot;It's Still Rock n'Roll To Me&quot;,&quot;Don't Ask Me Why&quot;,&quot;She's Got A Way&quot;,&quot;Allentown&quot;,&quot;Tell Her About It&quot;,&quot;Uptown Girl&quot;,&quot;The Longest Time&quot;,plus two new songs that became hits as well,major(the trifle &quot;You're Only Human(Second Wind)&quot;)and minor(the underrated&quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot;).Granted,a few hits are missing(&quot;Honesty&quot;,&quot;Sometimes A Fantasy&quot;,and &quot;Leave A Tender Moment Alone&quot;),but overall this is the definitive compilation of one of the most talented pop/rock singer/songwriters ever.
B000050IE6|4.0|Opeth has been described as a band that one either loves or hates - no grey between. However, I must interject that there may very well be a middle.<br />    One of the biggest issues brought up of Opeth is the shifting of music, which goes from acoustic and clean vocals to acoustic/electric mixed with visceral death metal vocals. With death metal vocals one usually expects the music to go along exactly that route - menacing, violent, or eerie. With Opeth, the music under the vocals is anxious, arty, and pretty upbeat (despite the not so upbeat lyrical subject matter.) Understandably so, this has been awkward to many, and at the first listen I was one of those many, until I found this album was something made more for admiration than for entertainment. <br />     In style, Opeth seems to come closer to progressive metal or progressive/blues/art rock, due to the largely experimental song structures. Experimental is good, as many bands these days use the rhyming song-chorus-song-chorus technique which has gotten pretty boring. It's novel to have lyrics written more as a story then a poem and music written more as a plot then a song.<BR>  <BR> Still Life is a good album for those curious about the band and  \\"The Moor\\", \\"Godhead's Lament\\" \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" and \\"Face of Melinda\\" are the best tracks on the album (and also very representative of the overall Opeth sound). For those who are divided on Opeth, \\"Deliverance\\" is strictly death, and for the clean vocals and songwriting style, I strongly recommend the latest \\"Damnation\\".
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is a fast paced, intense read that makes you think. Is it right to make kids lose their inocence? Do we have the right to eliminate an entire form of life? Are there really kids out there that are that smart? Does the Human Race have that kind of potential? It also keeps things simple and easy to read so the reader does not get lost amongst all the happenings. It is a great book and I strongly advise reading it.
B000069HK2|4.0|I like the Used a lot and I enjoy this CD to the fullest. Maybe the fact that they sound an awful lot like glassjaw and other bands makes some of you angry or whatever but I think the Used deserves all the credit they're getting for this album because its a damn good one. I saw them live last October and they were super and put on a great show, infact I thought they were better than the band I had went to see, which is why I bought their CD. I love this CD and I think most people will.
B000007ODL|4.0|This is great Saturday afternoon music.  I have played it at various times while doing work around the house, when company was over, etc.  Everyone I've played it for loved it - even/especially the people who didn't know who J.J. Cale was.  I'm having fun with this CD!
B000002BFZ|5.0|i absolutely love this album! i had never really listened to pearl jam before and when i heard this album i fell in love with them. this is one of my favorite albums of all time! i definitely recommend this album to anyone. its just great rock music.
0446678430|2.0|...Retire Young...., however, is a sleeper. Same ideas in a new wrapper. Mr. Kiyosaki has retired rich and continues to get richer on this fluffy tome. While the title is compelling, this achingly dull book takes over 300 pages to sell one idea. That idea is to expand your mind far enough to grasp the idea that one can retire young and rich. <br />Great. Done. Now how do I do that exactly? <br />Well, that's \\"beyond the scope of this book\\". Mr. Kiyosaki introduces the idea of options trading which is exciting and new to me but does not recomend where I can learn more about it. (Go to the library he says. Maybe a suggestion of an author or title?)<br />Save your money. Buy it at a deep discount if you must. Or better yet. Go to the library.
0066620996|4.0|AN AWESOME BOOK IF YOU WANT INFORMATION THAT REALLY COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMPANY OR BUSINESS
B00003CXXP|2.0|Too bad Spielberg felt the need to add a hokey 'Close Encounters' ending onto the film.  The natural end point of the movie is when David realizes the nature of his existence and there is a beatiful and tragic moment.  Then there are are at least 3 more endings which depart from the tragic storyline to create a more friendly 'hollywood' ending.  The movie would have been more powerful without this ending that explains the motivations of David for those who were unable to grasp the similarities to Pinochio.
0062502182|4.0|That said I can't say that the writing is stellar.  But the story is certainly interesting if less so engaging.  As I am currently lost in my own personal dessert, an image utilized in the story, as I search for my own treasure the fundamental truths resonated.  Many of the feelings, doubts, and fears experienced by the main character are also my own and I would assume those of all the brave few who undertake the task.  Accordingly I found the story to be very reassuring as it validated many of those previously mentioned feelings.  <br />Very few people will ever have the courage to truly embark in search of their own personal treasure.  The price is too high I can assure you and filled with obstacles that I certainly didn't imagine as I began my journey.  As such I feel that the story is a very important one.  <br />For those who may criticize the writing I can largely agree as the characters are less than fully developed.  Therefore 'The Alchemist' fails to qualify as a great literary work.  However, the main point of the story is to describe the process and I believe impart to the reader the essence of personal discovery, risk, and belief.  And in that regard it most suredly succeeds.
B0000844IT|5.0|It was only a matter of time before they re-released a double DVD of this movie.  The first one \\"Army of Darkness - Collector's edition\\" only had a 30,000 run.  ...

1558216847|1.0|I am an avid outdoorsman with experience in long distance hiking and backcountry winter travel. I love TRUE survival stories, but this one is not only false but obviously so. It is simply not possible to bushwhack 20-30 miles a day through deep snow with almost no food and no water as recounted in the Northern part of the trek - and to make that distance in actual forward progress with no map. <br />He also claims to have gone 8 and then 12 days with no water in the Gobi desert in the heat of summer while walking miles and miles each day. This also is impossible as survival without water in these conditions is limited to a very few days at best.<br />It's also full of all kinds of &quot;little&quot; howlers like the idea that when they got to the Gobi desert between the eight of them they only pot or pan they had was a single mug they'd taken from the prison camp. They hadn't even managed to scavenge a tin can. Right. <br />I love the American, &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;, who doesn't reveal his first name throughout the entire epic. Maybe he was really Agent K. Or was it J.<br />In the end, it's ever so convienient that he loses track of all of his fellow survivors so &quot;coincidentally&quot; there is no one to corroborate this absurd story.<br />I've really only scratched the surface.<br />If you want some incredible survival stories you can believe try &quot;Endurance&quot; - an account of the Shackleton Expedition, Touching The Void by Joe Simpson, or Adrift by Steven Callahan.<br />                  =Steve Dunn=
B000000H6D|4.0|now peter steele is as far as I can tell a complete boorish clod (i mean anyone who would write a song like &quot;we hate everyone&quot; and is actually over the age of 9 must be a bit dull) so why can't i live without this album?  because christian woman, black #1, summer breeze/set me on fire, bloody kisses, blood and fire, and can't lose you (in spite of the chanting/spoiling) are totally great.  this album reminds me of the film &quot;wings of desire&quot;  -- absolutely LOVED half of it, absolutely HATED the other half.  and if that was the point (maybe it was) -- what kind of point is that?<br />anyway -- if you like goth metal you have to have it or you already do -- so buy it if you don't and puzzle over it if you do.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|They really are, this time. More energy, more anger, more passion. More faster heavy tunes, more pure heavy rock power.<br />And if you are not so happy about the world, and feel comfortable with the lyrics like theirs, if you are slightly tired of the nice sweetness of the bands like Linkin Park, then most of the tracks off Faceless are what you definitely need this time.<br />Some catchier, some less, still most of the songs are equally impressive and memorable: take Straight Out Of Line, or I Stand Alone, or Faceless, or Make Me Believe, every track has its melody, its signature-style heaviness, and in every track vocals add so much that you can't imagine a better mixture of rock elements in one band.<br />The only thing to disappoint is, as usual, a small number of tracks, considering the presense of the heard earlier I Stand Alone, and the little instumental, which can hardly be considered a song. The rest is just fine, the album is the new and better option for any band's fan and the one who's into rock music in general.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Rocky Horror Picture Show, a cult classic that has remained a favorite for over 28 years. Dedicated fans still flock to the theatre each Friday and Saturday night dressed as their favorite transsexual. Perhaps it the music and the excitement, perhaps it is that erotica and utter sexuality that seems to exude from each and every cast member. Whatever draws us to Rocky Horror, it has kept us coming back again and again. This film defines decadence, and I think that for millions of people the movie represents the ghost of an entire era. Years ago RHPS was home to a group of virtually homeless people who, at the time, were not accepted by society. Out in today's world if you walk around wearing almost gothic-like makeup and 7 inch stilettos people are most likely to take one look at you and automatically make a false judgement. Whereas, at Rocky Horror, people are most likely to take one look at you and automatically make a judgement if you AREN'T wearing outrageous makeup, racy laungerie, and stilettos. It's both ironic and intriguing, and the thought of theatre virgins getting initiated at their first RHPS viewing always gives me a kick. <br /> For close to two hours the audience becomes the innocent and naive Brad and Janet, and we allow ourselves to partake in the forbidden fruit that is Rocky Horror. A combination of glamour, sex, eccentricity, and hidden meaning is combined altogether to create the story line. If you were to search for a moral hidden in this movie, you would find it during the floorshow scene, where a large portion of the cast starts swimming in a large pool, continually singing: Don't dream it, be it.' This expresses the whole purpose and meaning of the movie. Many people in today's society have fantasies (sexual and nonsexual), but are too afraid to act them out. What makes the characters in RHPS differ from us is the fact that they are not afraid to act out all of their perverse fantasies. They are comfortable with themselves and have no shame,much unlike us (the audience). Also, take notice of the expression, 'Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble and pain.' Each character repeats this after singing a verse at the floorshow. Perhaps Richard O'Brien was trying to portray to us how everyone has something that they use for comfort, some kind of distraction that keeps them going on when times get hard. At the very end of the movie, the narrator says: 'And crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race. Lost in time, lost in space, and meaning.' I believe he is saying that yes, we humans are lost in meaning. We have lost sight of what life is all about, having fun and experiencing it to the fullest extent. Whereas, the transsylvanians have not, because they are enjoying themselves and ignoring all consequence and all rationality. They just do what they do and to hell with what others think, and isn't that the way it should be? <br />To the untrained eye RHPS appears to be a mindless, immature movie that makes no sense. Those who say that have obviously not looked deep enough into this film. Also, you can't enjoy the movie to its full extent if you take it too seriously. Let yourself go, and have fun with it. That is truly what Rocky Horror Picture Show is all about. Whether you view this timeless story at a theatre, at home, or at a play, you are sure to leave wanting more. <br />RHPS is neverending, and years and years from now millions will still be viewing it. Any true RHPS fan will tell you that it is our absolute duty to keep the spirit of Rocky alive and to be sure that it is not forgotten, no matter how long it has already been around. There are rumors of a RHPS remake with a new cast. We must protest this and boycott this!!! Rocky just isn't Rocky without Richard, Patricia, Little Nell, etc, and most of all...TIM CURRY! He not only portrayed Frank as dangerous and manipulative, but he made him sensual and completely irrisistable as well. Frank N. Furter is that guy that you know you shouldn't indulge in...but you really, really want to, despite your better judgement. <br />Without Tim, RHPS would never have made it, and whether you're a fan of Rocky or of Tim or of both, we owe it to him to make sure that it is the movie with the ORIGINAL cast playing every Saturday night, not the new one. <br />This movie is not just a movie...it is an unstoppable force and it has a true life of its own. 50 years from now (as long as I age well) I'll still be dressing up in my tattered fishnets and ghoulishly seductive makeup, parading down the street to the theatre for yet another night of mindless fun and dancing and laughing, reciting each and every word of Audience Participation and each and every word of the original script...which is memorized easily if you've watched the movie or seen it in public over a hundred times (like me, lol). <br />Those of you reading this review who have never seen RHPS will think that I'm an obsessive lunatic. However, those of you reading this interview that are true Rocky fans are probably nodding your head and agreeing with every word that I am saying right now ... <br />I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to let go and have fun, you are sure to find yourself singing along with all the music. C'mon...there's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure!
0688163173|4.0|... because I have come to expect special things from Lehane.<br />Don't get me wrong.  This is a very entertaining book.  It reads like gangbusters and you will finish this within a couple of days (OK, the book is disappointingly short).  It has all the Lehane signatures - characters carrying their demomns, cackling dialog and the relentless pace.  Unfortunately, this speed is also the problem for this book because it does not leave room for the development of tragic dimensions of Mystic River, and my favorite among Kenzie-Gennaro series, Gone Baby Gone.<br />So the book must rely on the plot twist.  It is well executed, but, alas, it does not surprise because ... we have seen all this before.  I can name a few recent ones on top of my head - \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"Story of Pi\\" and even \\"Sixth Sense\\".  At this day and age of conspiracy overdose, the last thing we need is another \\"nothing is real\\" story.  Of course, not many stories can ever be truly original, but if the main point of the story is a trickery, it better work, otherwise it rings harrow.<br />Lehane should be applauded for breaking out of the mold and trying something different, instead of turning into a book factory capitalizing on his popular characters of Kenzie and Gennaro.  But sometimems, I cannot help but missing them for what Lehane does best - writing great stories with the characters that we really care about.
031286504X|3.0|If you're looking for a book that will make you jump at odd noises you hear while reading it or make your mind wander to the shadows at night (is something there?)...this book will not do that (try reading Hell House by Masterson instead).<br />However, it is an interesting read.  The story kind of reminds me of the story premise of the comic book 'Blade', except that the main character is not half-vampire, but a vampire killer nonetheless.<br />It's a short read and the ending is worth the hour or so read.
0385504209|5.0|I cannot believe that so many people were worked up about the content of this book.  Take it for what it is - a mystery thriller.<br />This is not a reserach on theology or religion.  All Mr Brown did was to collect what were out there and tied themm into a damn entertaining novel.  He did not make up any of the stuffs - Opus Dei, Da Vinci, Priory Sion, Phi...  They were all out there.  Alternate explanation of Bible is, well, as old as Bible.<br />Granted, all the puzzles and plot twists and historical anecdotes did not leave much room for real character  development, but this is undoubtedly an interestinig yarn.  Don't you find this type of thriller refreshing amongst all the stories about serial killers, homocidal cops, super lawyers and forensic medical examiners?
B00005JLRT|1.0|...does this series end.<br />Rather than leaving us with any emotional impact over the loss of a long-time character, this movie dispels any tension whatsoever by coming up with a rampant tale of clones and copies, removing any chance that we'll lose a favorite character.  There's nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere.
0316666343|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well-written and an excellent story.  It kept my attention and at times made me laugh and cry.  I've heard a lot of people mention that it is very depressing.  While I found the first two chapters or so to be pretty sad, the book really picked up after that.  As a whole, I thought it gave a pretty positive outlook on death and life after death.  The point of view of the main character (Susie) was very well written.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but I will not go into details of why in order to keep from spoiling the plot.<br />The reason why I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I reserve that rating for only the very best books.  While I completed the book quickly, it wasn't one that I couldn't put down.  I also didn't think that the hype 100% matched the quality of the book.  <br />I'm glad I got my hands on a copy...I would suggest reading it.  Enjoy!

He gives the impression that this work is well researched and his facts about the Catholic Church and the beginnings of Catholicism are true. They are not.

0385504209|3.0|I'm not a Grail devotee, but it looks to me as if Brown's research on the subject (as well as on cryptography and symbology) is pretty accurate. But he needs to take lessons on thriller writing from the late Robert Ludlum.<br />Although Ludlum's characters were larger than life his story and plotlines were always logical - you could pick up any of his books and trace out what happened and why. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" relies far too much on coincidence and inference, and when the villain's identity was actually revealed the story and its author lost a great deal of credibility. Even more credibility was lost in the climax and anti-climax that followed.<br />I can see how this book became so popular because of it's main subject (the mystery of the Holy Grail) and the obvious research that the author did on that subject. But as a thriller or mystery writer Brown falls far short of the mark.
0812548094|4.0|I just started reading Terry Goodkind (&quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series) again.  A few years back, I was reading the second book, Stone of Tears, but never finished it due to it seeming derivative of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time (it had Sisters of the Light, like Aes Sedai, and other similar things) and it being long -  997 pages).  Well, I picked it up again and finished it.  I tell you what, it was excellent (I was stupid for putting it down before).  Goodkind keeps the plot moving and the action brisk.  It doesn't have a series of long chapters (or books) where you get endless description, endless insignificant characters, and nothing happening, as is common in The Wheel of Time.  In other words, Goodkind tells a story and entertains you with action, intrigue, fascinating creatures, spectacular magic, good characters that grow and evolve, philosophy, and satisfiying conclusions. Goodkind gets things going right away and doesn't bore you with excruciating, pointless, mindless drivel that's being used for profit producing filler, like is so common in the later books of The Wheel of Time.  It's like night and day, comparing Jordan to Goodkind in terms of entertainment value.  And it's not like Goodkind lacks in vivid description or quality detail.  He just incorporates description and detail within the flow of the story in a graceful, entertaining fashion that enhances, not detracts from, the reader experience.  So if you are looking for an entertaining, enriching read in the fantasy genre, I recommend Goodkind.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I took my lunchbreak from work to buy this and was so astonished by the powerful and uncompromising performance that I forget to buy lunch. Remember the dorky kid with the \\"take me to the bridge\\" t-shirt in Almost Famous? This is enough to make a 31 year old businessman act like a fawning teenage fan.<br />This is not the meandering, unfocused performance some of you may associate with Led Zep circa 1970's because of the previously available material. This is laserlike in intensity, the backbone is, well, led-footed and innovative, and this might propel Page into the Hendrix stratosphere. There are no highlights, because there are no lowlights. <br />I previously relied on Page/Black Crowes \\"Live at the Greek\\" and Led Zep live at the BBC for decent live material, but this is superior to those performances, because of range of material and the combination of Page's amazing solos and Bonham's tempo-shifting backbeat. The sound is great, and I could go on but I have to go because Bonham is at it in Moby Dick. I can't type and tap at the same time.
B000005S0E|1.0|Don't be fooled by these insane cure fans, who give 5 stars to everything Robert Smith has ever done.  I love this band, and have every album, and this has to be the worst(no wonder its an import only).  With only a couple of good songs, this is a disapointment especially during his best years. So I give it one star (overly bashing it) just to prove a point...I hate coming on to this site and every album gets at least 4 stars just because of obsessed fans cant bear to give their favorite band a bad review.  If these reviews are all bias whats the point of having them?
B00008OWZC|5.0|I just picked up the album, and it is awesome!!! Also, what a great price. [This price] for a 3 CD set is unheard of. The DVD from what I have heard is equally awesome...
B00008OWZC|5.0|Awesome! Awesome!  This album is everything you could want out of a rock band.  Being heard live is really the way Led Zeppelin should be listened to. If you haven't heard them live then you definately need to scoop up this album.  I would recommend this to anyone.
0446678430|3.0|For those who have read other Kiyosaki books, you won't take away any significant new information from this book. It's worth a read if you need a mental refresher course in the Rich Dad basics. Personally, it got me thinking in the right direction again after going a few months without action toward my financial goal, so in that sense, it was worth my time. I'd recommend borrowing it or checking it out from your local library. The money you save may be better spent on a title more specific to your investment interests.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is astounding. His voice; smmoth as silk. <br />This CD echos of great, smooth swingers like Sinatra, Martin, and Torme. Buble is hip when he needs to be, swings when it needs to be swung, and tender when it requires a soft touch. Every track from this 25-year-old is golden.<br />Today's music lacks heart, talent, and feeling. All that and more are found in this timeless disc. His renditions of classic swing standards and his play on more contemporary pop songs are a delight and sweet fodder for your ears.
0553260111|4.0|I waited 5 months to get this book from the library, so I had a bit of frustration and anticipation built into getting to read The Bourne Identity.  I had seen the movie when it came out in the theater, but otherwise this is not a genre that normally interests me.  I decided that I wanted to read the book anyway.<br />While the book and the movie started the same, it became quickly apparent that the movie deviated quite a bit from Ludlum's novel.  The novel opens with two newspaper clippings about an assassin named Carlos.  It moves right into Bourne being shot and falling into the ocean.  He is pulled from the water and is put into the care of a doctor.  The doctor heals Bourne, but Bourne does not remember his past.  He does not know his name or how he came to be where he is.  All he has is an account number for a bank in Zurich.  It is with this knowledge (and the lack thereof) that Jason Bourne begins his quest to unravel his identity.  Bourne's actions are determined by the little information that he has, but he quickly learns that someone is trying to find him and kill him.  He finds out the name of a company that he thinks he works for, Treadstone 71.  But when I tried to contact this company, it doesn't exist...as near as he can tell.  However, the closer he comes to finding who he is and why he has all these skills (fighting, espionage) and memories that he can't explain; the closer he is to being killed.<br />Starting from the simple concept of one man trying to find out who he is, this book travels up the ranks of the U.S. Government to covert ops from the CIA.  The book also has the other side hunting Bourne: the organization of an assassin named Carlos (the Jackal).  This was an extremely engrossing novel and is far superior to the recent movie adaptation.
B000062TU1|4.0|Ok,<br />So I KNOW I'm laying myself on the cross for this one BUT, I really do feel that some of the contents of this movie are NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!!! While I was dazzled with the visual effects and the sound track of the movie, I was also amazed at the age range that they are saying this movie can be viewed by. I don't know about you folks but, my younger kids would have been scarred ... by some of the scenes in this movie.<br />This being said, it's a well developed movie, that you'll want to watch again and again, just be careful with the young ones.(I'd pre-view the movie first before showing it to your younger children)<br />Ciao!!
0345457684|5.0|Altered Carbon was an amazing first novel for Richard Morgan. This guy has a future! The book is dark and slick. It defintely has a Blade Runner feel to it along with some Matrix and Maltese Falcon (or even China Town)like mystery thrown in for good measure. The hero (Kovaks)can handle himself in a fight (he is enhanced) but is quite witty at the same time. His one liners cracked me up. The technology of sleeving (down loading one's mind through science into another body) is also fascinating and scary. Overall this is a great summer beach book. If you are looking for a good detective novel set in a futuristic Gibson/Blade Runner like society with lots of action and phylosophy concerning the nature of the human soul get Altered Carbon!
0060930187|4.0|We thought the book was an interesting perspective into the mind of the depressed. It allowed us to see the despair and struggles facing those with mental illness. It followed Esther though the beginnings of her disease though recovery, allowing us to better understand this process. We liked Esther's use of analogies (such as the fig tree) to explain her feelings toward her life and her world. Esther also seemed more than just a character in a book - she felt like a real person to which one could relate. One flaw in this book is how it sometimes jumps from scene to scene, past to present, with little warning, leading to confusion. Some things were also vague and unexplained, such as Esther's insulin shots and other incidents and characters. Overall, this book was an enlightening and educating experience.

B00005JKCH|5.0|So many movies have to be skipped when deciding what i can buy for my family, given that I have 3 sons and 2 daughters.  Ol spidey had action for the boys, and a love interest for the girls, without over doing either.<br />Given that My review is the 882nd review for this movie, and no one win read this, I guess my 5 star vote is the most important contribution of this review.  The movie contributed for to out family, than I can contribute to it.  <br />Please do a good job on the sequel!!
1558908420|4.0|Here's the deal: Take Stallone (\\"Rocky\\"), De Niro (\\"Heat\\"), Liotta (\\"GoodFellas\\") and Keitel (\\"Mean Streets\\") and put them together and you have probably one of the best ensemble casts you can assemble for a movie. Make a great screenplay and idea and you got a great movie on your hands. The characters are all cops (some crooked, some not) and they all have great lines and play their characters with real authenticity. I live in New Jersey and regularly visit the towns where the film was shot (although it's amazing that in the seven or eight years sinse filming how the locations have changed so dramatically). The realism of the mannerisms and speech patterns are so on target it's scary. It always helps when the cast is really from the East Coast. The cops (whether crooked or not) are all pretty depressed in general displayed by the fact that they are all fat and sluggish, smoke like chimneys and drink like fish at local hangouts. Let's face it fellow Jersey folk: that familiar suburbian boredom of any small Garden State town has lead us all into a \\"Figgs\\"-like self-destructive phase. None of the stars of this film took their regular million dollar paychecks (if they hadn't taken pay cuts this film would never have been made) and they all put on the needed weight and sport the bad hair and clothes, showing that the stress of their work-a-day lives has pushed personal hygene and general happiness on the back burner. The movie is more of a character study (much like \\"Mean Streets\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction\\") with twists and turns and surprises. Garrison, NJ is a fictitious name (probably derived from nearby Harrison) and the movie was filmed across the river from NYC in the run-down (but relatively livable) Edgewater and neighboring towns before Starwood and other hot shot developers built up the waterfront land with condos, stores, restaurants and many other attractions--making the area congested and city-like, a dream for tourists and shoppers. Views of the Manhattan skyline are prevalent at all times and being an East Coaster, I can identify with a lot of this films' themes. Probably one of Stallone's best performances, I'd highly reccommend CopLand to be viewed more than once. If you are a JerseyGoomba like me and a Soprano fan you will particularly enjoy this flick with supporting roles from the likes of Edie Falco before she was Carmela and watch out for Davey Scatino, Gloria Trillo and, well you keep your eyes peeled for the rest. Wish I could have seen cameos by Pesci and Pacino as possible gangsters and maybe Travolta in a small role. Would have made CopLand even better!! I hope for a sequel some day, films like this DO have an audience even if box office receipts are not of the \\"Matrix\\" level.
B00005JLK1|2.0|\\"Ghost Ship\\" is one of those films that draw you in because the basic idea sounds great. An outfit of ship salvagers out of Alaska receives a tip from a man named Ferriman about a mysterious ship that suddenly appeared in the middle of the Bering Strait. On closer examination, the ship turns out to be the Antonia Graza, an Italian cruise liner lost since the early 1960s. The salvage crew gets immensely excited because the ship promises millions in finder's fees. The eventual discovery of gold bars on the ship promises even more wealth, in the 200-300 million dollar range. Regrettably, a few small problems arise during the exploration of the rusted hulk of the ship. The salvage tug blows up under mysterious circumstances, killing one of the crew and leaving the surviving members trapped on the abandoned ship. Even worse, several of the other salvagers encounter eerie ghosts wandering the Antonia Graza, ghosts who seem to take a serious interest in keeping them on board permanently. Top this off with the discovery of a hole in the hull of the ship which promises to sink not only the dreams of the salvage operation but cost them their lives as well and you have the fundamental premise of this horror film. As great as this idea sounds, \\"Ghost Ship\\" fails on nearly every level. Bad acting, a bad script, a bad soundtrack, ineffective gore, and a lack of interesting characters plague this film at every step.<br />Let's start with the gore. The film opens with a flashback about what happened to the passengers on the Antonia Graza. A dance party is underway on the deck, with lots of rich Europeans hobnobbing and generally having a good time. Suddenly, an incredibly bloody encounter with a wire leaves the deck awash in red. The scene is imaginative, of that there is no doubt, but the special effects are rather tepid. An event like this, if it really happened, would result in a veritable tidal wave of the sticky stuff. Instead, we get some lame mannequins and blood that is far too bright (and in insufficient quantities) to prove convincing. Additional scenes, including an unpleasant encounter with a hook, are equally unimpressive and too sparing with the sauce. In an extra on the DVD, the special effects team discusses how they created these scenes for the movie, and one of the guys was wearing a Tom Savini T-shirt. I found myself wishing Savini had done the effects for \\"Ghost Ship.\\" They would have been much better.<br />With the presence of Julianna Margulies, Ron Eldard, and Gabriel Byrne, you would think the acting might give \\"Ghost Ship\\" a boost. Think again. It is unlikely any high-powered actor or actress could have salvaged much from this plodding script. Byrne sleepwalks his way through his role as captain of the salvaging crew, and Margulies is superficial in the \\"tough chick doing the guy thing\\" role that has been done to death in recent years. Eldard fades into the background as one of the welders on the operation, reduced to sneering and laughing his way through the part. The lesser characters are even more forgettable. I think the biggest problem I had with this film involved the acting and the characters because I quickly realized that I didn't like any of them. The macho image projected by all of the characters made me completely indifferent to their individual fates. It's tough to work up any sympathy when characters that are jerks die off in a movie, and every character here is a jerk.<br />One benefit of seeing \\"Ghost Ship\\" on DVD is the plethora of extras. There is plenty of stuff here for the curious viewer. You can watch a documentary containing actor interviews, a documentary on the special effects, a little \\"game\\" where you find four short clips with extra information about the cruise ship, and the usual spate of filmographies on cast and crew. But even here there are problems: An \\"interview\\" with Francesca, the ghostly singer on the cruise liner, is laughable due to her cheesy Italian accent (the actress is actually Italian and it STILL sounds cheesy and unbelievable) and the gauzy camera shots of her dressing for a performance. The tone of this extra footage made me feel as though I was watching one of those international coffee commercials.<br />I should also mention the soundtrack and cinematography of the film. The long arm of \\"The Matrix\\" reaches into the depths of the Antonia Graza, with wildly inappropriate bursts of techno music mixed with the type of jarring camera shots I've come to hate with a passion. I wish filmmakers would quit using gimmicks for no other reason than gimmickry's sake. It adds nothing to character development and is offensive to someone who actually has an attention span that lasts longer than three seconds.<br />With a host of insurmountable flaws to overcome, \\"Ghost Ship\\" founders on the shores of banality. Anyone looking for effective scares, intriguing characters, and a plot without holes that you couldn't sail an ocean liner through will need to look elsewhere. I fervently pray that no salvage team attempts to raise the wreck that is \\"Ghost Ship.\\"ally Italian and it STILL sounds cheesy and unbelievable) and the gauzy camera shots of her dressing for a performance.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|If you really want to hear this album the way it was intended to be heard, get the Russian version.  You could probably find the translation somewhere on the net.  While their English debut is intended to captivate the North American crowd, it is clearly inferior to the Russian release.  Due to their accent and unsuitable voice for English lyrics, a few songs sound a little comical while some of their best tracks are missing.  Whatever happened to Robot and Ya Tvoi Vrag?? Nevertheless, I gave it 4 stars for their well spent effort.
0679882820|1.0|This bright and early board book is an abridged edition of a Dr. Seuss classic.  The intent seems to have been to create an infant and toddler friendly edition of the book.  Unfortunately, the editing was done very poorly.  Much of what children seem to perceive at this age is \\"rhythm and rhyme\\" - the musicality of spoken language, if you will - not necessarily the story or the words themselves.  In the editing process, much of the special \\"rhythm and rhyme\\" that makes Dr. Seuss so special was garbled.  While some of the \\"noises\\" are still fun, much has been lost and this edition isn't half as good as the unabridged  (non-board book) version.<br />If you are looking for a book of \\"wonderful noises\\" for young children in a board book format, a better bet would be Sandra Boynton's \\"Moo Baa La La La\\" (published by Simon and Schuster and available on www.Amazon.com).  Or, wait until your child is a little older and purchase the unedited Dr. Seuss (also available on www.Amazon.com).<br />Incidentally, Random House decided to publish this edition without acknowledging the fact that it is an abridgement, in clear lettering, on the front outer cover .  Other of this company's board books reportedly share the same problem.  The legalities notwithstanding, this is certainly a misleading practice, if not outright unethical.  Wake up, Random House!
0812550706|1.0|The plot involves super-genius children receiving military training in preparation for an invasion by alien insect creatures.  Most of the book is detailed tactical descriptions of paint-ball played in zero gravity by 12 year olds.  The children then graduate to \\"command school\\" and train on star-fighter simulators.<br /><br />It's as idiotic as it sounds.  Written for 12 year old readers, I think.<br /><br />Maybe it is pretty good for juvenile literature?
B000002WYT|4.0|Crash is a great CD.  I wouldn't call myself a hardcore fan of the band...but I do enjoy their music, and I have most of their CD's.  I love the blend of styles on Crash...you get some jazz sounding stuff, some rock, some pop (sorta), and even some bluegrass sounding music (on tripping billies, maybe bluegrass isn't the right word, but it's not your usual rock stuff.)  The band is never boring and they seem to mix it up a lot, blending a number of styles into one song sometimes.  <br />The drumming by Beauford is, as always, amazing...this guy can really rock.  It's the kind of drumming that makes me want to right down at the set and play along (which I have done more times than I can count.)  I don't love all the songs on this album (not even really a big fan of the title track), but overall it's a really great, tightly woven album, and the songs all sound nice together.  It's probably my favorite CD by the band...I personally think their sound has changed a bit over the past few years. This has the original DMB sound that I love, reminds me a lot of the type of music on UNDER THE TABLE...
0446608955|1.0|This is quite literally the worst book I have ever read.  I really did try to like it, but it is just one cliche after another.  The ending was so expected, I might as well have just read the book jacket.  Only to be read as a near substitute for soap operas.
6304493681|5.0|This was one of the first anime movies I had ever seen, and from the few opening scenes I fell in love with it. Since then I have seen many an anime (movie or series) and this is still one of my favorites.
B00008OSD3|2.0|I am a star trek fan and this movie has so much cheque and usage of techo mumbo jumbo words that it clearly lost the one thing that makes the previous star trek its true stamp of approval, and that is originality. It is acceptable if this movie was made as a typical tv episode but not as a grand final to end the star trek movie serie. Let me tell you some of the scene i find strange.<br />1) When Data said to Wolf that the arm he was holding appear to be a robotic arm and Wolf said 'very astute'. Now when do you ever see a Klingon (Wolf for that matter) use words like that? Not likely. What Wolf should of said was 'You think?'. That would of been funny and acceptable.<br />2) When the 'away' team was given coordinate by that ugly remus vice roy that included just about every key member. Why does both Picard and Riker need to beam down? One of them should of stayed on board in case it was a trap. There was no discussion of what would happen if something where to happen to the 'away' team. I suppose the enterprise would be waiting forever because no one would know what to do. <br />3) The 'shooting' scene with Picard and Data on the Zinatar warbird. How come neither of them got hit in the open?  There were more enamies and they were being hit left and right yet neither of the good guys got a single nick. That goes for the 'shooting' scene on the enterprise with Riker and Wolf. Did you see Riker just walk up to that docking hole and just crawl in (in the middle of constant shooting back and forth. You would think he would of got hit. Not only that, it was crazy to even attempt to go thru that hole in the middle of constant fire. He told Wolf to give him cover HA. That is so funny when he said that. The only people that seem to gotton hit are the crew with no names. I find these fighting scenes to be totally unrealistic since none of the main crew got hit other then DATA in the end.<br />4) DATA sacrifice in the very end because Captain Pikard just froze in the end. What if Data didn't help him in the end?  Would that mean everyone in the enterprise would of died? Yes they would, and the blood would of been on Picard's hand because he didn't do anything but froze there in the end. Then again, if he did act, both him and data would of died, so i guess its better to lose one then both. <br />In the end, i was rooting for the Remus Warbird Zinatar over the Ramulian warbirds since it was the Remus who were being liberated from the cruelty of the Ramulan and i have no respect for them. They seem like good people who's real goal should of been to conquer the Ramulans and make them dig the mines to see how they feel about it. I am for liberating the Rimens. <br />Do i recomment watching this movie...Yes, if your a diehard 'trekkie' fan. If your not, skip it and watch First Contact, then Insurrection.
0790729628|5.0|I, like many other few thousands, worship this movie... with its flaws included... And I must say something that between the purists may sound sacrilege: I don't like the Director's Cut as much as the voiced over one.<br />You can see a BR many times and see a new movie in each review, but, c'mon! This is FILM NOIR, and without the voice over (even with the down-toned edition of Ford), it is not!!<br />Buy it if you want it, you will enjoy it, even without the &quot;happy ending&quot; but don't let pass the opportunity to watch the original if some re-run is screened...
6300215814|5.0|Audry at her best as tiffany. This movie is a classic and one i can watch over again without regress. I will not go over the storyling or plot since you can find that out yourself. I will say to watch it and enjoy the heyday's of life in Manhatten. You never life until you live there. You just don't see movies like this no more. However, Mickey Rooney looks funny trying to portrey an asian. Nethertheless, its a great movie.
B00006LPER|5.0|The \\"Piano Teacher\\" is one of *those* films.<BR>You are probably either going to *love* it, or you are going to LOATHE it. There is really no middle ground. <br />So which will it be, for you?<BR>If you like your films easy and with Arnold Schwarzenegger in, you will almost undoubtedly loathe it. If you come from some rural backwater and believe in that whole \\"christian\\" thing, the same applies. If you have heard that this film is \\"dirty\\" and has \\"sex in it\\" you will probably feel deeply ripped off.<br />If on the other hand, you know that Hollywood has only produced four or five films worth a damn in the last ten years, and have turned your attentions to the films of the rest of the world, you will be in for a serious treat. \\"The Piano Teacher\\" is a real film, about real people, and real human relationships and as such it is neither simplistic or particularly easy to watch. <br />If you like films that make you think and draw a deep emotional response, you will like this film. If you like the idea of a lloooonnng argument or acrimonious discussion after a film, \\"The Piano Teacher\\" is definitely one to watch. It *really* stirs the pot.<br />A brilliant film, but one that some people find very difficult to deal with. Check out some of the commentaries on this film on the web, just search for \\"Piano Teacher meaning\\" on Google.<br />Magnificent stuff, and top marks to Isabelle Huppert for one of the greatest performances EVER in a motion picture.<br />...but beware the warnings, this film is not for those who value simple pleasures.

B000002GWN|5.0|Joni Mitchell's &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot; is a wonderful live album, which just recently has been finding its way more and more into my CD player's tray.Recorded primarily at the Universal Amphitheatre (Circa '74)the album features Joni doing some of her more popular songs of the era, while she is backed up by the jazz ensemble, 'The L.A. Express' (featuring horn player Tom Scott).I like to think of this as a gateway recording between the light musical shadings of &quot;For the Roses&quot; and the folk/jazz/rock sound found on the immensely popular, break-out album &quot;Court &amp; Spark. Eventually the transition would lead too the more serious, hard core jazz found on &quot;Mingus&quot; and the  stupendous, live recording, &quot;Shadows &amp; Light&quot;. On &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot; we are treated to a mix of both folk and light jazz arrangements.The album opens with a lively rendition of &quot;You Turn Me On (I'm a Radio)&quot; which really makes my pulse race. The same can be said for the classic track &quot;Woodstock&quot;. But instead of the slow mournful version, that we are use to Joni singing, we hear something that is closer to the rock athem made famous by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. Different but still good! The album also features slower material such as nuanced versions of &quot;A Case of You&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;.Other highlights include the 'Court &amp; Spark' rocker &quot;People's Parties&quot; and an off center audience sing-a-long of &quot;Circle Game&quot;.The recording has a boisterous audience, that includes one excited guy who shouts out &quot;Joni, you have more class than Mick Jagger, Richard Nixon and Gomer Pyle combined&quot;.The references might be a bit dated, but we all know what he means. A classy lady giving a classy performance!
B00008PX8P|5.0|There are no words to decribe this movie.  Jimmy Page is perhaps the best guitarest of all time and this movie shows it.  I actually own this movie so I'm not writing a review without having experienced it first.  While the movie advertised the four songs from the garden weren't on The Song Remains The Same in all honesty two of the songs were.  None the less this movie is a must but even if you're not a fan of Zeppelin.  I own every Zeppelin album and this movie plays the best song of practically every album, and they play it well.  This movie is definately worth the price and you'll find yourself watching all 5 hours and 20 minutes of it.
6305311463|5.0|While the movie has no more than 5 minutes tops of extra intakes that Michael Bay put in, they're more than most would need if you're a die hard fan of this movie. The little bit extra that he's put in really tops off this movie. If anything, this DVD entitles you to the bragging rights to owning one of those \\"special copies\\" of a truly great movie. <br />This movie is a definate winner if the one DVD regular edition isn't enough to your satisfaction. This extra dvd does for armageddon ...<br />I love this DVD!
B00004XMS0|5.0|This movie series starting in 1989 and ending in 1997 is a truly awesome set consisting of three great Batman movies and one dud of a movie. The first three movies are absolutely amazing and powerful and are as good today as they were back during the years when they were released. This set overall is just a great marathon of tons of action and eye-candy and if you like all four of them (I only liked the first three), then pick this set up.<br />Here's my review for each of the individual movies:<br />BATMAN (1989): This first entry in the series was a defining moment in my childhood as a young kid. No I wasn't watching teletubbies or that kind of muck. No! I was watching this amazing and riveting movie entitled \\"Batman\\" and this was what turned me onto the entire comic book franchise for many years after this movie. Starring Jack Nicholson as the maniacal criminal The Joker, Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Kim Basinger as his romantic interest Vicki Vale, this movie is absolutely a dark, foreboding and totally engaging masterpiece and a true work of art, thanks in part to the dark genius that is Tim Burton. The story is of a criminal mastermind who was badly maimed after an accident at a chemical plant and driven mad into insanity and becoming the homicidal maniac The Joker and Batman goes on his first major crime-fighting mission to stop him and his menacing crime sprees. The scenery in this movie and the dark and highly foreboding atmosphere make this movie absolutely a masterpiece. The entire cast must have had a great time filming this movie. Hats off to Tim Burton for bringing Batman to life. This movie defined a period in my childhood.<br />BATMAN RETURNS (1992): A wicked and absolutely dark successor to the 1989 original and a classic all on it's own \\"Batman Returns\\" continues the dark foreboding atmosphere of the first movie but with an even darker and much colder mood. This outing brings the mysterious crimefighter against two major criminals. One is a corrupt industrial CEO named Max Schreck and the other is the main villain Oswald Cobblepot aka The Penguin. Danny DeVito was absolutely brilliant in his role as Cobblepot/Penguin, showing the extremely twisted and malicious personality of the character. The third villain is somewhat uncertain. That is the sultry Catwoman. Played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Catwoman could as well be the most complex and most perplexing character in the entire Batman movie saga. Is she truly a villainess or a heroine? Perhaps both? Makes you wonder. Anyhow, \\"Batman Returns\\" is a dynamite and cold classic for the ages and also defined a moment in my life as well just like the first one did. Hats off to Tim Burton for creating another masterpiece. These two movies directed by Burton will be very difficult for some of the more comic humor audience to digest but overall, they are absolutely incredible movies.<br />BATMAN FOREVER (1995): \\"Batman Forever\\" while having it's share of flaws, was a highly enjoyable third entry. This movie went in a very different direction with the reigns passed on to director Joel Shumacher and the end result was a less forboding and more colorful addition to the movie trilogy. Actor Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton in the role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and I have to say he did a good job at succeeding Keaton. Richard Grayson aka Robin comes into the picture and is played by Chris O'Donell and joins the superhero business after his parents and brother are killed when the equipment at a circus stunt collapsed after being sabotaged. The two main villains are the homicidal maniac Two Face and the highly eccentric bozo madman Edward Nigma also known as The Riddler. The two villains team up as they use a special hypnotizing invention that Riddler built while a scientist at a laboratory to ensnare the minds of Gotham City and then eventually the world. Batman and his new sidekick Robin team up against them to stop their malicious goal of taking over the world population. While this movie is far less foreboding and brighter in general with a bit more comical humor, the darkness of the first two and the colorfulness of Shumacher's directing perfectly balanced each other out well. Schumacher did a great job with this movie. I wish I could've said the same for the following movie. To me, the series should've stopped right here. This is the last Batman movie from my perspective.<br />BATMAN & ROBIN (1997): OH HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN! After the success of three awesome Batman movies, the entire franchise comes to a disheartening end with this abysmal fourth installment in the series. I don't necessarily agree with George Clooney being unworthy of playing Batman nor Arnold Schwardsanegger as Mr. Freeze but the entire plot of the movie was very weak and completely devoid of any signs of development. The two main villains in this movie are Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Unfortunately, great potential for a great follow-up to \\"Forever\\" was completely wasted on excessive colors and too much MTV style directing, not to mention awful acting by all of the cast except for Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth who was very good actually, and terrible lines and MTV-style sequences. Everyone on the cast looks incredibly uncomfortable and Schumacher completely stunts any possible character development from taking form. This movie is just a sad and tragic ending to a marvelous movie legacy. In fact, it doesn't even deserve to have been categorized with the other three Batman movies. Schumacher and company owe the entire fan base an apology for this mess!!<br />This set overall, apart from \\"Batman & Robin\\", is a great purchase if you don't have any of these movies yet. This set isn't perfect because of the disastrous \\"Batman & Robin\\" and would've been perfect had that 1997 flop been taken out of this set. For the few who like the atrocious final Batman movie in the series, then by all means pick this set up. For the ones who liked the first three, or even just the first two, this set is worth passing by but the first three are worth getting.

0380977788|5.0|This book is said to be written for children. And while the reading level is probably that of a child, the content most definitely is not. Remember, this is Neil Gaiman we're talking about here. The creator of Neverwhere and the Sandman graphic novels is not about to tone down the creepy factor just because he's writing for kids. The only thing missing from this book that would make it for older readers is the violence and language that is commonplace in Gaiman's books for adults.    Anyway, the plot: Young Coraline Jones has just moved into an apartment filled with strange old people. So, for lack of anything else to do, she starts exploring her new home. What she finds is a door in her family's drawing room, a door that leads to an alternate world. In this strange new place, Coraline meets her Other Mother and Other father, who look just like her real parents, except that they have buttons for eyes. Coraline's Other Mother would like nothing better than to have Coraline for her own child. So, she kidnaps the real parents and hides them. With the help of a black cat, Coraline must rescue her real parents, as well as the souls of several other children that the Other Mother has stolen, all while trying to get home in one piece.    This book is written with a slow, deliberate voice that is almost childlike, which makes the story seem even creepier. The scary moments of the book (and there are many of them) are not so much nasty or terrifying as they are odd and unexpected. If you are a true Gaiman afficionado, Coraline feels like a toned-down version of the author's even weirder graphic novel \\"The comical tragedy or tragical comedy of Mr. Punch\\". If you aren't a Gaiman fan, or even if you haven't read any of his books, this is definitely a good book to get started on, since it gives you sort of a feel for his other books. If you like Coraline, it's likely you'll enjoy Gaiman's other novels as well. If you don't...Well, then I suppose you can always go to Stephen Kingfor your horror fix.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Man, I wish I had seen them when I was younger. I have never heard them sound better having gone from vinyl to cd and now dvd. This dvd sounds good on pcm stereo as well as dd and dts but I do think I prefer the stereo version. Bonham is an animal on the drums and as far as Page is concerned well he's amazing. If you only have seen \\"The song remains the same\\" on dvd...., this is so much better. This will be watched for years to come by both myself , my kids and my grand kids.
0440539811|5.0|Don't listen to the haters on this one.  Basically all the revues denouncing this book so far are by people who have their heads stuck so far up pop-culture's exterior that they are inable to judge useful literature from non-useful(albei entertaining) literature.  The Illuminatis Trilogy is useful literature.  It will change you.  Be prepared.  One thing that the critics always complain about is plot.  These people are missing the whole point: that the plot isn't the point of the story in the first place.  It's not where you end up, it's how you get there.  Read this book with a closed mind and you'll hate it.  Read this book with an open mind and you will find a new you.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This incredible collaboration of video footage is nothing short of astounding. To see the band progress from their early days of still working out the kinks to full-blown rock and roll stardom draws few parallels. Just to have seen any previously unreleased footage from Led Zeppelin would have sufficed, yet the quality of both audio and visual is over the top. Recommended for anyone who has the slightest interest in rock and roll.
0385507755|5.0|I read a lot of books.  All of my favorite authors are dead.  Frey's book has me excited about a new writer for the first time maybe ever.  <BR>   I was impressed with the technique but not overwhelmed or overly absorbed by it and, as a result, was able to feel genuine emotion for and towards the characters. <BR>   A Million Little Pieces is an excellent, exciting book.  I am looking forward to the next one.

B000002H33|5.0|This is by far the best album ever. Period. Sadlly :( Metallica's albums past 92' are pretty bad. Here is a review of every song on the CD. <br />1. Battery- This is the type of song that Metallica invented. Start off with a nice calm accustic, and then hit you with a fast paced hard metal song. Great to start off the album, and one of my favorite songs by them. 10/10<br />2. MASTER OF PUPPETS- THE GREATEST SONG IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. WOW!!!! WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW INCREDIBLE THIS SOng is. IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THIS SONG< YOU HAVE NOT LIVED!!! THis is byfar the greatest thing your ears will have the pleasure of hearing. Its a fast, hard metal song, but dosnt stay that way the whole time. It has an incredible solo, and is the song that made Metallica great. 10000/ 10 Yes that is possible. <br />3 The thing that should not be- A good song, but definately not the best. Its a good song, not very heavy, and not to calm either. 7/10<br />4. Welcome home (sanitarium)- Definately a good song, Starts off relatively slow, and gradually gets heavier so you almost dont notice it. Has a good solo, and a good ballad all around. 10/10<br />5. Disposeable heroes- Not a very long song, but really heave, and pretty good. Better than The thing that should not be. 9/10<br />6. Leper Messiah- Good song, a little slow, but very good, one of the best on the album. 8.5/10<br />7. Orion- Awsome song, this is not a song that they EVER play at a concert, I have all the live stuff that they have released and this song isnt on any of the. <br />8. Damage Inc. A good song to end the album with. A really heavy song, short, just a little over 5 minutes. <br />Overall, The best album of all time, from the best band of all time. If you liked this Cd, then get Ride the Lightning, similar, with some songs just as good.<br />List of Metallica albums.<br />-Kill em all 1983<BR>-Ride the Lightning 1984<BR>-Master of puppets 1986<BR>-...And Justice for all 1988<BR>- Metallica (the black album) 1991<BR>-Live S$*t Binge and Purge (live 3 cd, two DVD, album) 1991,92' 93.<BR>- Load-1996<BR>-Reload1998<BR>- S&M 2000 (Live with San Fancisco Symphony)<BR>-St. Anger 2003.

B00003CWTI|5.0|... chances are you'll like Magnolia.<br />Magnolia is a quirky indie that will tend not to appeal to mainstream tastes, which is a compliment I'm sorry to say.  In other words, if you tend to really hate movies that play in small theaters, don't watch it and stay home to catch Buffy the Vampire Slayer or something.<br />Magnolia is a masterful movie with masterful cinematography, art direction, acting, editing and --albeit imperfect-- multi-plot screenplay.  The movie is quirky but thoroughly engaging to anyone interested in drama - that is the human condition and emotion, and human conflict (internal and external).  There's an abundance of interesting plot turns and character textures to keep your eyes, ears and mind fully riveted to the screen.  Like a fine wine, its complexity can be overlooked, so keep your senses on full alert!<br />The most stunning aspect of the movie are the risks the actors take.  You won't see a reserved Tom Cruz guarding his hollywood persona here.  You'll see Tom Cruz the actor nobody knows about.  Yup, Cruz gives a stunning performance, and that's coming from, how should I put it, a non-fan.  The rest of the star studded cast deliver in full taking tremendous risks and displaying a complexity of emotion that you just don't see in most movies.<br />If you like indies, like alternative screenplays, or want to see some honest, spontaneous moments of acting, I recommend Magnolia.

B00008OWZC|5.0|June 25, 1972 is one source of &quot;How the West Won&quot; and is known to bootleg collectors as &quot;Burn Like a Candle.&quot; It's one of the group's best shows and was, along with the June 27 show, an ideal choice for this set. With much more spark than &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; and more atmosphere than &quot;BBC Sessions,&quot; &quot;How the West Won&quot; is destined to become Zeppelin's definitive live set (until Page releases a set with one of the Earl's Court shows from 1975!).<br />The floodgates open with the hammer of the gods, &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, and there's no chance for the audience or listener to catch their breath with a jump right into &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. The stage is set for a no-holds barred show. The tracks from &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; that the band added to the set list just days earlier sound fresh out of the box, especially &quot;Dancing Days.&quot;<br />&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; live was never the same twice and this edition is proof of that. Page always knew how to stretch this workhorse and Jones and Bonham follow along for the ride.<br />Really, it's all here. You can tell that barely seven months after it's release, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was already a fan favorite. The &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medly allows the band to delve into their favorites. &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp&quot; and &quot;That's the Way&quot; show the band's accoustic side, and &quot; &quot;The Ocean&quot; and &quot;Bring it on Home&quot; close out a show (two shows, really) that shouldn't have been under wraps for 31 years.

0780622553|4.0|Dark City is an excellent film - one of the most interesting in the sci fi genre.  This movie is heavily influenced by film noir and other dark science fiction, including the director's more popular but inferior work, The Crow.  While the movie suffers in the acting department and there are certain stylistic issues, it is definitely a great movie to watch and a return to good genre film moviemaking that has been missing for quite some time.  Naturally, it does not fit into the pop paradigm, and was largely overlooked.<br />The movie takes place on an \\"experimental\\" city that is always dark and subject to change at the whim of powerful alien forces.  The \\"experiments\\" are intended to determine whether people, given a certain set of memories, will continue to behave in a predictable manner - or if free will and individuality transcend this process.  The hive-mind, collectivist experimenters are in for a surprise, however, when certain individuals choose not to cooperate.  The movie explores what it means to be human and touches on cognition, the individual's relationship to society, psychological illnesses, and genuine human emotion.<br />Rufus Sewell does a horrible job as the protagonist, Keifer Sutherland overacts his role as mad scientist good guy helping the bad guy, and the supporting cast provides almost no emotion to the story.  Yes, its true, the movie is poorly acted, and there are some issues with the \\"mind power\\" that certain characters emit from their brains.  Also, the evil alien overlords look way too much like the bad guys from \\"Hellraiser\\" for my taste.  You will have to suspend your disbelief several times during the film, and this may turn off many viewers who are not used to science fiction.  If you are not a fan of the genre, you will most likely not like this movie.<br />For the rest of us, this movie explores interesting themes in a new way.  The special effects aren't what you'll see in \\"The Matrix,\\" to which this movie is often compared, and the action scenes are not nearly as exciting.  However, I recommend this movie for its story, wonderful art direction, and compelling themes.  It should keep you watching until the end, and then bring you back another time to really understand it.  The DVD's special features are poor, but the movie looks stunning on a good system and is worth owning.  Watch this movie, it won't let you down if you know what to expect.he action scenes are not nearly as exciting.

B00005M91K|5.0|In a world where we are being slammed with screaming advertisements from the TV to the roadways, this collection of moving images is like having your senses massaged. The only dialogue is the glorious soundtrack, which I immediatly ran out and bought after I saw this film. If you're a movie or TV junkie, take a nice break from MTV and primetime. If you want to rent it, chances are that Blockbuster won't carry it...allowing you to discover that independent video rental store hidden two blocks away.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence is combination of hard guitars and soft strings and pianos that all support Amy Lee's beautiful voice and rare, signature style.  It is not a masterpiece or triumphing musical achievement, but it is a very good first album and very pleasing to listen to.  It should appeal to a wide variety of people - as a model for pop rock, it is outstanding.  I would very much like to see more groups emulate this style and showcase instrumental and vocal talent on the popular stage.<br />The tracks are a mixture of very soft pieces and hard, rock-rap injunctions.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a pretty balad, and &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is a semi-gothic anthem that stands out among a crowd of very good-but-not-distinct tracks.  The end of the CD is slightly disappointing, but the album works together as a unit.  Production is sharp and refined, Ms. Lee projects her voice rather well for a first album, and Evanescence promises to have some staying power because of consistent quality and good, emotional hooks.<br />My recommendation: buy the CD if you like &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; which I'm sure you have heard hundreds of times by now if you are considering this album at all.  You won't be disappointed, it is everything it purports to be without any bad (or good, really) surprises.
055357342X|5.0|I have written reviews of the previous two books in the series as well, and if you have the time and absolutely nothing better to do (I certainly hope that isn't the case!), then you can read them and see that I started off with a relatively lukewarm opinion of the series. Well, it's growing on me by leaps and bounds. The character development stands out as absolutely the most interesting I have read in the fantasy genre in quite a while. As others have pointed out, we get to see some particularly interesting developments in the previously uninvestigated character of Jaime Lannister as well as his never uninteresting younger brother Tyrion. <br />If you, like me, left the last book wondering when we were going to get down to some real nitty-gritty plot development, this book will not leave you unsatisfied. Many developments occur in the area of supernatural powers. We get to spend alot more time beyond the wall, and are tantalized by what is hinted at out there. of course, the Starks get even more manhandled and scattered. Daenerys continues on her path of subjugating the free cities, which provides an interesting, at-this-point-unrelated subplot with a very vivid landscape. <br />Finally, a large number of characters who walk quite unaware into this book don't get out alive, so I am pretty sure that after the final few tumultuous chapters of this installment, we will be left with a very different and interesting landscape at the start of &quot;A Feast For Crows&quot;. I, for one, can't wait!
0140177396|5.0|Review of: Of Mice and Men<br /> Of Mice and Men is a novel about two men named George and Lennie who have the dream of owning their own farm one day. The problem however, is that George and Lennie do not have nearly enough money to pay for their own farm nonetheless pay for a decent living. George is a small dark man who is pretty smart, and his counterpart Lennie is a little different. Lennie has a slight mental disability because he nearly drowned in a river that he and George swam in a long time before the novel started. Because George felt that he did not to enough to save Lennie, he vowed to take care of Lennie for the rest of his life. <BR> The next day, Lennie and George apply for a job at a local farm. They get a job and are allowed to live in a bunker house on the farm. In the house, they meet Candy, who is a another \\"hand' around the farm, and Curley, who is the boss' mean-spirited son. Lennie and George work on the farm for the next week or so, when Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans for the farm they are going to buy. Candy vows to not tell anyone about the plans and says he will donate his life savings if he is allowed to live on the land. From that point on, whenever someone threatens Lennie or tries to make fun of him because of his disabilities, (example is Curley when he is jealous that his wife is hitting on everyone) Candy is there to back Lennie. <BR> During one of the following evenings, Lennie and Curley's wife get into a discussion about how they love to touch things that are soft. Curley's wife allows Lennie to feel her hair, and after a couple of minutes Lennie is yanking at Curley's wife's hair and ends up breaking her neck. Previously before this incident, Lennie had killed his baby puppy that had been given to him as a present. The next morning, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head as an act of mercy, to relieve him of a life, that he obviously never wanted to live. <BR> I thought that there were a couple ofaspects in this novel that could have made it a banned book. An aspect may have been, who and who isn't allowed to work legally in the United States. I thought in the past, there may have been a law that said that no person with mental disabilities would be allowed to work manual labor. Because of this law, I thought they may ban this book because it is a prime example of how a retarded person got away with working on a farm and how the novel may show examples for other mentally-challenged people in the world to find jobs. Because this book, I thought promoted illegal policies, it would be banned. Also in a moral standpoint, I think this book may have been banned to relieve the public about a story of a retarded person who's life turned out so badly for him. I think this book may have disturbed many people in the past, therefore, the book was banned so when people saw mentally-challenged people, they would not relate the person to the story of Lennie in Of Mice and Men. <BR> I think this book positively aspects the literary world and its' themes should be shared by everyone that can read a book. I have many reasons why I believe this. First of all, I really liked how Of Mice and Men portrays the value of human existence. At one point in the book, we notice how Lennie has the need of a friend, yet he will cling to a stranger, such as Curley's wife, for self-comfort. In scenarios such as this one, we can see that tyranny does not come from those who are rich and powerful, and I believe that this is a very powerful concept to have the knowledge of because oppression does not come from \\"the hands of the heavens,\\" which is something everyone needs to know. <BR> Another aspect of this book that positively influences the outside world is how there is no possibility of everything happening perfectly, or \\"The American Dream.\\" There are many examples of this throughout the book. For example, Curley's wife wishes to one day be a movie star, Crooks wishes to be the hardest worker on Lennie and George's farm, and Candy wishes that he will have a friend, (George) own a large piece of land. Obviously, none of these wishes came true. The moral to this is, what makes dreams is the desire to follow their own freedoms, and dreams, as shown by Of Mice and men, will never occur. And that is something that every American needs to know, is that dreams are meant to be dreams, and the sooner you know that, the better it is; which is why this book is a positive influence to the outside world.  <BR> I would recommend this book to all advanced readers because it not only provides an interesting setting, climax, and plot, it provides a great understanding of the world, and what meanings of life the world has to offer. If you would like to have a story told to you that tells you the journeys of two young men who are looking for answers to life, but get them in symbolic form, read this novel, because you look at things a whole lot differently, once you look at life from a different standpoint.

But then I downloaded like two of their songs and I abosolutely loved them. I immediatly bought their album and loved all their songs and when I buy a cd, its very rare that I like all the songs on the cd.Amy Lee's voice is very beautiful and angelic and the songs are really really good, especially their lyrics. People should really stop comparing them to linkin park because seriously this band has something all their own.
055357342X|2.0|Oh, gods...  I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books.  His stories progress at a glacial pace.  This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent.  Or rather, the majority of them aren't.  If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading (Tyrion for example).  Or if the characters were effective, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas.  Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.<BR>The books I'm reminded of most to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books.  He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like.  Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle.
B00000ICN5|4.0|Steve Ray Vaughan was one heck of a guitar player.  Texas Flood, his fine debut consistents of many stunning guitar solos and embelleshments.<br />Pride And Joy is a stunning track that is very worthy of all its airplay on classic rock stations.  But there are many other highlights on here.  The rollicking Testify offers some wicked solos but on the studio and live versions.  The slow blues Dirty Pool features some extremely creative guitar stylings and Stevie Ray seems to be playing rhythm and lead almost simultaneously.  Lenny is a soothing jazz workout.  Also like the unrelased version of Tin Pan Alley in spite of the odd fade out.<br />Its straight ahead blues/three chord rock.  This may not be for everyone and yes it can be a bit redundant.  Nonetheless, you cannot deny the talents of Stevie Ray Vaughan as they shine quite strong on this fine collection.

But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like.  Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle.
B00005LANG|4.0|Many pleasing tunes abound on Bob Marley's Exodus CD.  Three Little Birds and One Love/People Get Ready truly grab me with such pleasing tones and captivating melodies.  However some of the less familiar tunes like Turn Your Lights Down Low and Natural Mystic stand fairly tall as well.<br />The style does not vary too much and a few songs are a little long.  Nonetheless, like Catch A Fire or the Legend compilation you cannot deny the soothing effects of Mr. Marley.  Put it on and don't worry because the music is just allright.
0553579908|2.0|Oh, gods...  I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books.  His stories progress at a glacial pace.  This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent.  Or rather, the majority of them aren't (Tyrion is a pleasant exception).  If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading.  Or if the characters were dynamic, that would be alright.

0688163173|5.0|This was a wonderful mystery, full of unexpected twists and turns.  I don't want to give away more than has already been described by others, so I will just say that, in addition to the fine mystery, I found especially nice the wonderful picture drawn of the early 1950s.  Everything seems just right on target.  Anyone who loves a good mystery, full of doubletakes, will love this book.  The delimma that is mentioned in the book re the sorts of treatment, surgical vs drugs vs talk, has led to much discussion in my family.  I will say, however, finally, that I did kind of guess the end before I was a dozen pages in.  But that is not a reflection on the skills of the author -- I just have read lots of stories and there are only so many twists any plot can take.  And the author gave exquisite little hints.  I plan to read all his works!
B00000DNCF|5.0|The bonus disc is named s.o.m.m.s., when spelled out is a palindrome (spelled the same forwards and backwards). Badmotorfinger alone is incredible, but knowing that this limited edition is hard to find, I had to get it. Most or all of these tracks can be found elsewhere, but nice to have together here. A few covers to start. \\"Into the Void\\" (Sabbath), \\"Girl you Want\\" (Devo), \\"Stray cat Blues\\" (Stones). All done very well. Then \\"She's a Politician\\" (Cornell), and a live version of \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\". ONLY that song is done live. Not all five. This is a great find for the Soundgarden fan, though you may have to search the used bins or online to get it. Maybe soon we'll get a \\"B-sides\\" disc to complement the \\"A-sides\\" one. I heard there's a live album in the works too, but watch that not be out until 2011 or something.
0385504209|1.0|The plot of this looked so intriguing and had the potential to be an entertaining, educational thriller.  What it emerged as ,however, was a sophomoric waste of time.  I found myself angered at the predictable, ridiculous plot and the thin characters.  Without exaggeration, this book would be great for a junior high student looking for an adverturous novel.  As a well read adult, I  was appalled that this poorly written garbage would ever get published.<br />If I could count the number of times a hidden code was magically deciphered through a simple \\"Oh my God, I've got it!\\" it would outnumber my digits.  I am apalled that people are not only buying this [...] but enjoying it.  Funny thing is, I bought it with the intent of reading a mindless, entertaining novel. What I got was a waste of time and money.  [...]
B000002HH9|3.0|Besides the fact that the cover art's bad, here's the deal with &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;. When taken by itself, it's actually quite good. Very up, and pop melodies. There's pop songs on many Cure albums, just not so many. The bashing starts when this is compared to other Cure classics. Imagine if INXS had put out a slow, dark, acoustic cd. It would've been the same kind of shock. I'm actually glad we didn't get a &quot;Disintegration&quot; part 2, 3, and 4. And this does have a few of the typical Cure songs on it as well. But overall, if you're a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; kind of Cure fan, you should enjoy this also. It was good that this was followed by &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; though.
0066620996|5.0|This is a book that has profound insight which is nicely based on empirical data.  It is refreshing to read a full case study written by an author that admits to personal leadership flaws and who is in search of bettering himself by applying the rules learned during his research.  In this book, you won't get deluged with leadership principals offered by an oracle who wants you to enact his insight.  You get the facts as displayed through research into 11 proven great companies and the leadership that got them there.  The principals that are reported in this book are timeless and yet newly reported.  From a biographical standpoint, you will learn how to be a better business and human leader.<br />As a person that loves leadership, I have spent many years reading books such as Primal Leadership, Developing the Leader Within, Lincoln on Leadership, etc.  What Good to Great does is show you how it works in real life.  It teaches that you can be you and still be great without having to develop some smarmy charisma.  It shows that the toughest challenge is the people you put &quot;on the bus&quot; rather than how you motivate them and manage them.  It proves that building great organizations is about diligence rather than magic or markets.<br />Get this book, find a good highlighter and a few hours.  This is one of few business books that you cannot afford to miss.

0385504209|3.0|This is truly a page-turner: I finished it in one day.  The action hurtles along relentlessly, with fascinating detail as well as (largely) erudite commentary.  It's so much fun that it seems churlish to complain, but there were enough errors, inaccuracies, improbabilities, and contrivances large and small to create a nagging feeling of sloppiness and manipulation.<br />Call me a nitpicker, but I'm sick and tired of having people state a word as Latin when it is Greek (the opposite is rarer): a scholar such as Brown should know better.  Referring to a sports car as an Astin Martin (at least twice) when it should be Aston Martin reveals sloppy research and editing.  No Briton would ever say \\"downtown London\\": this is one of many similar slip-ups in tone.  The Seine's waters should be \\"turbid\\", not \\"turgid\\".  And the author falls into the usual trap of Western-centered blindness when he totally ignores the 1000-year history of Byzantium, the real mediaeval Roman Empire, and the Eastern Orthodox Church.  He is in good company there: there was even a successful book called \\"How the Irish Saved Civilization\\"--as if Byzantium (not to mention the Arabs) never existed.<br />Enough of the sloppiness.  Let's move on to improbability and contrivance.  Would a real conspirator use a hulking albino monk as the assassin?  Why not have him carry a 10-foot sign \\"I am a killer\\", or have it tatooed on his forehead?  And how does the hulking albino monk end up from a French port, where he kills someone, to a prison in Andorra, a tiny landlocked principality in the Pyrenees?  The way the conspiracy works is ingenious but contrived and unsatisfying.  The Louvre curator and his granddaughter use English in their elaborate riddles for the convenience of the English-speaking readers, and the reasons given are contrived.  This is just a small sampling of many things that strain credibility.<br />Character development is not a strong suit of the author by any means.  All characters are one-dimensional, simply means to the end of carrying the plot forward, or sounding boards for the outpourings of symbology, dubious history, etc.  Some, such as the Capitaine of the Judicial Police or Sir Leigh are out-and-out caricatures.<br />Finally, there is enough mystical and secret society claptrap here to choke a horse.<br />Maybe I expected too much.  Even Umberto Eco (\\"The Name of the Rose\\", \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\"), who ploughed very similar ground wonderfully well, does not succeed on every level.  And Dan Brown is no Umberto Eco.<br />So, why did I give this book three stars?  Because it is a cracking good yarn, entertaining, a real page-turner; and because it contains lots of provocative explanations about the use of symbols, the presumed suppression of the \\"sacred fiminine\\" by the early Christian church, the origins of Christian misogyny, the nature of the Bible, and the uneasy but interesting relationship between Christianity and paganism.  A nicely written adventure story that makes one think is worth the price.  If it could also be meticulously researched and edited, with effortless erudition, flawless prose and excellent character development, it would be a truly fine thing.  That's why I like Patrick O'Brian.

0688170528|5.0|\\"The Pact\\" was an astonishing novel of two soul mates, Chris and Emily.  They knew each other since the day they were born and grew up to love one another more than anything in the world.  Unfortunately, Emily discovered she was pregnant and couldn't face becoming a dissapointment to the rest of the world.  Her only way out was suicide, and because Chris would do anything to make her happy, he helped her kill herself.  This book was one of the best I have ever read; it was impossible to put down.  Every customer seems to love the twisted psychological tale, and important lessons can be learned about the consequences of actions and about living life to its fullest.  \\"The Pact\\" recieves my highest praise.
0385504209|1.0|The writing was sophomoric and simple. If you know anything about Art History, you'll be bored at this simplistic re-hashing of half baked theories. The story line is overwhelmed by the incessant background information, and the real places and activities in those places used in the book are described incorrectly.
0689859368|3.0|I am a sucker for a nicely bound, handsomely illustrated book.  So much so that I will probably buy the rest of the series despite the author's abbreviated attention to some weighty subject matter.<br />    The chief problem is the brevity of the book; a slim seven chapters and hundred-odd pages.  Holly Black's attempt to introduce the characters, build a bit of mystery, sympathetically handle one child's pretty severe abandonment issues, and reach some pinnacle of suspense to keep the reader coming back all fall short for lack of space.  I feel very much like I have just read an outline for a very interesting novel.<br />    However, I read this with my daughter (age nine) who paid much closer attention for this than with most books.  I credit DiTerlizzi's excellent illustrations that kept her looking over my shoulder the entire time.  The weakest of these drawings are equal to the best of Brett Helquist's in Lemony Snicket's Unfortunate Events.  I mean that to be extremely high praise, as I greatly admire Helquist's abilities, as well.  It is, primarily, her interest that will convince me to buy the next in the series.<br />    My hope is that, with introductions out of the way, book two will cover more ground, build suspense, and magically make my buyer's remorse vanish completely.
B0000027DJ|5.0|Alice Cooper finished the 80's with his smash album \\"Trash\\" and then continued his dominant invasion into the 90's with another masterpiece, \\"Hey Stoopid\\". This album is the next step up from 1989's \\"Trash\\". The album is a 5-STAR MASTERPIECE! It has great lyrics, outstanding guitar riffs, and excellent rhythms. Alice Cooper has done it again. Every album Alice makes just keeps getting better and better. This album proves it!<br />The opening title track, \\"Hey Stoopid\\" starts out with a cool whip sound in the background and then \\"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey Stoopid.\\" Then the guitar kicks in and then the drums. The opening lyrics go like, \\"Hey bro, take it slow. You ain't livin' in a video. You're flying low with a high velocity. No doubt, you're stressin' out. That ain't what rock n' roll's about. Get off that one way trip down lonely street.\\" Then the next track, \\"Love's A Loaded Gun\\" is a catchy semi-anthem. It has a smooth guitar riff and a good catchy chorus line such as, \\"One down, one to go. Just another bullet in the chamber. Sometimes love's a loaded gun. Red lights, stop and go. Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger. Sometimes love's a loaded gun. And it shoots to kill.\\"<br />Another good ballad of Alice's is \\"Burning Our Bed\\" which is a tragic song about a girl that took advantage of her man and walked out on him. The chorus line goes like, \\"Baby, I might lose my mind. Maybe I might lose my head. One thing I'll never do, is swallow my pride comin back to you. Baby, I'm burning our bed.\\" It's a good semi-slow tune with a passionate tone in Alice's voice. One of Alice's all-time greatest ballads that came out of this album was \\"Might As Well Be On Mars.\\" This song is a MASTERPIECE and is VERY POWERFUL! It is nearly 7 minutes long and is definately a classic Alice ballad. The song is about unconditional love and it shows a sensitive side of Alice that we usually don't see too often. Such power lyrics went into this song such as, \\"You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place. Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'. I'd cross the universe to be right where you are. But I'm right in your backyard. And I might as well be on Mars.\\"<br />The next track, the evil \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\" is pure Alice Cooper: THE DEVIL! It starts out with the dialogue, \\"I know you're hungry. Ah! And here comes dinner.\\" Then \\"FEED MY FRANKENSTEIN!\\" Then the drums bang and the guitar kicks in. Then Alice starts singing in a demon voice like Frankenstein. \\"Well, I ain't evil, I'm just good lookin'. Start a little fire, and baby start cookin'. I'm a hungry man. But I don't want pizza. I'll blow down your house. And then I'm gonna eat ya.\\" It also has a killer guitar solo that makes the song even better. It's definately another Alice classic. Now, here is another classic Alice ballad, \\"Die For You\\". The song is very loving and a great song for a couple. It's about a man that is seriously in love with a woman that he'd die for. The chorus line goes like, \\"Baby, I could have been someone. I could have been something. It would have been nothing to die for you. Baby, you're going to need me. You'd better believe me. It would have been easy to die for you.\\" It's another Alice MASTERPIECE!<br />This album, \\"Hey Stoopid\\" is one Alice Cooper's greatest albums of all time. He did an outstanding job on the lyrics along with Desmond Child who helped him write, \\"Dangerous Tonight\\" and \\"Might As Well Be On Mars.\\" The album without a doubt deserves a 5-STAR rating. It's a must buy album. If you're an Alice Cooper fan, this SHOULD be your next choice.o a dark and lonely place. Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'.

B00008PW3Q|3.0|I just gave this album my first complete listen and the first thing I noticed is the lack of &quot;real&quot; drum playing.  Most of what I heard could have been programmed on a drum machine.  One of the standouts from &quot;The Dance&quot; was Mick's drumming - a wonderful return to his 70's form and sound.<br />Drumming aside, there are some good tracks here and I'm sure repeated listening will have them grow on me more.  I'll agree with other reviewers that this should have been pared down to 10 to 12 songs.  Overbloated CD's seem to be quite common these days.<br />Actually, it's more like 3 1/2 stars.  A little editing and some real drums would make it 4 1/2.
B00006RCNW|2.0|Low budget oater that has a weary familiarity. Various conspiracies and plot twists seem contrived for the purposes of making a punchy and fast moving show rather than one that is entirely credible. Would mackey really have got away with beating that pervert over the head with a telephone directory? America is the home of the lawsuit. Chiklis is no Dennis Franz either. He can't carry the show. The boss can't cut it either. The black detective gives the best performance. Couldn't help but smile, though, at that bit when the crook Mackey is chasing jumps over wooden door in an alley and Mackey crashes straight through it like a bull and collars him.
B00005JLRT|4.0|Die hard Trekers will pick this one to death, but for the casual and steady viewers of Star Trek, this tenth entry of the movie franchise is a pretty good way to kill two hours. The TNG Enterprise 7 return by coming together for the wedding of Commander Will Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi. On route to Betazed for the rest of the nuptuals, the Enterprise is diverted (so what else is new) to the Romulan Neutral Zone to meet with the new Praetor, Shinzon. Turns out that Shinzon is Picard's clone and was supposed to replace Piccard as captain of the Enterprise as a Romulan spy. Before the project really got off the ground, the Romulan government pulled the funding from the project (been there, done that) and exiled the young Shinzon to Remus, the twin world to Romulus. There he was abused in the dilithium mines and vowed to get revenge on both Romulus and Earth. The special effects are spectacular, the acting is typical Trek. As for this being the lowest grossing Trek in franchise history, I blame the geeks that started posting the poison in chat rooms ten minutes after seeing the flick. True, there were some points that could have been scripted better, such as why didn't the fleet come looking for the Enterprise when they didn't pass through the ion cluster in a reasonable amount of time, but I enjoyed this one better than the last, Insurrection.
B000000Y27|5.0|This CD has already got 17 reviews,,so here comes number 18.<br />The recording is already 43 years old and still Wes playing is as fresh as it was then. A few things comes to mind when listen...Wes used to call that a player had  a good definition if his phrasing was clear and had a good timing and that is by all means true about Wes himself...it is also amazing to listen to his lines knowing that he was basically a &quot;3 finger&quot; player and when ytu saw him playing it seemed that he would be restricted by this..but not so.<br />Wes also had a tremedous command of the bebop language..he must a have been one of the very first guitarists that really applied the Charlie Parker language to the guitar,<br />On this recording several of the legendary tunes written by Wes appear..like &quot;Westcoast Blues&quot; Full House&quot; and the funky &quot;D natural Blues&quot; &quot;Mr Walker..which Ronny Jordan by the way made a nice version of.... and then there is a beautiful version of the standard &quot;Gone with the wind&quot;<br />We are a lot of jazzguitarplayers that owes a lot to Wes...some of the very best players out of the Montgomery tradition.in my opinion is in particular JIMMY PONDER but also PETE BERNSTEIN and ROYCE CAMPBELL.Ponder is the one that is  the closest to Wes . only using his thumb like Wes.

B00005JL3A|5.0|I have seen every movie that came out based on games from Nintendio, Playstation, etc....None met my expectations...Mortal Kombat did...to an extent (it had a lot of work and stuff they missed). Resident Evil happens to be the ONE movie like this that did not disappoint me. <br />Packed with terror, gore, and action...Resident Evil brings the game to life on the screen. Every actor in this movie was great. Every creature was amazing. Every piece of music (composed by Marilyn Manson) fit the scenes. <br />This movie is one of my top recommended movies of all time. If you love Horror or if you loved the game check it out. It is SO worth it.<br />CAN'T WAIT FOR 2!

0385507755|2.0|I picked this book up because of all the hype it's received since release. As an individual acquainted with alcohol recovery, I'm interested in learning from the struggles others. The best memoirs on addiction and recovery (I think of Caroline Knapp's \\"Drinking a Love Story\\" and  Pete Hamill's \\"The Drinking Life\\") inspire the reader not only with tales of the courage involved in the addict's determination to embrace sobriety, but with the insight he/she gains in the process. Frey's book offers none of the kind of reflection involved in coming to terms with the cunning, baffling, and powerful nature of alcohol and drug addiction.  <BR>Further, his writing style, which has garnered so much attention, is little more than a kind of pared down prose with repetitive interjections meant to heighten whatever feelings he is having at the time. As a stylistic device it works on occasion, but, for the most part, comes off as an extended whine. <BR>Finally, Frey's book is marketed as a memoir. As a reader I want to believe that I'm hearing a true account of his life, but certain incidents in the book make that impossible. His account of molestation by a priest is not only tough to buy; it strikes the reader as an attempt to capitalize on the current scandal in the Catholic Church. Having worked with sex criminals I can confidently say that not even the most blatant sex offender would attempt to violate a total stranger in the way this priest does, especially one who is decidedly more powerful and hopped up on drugs.<BR>This raises a critical issue with regard to the current interest personal memoir; to what degree is the author responsible to write what really happened when dealing with his/her personal story? <BR>In Frey's book this question asserts itself prominently as it becomes apparent that the line between truth and fiction is as fuzzy as a teenager's sense of direction after a fifth of JD

B000089RVX|5.0|I was given a copy of Evanescence's demo CD 'Origin' by Amy Lee's father one afternoon. Having been in radio as a Music Director and lived in California and seeing that everyone had a demo in thier backpack or a screenplay in thier trunk, I accepted the demo with only curiosity to see how they sounded. I was not expecting the outcome that followed. A good CD moves you with emotion while a great CD controls your emotion and leaves you helpless. 'Origin' is good but 'Fallen' is great. Mark my words. 'Fallen' will go Double Platinum if not higher. It moves your inner soul as only a great CD can. <br />I have read many reviews about Evanescence and how they are alot like Linkin Park and other bands of that genre. Evanescence has one thing that they don't have, Amy Lee. I am certain that there are other female singers that have her range but do they have her ability? Her ability to control the emotions of others by her voice is a quality that very few male singers and, until now, no female singers at all have. <br />But we all know that a great voice is nothing without the backup of a band. Most bands of today have a somewhat limited ability. They can mask errors and create a feeling of acceptance through riffs, licks, bass lines and stage presence. Ben Moody and David Hodges are very gifted and anyone who talks of their inability to perform, hasn't a clue of how a band works. We all must crawl before we walk. All bands find thier niche at some point. Evanescence started crawling at birth. They are running while others are just learing to crawl.<br />'Fallen' will tap your inner emotions and allow you to express them as you have never been able to before. It is my CD of choice when I am writing.  <br />Evanescence is a meld between Enya and Type O' Negative with a blood spatter of Metallica. They are angelic and dark and at the same time being pure and open. They will set the stage for others to follow. <br />God bless Evanescence, Amy Lee and her family.<br />Warmest regards,<br />Mark Herrington
B00006JDVV|4.0|WOW...all I have to say is wow. This movie met my expectations. Great graphics, cool storyline, awesome acting...only one reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars...NEEDED MORE DRAGON ACTION. Other than that....Reign of Fire is an awesome twist to what our future could hold if these monsters were real. What do we do? LOOK TO THE SKY! What if the sky held these creatures...and they stalked us? Hunted us? ... what if our destruction and the destruction of life around us provided them with what they needed to survive? <br />This movie raises great questions...plus for any STAR WARS FANS it has a cool joke in there that is a MUST see.
B00000JGHM|2.0|De Niro and Pacino on screen together for the first time. It should be cinema magic. Unfortunately even what is quite possibly the biggest name cast of the nineties can't save this movie from being way overlong and having a script, written by director Michael Mann, that can only be described as appalling.<br />I mean the characters and dialog in this thing are grist for the mill in TV's \\"Law and Order\\" and its ilk. Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, a cop \\"on the edge\\". He actually says that he's \\"on the edge\\". Unbelievable. Frankly his character is overplayed and annoying, he spends a lot of the time smugly admiring his offscreen criminal opponents, sharing a sneaky admiration that his fellow cops aren't edgy enough to appreciate. Thats when we're not forced to endure his cardboard cutout crumbling marriage. Oh dear.<br />De Niro is excellent, and his role is certainly the most unique and interesting. The much talked about scene where De Niro and Pacino meet in a cafe is also a unique and atypically well written twist, but these moments cannot save this movie from being dragged down in tedium and mediocrity well before it comes to its predictable shoot-out conclusion.<br />What a waste of some of the best acting talent around today.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I am still really loving this supersonic female music trend that started with the Kidneytheives, continued with Evanescence and now with TaTu. I was really expecting some corny lesbian pop but here I found some really soul baring stuff. I really loved All the Things She said, Stars, and How Soon is Now. I really hated  Malchik Gay, too freakin's chirpy. I actually see them having some longevity. So four stars...
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is amazing.  I saw them as the opening to Matchbox 20, they are incredibly talented, and Adam Levine has such a sexy voice.  Harder to Breathe and Sunday Morning are great, and This Love is my favorite, I can't help dancing when it comes on! What makes them great is that they're are original and have a fresh funky sound, which is a relief from the homogenized music teens get these days.  Buy the CD and tell your friends!
B000000H5K|3.0|Chaos A.D. was the most brilliant metal album of the 90's. Now, Roots has some excellent material, especially the opener &quot;Roots Bloody Roots&quot;, which would have stood out even on Chaos A.D. But half the album is just numbing nu-metal riffery. There are some deliciously menacing tracks besides the aforementioned opening tracks, not least &quot;Ratamahatta&quot;, but for my taste there's just too much KORN here.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Did I unjustly help ring the death knell of the ST:TNG movie franchise?<br />So, I need to admit... I passed on seeing ST: Nemesis in the theatres... and I'm not quite sure why. I don't think it was because there were a myriad of competing movies out at the same time... I don't think it was because I didn't have any interest in seeing another Trek movie... I think it was because of 3 reasons.<br />1. Minor reason. OK, I was a ST:TNG fan. I will admit. I loved each character. I enjoyed the original series with Kirk at al, but, lets face it... it was campy. I never got into Voyager, Deep Star 9 or whatever, and now, at 28, I'm just too busy to really invest time into watching an hour long drama every week on a regular basis (ala Enterprise). But I digress... yes, I always loved TNG. And, well... before the movie came out, there were rumors that they were going to kill off a main character. Well, I just didn't want to see that happen.<br />2. Major reason. The marketing for this movie was AWFUL. If I recall, the trailors focused more on the \\"dune buggy on a bleak sun-bleached desert planet\\" scene, eliciting memories of some of the more awful contributions to the Star Trek film legacy (namely Star Trek:5, and Star Trek: Insurrection). I'm sorry, but when I think \\"Star Trek Movie\\", I don't want a lot of planet-side action... I want epic starship battles. I want explosions, and hull breaches, and torpedos, and monumental clashes. <br />3. On top of it, there simply was ZERO buzz about this movie. Paramount spent, what, $2.73 on promoting this movie? If any Star Trek film killed the movie franchise, it wasn't \\"Nemesis\\", but the previous installment, \\"Insurrection\\".  Movie sequels and franchizes need to feed of the buzz and hype off the one before it, and let's face it folks, \\"Insurrection\\" was an awful movie, and \\"Nemesis\\" paid the price for it.<br />So, why am I writing this?<br />I just rented \\"Nemesis\\", and, well... dare I say, it's one of the three best movies in the series!!!! (behind The Wrath of Khan, and First Contact).<br />I was totally engrossed in the story line! The dune buggy scene WAS actually hokey, but was only a minor little side-bar, the villain was menacing yet complex, and I even felt some sympathy for the character. The special F/X were really good, the directing was competent, the mood was dark (Star Trek with a David Fincheresque twist!), the visuals were stunning, the interplay of the characters with the emphasis of \\"family\\" was indeed touching, the ending sacrifice actually worked, and the ending space battle between the Enterprise and some of the Romulan/Reman ships were some of the best captured on film for the entire franchise... be in a movie or a television show. It was EVERYTHING I could possibly want in a Trek movie...<br />THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE STAR TREK FRANCHISE!  <br />So, I am sorry I didn't go see this movie in the theatre. I'm sorry that this great movie did not do so well in the theatres, and I'm sorry that because of it, there may never be another Star Trek:TNG movie again. And for that, I'm rather sad.<br />So, if you are a Star Trek fan that stayed away like I did, or a sci-fi fan in general... buy the DVD. Support the franchise. Maybe we can now make up the poor box-office receipts and potentially secure another Next Generation film somewhere down the line.
0553382179|5.0|This is the best self-help book on caring for your home that I have ever read!  The book is fast-paced, easy to read, and totally motivating!  Marla Cilley's warmth, encouragement, common sense and kindness, combined with excellent practical advice, make for a truly wonderful and unique book. And it's fun to read the testimonials and realize you're not alone. I've had this book only a week and it has helped me more than I can say.  (The 27-fling boogies are especially fun!) I recommend this book to anyone who, like me, has a problem with organization.
0385495323|4.0|I would give this book an 8.5 . This book is very interesting, taking you through the history of code making and breaking in an unparrellelled manner. Even though the author has some strange ideas about some things, I think this book is one of the best I have seen for an introduction to cryptography.
B00006L9ZT|4.0|TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY Der Ring des Nibelungen, and which one to buy: Met or Bayreuth? Der Ring des Nibelungen is arguably the greatest work of art ever created by a single individual. If you know about and love music enough to be reading this, then you have no choice but to buy one. Like other reviewers, I recommend the Met version to start, because it is most faithful to Wagner's stage directions, so you get a better idea about the work's original conceptualization. However, I would expect that you would want to follow up later with the purchase of the Bayreuth Ch&eacute;reau Ring :o) I own and have listened to both many times.<br /><br />Overall, the Met Ring is very satisfying. The first two acts of Die Walk&uuml;re were the least effective of the entire set of four operas, in my opinion. Despite some great singing, I just did not feel the chemistry that must occur between Siegmund and Sieglinde. For me, these two acts in the Ch&eacute;reau production (including Gwyneth Jones' Br&uuml;nhilde) are worth the price of the entire Bayreuth set. However, the poignant and powerful third act farewell scene between Wotan and Br&uuml;nhilde in the Met production more than makes up for the first two acts. Also notably powerful in the Met performance (besides Matti Salminen's astounding Hagen) was the scene of the swearing of the oath on the spear by Br&uuml;nhilde and Siegfried in G&ouml;tterdamerung, which Behrens -- as a relatively light and clear voiced Br&uuml;nhilde -- sings with great dramatic intensity.<br /><br />To those of you who are uncertain if you want to invest the time, money, and emotional energy in exploring this work through the available DVDs, I agree with many of the harshest critical reviews, at a technical level. However, DO NOT let any reported shortcomings of either set stop you from purchasing one or the other! The tone of most of these criticisms suggests that they come from people who are passionate about the Ring, but for whom the reality of theperformances captured on DVD simply does not measure up to the Ring they have idealized.<br /><br />The point is this fellow Music Lover: the Ring is worth learning about and experiencing. But guess what? There will NEVER be a flawless live performance of a complete cycle. What's more, people will never completely agree on the impact and quality of any given element of any given performance. Both the Met and Bayreuth sets have strengths that overwhelm and weaknesses that you can overlook: overlook because flawed performances, however objectively or subjectively perceived and evaluated, are simply all that can be expected from flawed human beings striving toward an ideal. \\"True Wagnerites\\" :) should appreciate this point as one the Ring itself makes overwhelmingly.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Met Ring is my recommendation for starters. However, if you are new to Wagner, before laying down your money, here is a way to ease into the Ring that lets you bail out if it is just not your cup of tea:<br /><br />-- FIRST read the Thomas & Kane or Russell et al. comic book version to understand the basic story.<br /><br />-- SECOND, listen to the Met Opera CD set of four lectures, \\"Talking About the Ring,\\" to understand how the story is represented musically.<br /><br />-- FINALLY, read Bryan Magee's, \\"The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy,\\" to understand why the story is what it is, and something about why it has such power to move us.<br /><br />After experiencing the Met Ring, get the Bayreuth Ch&eacute;reau Ring, if for no other reason, but to glory in the stunningly memorable and moving performances of the great Jeannine Altmeyer and Peter Hoffman as Sieglinde and Siegmund in Walk&uuml;re!
B000007489|5.0|I still can't figure out just why Suicidal Tendecies had to switch rfom hardcore punk into speed/trash metal, because this album is a brilliant collection of brilliant hardcore songs. of course, there are classics such as \\"Institutionalized\\" , \\"i Shot The Devil\\" or \\"Possessed\\", but tracks like \\"Subliminal\\", \\"Two-Sided Politics\\" and \\"I Want More\\" are equally impressive. Not only is this the finets SD album, but also highly recommended for any hardcore punk fans out there.
0805062971|5.0|I wish I knew more about the philosophy and beliefs that surrounded the basis of this book, because I thought, though they were somewhat insane and disturbing, that they were fascinating. The surreal storyline and characters drive the quick read forth to make it exponentially more powerful, leading to an amazing climax.<BR>The book is certainly better than the movie, and in the case of this film, that is saying a lot. <BR>If you're looking for something to read on a plane or in an afternoon or something, pick this up.
B000069HK2|5.0|A cd like this doesn't come out everyday, or even every year for that matter.  When I first listened to this cd, I decided that it was EASILY a 5/5 stars.  When i listened to the cd more, I was angry.  Why?  Because you can only give a cd up to 5 stars.  I feel that I am lying to you when I give this only 5 stars, because it deserves so much higher than that.  After seeing them live, and seeing for myself how much emotion Bert (the lead singer) has, I once again wished for a higher rating.  If you like rock, or even if you don't, buy this cd, because no matter what, you'll love this cd.  Some of you may be saying, &quot;Well, if their so good, why aren't they number 1 on the charts?&quot;  As Steve Buscemi said in the movie Airheads, &quot;Because you never play it, babe.&quot;  (this was said to the executive of a radio station)  You may have never heard any of their songs, or just a couple like the OUTSTANDING Box Full of Sharp Objects, Buried Myself Alive, or The Taste of Ink.  Whether you have or have not heard these songs, buy the cd now.  It's worth every penny and more.
B0000797IO|2.0|I can see that others raved about this movie, but I found it hard to sit through.  I am not criticizing the performances, but my question is: what is the point of this movie?  Whose fault IS it that Justine's life is so dull?  I can't see how it's anybody's fault but hers.  I kept wanting her to DO something: go to school, take classes, become a carpenter, a chef, a real estate agent, a gardener, an artist, ANYTHING.  She seems just empty.  She's bored with her husband because he smokes pot and watches inane TV, but she isn't any better.  Hard to feel sympathetic.  And the movie was just as boring. At one point I thought it would turn into a real black comedy, but it retreated to just dull.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This is the greatest live album ever recorded, by a mile. No matter how brilliant moments of magic albums such as The Who's Live At Leeds include, this is the one live album you should own. Of course, Johnny Cash himself is larger than life, but it is the electricity, the emotion and the interaction between the performer and the unique audience that makes this album so huge. If this was the only album you owned, you'd still have a mighty record collection.
0446310786|5.0|I don't want to restate the other reviews, because they really got the points down pat.<BR>all i want to say is that there is a reason this book is a classic. theres a reason this book is taught in English classes nationwide. There is a reason this book will be remembered.<br />Highly recommended, if you haven't for some reason already read it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Jimmy Page has a point to make, and he does it like no one ever has before. There was always a gap between the early baby boomers, and the latter,(ones born between '55 and '64).The younger ones knew how huge Zeppelin was, and deservedly so. The older one never seemed to accept the heavy metal non-sixties sound. By releasing this incredible account of the biggest selling band of the seventies, Led Zeppelin is about to become a household name to people who never gave them a second thought. This is SOOO obviously the best rock DVD ever made, and it cost me under 20 bucks, including tax. How many millions will sell? 5 hours of truly live Zep, much, much better that the Song Remains the Same. There are too many gems to recount. It impossible to overestimate the overall impact of this DVD. Jimmy's point is simple. He sold the most records in the seveenties with no help from the media. Now with technology on his side, a ridiculous low price, and 5 hours of pure quality, he just may sell more DVD's than anyone in history.

B000069AUI|5.0|On &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; Coldplay takes their previous sound and adds some edge to it, creating a sound that is at the same time lush and abrasive.  The orchestration and arrangements on this album are absolutely amazing, each note enhancing the vivid landscape of the music.  Cutting through the amazing background is Chris Martin's soothing and versatile voice, one of the best in rock music today.  The lyrics may not be very deep, but that is more than made up for in their bare emotion.  On &quot;Parachutes&quot;, Coldplay's sound as well as lyrics were at times too mellow for their own good resulting in some cringe-worthy moments.  There are NONE of these on this CD.  Every song is a near masterpiece, and some, like The Scientist, Warning Sign, Politik, the title track and Amsterdam ARE masterpieces.  That's almost half of the album.  The rest of the songs are at the same high level of quality, creating a CD in which a band finds their voice.  And that voice is amazing.  Buy it, no second thoughts.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi certainly takes its time to get going (the boat doesn't sink for 97 pages, I think... or was it 96?). But once it does, then the real meat of the story begins. Pi's spiritually and physically adverse journey made my jaw drop in awe and wonder, quite literally at points.<BR>Towards the end, you are left wondering whether it was a dream, hallucination, reality, or a truly spiritual encounter/experience (those who have finished the book will know what I'm talking about).<br />Granted, the book is slow and took me some time to get through, but I highly recommend it.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I will start off first by saying that if you do not like comic books or never knew a lot about X-men in the first place....you probably won't like this movie. If you are a follower, then this movie is great. Once again, Wolverine makes this movie go and I'm glad most of the focus has been on him in the first two movies. His attitude and aggressiveness is frickin' awesome. He did however meet a mutant that was pretty much his equal.....almost. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. I will also say that the plot is pretty simplistic: Brian Cox plays a military officer by the name of William Striker bent on killing all of the mutants while Magnito and Xavier try to stop him...there's a lot of fighting and explosions throughout. Turns out that Striker and Wolverine have a past. I won't give too much of the movie away, so that's all I am going to reveal. My favorite characters are still Storm-because of Halle Berry of course, Wolverine, and Mystique...For once, Magnito and Mystique help the X-Men in their quest against Striker. All of the new characters just added to the experience and they were not overdone. Thank God. The Night Crawler was a little weird, but there wasn't too much emphasis placed on him which was a good thing. As I said before, most of the emphasis is placed on the original characters, while working the younger characters in slowly. Overall, I rate the experience an A. I would have rated it an A+, but the plot was a little weak. Who watches X-Men because of the plot anyway. You watch it because you love it and it's cool! If you love X-Men, this movie will not disappoint. If you're looking for some intellectual piece with an intricate plot, then look elsewhere. X-Men is cool and the action is awesome, and the special effects were well done. This is a sequel that was nicely done. I feel that it's better than the first after watching the first right after seeing X-Men 2. There's more characters, more action and in this case more is good. Watch and Enjoy!

B000089RVX|5.0|This album is just excelent, many do not like it because they think this has something to do w/Linkin Park, or that they tried to copy their style. Not at all. This album is just excelent and worth hearing every track.
0380973650|5.0|Wow. I mean seriously, Wow. Being a big fan of mythology of all sorts, this book truly took to me quite well. The main character is somewhat dry, but I think that complements the rest of the colorful characters very nicely.<br />The dialogue is amusing, the story is fantastic in every sense of the word, and it is quite thrilling. I couldn't stop reading it. It helps to know a bit of Norse Mythology when going into the book, because you can see the mythos paralells ahead of time. Before reading the book, you should at least familiarize yourself with some of the names and roles of some of the Norse gods so you aren't lost in the last 100 or so pages.<br />A great read. Highly recommended.
0380729407|4.0|This book was suggested for me to read by a friend of mine.  She knew the wicked books that I have read very recently.  At first, I did not want to read it, but after I read the cover of the book I was hooked.  The opening pages were very interesting, I was going into the book not knowing what to expect and I was very shocked.  The scene I most thoroughly enjoyed was the carousel.  Most people would think that it is a very wicked part but I really enjoyed it.  Most of the book was very disturbing and that they did not know what they had gotten themselves into.  I really enjoyed the book.
0671027387|5.0|\\"Deception Point\\" opens in Washington, DC, during a tight Presidential campaign. The incumbent, a man of strong principles, is a major NASA supporter. His opponent, who is basing his campaign on turning NASA into a private, non-governmental agency, thus saving the US taxpayer billions of dollars annually, is way up in the polls. He is also accepting enormous illegal campaign contributions from private aerospace companies who have billions to gain from the privatization of NASA. After many failures & much spending, NASA is badly in need of a success.<br />Then a NASA satellite detects a large, high-density rock buried 200 feet below the Milne Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island, high in the Arctic Circle. NASA scientists determine the rock to be a meteor containing fossils proving that life exists elsewhere in the universe.<br />To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House sends a team of independent experts to the NASA habisphere, built over the meteor in the Arctic Circle. One of these experts is the intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton, the daughter of Senator Sedgewick Sexton. Senator Sexton is the man running for election against the President of the United States. The plot thickens.<br />Rachel, while in the Arctic, uncovers what could be scientific trickery - an incredible deception that could cause political and scientific upheaval and cost the President his bid for re-election. When she & her colleagues attempt to investigate further, they are plunged into life threatening danger. To escape assassination they flee for their lives. Their only hope for survival is to discover who is behind this extraordinary plot and expose the truth.<br />Dan Brown has proven to be one of the top writers in the suspense-thriller genre. The originality of his plots, his amazingly accurate research, and his ability to catch the reader's interest from the get-go and hold it until the last word in the last sentence of the last page, make him an exceptional author. Plus, after completing each of Dan Brown's books, the reader usually comes away from the experience having learned much more than a storyline. I loved \\"Deception Point\\" - couldn't put it down.

The movie has some dull parts yes, but these are not only outshined, but blown out of the stratosphere by action scenes.  The action sequences in this movie really wore out my rewind button on my DVD remote, because I had to know HOW THE HELL DID HE DO THAT?  Absolutely incredible, sets a new standard for action.  <br />Fun movie, most definetly.  Not for the squemish in some parts. (hey did he just break someones leg and snap their arm in half?  Why, yes he did!).  But definetly worth it.
0679721037|4.0|This book is powerfully objective. The facts and the details, the hardships that the six main characters go through make you question President Truman's morals and true consideration in his execution of the operation that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.<br />The novel loses some steam in the last twenty pages or so, but I still highly recommend it if you don't have to read it for school.
B0000931QA|5.0|Too bad this group out performed themselves with this CD.  It is their best, period. Unfortunetly it was also at the beginning of their career. Although &quot;Empire&quot; has the hit singles from which most people will recognize their sound, as an entire CD none of their others even comes close.  I bought Empire, Q2K, Promised Land, and Operation Livecrime based on the greatness of &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot;. I believe if Operation Mindcrime is the first CD you pick up by this band then any other albums will fall well short of O.M. In short , if you want to pick up any one CD by this band, this is the CD to pick.
B00006L7MV|5.0|If you have not entered the world of multi-channel music, hold on!  This is one of the best 5.1 mixes available (DVD-A or SACD) and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  While not a big fan of Linkin Park, I have to say that the &quot;shock value&quot; of this mix is well worth the price of admission.  Make sure your surround speakers are capable of producing a full range of frequencies because they will certainly get a workout.  Go buy it now.  No, I mean it.  Go!
0792841344|5.0|Of note to all \\"Phantasm\\" fans out there who, like me, were impressed, inspired and even influenced by Bill Thornbury's unforgettable ditty \\"Sittin' Here At Midnight\\"--a 1995 studio recording of this song is included in the supplementary material of a DVD already loaded with cool bonuses. Although different in tone and arrangement (no electric guitar strumming here or dual guitar jam, this is strictly acoustic) the original atmosphere of the song remains intact and Thornbury's beautiful vocals deliver a previously-unheard chorus guaranteed to stay in your head long after your first listen. If that's not enough to tickle the fancy of any die-hard \\"Phantasm\\" fanatics, the DVD also treats you to a two-part tv interview with director Don Coscarelli and \\"Tall Man\\" Angus Scrimm just after the film's release in 1979. This DVD is definitely a steal at such a low price.
0425188809|4.0|I don't understand why the rating on this book is so high... in my opinion (to each their own), the plot was, for lack of a better word, silly, and the dialogue was somewhat laughable at times. The reason that I give it a higher rating than 2 or so stars is the dog. He's just pretty cool. A dog that can communicate via scrabble pieces is pretty original and comes up with some cool plot devices. Theres actually a few good moments of suspense, as well.<BR>It just feels so B-Movie like to me.

B00005221M|5.0|Every decade has it's classic films. This is one of the best of the 90's. This epic film is well crafted, and Michael Mann spent much time to develope a classic. His direction is stunning, and the cinematogrophy is some of the best and most beautiful since the days of classic cinemascope. Daniel Day Lewis is a fine actor, and fits the part well. The DVD is superb, with great sound and a wonderul transfer. The 90's gave us some of the greatest films of all time, and this epic is one of them. Not always listed as a favorite of critics, and it did not make the AFI 100 Greatest Films list, but it deserved to be included. I would rank it as one of the top 100 films of all time.
B000088E6D|5.0|I first discovered Mr. Buble on the &quot;Down With Love&quot; soundtrack and quickly went on a journey to find all I can.  I was shocked to see someone so young and even more shocked to find out that this was his FIRST cd!<br />You'd never know it by listening to his music.  He takes these songs and handles them like he's sung them for YEARS.  He even breathes new life into Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, George Michael's &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot; and the Bee Gees' classic &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;(featuring backup vocals by Mr. Barry Gibb himself).  But it's the classics that stand out the most here.  &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;For Once In My Life&quot; all are WONDERFUL!<br />This is one album I'll be listening to for years to come and I look forward to the next cd!
0140288503|5.0|Seriously one of the fastest, most riveting reads I've ever experienced. The completely objective point of view helps make it more powerful as the reader jumps from troop to troop, keeping track of the different blockades and events that affect each and every single person in the operation. <br />People argue that it's too hard to keep track of all the characters, but I say that could be one of the points the author is trying to make, or it could be a point that is unintentionally made. Nevertheless, a great book.
0140177396|4.0|First off, I thought that the novel, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was a pretty good one. Usually I can't and don't really like reading novels but I did like this one. This book has been banned before in schools and I just think that that's ridiculous. Why ban this novel? I could understand the banning if this book had themes of sex, violence, etc. but it doesn't. All the banning does is hinder a children from reading a book that is commonly referred to as a legend.<br />I have researched on the internet as to why this book had been banned in schools across America and some of the reasons I found were because the book had parts with obscene language and violent scenes, such as the ending. <br />I suppose that these schools do not seem to realize that the book is more than just that. The story is about a friendship between two men named George and Lennie. Some might ask the question : \\"How can they be friends after George shoots Lennie in the end?\\" Well, to answer a popular question, George did it for Lennie. He peacefully killed Lennie before Curly and his men could get to him. He saved Lennie from the torture that undoubtedly would have occurred had they found him first.<br />Like I said before, I consider this book, as many others do, as a \\"legend\\". If schools want to ban the book because some of these \\"controversial themes\\" then the least they could do, is allow the children to read the book at an older age. They're just taking away one of the best books from them by having it banned.
0156027321|5.0|I haven't read a book as good as &quot;Life of Pi&quot; in quite a long time.  It easily ranks among &quot;One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest&quot; and &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; as one of my all-time favorite novels.  Yann Martel captures the language of storytelling that few authors achieve.
0380002930|5.0|Most books are short but sweet and you only think about them for the time that you read, but this is one of those books that make you sad or happy for a long long time.  This is a must see for anyone who wants an adventure.  Traveling with Hazel-rah and his friends will be so interesting, you'll keep reading until this last word.
0743424425|5.0|Personally, it is my favorite of King's works. The complexities of Jack and his son are so intertwined and far out there that I read the book twice to absorb it all. The writing is chilling, and the grotesque horror sequences kept me up late into the night.<BR>One of the few books that scared me, and that is truly saying something. Though the movie is great, I find that the book is certainly better. Don't you even dare watching the mini-series, because it is horrible (even though it's somewhat faithful to the book). <BR>A complex and scary read.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I must be getting old, I loved the slow ones and hated the fast songs! My favorites are: (1) Easy Ride, (2) Nothing Fails, (3) Intervention, (4)love profusion, and (5) x-tatic process. These songs are more folk than pop and make me feel relaxed once they are played. <BR>Unlike Music (2000), AL sounds like a cohesive body with a thin line connecting all the songs and not a compilation of styles. However, like Music, it uses the same formula but to generate an older and mature-er collection of songs (not as original as ROL though).<BR>Unfortunately, AL will be judged and crucified for all the wrong reasons: (1) AL the single (simply not a single material), (2) the rap in AL (not bad but what's the point!), (3) the video fiasco (I guess the Iraq issue was to hot to handle even for Madonna), (4) the CD jacket/sleeve (ugly), (5) the lyrics (well, the lyrics in mother and father and I'm so stupid is just hmmm, so stupid), and (6) the vocoder that ruins a couple of songs (nothing fails is inherently a nice song but destroyed, crushed, mutilated with the Cher-effect).<BR>So, to cut a long story short, buy it as I think most people over 25 will find at least five/six songs to enjoy.
B000002UB3|4.0|Listen to Because and tell me if there were ever three guys who sang better harmony. What a beautiful song.<BR>George shines on this album, contributing Something and Here Comes the Sun, probably his two best.<BR>Lennon was coasting/obsessing on Yoko. He has only one real song, Come Together, a rocker with a Walrus-like lyric. I Want You is a borderline experimental track from a suffering man.<BR>The medley is great but probably overrated in that they were unfinished songs. One thing that's overlooked with this album is that many of the songs -- the snippets at least -- were leftovers deemed unfinished or not good enough for the White Album. It's obvious that the Beatles' bag was nearly empty. It's like they picked up all the crumbs for a tapestry.<BR>Still, the album sounds great, very polished. Ringo is excellent throughout. Lots of Beatle harmonies.<BR>Bottom line: Great but not their best.
B000089RVX|4.0|Funny thing is when the word \\"Christian\\" is next to the artists name people shutter away and don't bother listening. Thus groups like this, POD, Stacie Orrico, Chevelle, etc are blowing up on MTV and Pop Culture everywhere because its sad but they had to lose the \\"Christian\\" label name and go secular. Then people are like oh they are good. Hey take a chance, just because someone proclaims Christ doesnt mean they [are bad] at music. There are a lot of great artists out there who dont get the proper credit bcause of this stereotype. I am proud of those who stick to the faith and make it in this world with music that doesnt have to cuss or talk about sex every two seconds. Good album and next look out for Pillar, they will be the next huge act gone from Christian to secular. Funny how God works things out for those who follow Him!
B000003C2U|5.0|Some may be turned off by the pounding double bass, detuned guitar riffs, and of course, the growling/screaming vocals, but I love every second of this album.  Chuck Shuldiner and Death have developed so much since the days of \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\".  While SBG had simple riffs and gross lyrics, this album features much more technical and progressive songwriting and excellent lyrics.  Mind you, it's still heavy as hell, and unbelievably fast.<br />Chuck Shuldiner was truly an outstanding guitarist.  The riffs he wrote for this album are amazingly melodic and precise, yet complicated and very fast.  His solos are fluent and melodic.  The musicians accompanying him were the best he had worked with up until this point.  Sean Reinert and Paul Masividal from Cynic joined on guitar and drums.  If you're familiar with Cynic, you should know they're amazing.  If you're not, you can trust me on that one.  Steve DiGiorgio is a bass god, who has worked with Sadus, Iced Earth and others.  He plays those incredibly fast riffs with his fingers.  Whoa!<br />Chuck's songwriting took a more progressive and technical turn here, but it's still very much a straight Death Metal sound.  \\"Flattening of Emotions\\" is about the best song ever, with it's incredibly fast double bass and awesome trade-offs between Chuck and Paul during the solo.  It's also filled with Chuck's powerful growl/yell, which has always made him my favorite death metal vocalist.  The album's fault, if it has one, is that it's not that diverse.  I don't mind though, when the material is this good.  \\"Suicide Machine\\", \\"Together As One\\" \\"See Through Dreams\\" and \\"Secret of Face\\" are all stand-outs as well, which feature excellent riffing and amazing guitar solos.  \\"Lack of Comprehension\\" is an awesome song too, with it's awesome jazzy opening.  \\"Cosmic Sea\\" is an instrumental with some extremely fluent soloing.  It's damn close to impossible to play those patterns as clean and fast as either Chuck or Paul plays them on thissong.<br />So, in short, this is more than another death metal album.  Aside from their first few albums, Death has always had a more unique and innovative sound than most other death metal bands.  In my opinion, Chuck also writes much more intelligent, thought out, and realistic lyrics.  The average person can relate to many of Chuck's later lyrics.  If you're interested in technical metal or death metal, you can't go wrong with this album.  Unless you're turned off by the things mentioned in the first sentence of this review.  I probably repeated myself a lot in this review, but oh well.  The album's just so damn good.  Also recommended:  Death - Symbolic, The Sound of Perserverance.
B00008D1NF|5.0|Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown are each great musicians in their own right, but the result when they collaborate together on this CD is nothing short of mindblowing.  This is by far one of the best CDs of 2003.  I haven't gone through the CD booklet in detail yet to get a rough translation of the lyrics, but you really don't need to understand what they're saying; the music is that infectious.  While the bossa beat emerges from time to time, this is above all an intelligent pop record along the lines of Gil & Caetano's \\"Tropicalia 2\\"...It's heavily influenced by mid period Beatles(Revolver/Rubber Soul) yet very contemporary. Stone cold classic.
B000002UAX|5.0|To quote John, &quot;I always preferred it to all the others, including Pepper.&quot;<BR>Pain produces the best art and this was clearly The Beatles' psycho-torture album. And what a walk through primal scream it was. Listen to John shout, &quot;I'm going insane&quot; on I'm so Tired.<BR>The reason this album is so great is its many different styles. You've got hard rock such as Helter Skelter, beautiful ballads such as Julia and I Will and the innovative Happiness is a Warm Gun, Piggies and Why Don't we do it In the Road.&quot;<BR>Forget the talk of cutting it to one disc.<BR>This is The Beatles finest hour.<BR>Say you wanna revolution?

0064471837|5.0|During my American Lit class, my teacher was ranting on about how stories were better when they were realistic, as fantasies were too predictable; I disagreed, but I had trouble thereafter of finding a good fantasy.  This broke his theory entirely, as it showed that the laws of magic follow a convincing set of rules of their own, and it made me want more action.  The ending was a tad melodramatic, but it showed greater realism than his so-called realism genre (they tended to end as a tragedy, whereas these ended bittersweet).
B000002UB6|4.0|Much has been made of Spector's work on this album. The real issue is the songs -- the songs that didn't make it.

Consider:<br />Side 1<BR>Get Back<BR>Two of Us<BR>Dig a Pony<BR>For you Blue<BR>Let it Be<BR>Across the Universe<br />Side 2<BR>Don't Let me Down<BR>Old Brown Shoe<BR>The Long and Winding Road<BR>I've Got a Feeling<BR>Ballad of John and Yoko<BR>Get Back (Reprise)<br />Apple should re-release Let it Be, stripped of the Spector smaltz.

Tyler shows our narrating friend a way to release his anger and frustration through what can be best described as &quot;therapeutic violence&quot;. The idea catches on, and before long they have teamed up to lead a Fight Club every Sunday in the basement of a bar. But it's not long before the narrator is completely desensitised to violence, and thus searches for something more dangerous - something more self-destructive.

B000002UAU|4.0|Half this album's allure, at the time and historically, stems from the cover. <br /> Many of the songs, Lovely Rita, Good Morning, Fixing a Hole, She's Leaving Home, are not that strong. The title song sounds like a [bad] version of Drive My Car.<br />Only Lucy in the Sky and Day in the Life are enduring classics. If they hadn't adorned the album with weird sounds and a fantastic cover, it might have been panned like Magical Mystery Tour, which in many ways is a stronger album.

0156027321|4.0|I found this book to be warm and delightful in the beginning, and thought provoking in the middle.  Martel writes beautifully and gives his characters so much life!  Pi is such a spiritual and spirited young man, you cannot help but love him.  I did find myself though, wondering what all the spiritualism was about in the beginning, for other than an occassional mention of prayer on the boat, he didn't use his spiritualism to guide him.  It was much more common sense that granted him the ability to survive.  The end of the book I thought went completely astray...  I was taken completely off guard and wondered where in the world this ending came from!  And what ever happend to the &quot;author&quot; -- the one who started out telling the story... it never got back to him!  It was a great read - but left me questioning in the end.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix, at its core is about realization/spiritual growth/ enlightenment, the plot, the action, the acting and the  specical effects are all secondary however, they do make for a good movie that appeals to a wide audience.
B000007T1M|5.0|Without a doubt, System of a Down's best. Every song is great.<BR>Here's a song-by-song breakdown:<BR>Suite-Pee: 8/10 Crazy opening song. Great intro, starts out fast and suddenly goes into this cool slow part, but picks up speed again. The lyrics are kinda strange, but overall great.<BR>Know: 7/10 Nice drum intro, really great guitar riffs too. The bridge is pretty cool and Serj sounds funny when he says &quot;Didja ever try to fly?&quot;<BR>Sugar: 9/10 One of the standouts, great basslines by Shavo and some crazy-fast verses by Serj. Nice guitar riff and swingy drum beat.<BR>Suggestions: 7/10 Its just a good song. Nothing special, except Serj sings really, really high pitched. I like the second verse a lot.<BR>Spiders: 8/10 Slower, slightly spooky. Great guitar riffs and solo by Daron.<BR>Ddevil: 9/10 Great, energetic, bouncy song. Its pretty short compared to the others, but its still one of the best on the album. Is that Serj doing that bird-call thing in the middle?<BR>Soil: 10/10 Best track, hands down. Nice riffs and drums in the beginning, fast singing by Serj, especially in the choruses. Oh yeah...and the awesome solo by daron. Great stuff.<BR>War: 8/10 Niiiiiice intro. The middle is kind of weird, but the chorus more than makes up for it. We will fight the heathens!<BR>Mind: 6/10 Definitely not one of my favorites. Its six minutes long and it goes through so many tempo changes, it just sounds like a big mess of stuff. The beginning is the coolest part.<BR>Peephole: 9/10 Another one of my favorites, its in 6/8 and has a spooky carnival type feel to it. Also another great solo. Daron just keeps crackin' em out.<BR>Cubert: 7/10 Its pretty weird, thats all I have to say. Some of the more strange sounding lyrics by Serj.<BR>Darts: 8/10 I like this one a lot...until half way through. In the first half, theres great riffs and cartoon-like singing by Serj. Then, it goes between slow and fast, and kinda sounds stupid, with Daron screaming in the background. Still good.<BR>P.L.U.C.K. 7/10 Haven't listened to this one too much. The chorus is definitely the best part, with Serj and Daron trading off the verses.<BR>Overall, great CD from a great group. Pick it up.
B00005JL96|4.0|While this is not a masterpiece, there are many things to like about this movie.  Here are some of them.<br />1. It features a great performance by Daveigh Chase.  (Incidently, she was the actress that played the creepy little girl in &quot;The Ring&quot;, and she also voiced the girl in &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.)<br />2. It has a simple and charming story, and there are some very funny moments, like the segment concerning San Francisco.<br />3. Comforting character and background designs.  As explained in the extra section of the DVD, the animators emphasized roundness in this animation.  The result is unusual but visually very comforting.<br />4. Beautiful Hula dance sequences.  Animation made this dance even more beautiful than live actions.
B0000931OG|5.0|One shouldn't put off 'Think Tank'after only a few listens as, with other Blur albums, it's not instantly likeable. The album takes time to grown on you and when it does, you'd appreciate the journey. I agree that the guitar department lack the creative flair of Coxon, but it's not that greatly missed. Coxon's presence would undoubtedly add an intrinsic  vulnerability, tenderness and restraint to the cocky Damon-fest overload that is Think Tank, but this is an extremely enjoyable ride, nevertheless. <br />I am great fan of their Life(MLIR, Parklife, TGE) trilogy and the series will always have a special place in my heart. However, I enjoy this album much, much more than 'Blur' or '13', a good sign since I've only  gotten the album for less than a month, and still on my journey of discovery.<br />The songs are varied in style, the oompah-pah-fun-fair chassis that defined the three Life albums is still evident (which is a Blur feature that i've always loved), exotic instruments adds interest, Damon's voice, which alternates between a sleepy resentful drawl and a that of a charming naughty boy's, entertains, all of which make for a great listen.<br />The highlights for me are :<BR>1. Ambulance : crazy casio loops punctuated with tender lyrical moments such as \\"I was born out of love, It's the only way to get into this world\\"<br />2. Out of Time : this is a great example of not trying to hard. A quitely-beautiful genious of simplicity, layered with a background of haunting morrocan orchestra. At first listen it sounded plain, but after awhile it was magic.<br />3. Good Song: A nice easy tune that conjures images of lazy, carefree days. It's a Good Song, really.<br />4. Caravan: Beautiful, I expected it to go into guitar overdrive and then remembered that Graham is not in the band anymore. Which,frankly, is not that bad a thing after all.<br />5. Gene by Gene: Extremely catchy, happy, jumpy, can't stop singing to this. Dan Abnormal on a pogo-stick!<br />The only major grouse I have is the inclusion of Crazy Beat which I believe is  the second single of the album. Not only does it reek of the ghost of Song2, it sounds just like Bugman, only more brainless having been stripped off Coxon's redeeming guitar riffs. But it seems that a lot of people love  this track so it might be that I'm getting old.<br />In my opinion, Think Tank doesn't alienate early Blur fans as much as their two previous album. This, to me, is FINALLY the proper continuation to The Great Escape.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Okay, so this is a nice addition to the Matrix canon, and does give us a lot of back story to the events that happen in the live action films.<br />The stories are mostly entertaining, though a couple are as gruesome and troubling as possible. If you are not the kind of person that enjoys bodies being mutilated and people being killed cruelly by robots, this might not be for you. Also, if you don't like the Matrix films, this is not for you. In fact, why are you even reading this? <br />The animation is great, the sound is excellent, and overall the dvd is worthwhile. If you enjoy really wild animation and special effects, you will certainly like this. <br />HOWEVER - just because this is animated does NOT mean that this is child appropriate. It is not. It is completely inappropriate (IMO) for children under the age of 12. It is very violent and contains images that are FAR too incomprehensible for young children, not to mention R rated language. Fine for adults and teenagers old enough to know the difference between reality and movies, simply not appropriate for children.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager living in 1988 suburbia.  Sure, there's lots of troubled teenagers in suburbia, so what's new?  Well, for one thing, Donnie keeps seeing manifestations of a guy named Frank dressed in a bunny suit telling him that the end is approaching.<br />No one really understands Donnie, so he rebels against just about everyone and everything except his therapist (Katherine Ross).  Extremely strange things begin to happen as Frank predicts Donnie's approaching rendezvous with destiny.<br />The film is unfortunately loaded with clichés:  the troubled teen, the idiot parents, the sympathetic science teacher, the class bullies, the new girl in town...it's everything we've seen before in dozens of other movies.  But `Donnie Darko' does have one thing going for it: it's as strange as a flock of flying pigs.  That weirdness almost makes the movie work, but the film ends leaving so many loose ends that are never tied up.  The extra features should have been a warning sign: when you've got 20 deleted and extended scenes, you've probably got a chopped up story.  Maybe the movie makes more sense with those scenes included, but after two hours, I didn't really want to spend any more time with Donnie Darko.
B0000009RT|4.0|What a freshman release! Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention created one heck of a first album. It was one of the first double albums in rock history, and certainly one of the wierdest.<br />My approach to this review is to look at (a) the attractiveness of this release for the Zappa novice, (b) the attractiveness of this album for the Zappa devotee, and (c) the quality of the release.<br />(a) If you are just getting interested in Zappa, this is not really the best place to start. While there are some interesting tracks here, there's also a lot of what at first appears to be just wierd noise and people freaking out tracks too. Those tracks are not available as samples on www.Amazon.com, so proceed carefully. <br />(b) Of course you need this! It's great! The mix is a bit different from the original vinyl, with a lot more reverb than before. I'd say that the original vinyl is probably the way to go, but the cd is very good too. (Besides, the cd saves you flipping records over.)<br />(c) The sound quality is superb, although, as noted before, the mix differs from the original vinyl. The packaging includes all of the original elements, which helps you relate to what the heck the mood was in 1966. <br />Enjoy!
B00005JKZV|2.0|I was very dissapointed in the second installment of The Lord Of The Rings movies.  They took the most mediocre book in the series and turned it into a sub-par action film.  It has its moments, but the action scenes drag on and on and seem to have no character development what-so-ever.  I was extremely pleased with the first film.  Even if it wasn't Tolkien's middle earth.  It was still a fine rendition of a classic novel.  After this poor showing I certainly hope Jackson and friends can deliver in the third installment.
B000002MFN|5.0|I do not think Madonna got the credit she deserved for this album. Madonna was exploring a new world of desire and pleasure. I love the way she approached Erotica, with the whole dominatrix atmosphere.  The rest of the album is not real sex-inclined, other than the sultry 'Where Life Begins' and 'Did You Do It?' Explicit Version Only). It also has serious songs, Such as 'In This Life'. And there is Rain, by far one of the best songs on the cd, which Madonna uses Metaphore compares waiting for love to Rain. In all, this is one of Madonna's best.  I don't really think it truly earns the Parental Advisory Label, but it got it for Bye, Bye Baby and Waiting and the sexual content.
0385507755|4.0|[Disclaimer: Much as been said about the author, and I can see that some reviewers here talk more about the author than the narrator, and I understand they are the same person, but there is no point in equating the two, and therefore I will refrain from discussing James Frey's comments in interviews and magazines.]<br />The book is addictive, but that's not the same as saying it's a great book. It is a good book, but not not without its flaws. Not the indisputable best book of our generation, as some have proclaimed it, but again, a decent book and one well worth reading. Despite the fact that few readers will be able to truly understand the author's viewpoint given his life of excess, it's easy to relate to the narrator, and feel his frustration, and therefore he is a very sympathetic character. At times, however, his behavior and human interactions become two-dimensional, particularly with his newfound 'girlfriend' and his experience with the Tao Te Ching. But these moments are infrequent, and anyway, it's forgivable because it's a book that has a message, and regardless of how &quot;masculinely&quot; stated it is, it is a message worth hearing: that you as a human have choices to make, and problems that you encounter in your life are largely symptoms of your choices, and the way you react to these problems is also a choice you have to make, and the decision to gain victory or to be defeated by the problems that plague you is, again, your choice. The book is the story of a triumph of the human will. Recommended.
B00008I8IF|5.0|After a few rather uneven albums (although the last one did contain one of their all-time highs, I'm Gonna Make You Love Me) the Jayhawks are back in the glorious form that made Tomorrow the Green Grass and Hollywood Town Hall such classics. Everything I love about Jayhawks - the infectious melodies, the gorgeous harmonies, the inevitable bittersweet feel - is back and better. With every listen I am more and more convinced that Save It For a Rainy Day is right up there with Blue and I'm Gonna Make You Love Me in the \\"best Jayhawks song\\" category. It is a stunning song, by far the best I have heard so far this year. I am, however, not sure that adding the acoustic extra tracks at the end was a good decision. They're all perfectly good songs, but I can't help feeling that they slow the pace of an otherwise glistering effort. I'm not too wild about Come to the River or Fools on Parade either, but who cares when the rest of the album is so darn good? Despite its title, this is summer music at its best and it will keep your spirit up well into November.<br />Standout tracks: Save It For a Rainy Day, The Eyes Of Sarah Jane, All the Right Reasons, Tailspin, Angelyne, One Man's Problem.<br />If you like this, you may also like: The Thorns - The Thorns<BR>Minus 5 - Down With Wilco<BR>Wilco - Summerteeth<BR>Beach Boys - Pet Sounds
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is a laid-back, late-night set of songs if there ever was one.  Very quiet but full of melody, Norah does her thing in a somber yet gripping style.  Definitely a far cry from the party stuff you hear on pop radio, which makes it even stranger that your hear Norah's songs on pop formats.  If you liked the first couple of singles she has released, then chances are you will enjoy the rest of this disc.

014118213X|5.0|Class consciousness, a common topic in British literature, is emphasized clearly in \\"Howards End,\\" which draws the class distinctions along very bold social, economic, and political lines.  Forster is frank in his observations that such a class system has made Britain the imperial force that it is, but it also paves the way for the worst sort of elitism, which inevitably leads to hypocrisy and the creation of double standards.<br />In the novel, the upper class, the symbol of British imperialism, is represented by the Wilcox family, who own a rubber company that operates out of Nigeria; the novel's title is the name of their country manor, one of their several residences.  The father, Henry, is a trickle-down theorist who believes the great disparity of wealth between the upper and lower classes is necessary to maintain the strong economy, a sentiment that is echoed by his callous older son Charles.<br />The Wilcoxes have befriended two sisters, Margaret and Helen Schlegel, who, living modestly off their father's inheritance and not having to work, may be considered middle class.  They both are highly educated and idealistic with regard to social reform and equalizing the classes; Margaret the older and more serious, Helen the more frivolous.<br />A conflict arises when Ruth Wilcox, Henry's wife, having spent some pleasant hours and developed a special friendship with Margaret in London, informally bequeaths to her Howards End, which results in a subtle moral paradox:  This wish is not legally binding, but isn't Henry dishonoring his wife's memory by dismissing it?  The point becomes moot when Henry and Margaret, overcoming their differences of opinion, genuinely fall in love with each other and marry.<br />The lower class is represented by a young office clerk named Leonard Bast who attempts to transcend his social status by earnestly reading Ruskin and attending cultural events -- his fateful first encounter with the Schlegel sisters is at a Beethoven concert.  Although his intellectual posturing falls flat with the Schegels, they see him as a model of social change and make him their pet project.  However, it is his slatternly wife Jacky who establishes the real significance of his presence in the novel, which is to expose a blatant double standard of which Henry Wilcox freely avails himself.  <br />Forster is an excellent empathic writer, able to convey with unusual sensitivity his characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, rivaling Edith Wharton in this skill.  He demonstrated this attribute to great effect in \\"A Room with a View,\\" but I feel \\"Howards End\\" is a triumphant improvement over its predecessor.  By using the social aspects of \\"A Room with a View\\" but eliminating the levity and the feeble attempts at comedy, he managed to construct what very well may be considered the definitive Edwardian novel.
6305327084|2.0|Beautiful Girls is a movie you can easily avoid. I bought it based on the fine list of actresses: Mira Sorvino, Lauren Holly, Natalie Portman (about 13 in this one and the only bright spot in the whole movie), Uma Thurman etc. It takes place in the winter in Minnesota (who thinks up these things?). Uma Thurman (fine looking face) never takes her coat off in the whole movie. After I watched it, I looked at the DVD cover to see why I ever bought it (49 wasted) and it said on the cover that it was a comedy. Always up for a good comedy. I didn't know it was supposed to be funny. I am going to watch it again with new understanding, I hope. I had NO IDEA this was a funny movie. I should have read the cover before I watched it; I could have anticipated the clever nuances of humor so cleverly disguised as boring stupid garbage. Other people should be warned. This movie literally makes The Grass is Greener appear humorous in comparison.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Once in a great while, a movie comes along and absolutely blows my mind - that's Memento.  And considering that it was a semi-independent film (meaning that it went to indie film fests, though it still had enough money to cast some pretty big names, like Carrie-Anne Moss), it makes me wonder why Hollywood is blowing hundreds of millions of dollars on mediocre films - instead of unforgettable ones like this one.<br />Memento is the story of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who lost his short-term memory when he tried to save his wife from the man who raped and murdered her.  Intent on revenge, Leonard keeps track of the facts with the help of Polaroids, scribbled notes, and tattoos, which tell him which hotel he's staying in, who he can trust, and who's lying to him.<br />The story is filmed in Tarantino-like intensity - in short clips, jumping from one story to another.  To complicate things even more, the scenes are shown in reverse chronological order.  You view each scene through the main character's eyes - not knowing what happened earlier.  In the end, everything you took as a given is shaken - and you're left wondering who the bad guys really were and who was telling the truth.<br />When it was all over, I spent hours working everything out, playing everything in true chronological order.  And the more I thought through it, the more amazed I became.  <br />Be warned that Memento isn't a brainless movie.  Rent it, and be prepared for two hours of blissful confusion that will drive you to replay it over and over.
B000089RVX|1.0|How to describe this C.D...  First, we start with derivative &quot;Linkin Park&quot;-style background music.  Then, we add a semi-talented female lead singer, who Tarja from Nightwish could blow out of the water easily.  (Amy Lee isn't bad: she just needs to learn more vocal range, because her voice varies little from song to song.)  We also add a good smidgen of faux-angsty vocals which get real annoying, REAL fast.  All those ingredients combine into a product that is, ultimately, quite mediocre, and really not worth your money or time.
0385504209|5.0|I decided to read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" after I thoroughly enjoyed reading a novel based on the end times prophecies of the Bible: Britt Gillette's \\"Conquest of Paradise\\".  That book totally blew me away, and I read reviews about this book tackling the secrets to uncovering the Holy Grail, so I figured it would be an intriguing topic.<br />Like \\"Conquest of Paradise\\", \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is set in the present.  A murder one night in the Louvre provides evidence of a sinister plot to uncover a secret that has been protected by a clandestine society since the days of Christ.  The murder victim, a member of this secret society, leaves clues at the scene of his own murder that can only be unraveled by his daughter and symbologist Robert Langdon.  Working together the two set out one a wild adventure that leads them all over Europe.  Dan Brown does an excellent job of entertaining the reader.  His descriptions of religious history remind me a lot of Tom Clancy's work in the military thriller genre, and pound for pound, Dan Brown holds his own with any other writer in the thriller genre.<br />For those who enjoyed the heightened suspense of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", I highly recommend \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" as another great read.  It's like few books I've ever read, and I couldn't put it down.  Either way, both books are fascinating entertainment.
B000002H38|5.0|This album is a true masterpiece. Anita Baker has exceeded the quality of sultry music and tough jazz tones and brought us \\"Rapture.\\" The songs are excellent for the slow gentle romantic soul. \\"Sweet Love\\" is the best song on the album. It's sultry sexy sounds gives Rapture a true beginning to the album. The second best is \\"Mystery.\\" What better way to show the mysterious jazziness of the album than have a song named \\"Mystery\\" Anita Baker's Rapture is like going to a smokey jazz club 1 in the morning while the moon is full.
0553106635|4.0|I really enjoyed the first two books, and this one started out just as good. However, two of the main characters die at the \\"Red Wedding.\\" It was totally apalling and took the fun out of reading it. Also, I wouldn't recommend this book for younger teenagers because of the sex scenes. It was very hard to get over the gruesome deaths of Catelyn and Robb....and the Epilogue did not quite make sense. We will have to see what happens in a Feast for Crows won't we?
0385508417|1.0|I was on my way to thinking this book was hokey but tolerable, much like It's A Wonderful Life, when it hit me: this story is supposed to take place in the present.  I think I read that one of the characters spoke into her cell phone or something, and realized that this goofy, preachy, Reader's Digest-style short story was supposed to be swallowed as if we heard about it occurring to our own neighbors or co-workers now, and not 60 years ago.  At that point, I went from desperately struggling to suspend disbelief to all-out disgust.  The idea that anyone in today's world even knows what his neighbors are doing for the holidays, let alone cares about the degree to which they are observed, is absurd.  No one pays attention to this kind of thing, and certainly reserves their neighborly gossip for more pressing, twenty or 21st century fare like shootings, terrorism, and sex between school-aged kids.  The only community that would be rocked by the scandal of someone skipping Christmas to save money and evade commercialism is that of pre-color Pleasantville (you know, the Toby Maguire movie?).<br />This tale is such a one-trick pony, too.  Every plot device comes in bunches: it's not enough to have the police come to the Kranks' house looking for annual contributions and doing  double-takes upon hearing that they're skipping Christmas- the boy scouts have to do the same thing later that week.  Every character is an unbelievable clich&eacute;, from the uptight neighbor who insists on putting a plastic snowman on the roof of every house on the street, to the silly jealous coworkers who envy the Kranks for taking a Carribean vacation.  The only reason Nora Krank isn't a clich&eacute; is because she is outright crazy: she eagerly goes along with Luther's plan until it backfires due to unforeseen circumstances (to everyone but the Kranks, that is- any reader over the age of 7 will see them a mile away); at that point, she turns around 180 degrees and attacks her husband as if she weren't a willing accomplice.<br />[By the way, \\"The Kranks?\\"  Please.  Why not just call them Mr. and Mrs. Evil McNasty, or something equally transparent?  This is the level of sophistication Grisham is working with here, perhaps to keep things simple enough to get his goofy, subtle-as-a-pie-in-the-face moral message across to an audience he clearly underestimates (or better yet, condescends to).]<br />There's so much more to tell, but I can't even go on describing this book's shortcomings.  If you need to know more than all of these negative reviews are saying, pick the book up from your local bookstore or library, open to any page, and read just two paragraphs.  I have no doubt that you will find enough wrong with this book by following those few simple steps- that's all it takes, folks.

B00008IAMD|5.0|If your reading this review, I presume you are trying to choose whether to purchase this album with or without the Bonus DVD (or buy it again with the DVD this time, or buy it for all your friends, DVD included...)  Essentially, you should spare no effort or money trying to obtain your copy of the &quot;Hurt&quot; video.  It captures the very core of Johnny Cash's presentation of Christian values and meaning in life.  Reznor's music converted me to Christianity by causing me to think through an articulate definition of my worldview.  Cash recreates one of Reznor's finest songs and uses it to illustrate the meaning of true Christian devotion.  The video is classic and one of the most evocative pieces of art I've ever come across; if the painting &quot;The Scream&quot; by Edvard Munch could be music, this would be it.  And the music here is as beautiful and astounding as &quot;The Scream.&quot;  I heard somewhere that Cash said that Hurt was something he would have written in the '70's &quot;if he was a good songwriter.&quot;  I'm sure happy he decided to cover it!  I have converted my brother into a Cash fanatic with this album, and when he came to visit recently I showed him this video.  He is aspiring to become a studio engineer/technical sound person, and said that the video made him aspire even stronger to create the best art he possibly could.  Enough said.
0812550706|5.0|This is an excellent work of science fiction that has as much to offer adults as it does teens.  In fact, both audiences will get what they need from this story, as the multiple layers aren't mutually exclusive.  It would surprise me if younger audiences can appreciate some of the social commentary and politics of this story, which make the tale as excellent as do the complex action sequences.<br />And what action there is.  Ender Wiggins, who is exhaustively trained and groomed- and whose very birth was commissioned- to eventually lead the world in battle against alien forces (\\"the buggers\\"), grows up in an anti-gravity combat arena outside Earth, where his every move is watched by the military.  The better he performs, the greater the challenges are created to train him or break him in the process.  Every force in Ender's life is calculated by his handlers to prepare him for battle, beginning with artificial isolation from his family and from other children, to allowing the child's nemeses to confront and bully him, to maintaining computer games for Ender to play, which incorporate real elements from his past into the landscape.<br />This book reads like a video game, through graphic representation of the battle scenes and thorough details of the strategies involved.  Anyone who has ever appreciated military-style games like Stratego, or even tooled around with Army men, will enjoy the formations Ender employs in battle (and Card's vivid descriptions thereof).  There is a large psychological component to Ender's training, and a sociological angle to the book in general, too.  In fact, a well-developed parallel storyline to Ender's training involves his equally-brilliant brother Peter and sister Valentine, and their efforts to marshal populations back on Earth to prepare for war with one another, in case the threat of aliens turns out to be a hoax.<br />Ender is a reluctant leader despite his very great gifts, and the entire training process begs the question: what if a society learned of a brilliant leader in its midst who was but a child; how hard should its leaders push him, versus letting him mature on his own?  For that matter, to what lengths should a nation go to discover the next Napoleon, Washington, or Churchill, before he has the opportunity to develop a non-military interest?  As for Ender, his fate hangs in the balance until the story's end, in a twist that remarkably allows him to skirt the issue of having to commit to one of his dueling natures: extreme empathy for others or utter ruthlessness in battle.at if a society learned of a brilliant leader in its midst who was but a child; how hard should its leaders push him, versus letting him mature on his own?

Having a dad that isn't focused on finances and business I think this book really helped me to know that anyone can make money and be succesful. I thik its an easy book to read. It's a book that you can understand.
B000088E6D|5.0|A friend recommended the CD of Michael Buble.  I curiously browsed through it on a local CD store.  I immediately liked it.  It is simple, but very refreshing.  The arrangements are nice, technically clean.  The selections are quite &quot;bubble gum&quot; songs, which makes it cute and enjoyable. There is a nice swing also to Michael Buble's voice, a natural jazz singer.  I like his version of Fever, Come fly with me, and Put your head on my shoulder.  I hope to hear more from this singer, in particular songs from the 60's.
B000087OR2|3.0|I was blown away when I heard &quot;Don't know why&quot; for the first time on the radio.  I was even more impressed that they were playing something in the jazz idiom on a pop radio station.  I immediately went out and bought the album.  To say the least, I was more than a little disappointed with the rest of the album.  It certainly wan't because the songs were of poor quality, but after a while they all sounded the same.  It's a shame that Norah Jones doesn't try to expand into something a little more up-tempo, or perhaps something with a latin rhythm?
B00006RU5B|5.0|Over the year there have been many great rock albums to hit stores.  Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Phish, System of A Down, and many more have released amazing hits.  Even some great newcomers came onto the scene, The Vines, The Strokes, Zwan, and of course Audioslave. Now I know the following statement is arguable, but the best album to come out of this year is by far Audioslave's debut. Now with Chris Cornell at vocals, how can the band not become a huge success.  Chris Cornell is by far the best voice in rock of this generation.  Rage Against the Machine is labeled one of the best rock bands to come out of the 90's.  With the two of these elements combined they created the Civilian Project.  <br />The CD doesn't have a bad song on it.  Among my favorites are &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;, &quot;Gasoline&quot;, and &quot;Getaway Car&quot;.  Of course everybody has heard the heavy riffs of &quot;Cochise&quot; and the vocally driven song &quot;Like A Stone&quot;.  If just having those songs on the album wasn't enough, &quot;Set It Off&quot; is another heavy song and &quot;Shadow In The Sun&quot; is one of the most lyrical songs I have heard in a while.  <br />This album is a must have for any fan of Soundgarden, or Rage Against the Machine, or any rock fan in general.  I would be surprised if anyone hasn't already bought it.
0688163173|5.0|While this book has little in common with the Kenzie/Gennaro novels or Mystic River, it does have the one thing that I've come to expect from Dennis Lehane - suspense.  The excitement never stops in this well written novel.  It was a great read and I'd highly recommend it.

B0000931OG|4.0|Despite the departure of the guitarist, &quot;Think Tank&quot; seems to pick up where the brilliant &quot;13&quot; left off; perhaps *slightly* more commercial, although I still see a lot of variety and experimentation here.  It seems that after mining the 60s Kinks Britpop sound (to great effect) and then aping US indie rock (to mixed effect), the group are finally creating their own identity, with Albarn's always-superb vocals at the center. Although it's happening in fits and starts (it was a four-year gap between &quot;13&quot; and this one, with other projects taking notable precedent), this evolution makes them one of the best bands in the UK today and I was actually looking forward to this release even more than &quot;Hail To The Theif&quot;.<br />The only problem I see is that the group should have cut 15-20 minutes or so off of their album.  In the old days of vinyl, they would have had a perfect 40-minute work--namely, the first 40 minutes or so.  The album starts off superb with classics like &quot;Ambulance&quot;, &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;...then continues<BR>that momentum, but by track 8 or 9 the inspiration starts to <BR>leak out and the last three or four tracks (with one exception, &quot;Jets&quot;) seem to drag on with no real purpose. Perhaps this was the result of the fractured way in which the album was made--I don't know, but in any case &quot;Think Tank&quot; is still highly recommended as a worthy followup to &quot;13&quot;.
B00004RF9B|3.0|Not everything is perfect, of course. Here are some pros and cons:<BR>Good: The faster-than-light travel. Contrast this with another good sci-fi film, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; -- both made in the 50's, but only FP's writers had any clue as to interplanetary distances and the speeds required to cross them. Also, the &quot;DC&quot; (deceleration) procedure was good, complete with &quot;DC stations&quot; and post-DC physical effects on the crew that were treated matter-of-factly rather than explained to the movie viewer. Quite good.<BR>Bad: First moon landing in the &quot;last decade of the 21st Century&quot;? They missed that one by 130 years.<BR>Very good: Most of the special effects.<BR>Not so good: Some of the Disney-supplied cartoon effects (not that I'm really complaining; they weren't all that bad, and it was the 50's after all).<BR>Great: Morbius' house and surrounding grounds.<BR>Not so great: The caps that the commander and lieutenant wore briefly with their short-sleeve shirts.<BR>Great: Anne Francis as Altaira (a babe, no matter what star system you're in)<BR>Great: Robby the robot<BR>Not so great: Earl Holliman's ship's cook character. A little bit went a long way.<BR>Great: The underground Krell complex (more good f/x)<BR>Good: the electronic music score<BR>Great: Walter Pidgeon's performance as Morbius<BR>Good-but-not-great: Leslie Nielsen's performance as the commander of C57D.<BR>Good: C57D; remember, this was the same time most sci-fi was still using the finned rocket ship.<BR>Not good: the fact that the DVD is not letter-boxed. It would have been better to see the whole screen.<BR>And the list goes on, of course, but you can add your own after you see this excellent movie.
0385504209|5.0|Man! Dan Brown must have some beef with the Catholic Church. But I must say, his beef makes for a good read. I've never learned so much from reading fiction in the whole of my life. Brown's research is meticulous, so much so that you start to believe his books should be in the non-fiction section. I truly enjoyed this book. Breaking codes and following clues...Brown has presented an engaging mystery that takes you from point A to point Z before you know it and teaches you something along the way. Even though I'm sure he's not too popular with the Vatican, I hope Brown keeps it up.
0783225733|4.0|One way to note how good this movie is: WE ALL KNOW HOW IT TURNED OUT -- WE KNOW THEY GOT HOME SAFELY -- and yet it still manages to be a suspenseful movie! <BR>Without doubt, the master stroke was to film some scenes in actual zero-G aboard the cargo plane (as described in the supplemental material on the DVD). Think of all the space movies that had cheesy imitation weightlessness using wires or other gimmicks. Those techniques might have ruined this movie. Getting the actual zero-G shots was sheer brilliance.<BR>Like all movies of historical events, the truth was altered a bit here and there for dramatic purposes (small sample: It appears that Jim Lovell's actual words were &quot;Houston, we've had a problem&quot;. But in popular culture it has always been &quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot;, and that's the way it's said in this movie). In light of the overall excellence of this film, it's easy to forgive small inaccuracies like that.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|He owns the catalog and put this out for more money. Their best songs never went to #1.
B00006IR5S|4.0|There are some marvelous moments in this music: among them the solemn walk onto the stairs to Dumbledore's office, the humorous ditties for Myrtle the ghost and the vain Prof. Lockhart, the Ravel-like variations on the Dobby theme, and rich development of the deceptively simple Fawkes music. There are also some rather stiff and iterative moments, as in the Flying Car sequence and some of the spider music is rather over the top. On balance, this is outstanding film music, as one would expect from Williams, though not as uniformly engaging and evocative as the first film's music (Sorcerer's Stone). It is clearly not Williams' best effort, however, and I'm looking forward to a fresh inspiration from him for the pivotal Prisoner of Azkaban film, now in production. This is a story that should certainly stimulate the deepest vein of Williams' rich talent, and with a new director involved (Alfonse Cuaron), there is even more to look forward to in this film. But we will have to wait until next June for that; in the meantime, enjoy the music to these two films: the first is some of Williams' greatest work of his brilliant career, and the second, if somewhat uneven in quality, is still enjoyable.

B00005OWIU|4.0|Williams delivers again with evocative orchestration, some memorable themes, and a few moments of breathtaking beauty (such as my favorite, the Change of Seasons variation). He draws richly and appropriately from his own past work and responds musically to the humor, pathos, and mystery in the Potter stories. Clearly, Mr. Williams has found a resonant inner chord in the work of JK Rowling and the visual adaptation created by Chris Columbus: when truly creative people are communicating on the inner channel, great work is done, and Williams' score is a manifestation of this depth of synergy among artists--from the writer who started it all, to the director who gave it an imagistic life, to Mr. Williams' extraordinary ability to sing in the voices of the characters and events of a great story.

B000089RVX|2.0|Alright, this is my first written review, and although I've been wanting to write a review for some time, it seems only Evanescence could propell me enough to state my opinion. I have to say, to anyone reading this, PLEASE don't be mislead about Evanescence.<br /> Thus Far, I've heard Amy's voice as being descibed as &quot;Gothic&quot;, &quot;Haunting, and &quot;Talented&quot;. Not Quite. Amy's Vocals have a nice flow to them, and ALMOST make it,BUT it's in alot of ways over-produced,frankly half-baked, and in my opinion, nothing to scream about. Some people say it's &quot;Emotion&quot;; I say she's whiny and melodramatic.<br />All I have to say is this; There are a million other &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands like this one, You just might like them, but if you want a vocalist that knows how to make your skin crawl with pain, torment, anguish, and &quot;Haunting&quot; despair, You're Looking for Trent Reznor, of Nine Inch Nails.<br />If you're a hardcore musician, listener, or artist, it will be dissapointingly obvious that Evanescence, like so many other new bands are close... <br />But Definately No Cigar.
0156027321|5.0|This book is easily one of the most fascinating book i have ever read. The story is magical,the imageries breathtaking and the characters ...well they speak to you !! A MUST READ for all ages.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|even if you don't like it, this band still has incredible talent. most of their tracks you can't help but like. one such track is enfilade. the whole album is amazing. i only just got  it, and the day i got it, i couldn't bring myself to listen to anything else. what i'm glad about is that the album doesn't have the same sound for each sound. some tracks are majorly fast-paced, others are melodically beautiful. to say the least, these guys really have talent
B00008WG3U|2.0|This CD started out with \\"The Separation of Church and Skate.\\" This song was rediculously good. I was so excited. I was thinking \\" I can't believe NOFX got better. The second song and third were pretty good too. It went downhill from there. Pretty crappy to be honest. I normally like NOFX's silly songs like \\"clams have feelings too\\" and \\"liza and louise\\" but \\"shes nubs\\" is annoying and horrible. Aside from the 1st track and a few others this CD isnt too great, don't waste your money. Get \\"Punk in Drublic\\" \\"White Trash...\\" \\"The Decline\\" or \\"Pump up the Valuum\\" instead. Weak Effort. Where's the energy?
B000089RVX|5.0|After hearing &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on the radio once, long before I saw Daredevil, I was extremely interested in this band.  Finally, after waiting for MONTHS to make sure I actually wanted to spend my money on this thing, I bought &quot;Fallen.&quot;  Ever since then, I have been listening to this cd constantly.  No matter what my mood, I have always found a song to match the way I feel, whether in the tone of the music or the lyrics it accompanies.  A few of my favorites here recently have been &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet.&quot;  And while some may say that there is little to be praised about these particular songs, it could also be said that they embody some of the largest pain and worry anyone of this age could have gone through.  Yes, some of the music may sound a bit like Linkin Park, specifically the harder of them (think &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; here).  However, on the whole, this album is unique, and I cannot wait to hear the newest music they come up with.  Very few bands can command my attention this well, however, Evanescence has risen to the challenge
B00003XACV|5.0|After watching this movie many times and feeling the intensity of it, I decided to buy the soundtrack(s). The one with lyrical songs on it [is bad] but this score is absolutely BRILLIANT! While hearing this music without the movie, you can totally feel the intensity of the characters even more, and I know why this movie was so good. I take this soundtrack with me in my car when I drive alone, because it puts me at peace, and makes me think and reflect. This score, I cannot emphasise enough, is perfect. Recommended to anyone.
B00005JKZV|5.0|So what if the movie was nothing like the book. It can't be. The book is sevral hundred pages long. That movie would go bankrupt before the cast was even assembled. I understand if you're dissapointed that you can't see what was in the book on the screen, BUT THAT'S WHAT IMAGINATION IS FOR. Why don't you try watching the movie, as a movie. Watch it for what it is. Don't watch it and say \\"oh, that was different. No, that's not supposed to be there\\". On it's own terms this movie was great. It had amazing characters, effects, and a not-too-complicated storyline (though the names do get a bit confusing). So if you didn't like it JUST BECAUSE it wasn't like the book, then you're not going to enjoy many movies.
B000002L9M|5.0|Absolutely, this is DM's most darkest, pessimistic, nihilistic and depressing album. I am a finnish boy who have to survive a long and dark winter. Black Celebration is just a great album to hear when there is snowing and winding hard in winter. Black diamonds are Here is the House, A Question of Lust and Dressed in Black, which shows clearly Gore's musical skills.<br />Black Celebration, Fly on the Wind Screen and World Full of Nothing are ultimate pessictic songs.

0743244249|5.0|I read this and Michael Moorcock's King of the City in the same<BR>week or so.  Moorcock's novel is a storm of anger, an eloquent<BR>British take on the modern world of high finance and low spirituality.  DeLillo's is a cool, equally eloquent, spare parable on the same topics.  It was interesting to read both these books in tandem since both take hard, beautifully written looks at the modern obsession with money and fame.  DeLillo has chosen to take a spare, emblematic approach while Moorcock's voice embraces the widest possible vocabulary.  Yet both writers offer us novels at their most engaging and serious, the best that modern writing can offer.  I've been recommending<BR>Cosmopolis and King of the City to anyone who'll listen.  The<BR>perfect combination.  I love DeLillo and this, no matter what some of the reviewers say here, is DeLillo at his very best.
B000000OXH|5.0|When I first time listened to this album, I didn't like it a lot because it sounded boring. Later, I listened Alpha again but still it didn't sound any better than last time. Third listening time told me the truth! This is a exciting and reflexing album. You won't maybe love this when you listen to Alpha first or second time, but you should continue and find a real Alpha's heart.  Asia's debut is classic and it is difficult to be not compering Alpha for it. In opinion, Alpha is almost as good as Asia.  Sounds has changed dramatically and some people won't like these new and fresh sounds. All Asia's musicians have still excelent skills to play interesting music in their own way. Downes and Wetton duo have written  10 songs which are simply fine and shine songs. My favourite tracks are The Heat Goes On, Never In a Million Years and Open Your Eyes. The end of Open Your Eyes song is one of the Asia's best and it shows clearly their unbeliable musicial skills.
038572179X|5.0|Having had only limited and disappointing exposure to McEwan's work in the past I approached Atonement with a degree of scepticism. For reasons I can no longer recall I had been putting off reading McEwan for some years, however, when Amsterdam won the Booker I could avoid him no longer. Amsterdam (the only other work by McEwan that I have read) received a chorus of fulsome accolades from the professional critics, much like its follow-up, Atonement. I was exceptionally disappointed by Amsterdam, which I found to be slight and under-developed, and I assumed that the Booker was awarded more in recognition of a `life-time's achievement', rather than specifically for Amsterdam. I mention this only to further elevate the praise that I'm about to confer on Atonement.<br />Atonement is a wide ranging novel that employs beautifully sensitive and elegant writing. The novel is in three parts, the first of which concerns the events of one long, hot summer's day in 1935. Briony Tallis, the novel's central protagonist, is introduced in part one and is expertly rendered. The emotions and feelings of this precocious 13 year old are conveyed expertly. Briony mistakenly believes herself to have crossed into adulthood; the catalyst to this premature revelation is her witnessing from afar unusual events between her elder sister and the housekeeper's son, Robbie. After witnessing this episode Briony conjures a fantastic justification that sets in train a dramatic and tragic series of events.<br />The second part of Atonement explores the repercussions of Briony's actions on the lives of herself and those around her. The tragedy that befell Briony, her sister and Robbie is expounded against the broader, but equally harrowing retreat to Dunkirk and the expected invasion of Britain. McEwan focuses on the minutiae of war, the personal, and in doing so presents us with an intimate perspective of life during wartime for the combatants and those that were left behind. The themes of guilt, redemption, blame, punishment and betrayal are paralleled between the global events of the unfolding second world war and those within the family.<br />The final part of Atonement is Briony's personal denouement, which attempts to serve a satisfactory conclusion to the novel but, in my view, is an unnecessary contribution. McEwan is perhaps a little too clever in his summation, although this is a minor criticism of an otherwise excellent novel.<br />McEwan's writing is redolent of the era in which Atonement is set: there is a sense of formality to his prose that accords his characters with a dignity and austerity that is entirely sympathetic to his subject. His pacing is expert and without relying on fantastically dramatic material McEwan is able to contrive drama through his tight prose. I enjoyed this novel enormously and recommend it without reservation.
B000002L75|4.0|There are seven fine and enjoyable songs, but there are also two less good tracks. People are People is full of catchy melodies and it has important message to us all, Master and Servant is kinky classic for sadomastic persons and Blashemous Rumours is dark song with good chorus. Something to Do and Lie to Me are songs that you can forget because they just don't sit on this album. It Doesn't Matter and Somebody are beautiful and touchy loce songs. Some Great Reward is good album to start explore DM's music.

078324228X|5.0|Denzel Washington stars as the prizefighter boxer Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter in this classic movie. This movie is about a wrongly accused man, Carter, who is sent to jail for a murder he did not commit.<br />It is a very intriguing story, because the chances of Denzel Washington actually being in his tight situation are so slim. But he was caught off guard, and subjected to racial and prejudiced trials and law officials. <br />This movie is motivational and entertaining. It brought tears to my eyes, and some parts were also humorous. There was a lot of drama in it, and a lot of story. Ultimately, I think it's a great movie to watch if you want to watch something realistic (this movie was based on a true story).
B00006BTCA|5.0|This album is so amazingly great I don't even know what to say about it. Everytime I listen to it I find another favorite song. I don't even know who to compare these guys with to describe their sound. This is very original and everyone should own this album.
B00005JKNC|5.0|What must it have been like to have been in a position of power and responsibility in The United States, when a single person and a cadre of political thugs were able to investigate anyone they pleased in the name of seeking out supposed Communist spies?  By contrast, small town America still lived in relative innocence, believing their government could do no wrong, believing in the values that we have always associated with The United States.  This dichotomy of situations is well-contrasted and exploited in one of Jim Carrey's best movies.<br />Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a Hollywood writer accused of being a member of the Communist party, just as his career seems ready to take off.  Peter goes for a long drive after having too much to drink, at the end of a long day.  His drive ends with his car over an embankment.<br />Peter wakes up to discover that he no longer remembers who he is, and is now in the town of Lawson, California.  The setting is critical to understanding this movie.  Small-town America is as different from large-city America as the moon is compared to the Earth.  Every small town has its claim to fame.  In Lawson's case, it was The Majestic Theater before World War II.  However, the war killed or maimed most of the town's young men, and took the energy of the town with it.  Peter bears a strong resemblance to Lucas Trimble, a town hero, and son of Harry Trimble (Martin Landau), the owner of The Majestic, and soon the town takes Peter for Lucas, convincing Peter in the process.<br />Unfortunately, the Committee on Un-American Activities eventually catches up with Peter just as he remembers who he was.  Peter goes off to face the music with Hal Holbrook as Congressman Doyle.<br />This success of this movie hinges on the ability to understand small towns, and the feeling those towns have for their landmarks and their history.  The loss of the boys during the war was symbolized by the deterioration of The Majestic, which further symbolized the despair and loss of the town of Lawson.  The return of Luke Trimble restored hope, symbolized by the repair of The Majestic.<br />We find that Peter Appleton is all too mercenary, and has few personal values.  However, he finds values in Lawson, and his redemption ultimately becomes redemption for Lawson.  The two are inextricably intertwined.<br />It's easy to criticize this movie for being too larger than life.  Obviously there were exaggerations.  However, the feel of small-town America is correct.  Was the movie predictable, as others have suggested?  I thought that the movie's outcome was one of several.  Ultimately, this movie is family friendly and is a favorite among our small-town family.  Five stars because I liked it after having seen it twice.air and loss of the town of Lawson.

B000002J09|4.0|For starters, I've never heard this album all the way through. Once I heard it on KLOS, but got bored with it after Stairway to Heaven. But those first 4 songs were good enough to warrant at least a 4-star rating in my book. But anyway, what I really wanted to say was to tell everyone here to please be more accurate and learn how to spell correctly when you write reviews. The song is Black Dog not Black Dogs, favorite doesn't have a 'U', in it, and it is one of the best, not on of the best. Those idiosyncracies are inexcusable. I just hope that from here on out people will write reviews with no errors or mistakes in them.
014028009X|4.0|Enter the world of Bridget Jones. Shes is a 30 year old singleton whose life is a whirlpool of dates with men, late nights out with friends, and endless dinner parties with the smug marrieds. The book takes place over the time span of one year, and throughout the year you see the changes that Bridget slowly goes through. The book takes you into her mind, and you get to see why she does the things she does. Bridget Jones's Diary is a very entertaining and funny book that gives you a fresh look of the life of Bridget. It is very real and honest. I really enjoyed reading this book and I found myself laughing out loud and staying up late to find out what would happen next.
B00008S2VG|4.0|\\"American Life\\" is like nothing I expected from Madonna, continuing a career-long trend. Songs like the stunning \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" sound like nothing on the radio and are proof that Madonna has continued to evolve and take chances artistically. Whether or not you enjoy the direction of such choices, it is the fact that she was at least willing to stretch that matters most. She did not settle on making a sequel to \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Music\\" (which would have been pointless and boring) or pump out the same contrived [stuff] as other artists. I found this album thoroughly enjoyable and found it truly came from Madonna's heart. It's not commercial for the most part and some may not like it, but I could care less.

B0000399WI|5.0|Andrew Dufresne is a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit.  This is the start of the film but it's basically a catalyst for changing the lead characters life as well as a few others.<br />After being convicted of a double-homicide, Andy is stripped of his life of privilege and sent to feared Shawshank Prison.  Once there things go from bad to worse for him, but that's only for the first few years.  Eventually the warden learns that Andy has special financial talents that can be put to use by means that are legal and otherwise.<br />A twist of fate will cause Andy to get so close to a new trial and the possibility of freedom and redemption that he can taste it.  But prison is not a fairy tale world as the viewer learns from Andy's friend Red.  But hope is never completely lost, and the man who perseveres can triumph over great adversity.<br />There is a happy ending, but don't believe for a second that this is a happy film.<br />Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on a Stephen King story titled \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.\\"  The movie is dark, but more importantly has adult tones and therefore I recommend not allowing children under the age of 14 to view this film.  This film deals with aspects of prison life that most people would just like to pretend don't exist.<br />The soundtrack is a great bit of music and could stand alone, but works even better within the movie.  The symphonic score was composed by Thomas Newman.  There's even some Mozart thrown in for a few minutes.  Hank Williams sings a song for those who don't like classical.<br />Not much on DVD extras here, but a great movie worth owning.
0316666343|4.0|New and interesting look at death, told by a young girl who is murdered by her neighbor, and ethereally hangs around afterward to watch after her parents and friends.  Unable to communicate, she watches as they suffer the after effects of loosing her, and watches as her killer goes unpunished.  We follow Susie, as she follows them, and tells us of her regrets, things she wishes she had done in life, and what she wishes for her parents and friends in their lives without her.  Only four stars instead of five, because toward the ending Ms. Sebold let the \\"fantasy\\" part of this book slip a little too far.  I enjoyed the story as Susie told it from her afterlife, but when she ventures briefly back into this world, I felt the reasoning was off and the concept unacceptable and a bit silly.  All in all, a pretty good book, worthy of four stars.

B00003CX8U|5.0|I think superior to Cabaret (closest similarity) because of its fatalistic storyline.  It is really about a man's journey through death, starting as he flirts with death and eventually embraces it; death being portrayed by a beautiful woman who in intermittant scenes discusses Joey's life with him.  In life, he is a philanderer who drinks and smokes and takes drugs to maintain his busy lifestyle as a top director on Broadway.  Trying to satisfy his insatiable appetite to be the best, to create the best; he must balance his relationships with his girlfriend, ex-wife, and daughter.  As the show he is producing begins to go over-budget, the stress is on and he finally reaches a saturation point of drugs, bad living and stress, and has a massive heart attack.  He then goes through the seven stages of death in his own theatrical way, dreaming of scenes that would portray his death on stage.  Brilliant dance sequences, excellent choreography,(and don't forget the actual footage of real open heart surgery) a flashy production of the life and death of a talented A-type personality, giving glimpses into just how little he leaves behind him in the end.  The final death production is absolutely great.  Enjoy!
0140187863|5.0|D.H. Lawrence touched raw nerves when this was published because it vividly addressed and described what the upper classes have been doing for ages: Having extra-marital affairs with members of their own class and those of the \\"lower\\" classes.<br /><br />The book does have a few scenes of raw passion and thoughts but Lawrence was merely addressing how people feel in such affairs. He had the courage to put down those emotions into Oliver Mellors, the gamekeeper, and also Lady Chatterley herself.<br /><br />This IS a love story, when you get down to it. From an extra-marital affair there comes love, an awakening of the self (and in Lady Chatterley's case, a child). Apparently, more and more people in today's society are putting their desires first, otherwise, why the high divorce rate? (And the book was given much publicity when it was banned - so much so that this book couldn't land in peoples' hands fast enough. Many \\"illegal\\" copies were made and shipped to England and America, becoming an instant classic.)<br /><br />I give David Herbert Lawrence all the credit in the world to address sex in an age of absolute prudishness. This stands out as a true classic of fine literature.
B00008LOS1|5.0|This must be the 5th or 6t copy of who's next that i own. Overall it is probably one of the greatest rock albmus of all time,marking the passage after the light pop and psychedelia of the 60's into the adulthood of hard rock music. It was also pioneering in its use of synthesizers in addition to the oversaturated guitars, as on \\"won't get fooled again\\". The additional material is interesting because it shows the material performed before the band had fully matured into what we have grown accustomed to hear on the album/CD: roger daltrtey's voice is not as mature and thee guitar playing is not as hard and focussed. It is intersting to hear that the bass and drums provided by entwhistle and moon had alreada reached its peak. the only complaint is that it is a tad expensive and does not contain all the extra material found on the previous expanded version which contaiend additional lifehouse stuff.It is of course an indispensable buy but how many versions of who's next do we need?? probably a lot more...
B000002ADT|5.0|I was recommended this by a lady at Borders-SanFrancisco in 2001 when I told her I want to pick up just a few definitive CDs on Jazz. Picking this disk, she said 'if you don't like this, probably you won't like Jazz !'. Coming back I was not THAT impressed by it listening for the first time. Then I listened to it after about a month and gradually I started liking it more and more each day. And today I feel completely fascinated by the all-round quality of it. Sounds like all the band-members are playing in a real nice mood, totally immersed in their artistry and in complete sync with each other. You can easily make out that they were really enjoying this session.  My 2c to an inquisitive beginner will be, pl. be patient with this album. Let some time go by. You will know !
B00008OWZC|5.0|For Led Zeppelin fans, this is a God-send.  For the younger set, this will illustrate the power of Led Zeppelin in concert and why they are still one of the best rock bands ever.  Zeppelin fans, this is a must-have even if you have the bootlegs.  Pagey has cleaned these concerts up and they sound great.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Received my copy today.  I'm thrilled to say that to call it jawdroppingly good would be an understatement.  THIS DVD CONTAINS THE BEST LED ZEPPELIN LIVE RECORDINGS EVER.  I saw the band four times including Knebworth.  I have always been at a loss to describe to my younger pals what seeing them live was actually like.  And after their kinda lame \\"Song Remains The Same\\" I had little hope of any live recording or video being able to capture the overwhelming power of this band in concert.  This two-disc set exceeds its hype by a mile.  \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", \\"Rock 'n Roll\\", \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"(without that silly \\"does anyone remember laughter?\\" from TSRTS), \\"In the Evening\\", \\"Kashmir\\" are all standouts.  There is some sparklingly deft guitar work by Page, Plant's voice is fantastic, Jones' bass is amazing and Bonzo's driving percussion remains the stuff of legend.  There is hardly anything AT ALL on this DVD set that can be considered weak.  The video quality ranges from surprisingly good to just plain great.   Sadly, the fidelity and dynamic range of the music requires some hefty speakers and serious amplification to extract every last bit of sound from the remarkable remastered audio.  Listening to it on tinny built-in TV speakers will not be pleasant.  And turn it up to eleven...  Highest recommendation and a great excuse to buy a 10000-watt surround system .
B00006F2TV|4.0|I loved this movie and the DVD was well worth buying.  I was somewhat disappointed with the extras.  I was hoping to get deleted movie scenes that you often get with the DVD version.  But no extra scenes are included on this one.

Each new character is described by the movies and music they love, which makes perfect sense to pop-culture junkies. <BR>It reads quickly and fluidly once you find the character's voices. The London vernacular and slang take a few pages to get used to, but once I read the book with an &quot;English accent&quot;, the characters took immediate shape and depth. <BR>I would describe it as the man's take on Bridget Jones.

B000002UUH|4.0|John Lennon certainly had a prolific career with many many successful beatles and solo records. The John Lennon Collection offers 19 solid tracks from his solo tenure that spanned from 1969 to 1980. Although I believe John Lennons' Imagine is his best solo work, and probably a must have, this is also a fine cd offering most of his hits from his other albums. My favorite tracks on the disc are Give Peace A Chance, Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, Imagine and Watching The Wheels. If you like the Beatles or John Lennon at all, this will be a rewarding purchase.
B00005JKN9|1.0|This is the most mind-numbningly boring movie I've ever seen.  The only redeeming quality is Daniel Day-Lewis's performance.  I don't think I can say much about this movie that hasn't already been said, but it bored me nearly to tears and the ending was disappointing.  It's one of those movies you watch and you think, \\"I sat through three hours... for THIS?\\"  I suppose it's worth seeing, as it is a very ambitious movie, and it had a lot of potential, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to own it.

B00008OWZC|5.0|The live CD \\"How the West Was Won\\" is excellent (I wish I could have been there to hear them in person)!!! The sound quality is excellent....it is very much like the double CD released a few years ago (Live from the BBC). <br />Led Zeppelin are truly masters of imprvisation. We all know the songs; but they are performed as though I have heard them for the very first time. My personal favorites on the CD are \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and a nearly 26 minute long version of \\"Dazed And Confused.\\" <br />Also included is John Bonham, performing an excellent solo on \\"Moby Dick\\" (a fitting tribute to the best drummer ever). <br />Led Zeppelin fans: THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was fortunate enough to get this from a local independent record store 3 days before its release. Immediately after hearing it, I knew that the planet was in for a treat. This, and the accompanying DVD, were hyped up among Zeppelin fans. After listening to this CD, I can safely say it is getting all the hype it deserves, maybe even not enough.<br />Though I enjoyed The Song Remains the Same album and film, this blows that out of the water. The sound quality is excellent, this has more to offer, and is just better in every way.<br />This collection of performances from 2 shows in 1972 (June 25th at LA Forum, June 27th at Long Beach Arena) represent Led Zeppelin at their live best. Listening to it makes me wish I had been born early enough to witness Led Zeppelin in concert, and I envy those who were there at those shows, witnessing a night of history. The versions of \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"Dazed & Confused,\\" and \\"Bring It On Home\\" are all at least 10 minutes and are sure to please every Zeppelin fan out there. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is here in all its live glory, containing the medley of covers that extended it to 23+ minutes, pure Zeppelin bliss. As expected, \\"Dazed & Confused\\" features Jimmy Page playing his guitar with the violin bow, and is yet another stellar version of this song to add to our CD collections. The acoustic set here is also present, featuring excellent versions of \\"Going to California,\\" \\"That's The Way,\\" and \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp.\\" The latter was a personal highlight for me, as the song is a tribute to Robert Plant's dog, he calls out the dog's name, Strider, at the end. I also have a dog named Strider, so it's cool that my dog has the same name as the dog of one of my favorite singers (for the same reason too, Plant loved JRR Tolkien, and my dog's name was thought of after seeing Lord of the Rings). The medley of \\"La Drone\\"/\\"Immigrant Song\\" kicks the set off with a bang, and an excellent version of \\"Heartbreaker\\" follows, with Page totally kicking but during his solo, incorporating Bach's \\"Bouree in E Minor\\" into it. There are stellar versions of \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" on here as well. As expected, the 23-minute \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" medley is a definite highlight, as is \\"Dazed and Confused.\\" Drummers are bound to be impressed by the late, great John Bonham's extended drum solo on \\"Moby Dick.\\"<BR>Although the Houses of the Holy album had yet to be released, those in attendence were treated to previews of some of the songs, and the versions of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\" \\"Dancing Days,\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" all kick massive behind. A just-under-10-minute version of \\"Bring It On Home\\" closes off this CD with a bang, and leaving the listener in awe.<br />Also when listening to it, one cannot help but notice how good the sound quality is. Any Zeppelin fan knows that Jimmy Page, producer for all the albums and a key songwriter, settles for nothing but the best, and only that. When Led Zeppelin's catalogue was first released on CD, the sound quality was inferior, so Jimmy Page himself remastered the CDs, showing that he not only cares about the old fans, but the young fans growing in the 90s discovering the group (like this one). With BBC Sessions, Jimmy was in charge of that, and gave us a great sounding album of BBC material. And once again, he has proven his loyalty to the fans (and to himself and his band) and given us an amazing-sounding live record with great material on it. THANKS, JIMMY!!!!!<br />All that said, How the West Was Won is an absolute must-own for any Led Zeppelin fan, no questions asked. If you like Led Zeppelin, you are GUARANTEED to enjoy this. Don't worry about price, because when you hear it, you will know for yourself that this CD is worth its weight in gold. Buy it and enjoy it for a long time to come.<br />5/5
B000089RVX|5.0|the first time i saw evanescence was when i was browsing through one of the many cd departments/stores in town.  since i hadn't paid my cable bill in awhile, and the radio stations down here [are bad]. (the only alternative station was shut down, blleeccckkk!)  i took a look at the cover, read the list of songs and generally assumed it was another female attempt at 21st century folk rock, and dismissed the album.  i realized that i had made a huge mistake when i heard the song \\"bring me to life\\" while staying up late, watching mtv.  i know many have said it's \\"linkin park-ish\\", but it's a new twist on the whole \\"rap rock/epic rock/dark rock\\" genre (or wherever you choose to place it), plus amy lee is an amazing singer. you hear more of a classical (as well as goth, and hard rock) influence in the songs, other than the usual rap beats, and computer blips, which i'm very sure that most of the population is sick of by now.  what really saves it is the haunting true-to-life lyrics that read like a diary of a troubled soul...<BR>quite frankly, i think it's a breath of fresh air from the depth-lessness of preppy rock/neo 60's-70's rock.

We learn that Chris is not just a rebellious young man, but a fascinating individual who is bored with the common way of living.<BR>     Born into a well to do family, everything came easy to Chris.  He got excellent grades in school and was well liked by many.  Chris, however was unique.  Unlike many us, he followed his beliefs and dreams.  It takes a lot of courage to do this, and that's just what Chris had.  <BR>     Krackauer writes about the past two years of Chris's life in immense detail.  Sometimes it might even seem unnecessary, but I think it helps the reader get a greater image and better understanding of the story.  The book is divided into eighteen chapters and only 200 pages long.  It isn't too long or drawn out and keeps the reader interested throughout.<BR>     This book enlightens a different way of thinking and looking at the world and nature.  Anyone who is looking for this and/or for a good adventure with a twist would certainly enjoy Into The Wild.  Other books that I would also recommend, like this, are Into Thin Air by Jon Krackaur and Call of the Wild by Jack London.  Call of the Wild was one of Chris McCandless's favorite novels.
B00007KLJJ|4.0|The movie, imho, is an extended study of the mechanism of small group warfare that was summed up at the end as: we fight not for<br />Queen and Country but for the man on our right. The same thing was determined in VietNam as American soldiers fought for their buddies not for any big ideals, but for the man on their right.<br />I have not read the book, nor seen the earlier versions, nor do the reviews here, nor does the movie motivate me to seek them out and do so. The movie is sufficent thought-fodder for this topic, for me. The central character is not a coward as the reviews here imply but a self-examining person who sees the fear within himself , primarily the fear of letting down his comrades, and deserting his girlfriend. He misinterprets this as cowardice in the face of battle yet follows them into battle, not as a soldier but as an enforced laborer pulling canons up the sand.<br />The brillant character of the huge, very black, very thoughtful Moslem 'messenger-angel' is the person who guides the main character through a series of trials to get to the point where he recognizes and conquerors the demons he is struggling with.<br />In the end he redeems himself on all points and becomes very much like the 'messenger-angel' character in his perceptive. A nice few hours of action, thoughtfulness, historical drama, well recommended.<br />richard williams
B000089RVX|4.0|I bought Evanescence's Fallen based on hearing their single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on the radio.  It reminded me somewhat of Linkin Park (and I'm a huge Linkin Park fan), so I decided to buy it, hoping it would be similar.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The only song that resembles Linkin Park is &quot;Bring Me to Life.&quot;  All of the others are vastly different.<br />On my first listen through, I was extremely disappointed at the lack of the rap/metal mix that I was expecting.  Thankfully, I gave the CD a few more chances, and was I ever rewarded.<br />Evanescence's sound is truly unique and is set apart by Amy Lee's hauntingly beautiful voice.  She lends emotion to every lyric she sings, and her voice is never overshadowed by the musical accompaniment.  The band also shows considerable versatility.  Fallen ranges from melancholy ballads (&quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;Hello&quot;) to angry songs (&quot;Haunted,&quot; &quot;Tourniquet&quot;)<br />Standout Tracks:<BR>&quot;Imaginary&quot;~ The images conjured by the lyrics are stunningly vivid and easy for me to identify with.<BR>&quot;My Last Breath&quot;~ I really just like how this song feels.  The music and vocals mesh especially well here.<BR>&quot;Whisper&quot;~ The monk-like chorus at the end was such a treat!<BR>&quot;My Immortal&quot;~ Sad but oh so beautiful.<br />Bottom Line:  A very worthwhile CD that most music fans should be able to enjoy.  Just don't expect the entire CD to sound like Linkin Park with a girl.  Enjoy!

Johnny Depp [always mercurial, never disappoints] is our slightly bemused hero - searching for the mysterious faux or real occult editions, but which one is 'the brew that is true' ~ now that's a twice told tale ....errr tail ..... very much of sound and fury when stepped on.<br />Great locations, dark, dank European [and New York] settings, and brilliant landscapes - culminating at a delightful old schloss ......<br />Stay with this one - it does have quite everything, from dewy maidens [the stunning Emmanuelle Siegner] to feline brunettes [Lena Olin] ~ including the delightful wheel-chair bound [just for impact] Barbara Jefford and not forgetting the almost over-the-top Frank Langella who really knows how to 'break into' a coven!<br />Sheer delight for the non-conformist ~ takes all the sweat out of spell-casting ~ if that's your bag!<br />Great sound-track too!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I've been a Linkin Park fan since they released \\"In the End,\\" so naturally I excited when I found out about the release of their second album, Meteora.  Once I got my hands on the CD, I couldn't stop listening to it.<br />Yes, it sounds similar to Hybrid Theory, but since when does a band have to completely revolutionize their sound for each album?  Meteora is only similar to Hybrid Theory on the surface.  It has much more musical depth and diversity.  It ranges from the soft/dance-like \\"Breaking the Habit\\" to the hip-hop flavored \\"Hit the Floor\\" to the heavy \\"Lying From You.\\"  The comparatively extensive album notes give info on the writing process behind each song and explain LP's musical goals.<br />The one thing that never ceases to amaze me is the way that Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda so seamlessly blend their vocals.  The transition between the singing and rapping is always smooth and creates a unique sound.  I also love the way that Chester can alternate between singing and screaming and control the feel of the music as he does so.<br />Standout Tracks:<BR>\\"Breaking the Habit\\"~  Strangely enough, this song is almost danceable.<BR>\\"Nobody's Listening\\"~  I love the Japanese flute in the background.<BR>\\"Numb\\"~  The intro sucks you right in and never lets go.<BR>\\"Faint\\"~  Crazy fast intro.<BR>\\"Easier to Run\\"~  I love the rap chorus.<br />Bottom Line:  Even better than the amazing Hybrid Theory.  Give this CD a chance!  You won't regret it.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book!!<BR>To whomever said that this book was \\"creepy\\"...you obviously aren't a parent!<br />This book brings tears to my eyes every time I read it.  It is heartfelt and sweet.<br />Thank you Robert Munsch for a book that touches the hearts of all parents and keeps reminding us that good parenting always pays off!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|I'd never heard of this movie but a friend of mine told me to watch it.  I wasn't expecting much but was instead blown away.  The story is interesting and thought-provoting.  The action sequences are unique and very cool.  It is a sort of Fahrenheit 451 meets Brave New World meets The Matrix.  You have to see this movie.
B000002BBY|4.0|Oasis is much derided as a glorified Beatles cover band. While recognizing the inherent truth in that criticism I still find myself pulling out \\"What's the Story Morning Glory\\" every 6 months or so and giving it a good long listen. I LOVE this album. When surrounded by my more music-savvy friends I feel almost [bad] as I try to hem and haw my way through taunts about the band's derivative song-writing (or song-biting) and Liam's notoriously boorish behavior. Liam may be a drunken lout and the Brothers Gallagher's Beatles OBSESSION may make them fodder for harsh critics, but I am taken away EVERY single time I listen to this CD. And that is the test for me. Do I have a visceral, unintellectualized, honest response to the music. And in this case I do -- unequivocally. And that is why I refuse to apologize for loving this album.<br />4 stars -- not 5 because I DO acknowledge their flaws.
6304510861|5.0|The first thing I couldnt help observing was that Lynch doesnt make movies to please the conformistic and intellectually un-stimulated audiences. Very rarely do you find people who take their work to a level where they do not genuinely bother about the impending financial ramifications of their art. <br />The brilliance of Lynch lies in capturing a distinct post-modernistic aura while not heeding to that familiarly compulsive habit of modern day directors to opt for stereotyped symbolism or complicated logic, but concentrating instead on surrealistic visual images that nevertheless are immensely appealing to any mature viewer with a broader sense of aesthetics. Those who find it hard to appreciate his highly refined sensibilities and harp merely on the obviosly chaotic storyline are not appreciating his art in a holistic manner.<br />IMO, this is much better than his later work, Mulholland Drive, in terms of the sheer delightful lushness of the situations, the adept and smooth pacing and last but not the least, the inimitably stylized nature of his direction. Therefore, it surely is a must see for all open minded, critical minded movie buffs.
B00003CXSM|2.0|I decided to watch this movie after being told by a friend that I was too hard on J-Lo. \\"She can sing! Sort of...\\" I was told. After I grimaced and pretended to vomit I was told \\"She's a better actress than she is a singer!\\" Not much of a recommendation, I remember thinking. However, feeling that perhaps I WAS being too hard on \\"Jenny from the block\\" I decided to go into the viewing of this movie with an open mind. \\"Out of Sight\\" is one of your favorite movies, I kept telling myself. So with good intentions and an open mind I decided to watch \\"The Wedding Planner.\\" <br />Absolute rubbish. That is how I would describe this movie. It was astoundingly bad. Miss Lopez' comedic timing is simply non-existent and her acting is filled with SO MUCH EFFORT that one grows physically weaker with each contortion of her face. The brand of physical comedy that Sandra Bullock consistently NAILS falls abysmally flat in this dud. Matthew McConaughey (sp?) was adequately charming but he's not going to be an Oscar candidate any time soon either. However, in fairness to the actors and their limitations, the script should have been used to potty train someone's German Sheperd. Same old, same old; but somehow worse, and more hackneyed than I thought possible.<br />In summary: bad script + bad acting = bad movie.<br />Instead of \\"The Wedding Planner\\" see \\"Miss Congeniality\\" or \\"Legally Blonde\\" intelligently done farcical comedies. Or if your truly want to see GREAT romantic comedy check out the Audrey Hepburn classics: \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", \\"Sabrina\\" and \\"Roman Holiday\\".<br />2 stars: If its on late at night on basic cable, give it a go. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of the past several years. I can't recall laughing so hard in a theater as I did during this picture, as the plot twists and imaginative humor had me captivated from start to finish.<br />I know there are certain expectations when a movie has the Disney name behind it--Bambi, Snow White, Pinocchio. But look at the recent trend--Lion King has some irreverent, even self-mocking moments, and The Emperor's New Groove is very different than traditional Disney family movies. So L &amp; S goes a little further, with a combo sci-fi/Hawaii/non-traditional family theme.<br />Regarding the animation, I immediately saw the connection with the colors and impressions of Hawaii and Polynesia as portrayed by Gaugin and other artists. I'm not saying the movie was trying to be artsy, but as a yearly vacation-goer I've always noticed the distinctive, vivid colors of Hawaii, and the movie definitely captured those images. So critics of the animation are probably expecting something like previous Disney efforts. But visit Kauai's Hanalei Bay which I think was the inspiration for this movie and you'll see what the filmmakers were shooting for.<br />The potential knock on this movie is the situation with Lilo's family, where she's about ready to fall into care of the state for various reasons. This is definitely not funny and it's questionable material for a family comedy. In the end, however, a family is formed, albeit with a few aliens and Cobra Bubbles as part of it, which is a defense for non-traditional families. My adopted daughter often feels different and an outsider, so I definitely could relate to Lilo's perspective on the world.<br />Finally, I haven't read many reviews that commented on the music. The songs in this movie are outstanding and also help capture the feeling of the islands. It was totally reminiscent of local Hawaiians surfing and swimming in the ocean as if it's a part of them, which it probably is.<br />So between the far-out humor, great scenes and music of Hawaii, and relating to Lilo's character, I'd have to say this is a 5-star movie all the way.
B000089RVX|4.0|I haven't written a review in a very long time now, (Probably over a year) but I was inspired to share my opinion on a great new band that has some solid potential. Evanescence has, probably, one of the best overall sounds I've heard in a &quot;new&quot; band in quite a while. While the music does sound comparable to Linkin Park (who I also like) - The Vocals and overall feel of the album is something unique and exciting. I'll do a quick breakdown of the songs:<br />Going Under: One of the best songs on the album without a doubt. Surprising and interesting at every turn. Very Original. 5/5<br />Bring Me To Life: The song most people know them by. Maybe a little over played on the radio, but a great song none-the-less. And the song that got me interested in them to begin with. 4.5/5<br />Everybody's Fool: A solid song that expands you a little deeper into the sound of the band. 4/5<br />My Immortal: A haunting and beautiful song. Amy's voice sends chills up my spine. 4.5/5<br />Haunted: A great song. Dark and eerie, may incite thought and contemplation. 4.5/5<br />Tourniquet: Awesome song. (Though the lyrics are a little on the strange side) Great Melody. 4/5<br />Imaginary: This song has a great transfer from the previous song and is a solid effort as well. Both these songs together make for a great 8 minute excursion. 4/5<br />Taking Over Me: Best Song on the Disc (in my opinion). Played this one over and over again. All around great melody, chorus and the music is outstanding. 5/5<br />Hello: A little strange on this one, but another solid effort. Amy's voice once again, shines on this one. 4/5<br />My Last Breath: A Good song. Probably the &quot;average song&quot; of the record, if that makes any sense. 4/5<br />Whisper: Now, surprisingly this was my least favorite song on the album. The end of the song is a little out there and while I like the music and the vocals, it seemed to lose me towards the end and seemed a little lacking in the melodies and lyrics. 3.5/5<br />Overall, a solid 4/5. While I do see the validity of a comparison to Linkin Park and bands of the like, I must express that I feel this band still manages to have a unique sound that I really enjoyed. Simply, a breath of fresh air.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I bought the CD and DVD today (the day it was released) and I've got to tell you I'm truly blown away. So far I'm about 2 hours into the 5+ hour dvd and it really has exceeded my expectations. At 20 years old I'm a bit too young to have seen Zeppelin in concert so I'm really happy to see a definitive live complilation come out. Thus far the highlight has been Dazed and Confused which takes full effect of the DVD surround sound effects, everytime Page slides up the neck the sound shifts to the rear speakers which really adds to the whole experience. Overall the sound quality is amazing and the picture is not bad considering it was mostly shot on 16mm and the film wasnt properly stored for all these years. The 2 disc set also comes with 2 really nice pamphlets (one for each disc) which go into detail on how this concert footage was restored and edited. I've rated alot of things on Amazon but until now I've never felt the need to write a full review which I think says it all. This DVD is well worth the money and any true Zeppelin fan should own it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Heehee I love this cd!! it's just great!! Even though Alyson Hannigan can't sing, she makes a valiant effort and judging by other reviews makes one of the biggest impressions!! Tony Head is per usual singing amazingly, what a voice! James Marsters had me giggling a fair bit as well! However, fair play to Sarah Michelle Gellar and Emma Caulfield who I personally think were better than Amber Benson. Yes she can sing but her voice is just too falsetto and grating to listen to often. However, Gellar's natural singing voice had a vulnerable, untrained quality which I felt perfectly encapsulated the place her character was in at that stage of the show. Caulfield's Bunnies song was just too surreal and funny to be believed! Nicholas Brendon was admirable as well. I WISH DAWN WOULD SHUT UP but that's nothing new. as for the songs, i loved virtually all of them. favourites include 'standing' which is just so touching, 'walk through the fire' which starts out hauntingly and progresses nicely, 'we're together' (hey ive died twice!), 'I'll never tell' and 'rest in peace.' that's not criticsing the others though, they're almost all fantastic. however, undisputed highlight of the whole thing has to be the grr argh monster at the end!! I would personally recommend you buy the DVD of this episode instead of the CD but as for quality, this cd is just so wacky and surreal, YOU MUST BUY IT!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|I can't believe I'm going to say this, but Zeppelin is even better than I realized. That's a bold claim from a huge Zeppelin fan. <br />The music here is culled from two shows in Long Beach and LA to create a single concert.  The set list covers the classic (to that date) Zeppelin songs plus a few from the soon-to-be-released Houses of the Holy.  Jimmy Page's solos are blistering.  The solo in Heartbreaker has a few different segments, one of which catches Jimmy getting funky... well, as funky as Pagey could get!  Robert Plant sounds fantastic.  He sounds better here on Going to California than on the original.  John Bonham is absolutely overpowering.  Don't take that to mean he's just hammering the kit (though he is).  He was also quite deft and stunningly fast.  (Check out the DVD to see him in action.) And Bonham's wing man on the rhythm team, John Paul Jones, is great.  Very melodic and also excellent at carrying the load when Pagey goes into a solo.  <br />The medley on Whole Lotta Love is worth the price of admission alone.  Over the Hills and Far Away and Bring It On Home are also tremendous.  Well, all the songs are actually so why go into it.... <br />Enjoy the music... Zeppelin as they were meant to be heard -- live.....
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie is excellent. The story line is great and shows that sometimes you get what you wish for, so be very careful.
B00003CX9E|1.0|What a waste of money! No widescreen, Dolby 5.1 Surround, and it's in black and white. In the scene in which Kane goes after political boss Jim W. Geddes, he just stops on the stair landing -- it would have been a lot cooler if he pushed him down the stairs.<br />There's very little action in this movie, just a lot of talk, talk, talk about Kane. There's sort of a plot, which is about finding out what &quot;Rosebud&quot; means. Then, at the end of the movie, you only find out it's his sled. Huh? I watched two hours of this tedious and pretentious nonsense to find out he misses his sled?<br />Save your hard-earned money, and watch &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded&quot; instead!
B00005JMFR|5.0|absolutly out of this world, great movie that brings you out of the universe and logic you think you know...must see movie and have to be seen again and again. very deep...
B00008PX8P|4.0|Well, I just watched a 2-hour preview of this DVD release and I must say it was fantastic. Although it did have some spots that were, well, less than satisfactory. These were scenes that could best be described as being shot by someone who just got their first video camera. Constant zooming in and out, fast panning back and forth, constant in and out of focus, etc., all inflict a dizzying sense of vertigo. Some of the video also shows its age, but hey, its 30 years old or so. All is forgiven, however by the overall experience. Having watched this preview in a movie theater setting, with full 5.1 sound, I was sucked into the altered reality of actually being at a live concert. I guess I sat a bit close, but it was like an IMAX Zep concert. Whoah! It was interesting watching the band members appearance change over time as the footage spans several years. My favorite so far is In My Time of Dying. I am buying this DVD just for that performance. I can't even describe it. For me, everything else is a bonus. I could go on, but there's no need. Zeppelin fans don't need reviews. If you're too young to remember, get this DVD and you can &quot;experience&quot; some of the power that was Led Zeppelin live in concert.
B00008973Q|5.0|Ran (literally \\"Madness\\" or \\"Chaos\\"), legendary director Akira Kurosawa's 27th of 30 films, is a masterpiece on every level, with sequences ranging from one of the most overwhelming battles ever filmed to intimate scenes which begin with ritualistic formality but then erupt into volcanic passion. Kurosawa spent ten years meticulously preparing every detail of, and scouring the world for funding for, this magnum opus, a free adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear transposed to sixteenth century feudal Japan.<br />Kurosawa brings an uncanny balance of psychological insight, thematic density, and visual/aural mastery to his reinvention of Lear. He gives us a developed backstory for Hidetora (although some would argue that Shakespeare's Lear is so dominating a presence, both on the throne and in madness, that he does not need more of a personal history). Tatsuya Nakadai's performance as Hidetora is, in a word, overwhelming. He brings out all of his character's pathos despite the traditional Noh makeup which Kurosawa has only this one actor wear. He begins with a fierce visage resembling the traditional demon mask, \\"Akijo,\\" but as he descends into madness, his deeply-lined face and red-rimmed eyes tellingly suggest \\"Shiwajo,\\" the sorrowing old man spirit forced to wander the earth to pay for his sins. What might have been a mere distancing technique in a lesser filmmaker is here shattering, as we are constantly reminded both of Hidetora's artifice and heartbreaking humanity.<br />Kurosawa also made an intriguing decision not only to expand the role of the Fool into a major character (here named named Kyoami), but to make him both sexually ambiguous and totally beguiling. He is played by the Japanese transgender pop star known simply as Peter. Kyoami is, in a way, the healing opposite of the chaos (\\"Ran\\") of the title, as he balances both masculine and feminine energy, great courage as well as flexibility and tenderness. As we see, those qualities are especially importantin a rigidly hierarchical society, founded on macho posturing, like the one disastrously promulgated by Hidetora.<br />Kurosawa's other major addition is Lady Kaede (brilliantly played by Mieko Harada), who exists as a sort of demonic opposite to Kyoami. Although based on Shakespeare's Goneril, she is a much more complex and important character in the film. Her unstoppable vengeance brings down Hidetora's entire family, first as the wife of Jiro the second son, then as the mistress of Taro, the eldest son. Without giving away some of the film's most dramatic plot revelations, let it be noted that what Hidetora did to Lady Kaede's parents, years earlier, provides the reason for her unwavering hatred.<br />Kurosawa is a visual master - although some people find his style, especially in the later films (including Ran), austere. But for me, his use of image and sound is exceptionally revealing about his subjects and theme. Look at Ran's opening shot. Despite the stillness of four horsemen, on a hill, waiting in motionless silence, there are intense visual dynamics: The contrast of earth and sky, the severely limited number of planes (this effect was created by using a telephoto lens and shooting a great distance from the actors), the tension produced - despite the bright full sunlight - by having each of the riders staring in a completely different direction (plus there was the added mystery of not knowing what they are searching for so intently, since we are not yet aware that they are on a boar hunt). This one image sets up the entire film, both visually and dramatically: Those four warlords, standing at sharp right angles, will soon pull apart not only each other but their entire world.<br />For a stunning contrast, look at the overtly dynamic first battle, which some people consider the greatest war sequence ever shot (it has inspired many pictures since, including the opening of Saving Private Ryan). Kurosawa films the battle with total silence, except for Toru Takemitsu's haunting score. He makes us view the carnage from a detached, almost omniscient point of view, then suddenly thrusts a new atrocity into the frame. The overwhelming power of this sequence is compounded by the deliberate, ritualistic pacing of the scenes which have preceded it.
076790592X|4.0|I found this book very well written and especially interesting because it is a true story.  Morrie's advice should be heeded by all.  The way it can relate to anyone seems almost coincidental.  However, this kind of touching story is just not my cup of tea.   I guess I'm just not the sentimental type.  Maybe I need a little suspense.
B000089RVX|4.0|This cd has a great musical quality and the voice is amazing. One thing that makes this cd suffer is the uniqueness of the singer's voice. After two songs the cd begins to run one song into another. (think sarah mclaughlin and norah jones..one song sounds the same as the next despite different lyrics.)<br />This is a defect of great musical ability and unique sound. Just don't use the unique sound over and over. Otherwise you create that run on effect.<br />I do recommend.
B00005JLD4|4.0|RABBIT PROOF FENCE illustrates a piece of Australian history that I, as an American, knew nothing about.  From 1931 to 1970, the aborigines were under the \\"guardianship\\" of a British bureaucrat, with the particular idea of separating \\"half-caste\\" aborigines from their full-blooded parents and putting them in a home so they could learn how to be servants and low-wage employees.<br />We follow three girls (aged 8-14) who are separated from their homes and placed in this camp some 1200 miles away.  Molly, the oldest girl, who is quite clever and spirited, leads the three on a daring escape and journey back to their home.  Their journey is amazing, because the endure lengthy hardships in the desert, little food, and the treachery of some adults they meet who try to turn these famous refugees over to authorities.  <br />They do meet help along the way too, but always they have to be wary of anyone they run into.  The movie has flashes of humor, beautiful scenery and some heart-wrenching scenes.  <br />Kenneth Branagh plays Neville, the bureaucrat, and is the only \\"star\\" in the movie.  His part is quite small...he handles it well, but it is NOT his movie.  The movie belongs to these three inexperienced actresses, who were \\"discovered\\" by director Philip Noyce and put to work in these tricky parts.  And they pull it off so well.  They are all outstanding at conveying their sense of fear, of outrage, or courage and they have a certain stillness that shows how reserved they feel around these white strangers who have uprooted them.<br />The movie is not exactly fast-paced, but I found it fascinating all the way through.  It quietly draws us in, because we are rooting for the lead characters.<br />The fact that this is a TRUE story (we meet some of the main characters towards the end) makes it all the more riveting.  It's one of those rare films that completely educates you about an obscure but important part of history, but entirely through the power of great storytelling.  We never feel we are \\"learning,\\" yet at the end of the movie, you want to go find out more about this time in history.<br />The movie is rated PG, but might not be very interesting to kids under 11 or so.  A recommended experience!<br />(By the way, the bonus feature on the DVD about the making of the film is outstanding.  So often, these little features are nearly worthless, but we spend 40 minutes learning how the kids were discovered and trained.  It is absolutely fascinating, and in my opinion, after watching the film, you should immediately watch the featurette!!!)
B000005RS0|5.0|This is Tina's first album after leaving Ike and going solo. It is an absolutely fantastic album with so much energy and is so much better than anything she did with Ike Turner.<br />1) I Might Have Been Queen<BR>A great track and this one puts you in the mood for the rest of the album!<BR>2) What's Love Got To Do With It<BR>This is statistically her most successful single, and if you listen to it you'll realise why, it's the best song on the album.<BR>3) Show Some Respect<BR>I think the name says it all. <br />4) I Can't Stand The Rain<BR>Another of her biggest hits, not one of my favourites but still a good one.<BR>5) Private Dancer<BR>The title track is the second best song on the album, with Tina's powerful vocals this song stands out.<BR>6) Let's Stay Together<BR>This version is so much better than Al Green's original and was Tina's first single release off the album.<BR>7) Better Be Good To Me<BR>Again, a strong track, not the best but still good.<BR>8) Steel Claw<BR>I love this track, it's great!<BR>9) Help<br />Probably the third best song on the album, a beautiful mellow song with lots of feeling.<BR>10) 1984<BR>This is the one and only track on this album that I don't like!<BR>11) I Wrote A Letter<BR>Another gooden!<BR>12) Rock N Roll Widow<BR>I really like this track, Tina's vocals are great on it.<BR>13) Don't Rush The Good Things<BR>Another great song!<BR>14) When I Was Young<BR>This track is great and the last one on the album (if you don't count the extended versions)<br />The extended versions of &quot;What's Love Got To Do With It&quot;, &quot;Better Be Good To Me&quot; and &quot;I Can't Stand The Rain&quot; aren't as good as the normal versions but they're still good.<br />I'd highly recommend this album whether you're a Tina Turner fan or not because it's just so great. The only Tina album that is better than this is her &quot;Simply The Best&quot; greatest hits album!
B00006F83Y|4.0|I won't call this the best thing ever, but there's no doubt that \\"Queens of the Stoneage\\" rock, and make alot of other bands look lame. Cool name too. I like that lyric in \\"Go with the flow\\" that says, \\"I want something good to die for, to make it beautiful to live\\". When I think of comparisons I think of \\"The Atomic Bitchwax\\", \\"Screaming Trees\\", on the songs Mark Lanegan sings on, obviously \\"Kyuss\\", and it faintly has the power and smarts of early \\"Soundgarden\\". These guys also seem to have a good sense of humor. Get the version with the DVD if you can. It's good. Lastly, all of the buzz surrounding the band makes more sense when you have one.
B00000255X|4.0|These tracks aren't as anthemic or immediately accessible as some of Bob Dylan's more familiar classics, so it takes some time for them to sink in. Hurricane is a torrent of a song in what sounds to me a stream-of-consciousness style, whilst Isis is likewise dense and profound, quite an epic with vivid imagery. Mozambique has a lovely melody and a lilting tropical beat, and is the only song here that exudes joy and happiness. Closest to his earlier folk style, Oh Sister is introspective, heartfelt and moving. Romance In Durango is the tragic story of an outlaw fleeing from the law but not making it and saying his farewells to his wife and child - it has a beautiful soaring Spanish chorus and a vaguely Latin flavour. Black Diamond Bay is a powerful and intense rock ballad whilst the autobiographical Sara makes reference to Dylan's earlier song Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands; it's a flowing conversational ballad with lots of charm. The musical and lyrical variety on Desire ensures a captivating listening experience. I think this album holds up well in Dylan's great body of work. Perhaps not one of his top 5 albums, but a work of enduring value containing at least four classic songs.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Great movie if you like I would recomend the original I personally thought it was better.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent's hardcore sensibilites and \\"post-bling\\" lyrics, combined with the production talents of Dr. Dre and Eminem, threaten to make most current commercial rap obsolete.  50 strikes a balance between representing his true self and reaching out for commercial acceptance, with songs like \\"In Da Club,\\" \\"P.I.M.P.,\\" \\"Don't Push Me,\\" and \\"21 Questions.\\"<br />My favorite track is the last, \\"Life's On The Line.\\" This track sums up the rage, uncertainty, and conversely, self-assurance that is 50 Cent, and makes this CD work as a whole.  It certainly will have hip-hop heads that saw the hit track \\"Wangsta\\" as wack and commercial change their view on mainstream hip-hop's latest hitmaker.  If you like this style of music, buy this without hesitation.

0380789035|5.0|Originality in writing is something that has been forsaken in writing it seems. Rarely do we get a story where original, colorful, intriguing characters are intoduced. Writers manage to churn out the basic cop story or formula fantasy novel week after week, but rarely seem to breathe any fresh air into the writing medium. Gaiman is truly an exception to this trend, in American Gods he has created a story that is reasonably believable, but at the same time manages to pull you into an intricate mythical world. Even if you hate fantasy this book will entertain you from start to finish.

B00008PX8P|2.0|As a zepp fan who has collected audio bootlegs over the years I must say that this is a dissapointing dvd. When you read the liner notes you will see they didn't have the luxury of choosing the best of what they had, rather what barely survived. The song remains the same is a better concert video and the highlight of the dvd is the outake of the ocean from song. Song is tighter and has less of plant ruining the song with add lib gibberish. Don't get your hopes too high, or rather wait and buy it next week in a used cd store.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I like the cd it wan't her best work. I think it is another example of Madonna as great artist and shrew business women. She is doing what she does best selling her music through controversy and actual musical talent.
0060536969|5.0|Just when you think Michael Crichton has written his best work, he comes up with an even more fascinating topic.<BR> <BR>I have been interested in the possibilities of nanotechnology since the late 80's when I read a book by Drexler called \\"Engines of Creation\\".  Crichton has taken this idea and coupled it with some of the latest ideas in Computer Networking theory to produce an exciting, fast-paced, nightmare of a book.  I read it in one day.  I especially loved Crichton's editorial comments explaining the scientific concepts including actually providing the code that the programmers where concerned about.<br />I'm just grateful that Crichton continues to aim his books at his most loyal audience.  Those who actually \\"get\\" what he's talking about.  Its refreshing to read Sci-Fi that is based at least partially on some scientific premise rather than the more commercial \\"And then it happened Automagically!\\" approach.

B00000F169|1.0|I have seen this movie in the theaters and I thought this movie was bad-bad-bad. It does not belong on a dvd. Putting it on a dvd is a waste. The dvd format is to0 good to be wasted on this movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|<BR>After viewing this puppy, Instantly, I was hooked. I put disc 2 in because I heard all the hype over the years about the Earls Court concert. I stated with the immigrant song and was blown away. Next, I went to the madison Square garden Concert wich has 2 tracks from the Song Remains the same (wich dissapointed me a bit) but the song The Ocean ROCKED!!! One of my favorites on the entire dvd. In My Time of dying on the earls court was absolutely fabulous along with all the acoustical gigs was also awesome. But Perhaps, my favorite was from the Royal albert hall. Please keep in mind that I have never seen any of this footage besides the Song remains the same, and this albert Hall left me dazed!!<BR>Overall, this is an awesome dvd collection to own with over 5 hours of footage. If you are a Zep fan as I am and have never seen any other footage, you will total enjoy this!! I promise.<BR>Rock and Roooooooooollll!!!!!!
B000002LK1|5.0|Well i can only agree with the other reviewers,this cd is DM' s masterwork.It IS simply an 80's masterwork from the beginning till the end ,truly excellent.Sound quality is superb.I listen on audiophile gear and this cd really draws you into the music,due to excellent songs,but also due to excellent studio work ,no harsh drumcomputers here,only good vocals and warm synths,the atmosphere and feeling of the songs are great,sometimes you can almost feel like Dave Graham is lying on a couch down singing,things like that..good music has to communicate with the listener..mostly i only reach that level with jazz and classical pieces.<BR>This cd just does what every recording should do..draw you into it,and this CD does it all(even for non synth pop or non DM fans)..
B00008PX8P|5.0|I had the rare privilage of being at the premier of the dvd at loews theater in NYC last night and the footage was beyond words. Being to young to have seen the band perform together, (i saw Plant open for the who this summer at Madison Square Garden though)this footage is the closest thing i have to knowing the brilliance that is Led Zeppelin. To make things even better, the band held a VIP party after the screening to sign autographs( I got Plant and Jonesy, Page came and went to fast) and greet old friends and industry people. I can now say I talked and took pictures with living legends. All in all the band was brilliant then and they are still larger than life now. The DVD is a must have whether you saw them perform back in the day of have never seen them perform but wish you could have. I hope the rumors are true and they decide to tour within the next few years.
0393057658|5.0|As an amateur Sabrmetrician and devotee of Baseball Prospectus, I was very excited to hear of Michael Lewis' book &quot;Moneyball.&quot; I've always admired the A's of the contemporary small-market days and how they are comprehensively a better team (except in power) than my own Texas Rangers, who have almost bottomless pockets.<br />I was not aware of Beane's playing career and found that part of the book particularly interesting. Lewis seems to indicate that much of what has motivated Beane to utilize a sabrmetrically-based approach to baseball are his own demons from his playing career.<br />Whatever the reason for the A's (and now Jays) systems of operations, the results speak for themselves. Hopefully the rest of the league will be as flinty and resistant as they have so far so we can see the dinosaurs taken to the cleaners a few more years before they are rendered extinct.
0767821629|1.0|I'm all about action movies, and this is nothing like what I thought it would be judging by the preview. I thought there was gonna be action like the matrix. I don't know why people compare it to the matrix, it was about as exciting as watching one of those &quot;mattress giant&quot; commercials. So if you're gonna get this movie, I would also recommend Battlefield Earth and Galaxy Quest.
B00005JLT5|3.0|... yaaawwwn... how much more Holocaust brutality \\"stock footage\\" must we be subjected to before we become totally desensitized to it?  This subject has become its own genre. It's sad that this horrible moment in history has been reduced to cliche and used as \\"Oscar-Bait\\" by Hollywood.  We seem to get at least one main stream or indy flick a year dedicated to this... and AMAZINGLY, most all get an Oscar nomination(s) of some kind.  <BR>  <BR>I'm giving this film 3 stars for three reasons (1) Brody, he wears that haunting look exceedingly well (2)Cinematography and (3) Polanski gets a point for DARING by following a passive character whose sole purpose in the film is self-preservation.  I suppose he was destined to make this film due to his own personal history, but an Oscar nomination?  It's interesting that he decided against one that was autobiographical.  At any rate despite Brody's best effort (and a good one at that), I felt less inspired and more manipulated.<br />True story or not, I struggled to stay awake in this one.  I managed to do so for most of the film by counting the number of wanton, random and impersonal atrocities used liberally by Polanski in getting his point across.  I lost count around 30...
B00005JKCH|3.0|This movie had a good comic book feel and the characters were very likable but parts were a little over the top and I found myself laughing!  Something to check out anyway.  It is still entertaining and fun to watch!

B00006RU5B|5.0|I've been a huge fan of both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden since highschool back in the mid-90s. But listening to Audioslave is like having the best of both worlds. Chris Cornell's powerful and energetic voice blends well with Tom Morello's electrifying, 'how-the-heck-did-he-do-that?' guitars. This is one album you can listen over and over to. <br />My favorites in the album are 'Set it Off' (crazy guitar sounds courtesy of Morello), 'Shadow of the Sun', 'Getaway Car'(Laid back music) and 'I Am the Highway' besides the popular 'Concise', 'Like a Stone' and 'Show Me How To Live'. <br />I would recommend this album to anybody who wants to hear a classic rock band! Simply put... Rockershhh!!!

0316548189|5.0|Nelson Mandela's autobiography, LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is simply incredible! The casual style of writing is very efficient. Nelson speaks simply, hooking readers from the very beginning. To imagine a 600+ political memoir, one predicts a strenuous read with long, dull spots. This does not prove true in the case of LONG WALK TO FREEDOM. Nelson's epic tale flows at a very fast pace, and at times, is so vastly entertaining, that it actually feels fictitious. The story of Nelson's life is truly unbelievable. An awe-inspiring tale of one man's struggle, both inner and political. Recommended to everyone (that can read)!

B000002KCC|4.0|If you don't like Neil Young, you won't like this album. And if you do like Neil Young, you will understand there was a reason for this record.  Yes, amoung his collection, like this LP, there are songs I don't listen to as much: but I always listen to the guitar playing and especially to the all the music. Mr. Young has a point of view and he is a master of self expression; musically and lyrically. Anyone who records a song like Albuquerque is someone I'd like to ride-along with anytime.
B000002HMH|5.0|If any band besides Metallica had released \\"Load,\\" it would have been hailed as a masterpiece by everyone.  But many fell into the trap of comparing it to past releases.  Of course, if you want every album to be as hard and fast as \\"Master of Puppets,\\" everything else in Metallica's catalog will fall short (\\"St. Anger\\" is supposedly a return to hard, fast music).  If you look at this objectively, it's an amazingly strong set of 14 songs.  You have many genres covered, from southern boogie to ballads to Sabbath-esque dirges.  Sure, the tempos are slower than the past, but any extreme form of music can't be repeated for very long without seeming silly.  Plus, seeing family guys in their 30's trying to emulate their youth is not a pleasant sight.  If Metallica released an album of reggae music, I'd buy it because it would be high quality, regardless of the genre.  As Shakespeare himself once said, \\"Comparisons are odious,\\" so don't dismiss this or any other album before hearing it objectively.  You'll miss out on some amazing music!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I am so excited about this new release. EXCELLENT concert footage, interesting artistic film techniqes. It really makes you feel like you were right there at the show. Through the two discs you watch the band grow and change, and hear improvisations and altered versions of the songs we all love. Any Zeppelin fan NEEDS this!!!
B00004BZ16|5.0|Buying this 36 track CD is akin to buying the collected works of Will Shakespeare.  It might take you a lifetime to get through, but you'll be richly rewarded if you do.  Just like Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, which cover many different styles, so too The Clash's music here has a little bit of everything.  Like Will's works, you might not like everything, but the overall effect is powerful.  While I frequently marvel over how many amazing works Shakespeare produced, I also frequently am dumbfounded with how many styles these guys were able to master.  What other band in history can touch rap, reggae, Motown, punk, jazz, country and electronica (and that's just on CD 1) with such authority.  Any way you listen to this, whether it's all the way through, or just pick a few songs at a time, your life will be undoubtedly richer for the experience.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have probably watched the other stuff (SRtS) hundreds of times over the years.  This is like a breadth of fresh air blown into the market at a great time.  I was somewhat disappointed, though, that these guys were in New York on the release and I did not find an opportunity to meet them - One of those lifelong dreams.  Jimmy - if you see this... thank you for the autograph photo you sent to my son!<br />Anyway.... Get this.  Get two or three.  Get one for the cat and one or two for the grandparents.  Get one for the mailman and meter reader.  If you are a Zep fan (and how could anyone not be) - you really need to check this out.  <br />God bless these guys. Thanks Jimmy, John, and Robert (and John B.) for the years of great invocation and for pushing the envelope so many times every time they took to the stage!
B000002H33|5.0|I remember when this was released in the spring of 1986.  I had read about Metallica in metal magazines, but actually hadn't heard them, since radio wouldn't touch them and they hadn't yet made a video.  After reading so much good press about their third album, I took a chance and bought &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot;  It was one of the safest investments I ever made, since this album is one of those perfect recordings.  From the opening acoustic guitar of &quot;Battery&quot; to the ending sprint of &quot;Damage Inc.&quot;, I was hooked.  Surprisingly, my original cassette of this still plays, but the lyrics inside are smudged beyond recognition.  I remember playing &quot;Battery&quot; for a friend of mine, and she said that the acoustic guitar was nice, but it scared her when the song got heavy!!  That was all the validation that I needed to love it.
0385504209|3.0|In reality, this book was just Angels and Demons, with the onl difference being that the Holy Grail was substituted for the Illuminati.<br />I'll give Brown a 5 star rating for having the courage and the creativeness to plug in very constroversial topics into a murder/conspiracy setting. It takes a lot of guts to have book presented to the general public in which you clearly get the author's opinion as to the divinity of Christ and whether he married and reproduced. So kudos to Brown for the guts and for the ingenuity to translate this \\"theory\\" into a fictionalized setting such that the general public finds it more plausible. If I was a real conspiracy nut, I would guess that Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci code was a \\"testing of the waters\\" as to public reception, and keep the concept of New World Order (Angels and Demons), and blood decendant of Jesus (Da Vinci Code), moderately acceptable in the public mind.<br />In any event, Brown is clearly not an eloquent writer. Rather, his appeal lies in the simplicity of his message and the simplicity of the conveyance of his message. The research could have been a little deeper, and frankly it was way too transparent as to how this was going to turn out. I guess overall if you are looking for something intellectual and think you are getting an intellectual thriller---you're not. If you are looking for fun and something new--I would give this a 4 or 5 star rating--I just had a different expectation level when I bought the book
B00005JLT5|5.0|It's very funny for a Polish citizen to read about the ruins where Szpilman was hiding (eg. \\"among the ruins of the Warsaw ghetto\\"). It prooves that many people haven't seen this picture with enough attention.<BR>Szpilman has been hiding on the so called \\"aryan\\" side of the wall since his escape from the Ghetto.<BR>He has been watching the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto (April 19 May 18, 1943) from the window of an \\"aryan\\" house. During the Warsaw uprising (August 1 - October 5, 1944, about 200 000 Polish victims) he has been hiding at an \\"aryan\\" apartment, then in ruins of a hospital occupied prevoiusly by the Wehrmaht, and finally in a house where he has met the \\"good\\" German officer.<BR>The sea of ruins you can see on the screen while he is going down the ruined street - it was just Warsaw, not its part - the Ghetto. In fact, the Ghetto has been destroyed yet in 1943.<BR>Warsaw as the capital city of Poland was destroyed in 95% in result of the WWII. <br />In my opinion the movie is a masterpiece. Polanski didn't even try to make this picture more sophisticated or studied. He has tried to show the Szpilman's story (and, somehow, his own) as accurately and exactly as possible, without any fireworks. And he was right - this movie looks almost like a documentary. And that is why its power and impact is even bigger.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Man, this movie was good! I mean, seriously, it was truly a great movie. Not often does a movie do as good a job as X-Men 2 in telling an intriguing and compelling storyline replete with great special effects and (if you know your X-Men 101) great characters and character development.<br />just the introduction of Nightcrawler was better than any  action sequence in the entire  X-Men 1 film. And also the cohesion and teamwork of the mutants is much more on display...<BR> Storm and Jean Grey working together on assigment to track down the elusive Nightcrawler - Wolverine engaging in true solo-action wetwork - Rogue and Iceman piloting the Lockheed for a dramatic rescue - Cyclops and Jean Grey dueling in a laser-show battle - Mystique securing Magneto's escape from his plastic prison - Nightcrawler teleporting himself and Storm through an impregnable barrier - and much more acts of heroism, derring-do and teamwork.<br />The one and only thing I questioned was why the X-Men did not rescue the weird green-and-blue-eyed, wheel-chair bound, mind-controlling, son-of-Stryker little mutant from what had to be certain death. Even if he did almost make Professor X kill every mutant on earth, and then alternatively, every human on earth I still think the X-Men should have rescued him (was his name Cypher in the comic book..? I can't remember).<br />And X-Men 2 had to have some of the best fore-shadowing of things to come in X-Men 3. I have a suspicion that the next arch-foe of the X-Men could quite possibly be none other than the entity so powerful she could destroy every galaxy in the universe, and then the universe itself... Dark Phoenix.<br />And in X-Men 3 prepare for another team member to join... the big and cuddly Russian farmboy COLOSSUS! When Colossus made his brief onscreen appearance I jumped out of my seat I was so excited! Talk about good teamwork, wait until you see Wolverine and Colossus pair up to do the Fast-Ball Special!

0066214122|1.0|How do I hate \\"Prey:a Novel\\"?----let me count the ways.<br />1) Michael Crichton's tale of nanotechnology is crammed full of filler and fluff; indeed, the first 1/3 of the book (sadly the best part) has nothing to do with nanotechnology, and everything to do with our protagonist Jack's life of house-husbandry and slowly (ever so....slowly) crumbling marriage. Even the *title* of the book is fluffy, for pity's sake: \\"Prey: a Novel\\"???? A Novel? As distinguished from what, \\"Prey: a Coloring Book\\"?<br />2) Fluff, if it's well-written, can be good, if it is used in the service of a higher goal and the novel pays off. Sadly, the novel does not. In a nutshell, the plot: Jack, unemployed computer programmer and devoted house-husband of Julia, worries (for 1/3 of the book) about his fraying marriage, and Julia's increasing distraction and strange behavior.<br />You see, Julia, a senior executive of biotech start-up Xymos, is evincing the signs of a woman having an affair. She's distracted, she's cranky, she's irritable, she's distant, she works late and takes a shower when she gets home---and she's starting to really shape up! After his wife's car accident, Jack finds out the lovely Julia has been spending entire days at Xymo's microchip fabrication plant, and gets hired as a consultant to figure out what's going on.<br />What's going on? The Gentle Reader can probably figure it out. Xymos, you see, is making little biomechanical machines on a nano (extremely small) scale, and the little devils have gotten out of control. When Jack gets to the lab, the little devils (actually nano-sized military cameras for battlefield surveillance) are outside the lab---but for how long? Worse, because nanotechnology replicates, they're breeding---a little swarm of nano-cameras buzzing all over the desert, and they're not out to have you say 'cheese.'<br />3) If I've made \\"Prey: A Novel\\" sound more exciting than it is, and I have, then I'm sorry. We've seen all of this before in Jurassic Park, except that book was fresh and interesting. This is just a boring rehash, a book that dissolves into a frantic chase when our hero gets to the lab and finds the little velociraptors (I'm sorry, nanomachines) devouring anyone they can find. Go ahead and slog through the first 1/3rd of the book hoping for a payoff---you'll regret it.<br />4) Nanotechnology is an exciting concept that many companies have already employed; doubtless we'll see more extensive and imaginative applications of it in our lifetime. But Crichton has taken this marvellous concept (with its ominous implications, as both K. Eric Drexler and Greg Bear have suggested) and turned it into a monster-of-the-week novel---and a long, tedious, boring read, at that.<br />If you want to see what the nanotechnology-gone-horribly-wrong theme looks like in the hands of a master, then grab the appalling and unsettling \\"Blood Music\\", by Greg Bear. In the meantime, save your money and your time and avoid \\"Prey\\".sic Park, except that book was fresh and interesting.

0060900075|4.0|<BR>\\"The Doors of Perception\\" is essentially a commentary by Huxley describing his experience with Mescaline.  What I found most interesting was that it is written from the perspective of a very well-educated intellectual who, while high on Mescaline, observes and waxes mystical and philosophical on art (paintings), of all things.  This was funny in an odd sort of way, reading an obviously passionate art appreciator discuss the merits of various artists and works of art while using a hallucinagenic drug, - however not understanding a lot myself about the history of painted artwork I think much of his commentary was lost on me.  In addition to criticizing art he also commented in general on the nature of the mind and the connection between the mind, hallucinagens and mystical experience, etc.<br />In \\"Heaven and Hell\\", Huxley discusses the nature and history of mystical experience, or as he tends to refer to it \\"visionary experience\\".  Again, he focuses strongly on the role of art (mostly painting) throughout history as being evocative of mystical visions and it's almost as if he is discussing the mystical implications of art throughout history as much as he is discussing the mystical experience itself.<br />While interesting, I found his approach a bit too intellectual for my tastes, and his fixation with art a bit beyond my reach considering I know little of art and had no frame of reference with which to personally evaluate his examples and comparisons (not being familiar with the specific works and artists that he was using for examples).  Also, compared to the wealth of written material and research available today on the subjects of hallucinagens, mysticism, and transpersonal psychology I felt that his material was a bit outdated. <br />Nevertheless, these books are worth reading and he makes many interesting points.<BR>

BUt this is an earlier release, and their older stuff is very good. I like their newer stuff too. Digimortal is ver good but i like this on better. It seems harder and faster. My personal favorite song on here is Edgecrusher cause it has really good music and words. I also like Hi-Tech Hate. THey are all very good though. Every song has a very good beat and the whole album has very good lyrics. THe vocals are very good. I love Burtons voice, he can scream and sing soft. Its a very good cd and you wont be dissapointed if you buy it.
B000002J20|1.0|Unlike other reviewers, I listened to this on an internet radio program and so had no cognitive dissonance hurdles from actually spending money on this album to overcome.  Having said that, I didn't last five minutes until I had to use the &quot;never play this song&quot; feature on my player.  Call me a wimp, but I was dizzy from the blood loss from MY EARS BLEEDING and I kind of liked it when my ears weren't bleeding.<BR>Then again, it was fun to sing &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; in anticipation of clicking that button that would ban this travesty from my internet radio station.  God, I *love* that feature now.<br />But I do have one positive thing to say about this album:  It was partly responsible for the birth of punk and therefore for The Pixies.  I guess I can forgive Yes and maybe give one of their earlier albums a try.<br />Ahem.  So yeah, don't buy this album.

0140177396|5.0|Judging by its short 106-page length and relatively large font, John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men would seem to be the \\"perfect\\" read for an average high school slacker. However, most high schoolers are not allowed to take advantage of the short novel because Of Mice and Men has been banned from many schools for being controversial. This may seem strange as the plot is centered around two friends, George and Lennie, who travel from place to place looking for work. However, George and Lennie aren't like most other manual laborers. They work because they have the goal of eventually buying and managing their own piece of land. Steinbeck focuses the novel mainly on their arduous journey toward achieving that goal. However, during George and Lennie's journey, Steinbeck incorporates different themes that are morally and socially controversial and ultimately result in Of Mice and Men being banned. <BR>Ironically, Steinbeck's philosophical themes that cause controversy stem from a relatively simple plot. The plot surrounds the main characters, George and Lennie, who are looking for a place to work and who eventually settle on a ranch in California. They develop many friends at this ranch and some of their fellow workers actually join Lennie and George in their quest to own land. However, it isn't long before that Lennie accidentally murders the boss's daughter in law and is forced to flee the ranch to avoid being punished. With a search party looking for Lennie, it is ironic that George, Lennie's long-time companion, is the one that kills Lennie. The novel then comes to a conclusion after Lennie is killed and the two never get to own their own land. With this plot the murder alone being controversial enough for the book to be banned, it is obvious that the reasons for the banishment are due to other themes within the book.<BR> One of the major themes of the novel that may have caused moral controversy is the relationship between George and Lennie. George and Lennie have been long-time companions and have always been there for each other. This friendship may not seem controversial on the surface but the way the two treat each other can be considered socially offensive. George, who is naturally much smarter than Lennie, often insults and chastises Lennie for being dumb. For example, one time after Lennie wanted a dead mouse as a pet, George reacted, \\" \\"`You crazy fool...'\\" He heard Lennie's whimpering cry and wheeled about. \\"`Blubberin'\\" like a baby! Jesus Christ!'\\" \\" Quotes like this are riddled throughout the book as George and other characters continue to insult Lennie for not being smart. This aspect of the novel will offend many readers as it is not proper in society to offend people who are not smart. These unwarranted attacks are reason why Of Mice and Men may have been banned. <BR> The novel also may have been banned because the novel negatively portrays women. The insulting description of women is a theme in the novel that can be seen through the character of Curley's wife.  She is the only female character in the book and negatively represents women as she is constantly portrayed s very annoying. She is constantly nagging all the workers on the ranch and soon gains the disliking of all the workers. The workers personify her with words like \\"tramp\\" and \\"tart\\" as they think she is whorish. Morally, this portrayal is controversial because Steinbeck uses Curley's wife as a symbol for all women. It is offensive for all women to be characterized as annoying and whorish. As a result, many women may have been upset by Of Mice and Men and called for the book to be banned. <BR> Although the novel became banned in many schools, I think Of Mice and Men positively contributed to the literary world because Steinbeck had a powerful message in his book. Although controversial, Steinbeck conveyed something through his writing and that is very important. Steinbeck made people think and argue as he pointed out pieces of society that might seem offensive. Through his book, he made people take action to improve society. I think that authors should always strive for an emotional response from their readers. As a result, because Of Mice and Men sends a powerful message, the novel should not be banned and students should read it.
6304039506|5.0|Altough I've heard ASCND was a classic before I saw it, I truely believe it now that I finally have. As an afficionado of acting, I was blown away by Leigh and Brando's protrale of Stanley and Blanch. I think this is one of Marlon Brando's best acting jobs every. It is such a shame that this style of acting is so rare. Sadly he did not win an Oscar for this role, which I believe was well deserved.

0140177396|4.0|Although many people view Of Mice and Men as a classic, there are some who disagree.  The novel was banned and challenged in many schools throughout the country because of explicit language and profanity.  After finishing the book myself, I strongly disagree.  The language used in Of Mice and Men is nothing new, and most definitely not something that teenagers have not already heard before.  One of the characters, Crooks, who happens to be an African American, is quite often referred to in the novel as inferior and is treated much differently than the other characters in the novel.  That is perhaps another reason why people may have challenged the novel.  Personally, I feel that Of Mice and Men positively contributes to the literary world because of its status.  Many critics feel that it is a classic and I feel it should be treated as such.  The idea of companionship is demonstrated throughout the book, and I feel that is a positive force.  As shown in the novel, everyone needs someone to talk to, one cannot go throughout life without friends to confide in and have fun with.  Overall, Of Mice and Men is a classic novel that everyone should read.
B00006AUIG|3.0|SESSION 9     (USA - 2001)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (HD Widescreen)  Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital    Five professional contractors - each with their own personal problems - are hired to strip asbestos from a huge, abandoned asylum where the horrific events of the past intrude on the present, invoking a murderous confrontation.    Notable as the first movie shot in the scope format using high-definition video at 24fps (transferred to 35mm film for theatrical screenings) - the same process used by George Lucas for STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES the following year - director Brad Anderson describes SESSION 9 as an exercise in 'creeping dread', filmed at the deserted Danvers Mental Institution in Massachusetts whose crumbling interior suggests nothing less than the hellish Marsten House of Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot'. As the audio commentary on the original US DVD attests, Anderson takes his visual cue from slow-burning thrillers like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW, favoring long, deliberate camera movements and wide-angle shots which transform the Institute's vast, empty spaces into an oppressive, tomb-like structure. Few Hollywood movies of recent years have used the scope format to such impressive effect.     A terrific ensemble cast is headlined by David Caruso (TV's \\"CSI: Miami\\") and Scottish actor-director Peter Mullan (MY NAME IS JOE), both of whom give committed performances as men on the edge of despair, and strong support is given by Josh Lucas (THE DEEP END), Brendan Sexton III (WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE) and co-writer Steven Gevedon as the hapless co-worker who stumbles on a series of audio tapes which contain ultra-creepy psychiatric sessions involving a former patient suffering from split personality disorder.     Memorable sequences include Lucas' unscheduled late-night visit to the Institute, where he finds himself sharing the darkness with... something that shouldn't be there, and the inevitable moment when Sexton - who had earlierdeclared his morbid fear of the dark - finds himself trapped in the bowels of the building just as the lights begin to go out... Two endings were filmed, one of which involves a subplot that was ultimately dropped from the final assembly, but in truth, neither one of them lives up to expectations. The combination of tragedy and horror will still take many viewers by surprise, but one is left with the distinct impression that few of the participants were interested in making a REAL horror film, even if the movie ends up being one anyway, in spite of itself. Beautifully judged for the most part, and genuinely frightening in places, SESSION 9 is worth a look, despite minor reservations.

B00008PX8P|4.0|Granted, when you're ahead of your time it's not surprising that a band like Led Zeppelin lept ahead of the technology of the times in terms of being able to capture their live show for posterity. These guys wrote the blueprint that a whole lot of people attempt to follow to this very day, and I'd bet all of it was analog.<br />To give an accurate review of this set, one has to be able to understand what it was that made Led Zeppelin what it was they were. This band had a range that has never been equaled, only approached maybe by The Who. Zep could shake your liver with sonic bombast, and then hold you spellbound with delicate, intricate accoustic beauty. Simply put, of their genre, they were the best, and still are.<br />&quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; was an ego-indulging disappointment, and for anyone who had ever witnessed Led Zeppelin at their thunderous zenith, this document of the group was roundly dismissed. <br />What makes this 2-disc set worth the money is the Earl's Court performance of 1975. This new, digitally mastered material is to Zeppelin fans what a drink of water is to someone who has been lost in the desert for a week. <br />To a hard core Zep fan, trying to capture in it's true essence what a Zep performance was, will always be a daunting task, given that the group disbanded almost 25 years ago. Then again, it's because of the time factor that now we can look back at what the band gave to us and how it has stood the test of time and realize how special it was.<br />If you're in your twenties and want to know what all the fuss was about, it's a decent chronicle and a place to begin your education. If you're in you're forties and have experienced Led Zeppelin personally, NOTHING can replace being in the 10th row.<br />What is kind of troubling is that this was the best Jimmy could come up with. We all have suspected that he has horded away in the vaults all the recordings and filmings of the band. If this is truly the cream of the crop ofwhat exists, it is truly a shame.<br />Better get all that 16mm footage converted to digital, Pagey...before it crumbles into dust and floats away!

B00003CXDG|3.0|After reading many reviews, I think majority of the people who have watched both MI1 and MI2 would agree that MI1 is far better film.  I have no comment on that because I haven't watched MI1.<br />Here are what I have for MI2<br />1)Good music and great CGI special effect.  Although some scenes are unbelieveable(eg. opening climb), it's flawless to me unless I slow-motion every second.<br />2)Tom is a one-man-army, he's more a James Bond than working as a team.  I heard MI1 is about team work.<br />3)Tom is great looking in that leather jacket.  I'm not a chick but I say he's so cool that I want that jacket.<br />4)Overdone on mask tricks.  You can put a mask on to pretend someone but body built and voices can be hard to copy.<br />5)Wild flying kicks.  You see Tom does this jump kicks all the time(more than 4 at last scene, I lost count), the problem for Tom is that he's a natural stiff.  He ain't Jet Li or someone who can do at ease.  He barely touches the bad guy.<br />6)His romance with the girl is thin to me.  I think that's John Woo's style.  He is good making movies with excitment.  <br />Overall, this movie isn't too bad.  I have a good time watching it once.  But I wouldn't buy or see it in near future.  I wouldn't get this for my personal collection.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I can go on forever about the enormous complexities, ironies, and messages in this album. Simply put, Radiohead's OK Computer is the best album ever recorded. Better than Revolver, Dark Side of the Moon, London Calling, Thriller etc.. The Citizen Kane of music.
B000089RVX|3.0|Ok, Amy can sing most people off the stage, but there is something irritating about her voice after a while, too sweetly strident? Too Pat Benatar? Too spooky? Maybe I'm too old. Maybe we are all spoiled now by the sensuous quality of Norah Jones, the sweetness of Eva Cassidy, or the grown-up magnificence of Mary Fahl (who, if you have not heard of her yet,is right up there with the great gals previously mentioned. Her new record &quot;The Other Side of Time&quot; wowed me.)  Sorry Evanescence, I can only give you 3 stars.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This set blows me away!  How the Zep boys kept this in the cans for 30 years is beyond me.  Far supperior to the Song Remains The Same, which everyone grew up with.  The digital quality of this album is excellent, and gives it a feel of actually being there with them live.  All 3 discs of this set are solid Zep, whether it's the acoustic set at the end of disc 1 (Going To California, That't The Way, Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp), or the extended versions of Dazed and Confused (25:25 on disc 2), or the jammin' version of Whole Lotta Love (23:08 on disc 3).  This cd set is a Zeppelin gem at any price!
B00006C7G9|5.0|The German Cold War Infantry Officer's review of April 27, 2003, writes a good review most of which I agree. but unfortunately, he speaks about the German soldiers' families being &quot;murdered by American phosphorus bombs&quot; while he ignores the air raids on Britain that killed innocents as well. Worse, he regurtitates the falsehood that US fighter aircraft strafed women and children after the raids on Dresden. This never happened! I was a 14-year-old runner for Dresden Air Raid Police(Luftschutzpolizei)whose story was chronicled in John Toland's book &quot;The Last Hundred Days&quot;. Both night raids of 13/14 <BR>February, 1945, by the RAF bombers were NOT accompanied by US fighters. The British flew quite low over the city and once <BR>could hear the roar of the engines quite clearly. In the early <BR>morning hours of the 14th, I was at the banks of the Elbe river where many hundreds had sought refuge. I saw no evidence of any<BR> injuries of deaths because of strafing. Stories that this in <BR>fact had occurred began the fowlling day. I spoke to many who <BR>where at river and no one confirmed this. There was NO strafing<BR> during the US daylight raids on the 14th. However,weeks later, <BR>US Mustangs did strafe along the river, hitting barges carrying troops and supplies, absolutely military targets.
B000068TPN|4.0|The first hour and 53 minutes of this movie is as close to a documentary as Hollywood can get.  Perfectly depicted was the chess match between An and Moore.  I hold the deepest respect for Charlie Beckwith, but his critisms of Hal Moore are deeply unjust (re: Deta Force by Charles Beckwith).<br />However, at exactly 1:53:00; this movie becomes complete [...].  It is purely Randall Wallace saying \\"See how much blood and dying heathens I can throw into 10 minutes.  The post-battle sequence is farcicle and disrepects the plight of the reinforcements that releaved Hal and his men.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I took this cd on a road trip and my friends and I were singing down the highway to the lyrics! Christina shows how much she has matured from Reflection and Come on Over. I love this cd and never tire of it though some of the songs aren't as good as others!!!
B00005QIPH|2.0|I have to preface this review with the note that I probably expected too much from The Strokes. I had heard critics applaud them for being the saviors of rock and roll, and I didn't know enough to about The Strokes to realize this was complete and total marketing balony. The Strokes, based on this initial record, are not remotely talented at songwriting or creating an original sound. I could easily forgive this if their songs were at least catchy and memorable, but they aren't. \\"Soma\\" is quite possibly the worst new rock song I've heard this year. I saw them play it live on Conan O Brian and, from one musician to another, I truly and honestly felt sorry for them. They are clearly not ready for the spotlight with such terrible material, and the applause (even for the Conan O Brian show) was very forced.<br />In the past there have been many bands without an original sound that were just so good they redefined many of their own influences, Guns N Roses and Oasis being 2 good examples. Does Oasis have a lot of talent? Not really, but their main songwriter (Noel Gallagher) has it where it counts: He knows how to write instantly catchy songs that stick with you forever, and Liam can belt them out with flair like no one else. The same goes for Axl Rose, he has that innate surly, snarly white trash swagger that makes him such a great frontman for a band based upon the 3 prime rock and roll directives: Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, in that order.<br />The Strokes will probably never even reach the popular success levels of their own influences, unless they can somehow turn around and create a sophmore album that is original and enjoyable. \\"Is This It\\" is not it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I've had a love affair with Led Zeppelin since I was 16. I will be 29 in just a few days and that love is stronger than ever. One thing that always seems to bug my love for the band is the lack of good quality visual and audio material. Led Zeppelin did its best work on stage as they improvised and reworked their classic songs for the concert stage. This two-disc DVD set is the long overdue celebration of one of music's greatest concert attractions. Led Zeppelin DVD is a visual feast for the senses and an audio delight that provides both the hardcore fan and the casual novice a front row seat into hard rock's greatest band. <br />There is much to be happy about including a stunning performance at Royal Albert Hall in 1970. I love the covers of Something Else and C'mon Everybody. The band is on fire and they know it and you can tell that the audience is literally getting off on the band.  Concerts of any kind should have a sort of connection between the fan and the artist and Led Zeppelin proved its worth to both the eager fan and the goal of the performer.  The 1973 Madison Square Garden shows are known for making up the only previously official live footage and album. The Song Remains the Same has always been average at best but on this DVD set one gets a new look at an old friend. The viewer gets unreleased versions of great renditions of Misty Mountain Hop and The Ocean, which makes one wonder, why they were left off the film when it was released in 1976?  The sound is also much smoother than the DVD release of TSRTS film, which I hope, gets the proper remastering treatment one day. <br />Next up is Earl's Court and what can I say but it was like a kid at a candy store. A stunning and intimate acoustic set along with fired up versions of In My Time of Dying and Trampled Underfoot. The viewer also gets one of Jimmy Page's best ever Stairway to Heaven solos giving the now worn out song a look and sound of grandeur.  The 1979 Knebworth shows represented a comeback for Led Zeppelin after being away from the concert stage for two years and away from their native homeland for four years. One can really tell that they were both nervous and excited about these shows and it shows in the playing. The viewer gets great versions of Sick Again, Kashmir and Achilles Last Stand. The playing is not quite on the same level of Earls Court or Royal Albert Hall but considering the long layoff shows a determined and passionate band that still had plenty of fuel left in the band's collective hearts. Knebworth deserves praise for a band willing to continue and the bands revamped arrangement of Whole Lotta Love should humble critics who have been far too harsh about these shows. <BR>The extras on both discs are nice including a fine 30 minute performance for Danish television in March of1969 with a nice and rarely played Babe I'm Gonna Leave You. We also get a fascinating NBC interview by a pro Beatles press in which the band commends the fab four while keeping its own goals and ideas that would make them the band of the 1970's. The sound and visual presentation have been handled with care considering this footage is old and was almost unsalvageable. The visuals can be a bit dark with gaps replaced by clever even if mildly annoying bootleg footage. However, its all done with the love and care and big time admiration should go out to Jimmy Page, Kevin Shirley, and Dick Caruthers for providing the final acclaim and a fitting closing chapter to one of music history's greatest bands.
B000002JS6|3.0|A true comeback recording by this well renowned Australian band. Loaded with many catchy riffs and several compelling hooks. You Shook Me All Night Long, Shoot To Thrill, Rock N Roll Aint Noise Pollution, and Hells Bells are very captivating tunes.<br />Now the remaining six songs are certainly fine. However, the tone of this album is just oh so loud with limited variation or pacings. Whereas Brian Johnson's screetching vocals are strong in the power category, they certainly are not conducive for all audiences or moods. Gosh that dude must gargle with razor blades!!!!<br />Don't get me wrong. I respect this album as essential for fans of heay metal/hard rock. However, those who like some mellow tones mixed in their music may consider sampling this in smaller doses.
B00008MNYS|3.0|This CD was OK &amp; it was also the first one I purchased by this artist.  I think Rolling Stone Magazine got it right when they gave it 3 stars also.  &quot;Me &amp; My Monkey&quot; is over 7 min. long &amp; it is a little strange-sounding in words &amp; music, but of course that's what we've come to expect from Robbie Williams, I guess.  &quot;Something Beautiful&quot; is the best song on the CD.  Nice beat &amp; great words.
B00008BXJF|5.0|What a fine release from one of my favorite bands ever.  This is a super strong album.  Lean and mean.  It has all the elements of what the earlier Crimson albums layed down plus some new tastes.  It almost has an electronica sound on The Power To Believe II with electronic drums and Fripp's superb Soundscapes.  Excellent stuff and a must buy for Crimheads.
B000003BQW|5.0|I love the Ramones and this is the best album of their later stuff.  Poison Heart and Strengh to Endure are the best songs here.  Strong hard edged tunes.  I higly recommend this cd.  This music blows away the boy band crapola that everyone is listening to these days.  LONG LIVE ROCK!!!!
B000001FDQ|4.0|After playing with Steeler and Alcatrazz, Yngwie Malmsteen plunged forth with this solo debut. This is Yngwie at his best. Many heavy metal guitar players added classical influence to their playing but few did it as tastefully as Malmsteen did. This is mostly an instrumental album, with only \\"Now Your Ships are Burned\\" and \\"As Above, So Below\\" featuring vocals. All the tracks on this are very solid. The strongest tracks are \\"Far Beyond The Sun\\", \\"Icarus' Dream Suite\\", and \\"As Above, So Below.\\" The arrangements on this album are fantastic and the musicianship is stellar, particularly  keyboardist Jens Johansson. While his other '80s albums after this were decent and his playing was still top notch, they were more commercial and less creative. If you want one album by Yngwie, this is the one to get.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|THis is the best album I have gotten in a long time.  The first single \\"Straight Out of Line\\" is a great track to come out the gates running with.  It is very intense and heavy.  The next single \\"Serenity\\" is a more mellow track like \\"Voodoo\\" or \\"The Spiral\\".  Have no  fear though, it is one of the best songs on the album.  This album also contains their biggest hit \\"I Stand Alone\\".  And for the people who want a hate song there is \\"I F****** Hate You.\\"  The album sounds different from their older albums, like Korn's Untouchables, but is still great for the true fan.  I give it an A+.
B00008OWZC|4.0|I eagerly awaited this release ever since I heard rumors about it several months ago.  I got both the DVD's and CD's today (5-27-03) and I have to say, I'm most happy since I never saw the whole band live.  These performances aren't perfect, but then the band never claimed to be.  They simply show my favorite band at various stages of their &quot;career&quot;, warts and all.<br />The concerts at the Royal Albert Hall show the band with a good year or so under their belt.  Man, they were RAW!  I LOVE the Earls Court acoustic set, as well as the unreleased footage from TSRTS.  They absolutely ROCKED at Knebworth!  I find it amazing to see how their live performances progressed over the years, while playing pretty much the same tunes.<br />The only thing I wish the band had done different over the years was to have a second guitarist playing with Page.  Of course, his ego simply wouldn't allow for that, but I think that the bands musical performances would have been much &quot;cleaner&quot; with someone playing rhythm to Pages' lead.<br />My recommendation?  Buy it.<br />ZEP RULEZ!<br />Ray Aviles

B00005JSGK|5.0|John Wayne goes to africa to capture big game for museums.  This movie is solid family entertainment.  It is fun on several fronts.  First there is the the adventure and &quot;learning experience&quot; watching how they capture wild animals.  This is the action that holds the interest of my sons.  second there is the love story for my daughters.  third, is the duke for ol' dad.  This is one of my top ten JW movies.
B00008PX8P|5.0|...and it truly is as good as I imagined it would be. <br />One of the first things that hits me as I watch it is that this was one FIERCE band, especially in the earlier days. When they were still young and hungry, NOBODY could touch them live. Bonzo and Page particularly were like men possessed (check out \\"White Summer\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\" particularly). <br />And don't let the fact that they call the TV footage \\"bonus material\\" fool you...the TV stuff is (mostly) every bit as revealing and powerful as the other footage...and there is a LOT of it. Heck, even the menus consist of cool old Zep footage you've never seen...<br />The one thing that disappointed me was the fact that they included a performance or two from the film \\"The Song Remains The Same\\"....not just different songs from those shows, but the same performances! \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is exactly the same performance we've already seen a million times (but with slightly different edits). I haven't got the slightest idea why they included it. But considering how much amazingly good material there is in this set, this is only a minor complaint.<br />Without reservation, this set gets 5 stars. Zep lives again.
B0000844I8|4.0|Good action movie but was that Michael Jackson? May 27, 2003<br />Guess I didn't like the bad guy and the fact that he seems to be a Michael Jackson imitation, in the worse sense, and surrounded himself with children. If you can get past that this would get 5 stars from me.  Also, It is a movie I can watch with my 12 year son and my 20 year sons. My 6 and 10 year old daughters didn't like it though and they like anything starring \\"Jack Burton\\".<br />The new TV show based on this movie is also worth a look.
0792838068|1.0|I laugh at those who call this an \\"honest\\" film...it is as Hollywood as they come.  This was another perfect example of how Hollywood says a film is \\"art\\" and people simply believe it because they are sheep.  Same thing with \\"American Beauty.\\"<br />When Shue pours booze on her own breasts in order to turn Cage's character on........PLEASE!! That isn't an \\"honest\\" or \\"powerful\\" statement about alcoholism--it's just stupid.  If he was REALLY an alcoholic, he'd have said \\"You are wasting my booze!  Stop it!\\"    <br />This flick was a con job, and all the people who lavished it with praise were [bamboozled].
6305754950|5.0|I can't decide if this is the best western ever made or the second best ever!  The characters such me in every time they are so well done.  Robert Mitchem playing a drunk or Dean Martin.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Sorry, I know alot of you folks like this stuff - for some reason -  but this band stinks! In trying to sound like a hodge podge of 80s bands (err - sorry they don't sound like JD) more like the Furs - they sound like no one. That is they have no soul or sound to call their own - they are just another long line of bands who go through their record collection for a 'sound' or songs - because they can't figure out how they want to sound. The only song I thought was OK was the one that sound like it was a complete [copy] of the Smiths. Which is fitting since the Smiths were the LAST pop band that had its own sound...
B00005JKN9|4.0|One of the big controversies surrounding this film was that Martin Scorcese was forced to cut nearly an hour of footage from his final vision in order to get the studio to release it.  That's understandable, as not many people will be willing to sit through a 4 hour movie in theatres.  So with the release of it on DVD, we should get the complete version, right?  Well... it doesn't seem so.<br />The details on this DVD mention nothing about extra footage.  Isn't one of the benefits of the DVD format that we get to see what the director intended before politics and marketing step in?  I for one would like to see the COMPLETE movie, the movie that Scorcese wanted to make, rather than the movie which was released, even though that movie was quite good.<br />I have a feeling that the studio is just doing the usual DVD scam of releasing the theatrical version as soon as possible to catch people while they are still hyped on this movie from the theatrical release and post-Oscar boost.  After a few months, hopefully they will release a director's cut, causing many people to go back and buy the DVD a second time.  I, for one, will wait as long as it takes until the full version comes out.  I'm sick of getting scammed by these studios into buying one version, and then seeing a \\"special edition\\" with all sorts of extras come out a few months later.  Not gonna happen this time, buddy-boy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you've been waiting for a review by someone who has actually seen this DVD, here it is.  After listening to poor-quality bootleg recordings of some of these shows, it's great to finally hear the real deal.  Jimmy Page really delivered on the audio, and the video restoration, which reportedly took months of painstaking frame-by-frame work, is breathtaking.<br />The Albert Hall '70 video is especially surprising, since it is so old.  It's clear as a bell, and the sound (other than Robert being very slightly distorted) is stunning.  The performance is very raw and spontaneous and really sums up what Zeppelin sounded like in the early years.<br />The Danish TV broadcast from '69 is somewhat legendary, as it's been broadcast so few times.  It's black and white, but very clear.  Plant's voice is fairly well shot, but the performance is still strong and the band is obviously having a great time.  Watch out for a mis-cue near the end of How Many More Times--these guys were close to the edge much of the time, and it shows here!<br />You get to see more than one version of Communication Breakdown and Dazed and Confused among the different segments, but you also get to see how these songs evolved as time passed.<br />The New York '73 footage consists of 4 tunes, two of which appeared on the Song Remains movie.  However, the soundtrack has been remastered, and the video has been restored with some different angles, so you're not getting a bunch of repeats.  The Ocean is a highlight of this segment--I don't see why they left this off the original.  Bonzo counts it off like on the album, and sings harmony on the la-la section.  By the way, Bonzo's playing throughout this package is jaw-dropping.  After eleven years of *that*, how could anyone else replace him?<br />Earl's Court '75:  this is the one everybody talks about, and it's killer.  My understanding is that all five nights were filmed, but much of the footage was unusable.  This segment consists of some acoustic numberswhich still contained a great deal of spontaneity, as well as stunning versions of electric numbers.  I'm a little surprised so few tunes from these concerts were used.  The footage is very close-up and intimate, and it's not obvious how big the room is.<br />Knebworth '79:  this section was a real revelation for me.  I'd heard an audience bootleg and seen some clips, and it was not very impressive-sounding.  With a real soundtrack, it stands up with anything else on this DVD.  The epic Presence material contains some amazing guitar playing from Page, and is one more highlight of many on this package.  In the Evening was a stinker on the bootleg, but it really rocks now--amazing what a professional mix will do!  Surprisingly, even though Ten Years Gone was broadcast on MTV in 1990, no performance of this tune was included on this set.  Page and Plant are clearly having a blast on this segment.<br />The extras are also well worth seeing, and most Zep fans would gladly pay the asking price for those alone.  Each menu page contains bits of priceless footage and/or audio that, while not quite as stellar as the main feature, is still top-notch.<br />It may sound petty to complain about 5 hours of amazing material not being enough, but it's too bad this set has to end.  This music is as good as it gets.  Five stars with room to spare!
B00006RU5B|4.0|First off, there those who rather sneeringly refer to Audioslave as a \\"super group\\" are off the mark; whatever this album may (or may not) be it is nothing if not sincere.  If they were in it solely for the money, Audioslave certainly could have made a more commercial album, instead they stretched their legs artistically, and while they don't always succeed, they certainly make a game of it.<br />By way of some background, Audioslave is made up of Chris Cornell, of Soundgarden fame, on vocals with Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass), and Brad Wilk (drums) all formerly of Rage Against the Machine rounding out the group.  The funny thing is, I was never a particularly big fan of either band, but the match-up intrigued me.  As Henry Rollins once said, Cornell's voice can, \\"peel paint off the walls\\", and I always liked Rage's fusion of funk and rock, personified in Morello's remarkable guitar playing.  The problem was, Zach de la Rocha's self-consciously political lyrics ruined the music for me (what rhymes with `Zapatista'?).  With de la Rocha's ouster, I saw a lot of potential, and while the end result is a mixed bag, it's more than worth the price.<br />The first three tracks on this album (\\"Cochise\\", \\"Show Me How To Live\\", and \\"Gasoline\\") are flat out rockers.  There is no one thing about them that makes them stand out; it's just an all out group effort with excellence at every level.  \\"Cochise\\" in particular is a brilliant combination of the stripped down grunge we would have heard Cornell recording a decade ago, and the flourishes that are Morello's hallmark.<br />The fourth track, \\"What You Are\\" foreshadows some of the difficulties found later in the album.  Morello, gets stuck in a pretty dull chord progression for most of the song, and when he finally breaks out with a truly remarkable riff (sort of a melodic, electronic version of a catfight, if that makes any sense) it seems oddly disconnected from the rest of the song.<br />\\"Like A Stone\\" is thefirst single off the album, and rightfully so as it represents the best fusion of Soundgarden and Rage on the album.  Cornell's voice is in fine form soaring to ear-piercing shrieks only to dip down to a steady rumble and then back again.  In addition, Morello's guitar work is nothing short of breathtaking; I don't even know how to begin to describe it other than that it is the perfect counterpoint to Cornell's voice and some of the most original and creative stuff I have heard in a long time.<br />\\"Set It Off\\" seems to be Cornell's nod to Rage's political base, and while it's not a bad song (in fact it's a pretty good tune) it seems oddly out of context on the album.  Moreover, Cornell, a multimillionaire pushing forty singing \\"...set it off now children...\\" is more than a little amusing.<br />If \\"Like A Stone\\" is a perfect fusion of what was, then track seven, \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" is the best example of what may be to come.  This track goes beyond fusing elements successfully, and creates something new.  Morello's guitar swoops and soars, never settling in one place for long.  In the hands of a less talented musician it would be pretentious and tedious, but with Morello it's just sheer brilliance.  At the same time, Cornell's singing reveals a more contemplative side, a certain maturity, which only adds to the power of his voice.<br />It's followed up by another excellent cut in \\"I Am The Highway\\" which contains some of my favorite lyrics.  Cornell explores relativity as he stays the same as friends and lovers come and go.<br />Track nine, \\"Exploder\\" is a pretty good tune, but there's nothing about it that one takes notice of.<br />The next track, \\"Hypnotize\\" is a funny little song that I rather like; but I'm not sure that it's the right direction for Cornell.  Specifically, he has a delivery that borders on the spoken word, and while there's nothing wrong with that per se, I'm not sure he has the right kind of voice for it.  An Ed Vedder, for example, would be better suited to the kind of delivery he's going for.  Nonetheless, I really like this one, and it features perhaps the best drum work on the album.<br />Tracks 11 and 12 are far and away my least favorite on the album.  Both \\"Bring Em Back Alive\\" and in particular, \\"Light My Way\\" offer performances that are more reminiscent of a cookie cutter heavy metal track than anything one would expect from artists of this caliber.  The one exception here is the superb guitar solo (one of the few extended solos on the album) that is completely wasted on \\"Bring Em Back Alive\\"; Morello really gets experimental on that one, and the drums are excellent, but the song just doesn't live up to the effort.<br />Next is \\"Getaway Car\\", which has an interesting, bluesy sort of beat, and vocal arrangements that vaguely remind me of Gospel/Soul (believe it or not).<br />Finally, the album wraps up with the rather forgettable \\"The Last Remaining Light\\".  Frankly, the whole band seems a little bored with this one, and while it's not awful, I can't imagine ever skipping ahead to get to it.<br />In the end that's eight good-to-great songs, three good ones, and three I could have lived without.  Generally speaking, I would be ecstatic to get eleven solid tracks off an album, and in this instance that's certainly true.  While Audioslave's first effort doesn't quite live up to all the expectations and hype (could any album have?) it is still well above average, and is a great listen.  If you want to hear why there may yet be hope for rock in this age of borderline psychotic rock-rap a la Limp Bizkit and the derivative drudgery of Creed or Nickelback, the self-titled \\"Audioslave\\" is more than worth checking out.<br />Jake Mohlman
6305313687|5.0|Wow! I can't believe that nobody talks about this movie. I rented it having heard nothing about it, but since I've seen it, I've told everybody about it. Edward Norton delivered an increadible performance as a repentant skinhead. This was truly an amazing movie. It is Norton's best role, which says a lot because he's always great (Fight Club, Rounders, The Score, 25th Hour). This is certainly not a movie that everybody can handle. Before you view, understand that it has an extreme R rating, which is for strong brutal violence (including a graphic rape), pervasive extreme language, and sexuality (including some brief nudity). This is not exactly your feel good movie either, so be prepared. Don't watch this with your elementary age kids. American History X is an extremely hard core movie that reflects hard core life styles. It is unforgettable and will have a powerful impact on you.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD encompasses 2 Led Zep perfomances in 1972 from Long Beach and Los Angeles, California.  It is truly an &quot;ear-opening&quot; experience to hear a live crowd react to the fabulous performances of this band.  This band clearly had a passion for the music it played and these discs clearly have the passionate energy running thru these tracks.  Stairway to Heaven is outstanding.  I also like this CD as it gives the songs of this band a new twist as they extend and experiment with their songs and seem to react with the audience and energize from their excitement. <br />If you like this band or even if you just like rock and roll, you need to have this CD in  your collection.  It is sure to become a classic in the years to come.  This serves as a permanent record for the legacy of a historic rock band.  I would also recommend the DVD that was also put out at the same time with this CD.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I can't say enough about this dvd.  It's excellent!!  If you are a Zeppelin fan you will not be disappointed.
B00006DEF9|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, to be used when I just want to just sit back and be entertained.<br />If you are a fan of tap-dancing, this movie is the absolute classic.  The combination of Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly is simply unbeatable.  It's just one excellent routine after another.  I love the athletic style of these dancers.<br />Add to that the songs and a comical story, and you have a winner.<br />The plot is strictly MGM musical formula.  Boy meets girl, boy and girl have to save the day by putting together a great musical show, boy gets girl, the show is a success, the day is saved.  However, the twists in the plot for this movie were done very well.  The comedy is done very imaginatively, and still is funny.
0446677450|4.0|Mike's father provided a new outlook on business and money for me.  Much like Robert's father, I always conisedered school and education the key to success and business. Now, however, I realize that one must never be fearful of failure and must always take risks in order to achieve success.  Mike's father was was a good representative of successful businessment in our world who know how to manipulate those around them to produce the greatest yield for themselves.  Overall, I thought the book was extremely  insightful and an instructive guide to the steps of success.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I heard about this DVD from a fellow nurse at work. She saw it and couldn't stop raving about it, she in turn heard about it from a friend who had heard about it from a DJ in Chicago, who announced on his radio show that this movie was better than the Matrix.<BR>So I being the skeptic and a big fan of the Matrix decided to rent this with my husband. I was all set to dislike this movie but ended up watching it twice that night. My husband loved the gun-kata scenes...and the scene with the puppy -yes i fell for it. So we liked it so much we bought it.<BR>Yes, this story has been told many different times, yes the effects were borrowed from other movies, but what movie hasn't ben inspired by a previous work? Regardless, it's the way the story is told and acted that works.The movie just pulled you in and made you care for this character - John Preston. This movie works for both males and females - It has just enough action,drama, puppies,and men dealing with their feelings-what woman wouldn't want to watch that! <BR>I have to admit i didn't know who the heck Christian Bale was, but now I can't wait to see more of his work.<BR>Hopefully word of mouth will make this the hit it should have been!!!
B00008K7AM|5.0|The movie i sHilarious i mean Adam Sandler is great but not enough people give credit to Tia and Tamera Mowry on their part i mean i no it was short but it was good. That is not the way they act at all in real life they are really christians and They arent in highschool they are 24 almost 25 so peopl have to give them credit on that movie their lines were funny and they played them right so pleeez give them there propls for movie
B00003CXSP|4.0|Honestly, within the first five minutes of the movie, the credits say \\"based on the novel by Thomas Harris.\\"  To address the complaints of the viewers who only saw the movie and did not bother to read the book, Hannibal and Clarice are kept apart for most of the story.  Changing this in the move would have completly destroyed the story.  The famed dinner scene (wonderfully filmed; nobody can tell which is a puppet and which is the actor), referred to as both comedy and horror, is again WRITTEN that way in the book.  The movie is wonderfully filmed, not as a sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" which it is not, but as a story about Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Sadly, some of the plot elements were diminished or removed, but the movie is beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and amazingly edited.  Of course, the book is better, but this is true of all three stories.  This doesn't make the movies any less disturbing or entertaining, if that is the word, but by reading the books more can be appreciated in the movies.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Well okay, I've never really considered Led Zeppelin pioneers of metal as much as a seriously heavy blues band, but history has deemed them as much and with good reason. When you consider all the bands that have been influenced by them over the past 30+ years who have either faded into obscurity (Kingdom Come, Fastway ) or have since gone on to fame and fortune in their own right (Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots), it's hard to believe that there once was a band Zep that started it all (for better or for worse). Their sound is such a part of our musical vocabulary that it's easy to take it for granted, and they're easily one of the most influencial bands of all time. This DVD set wonderfully illustrates why their music is as potent as ever. Zep could seriously jam and rock, and I do mean hard. The performances are fresh, exciting, and powerful, and feel like an injection of fresh air especially if you've grown up wearing the grooves out of their studio releases and have grown a bit tired of classic rock radio's overexposure of these tracks. The sound quality and picture quality are excellent, save for a few performances where instruments drop out or jump back and forth in the stereo spectrum from speaker to speaker, as in Page's solo performance of &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;. (eliminated if you watch it in stereo rather than surround sound). I found the early performances fascinating, and  what's striking about Zep's performances is just how well they could naturally groove and launch into improvisation given how young they were at the time in '68. They were fearless and played with complete abandon, and sometimes they'd miss the mark but most of the time they soared to a level unrivaled. If I had to offer any negative criticism at all it would be in some of the performances of Zep themselves, which could get a bit meandering and drawn-out in lengthy solos/jams. It probably made for an intimate experience at the actual concerts (and a little substance use probably helped too), but it can get a bit dull watching it on DVD. But they are what they are, so this only serves to show how the band progressed and matured over time.  <br />Overall, a fantastic overview of one of rock's greatest bands. 4-1/2 stars.

B000056K04|3.0|As an infantile fan of DMB, &quot;Everyday&quot; has been a good introduction into his realm. Aside from hearing &quot;I Did It&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; on the radio from time to time, I had never given Dave any thought. But then one day I was walking down the aisle of Media Play, looking for some feel good music that I thought I could jive well too, I came across &quot;Everday&quot;. I figured why not!? I had heard good things about DMB. After listening to the album I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard. The deep, rough vocals provided by Dave Matthews soothed my soul more than anything else out there on the popular music market. Recently, I have begun downloading songs from older albums of DMB and am really enjoying what I am finding. The older stuff seems to be a little bit better than &quot;Everyday&quot; provided, but it is an overall good indroduction piece. I am looking forward to buying/downloading the older albums.
0783229526|4.0|After watching this film I didn't know what to think.<br />This movie is a truly wicked angle in the lives of two drug users in Las Vegas. At first they are supposed to cover the motorcycle event that is taking place there. After that takes place, the movie goes straight to hell.<br />This is simply a view of what these guys do when they're under the influence of drugs. And it can be knee-slapping funny, whether the humor is intentional or not. Even without a coherent plot, the movie keeps the viewer interested in what the main characters will do next.<br />Johnny Depp is excellent, especially his narration. And if you want to see a very well-off Benicio Del Toro, he's all here.
B00000342V|5.0|I've only seen parts of this movie, but I've had this soundrack running around in my head for decades. I finally broke down and bought the CD last in 2002. I love this album, it's still timely (much to our collective shame) wonderfully produced and exquisitely played. Some of the songs on here are out and out Masterpieces. Why Isaac Hayes has an Oscar for &quot;Shaft&quot; and Curtis doesn't for &quot;Superfly&quot; is on of the greatest miscarriges of justice I've ever seen. This entire album is marvelous. Buy it, you can't go wrong.
B000062YAZ|4.0|A great album.  I got this initally in 1988 i think on vinyl.  That copy has gone to history, but it is a potent album that like someone else said has a timeless quality to it.  The meter changes, ambitious chord progressions & good to great song structures give this album a quality that few have.  The violence of Raining Blood.  The potency of Angel of death and postmortem,can make anyone with a likingness to this genre of music to sit down, pay good attention and really enjoy this record.<br />Now a days after I stopped listening to slayer around 1991, have discovered them again; 12 years later.  They say the chinese calendar rotates every 12 years, and similar patterns of life follow.  Well, Slayer is back in my life.  Purchased SOuth of ehaven last year, and Reign in blood brings me excellent memories.<br />To the newer folks getting into Slayer.  Hands down, the most violent band on record and live.  I enjoyed them (Clash of the titans '91).<br />Peace out.<br />= )
B00008PX8P|5.0|Jimmy got it right on the second try.  I finally have a true taste, via sight and sound, of what I never got to see for myself in person.  This group was pure magic, electric magic, and this DVD is a thorough capture of the magic that was Zeppelin.  The audio quality is superb, bodering on unbelieveable.  The songs from Madison Square Garden in 1973 and Earl's Court in 1975 give one an understanding of what true emotion can be derived from music.  A whole, uncut version of Black Dog and Since I've Been Loving You.  I can die in peace now.  For the love of Jimmy, please do not miss this DVD set.  Even if you are not really sure you are or were a Zeppelin fan, this will make a believer out of you.
B00006LIRI|5.0|This is a great follow-up to the 1980-1990 CD from 1998. Chronichling the material that the band made during the 1990s, this absolutely is the 'Best Of' their 1990s era..well almost. <br />Several 'new' songs appear on this collection. The 'new' ones are the new song &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; which is awesome especially the William Orbit mix. The main thing that kind of throws me off a bit is the redoing of the singles from their 1997 album &quot;Pop&quot;. While the redone versions are very good, they don't hold a candle to their previous incarnations available on their parent album. <br />On the other hand, &quot;One&quot; absolutely deserved it's place on this CD as it's one of their most compelling songs of their entire career. A definate classic for the ages this song is. <br />This is quite a well done collection. The 2-CD edition is the version I recommend over this 1-CD version but even this version is worth getting as it offers some new material, unlike the previous collection.
0140177396|5.0|I am a tenth grade student and I recently read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" for a school project. I thought it was an excellent book. I felt that the author, John Steinbeck, did a first class job with this novel. It portrayed the relationship between George and Lennie in a way that made you become very attached to the characters. You wanted to read more to find out if they ever accomplished their goals and to see if their dreams became a reality. George and Lennie are complete opposites; George is a small, quick intelligent man, while Lennie is a man of huge dimensions but has the brain of a child. Throughout the story Lennie acts in ways that infuriate George, but George will always be there for his friend because he knows Lennie needs him to survive.  Lennie can buck barley like no one else because of his pure strength, but would probably starve to death if he didn't have George to provide his daily meals. I think that has to do with why this book has been banned in the past by schools across the country. Some people may be offended by how the mentally challenged person is shown in this story. It seems as though the view being expressed is that people with mental problems can't do anything for themselves. They are also a constant threat to others because they cannot control themselves. Lennie didn't realize what he was doing was wrong until it had gone too far. These are stereotypes of mentally retarded people that some people may believe are reinforced by this novel. They are lead to believe that this book is discriminatory towards the mentally challenged. Parents whom believed this did not want their children reading this book because they did not want them to be exposed to these types of ideas. Also, Curly's wife does not fit the traditional mould. She is unhappy with her marriage and is not completely loyal to her husband like a conventional wife should be. She is always flirting with the men that work on the farm. Some adults believed that this was unacceptable behaviorto expose to children. I don't think that a school today would even consider banning this book because cultural standards have changed greatly from when this book was first published in 1937. I also don't believe that this book should have ever been banned. It is a great book that takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Once you get started it is almost impossible to put down. The ending is also written to perfection. It is unpredictable and is incredibly moving. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it anyone.

B0000584V3|4.0|When I first bought Blackwater Park, I was expecting Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree to have found a heavier version of his own band.  It came very highly recommended from a number of people whose tastes I respect, so when I saw Porcupine Tree last fall, I plunked down [money] for the limited edition version of this.  The next morning, I got in my car and put the CD on.<br />To say I was appalled would be an understatement.  Not being a fan of black or death metal, I wasn't expecting Mikael Akerfeldt to growl.  I shut it off after less than two minutes and thought about putting the CD up for bid on eBay.<br />As much as I hated the vocals, the music kept drawing me back.  So I gave it a second chance, and decided to at least listen to \\"The Leper Affinity\\" from beginning to end.  Eventually, Akerfeldt's low growl gave way to a calmer, more gentle tone, which I wasn't expecting.  I continued to listen to the album, and eventually was able to get over the hurdle Akerfeldt's vocals presented, and have learned to appreciate the album on its own merits.<br />I'm not about to go out and stock up on Deicide, Iced Earth, or Cannibal Corpse, mind you, but Blackwater Park may prove to be the death metal album for those who hate death metal.

B00008OWZC|5.0|These three CDs are filled with classic live Zeppelin performances.  They are worthy of all of the excitement surrounding them.  Plant's vocals are flawless, Page's playing is incredible.  Considering the  band released these at a bargain price to honor their fans, this set is a &quot;must have&quot;.  The only purchase I could recommend over this set would be the new two DVD set (also at a great price).  The DVDs have incredible sound and contain some of the finest moments in the band's history... absolutely amazing!
B00008J4P5|4.0|Hype doesn't make a bad album sound better. Nor does it make a good album sound worse. Judge the album based on it's music. Not on hype. Not on other reviews. Not on other classification. <br />This is a good to great album. Better than classic garage/punk? No. Better than all the pop, hip-pop, and pop-metal we've had to bear with the past 5 or so years. Definitely, yes!<br />I love my White Stripes albums. I love my MC5, Stooges, VU, Ramones, and New York Dolls more. But I still love Jack and Meg's music.
B00007G207|4.0|Cinema Paradiso is one of the best films I have ever seen.  However, I recently bought the New Version on DVD and was completely disappointed with it.  The original plot and version were what made the film so good, the new version is too much.  It tells too much of what happens afterwards and makes the most heart-warming character, Alfredo, seem like a bad guy.  A terrible dissapointment, buy the original if you want to purchase this film.
B000002BPS|5.0|This album is just amazing. All the tracks have somthing special about them. I've had this album for about 7 months and still can't get enough of it^^ although, at the beginning I didn't see much in it like smash. but after listening to it about 5 times i fell for it. <br />1) disclaimer- this is the best intro from offspring. really funny^^ 10/10<br />2) meaning of life- 8/10 i dont see anything VERY catchy in this one, though its popular with most ppl i know. it's just a normal typical offspring song. the lyrics are good tough.<br />3) mota- 8/10 at the beginning i ddn't like this one. but, like the whole album, after listening to it a few times it got better and better.The chorus is good, and it has a different sound to most offspring songs.<br />4) me and my old lady- 10/10 i didn't have to grow on this one, i loved it the 1st time i heard it. Very different to other songs too. Great melody.<br />5) cool to hate- 9/10 really super lyrics^^ pretty funny too, a song about hating everything. The melody is another \\"typical\\" offspring one too.<br />6) leave it behind- 6/10 nah... not that good. it's like \\"somehting to believe in\\" fron Smash. it's funny the way offspring always have one of the \\"worse\\" songs before the best on the album...(dirty magic, come out and play)<br />7) gone away- 11/10 GREAT SONG!! perfect lyrics, perfect melody, perfect vocals, i love it. Song about death of a loved one, the lyrics are really sad in some parts...<br />8) i choose- 10/10 another one that grows on you. cheerful song with good lyrics and melody, and super guitar riffs.<br />9) what was it...o yea , intermission- -/10 i';m not rating this one, its just an intermission^^ like a continuation to the intro.<br />10) all i want- 9/10 cool song, but maybe a bit too short.It has nice lyrics.<br />11) way down the line- 10/10 like \\"i choose\\". ANother 1 with really good lyrics^^. dunno why, but t seems quite long when you listen to it  although it's pretty short... the guiter riffs are good.<br />12) don't pick it up- 10/10 super song + hilarious lyrics. reminds me a lot of \\"what happened to you\\" , but i think this one's better.<br />13) amazed- 10/10 lyrics may not be as good as some others but the melody is reallly good. Darker song.<br />14) change the world- 10/10 normally i'd give it 9, but because of the guitar solo (from thee end of \\"smash\\") it gets 10. The main melody isn't as good as the rest but...<br />BUY BUY BUY!!! if you liked smash, you'll be amazed by this one!<BR>the album has a lot of range, from the sad gone away to the funny cool to hate and slower amazed.<BR>but thats just my opinion...
B000002MUW|4.0|This album, to me, just has a lot of warmth to it, if that makes any sense. Compare it to the cold, static sounds of \\"American Life\\", this album just flows beautifully. I remember buying this album when I was 11 years old, i played it non-stop! A lot of fans regard this as Madonna's r+b album. She recruited some of the most popular r+b producers of the time and experimented with more soulful sounds and hip-hop beats. This album was nominated for Pop album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It's a really good album overall with a lot of strong songs. Anyway, check it out.
0375823360|5.0|I stumbled across this series totally by accident. Thinking that they were just going to be the typical teen fantasy, I wrote them off and didn't give them a chance.  Until one day, I decided to try it. I'm not a good writer so my review won't do this series justice. I won't go into the plot of this book but to say that it follow a young girl's adventures and this statement is far too simple to describe this series.  No matter your age, this book grabs your attention, pulls you in, and makes you think!  Be prepare for a good surprise. This series isn't what you think it is. It's sooo much more than some teenager fantasy.  I still find that my mind wonders back to this series quite often. There are plenty of other reviews to say more of the books, but I have to say that Mr. Pullman is a genius. Thank you for writing this superb series.
0385335482|4.0|whoa! this book is hilarious! it's a great summer read and even better for a &quot;shopaholic&quot; like i am!
B00005JLRT|4.0|When &quot;Nemesis&quot; came out, I went to see it on the opening day, expecting nothing less than greatness. After all, the last film had left me somewhat unimpressed, and it seemed as though &quot;Insurrection&quot; was a movie that, honestly, could have just been a two part regular episode. The franchise realized this too, and they decided that Nemesis was going to have to be much more of an action movie - a movie with a villain we can all hate. <br />Well, Shinzon plays that role quite well, although the fact that he is the clone of Picard is a bit ludicrious. Plot holes aside, Shinzon fills in the gap that had been missing from Insurrection. He brings a certain aura of darkness into the film, from his looks to his voice and actions. His people, the Remans, also look magnificently dark. His intent is to destroy Earth to cripple the Federation, and the Enterprise (specifically, Picard), has to stop him before he gets there. <br />Patrick Stewart must have been bored with all of the speeches that he usually gives, because there are a couple of moments in the film when Picard is out of character (riding around in a dune buggy, anyone?) Even so, his acting talents are still up to par and he adds the life needed to keep this movie interesting. While there are scenes in which he will stop to take a philisophical standpoint, most of the movie is him making gutsy decisions that seem a bit out of place. <br />Aside from the great Picard/Shinzon rivalry, however, the only other character with real time in the movie is Brent Spiner, aka Data. This movie seems to have forgotten that he does now have an emotion chip, but that's forgivable, as the ending seems more touching when he is shown as making an ethical, noble decision in his quest to become more human. <br />But here the problems start to set in. Every other character from cast and crew is probably around for only 10 minutes, max. Fans of Micheal Dorn or Jonathan Frakes, or Marina Sirtis or Gates McFadden, will be sorely disappointed that their favorite characters did not get more screen time. After all, if this is &quot;a generation's final journey&quot;, you would expect to see more of the generation included. This wasn't a large problem for me as I am a fan of Stewart, and there is plenty of him in the movie. But for those looking for Worf to get into a hand to hand fight, be warned. Even Riker's fight scene is short, confusing, and ultimately forgetable as the audience becomes more interested in the fight between Shinzon and Picard than anything else. <br />In a way, this movie does draw some aspects of the Next Generation to a close - Riker and Troi are finally going to tie the knot (although we never see it) and Riker is becoming captain of his own vessel. Data leaves, but in his place is the B4, so there's still something that could be developed there. The long standing rivalry between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire may finally be coming to an end, although it really does seem to be wishful thinking. <br />So, in the end, what does this movie really accomplish? Aside from a view little wrap-ups, nothing really seems to be resolved, and I, for one, believe there will be at least one more movie in the franchise (after all, the promo said &quot;A generations final journey begins&quot;, not ends). If it were truly the final movie, I'd say it was a slight disappointment. If, however, it's not, then I'd say it delievers plenty of action for the audience and opens up new directions for the crew. <br />P.S: Should another movie be made, I suggest using Q as the villain. John De Lancie always was the best mysterious supreme being.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I might be wrong, but I think American Life is an awesome album.  I think its better and more innovative than Music.  It's fresh and different.  The whole CD flows progressively well from track to track.  \\"I'm so Stupid\\" is something I was never expecting Madonna to record, its very Shirley Manson, but I love it.  Overall I think the CD rocks, is free of ...fillers, and left me very pleased.  A lot of people have said the cd is very self absorbed, but isn't that what Madonna and fans are all about?  I know I relate.
B00003CX5P|5.0|come on people, this is perfect. All you questions from ep IV-VI will be answered in this movie. It is just perfect, especially the awesome endbattle with darth maul. Real SW like!!! A must buy for everyone.

0385504209|5.0|I really liked this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I thought this was one of the best stories I've read for quite some time (ok the plot stretches a little thin at the end, but ...).<br />I'm really looking forward to Dan Brown's next book.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|An Underrated Classic comedy about two people in love and their attempts at making an old, decrepit house into their dream home.<BR>This is a movie that all homeowners will be able to relate to. And, it's a terrific fun-time movie for the whole family.
0385504209|5.0|I purchased this book after reading a great review.  I'm glad I did.  This is a biblical/archeology type mystery with lots of<br />information about secret societies and the art world.  It was hard to put down.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I dont get why everyones slamming it so much--- a couple of bad reviews from major critics and now everyone thinks that way.  Its certainly not her best album, but its not \\"absolute trash\\" in any way.  It seems like she has taken a turn for the worse ever since she married Guy Ritchie (did anyone see swept away?) But this album is probably going to go down as her least-selling album to date, selling about half of what \\"music\\" did in its first week. While the song \\"American Life\\" in no way lyrically protests the war, it just wasnt a good idea to release the song in the midst of all the hollywood controversy with the war.  If this was released maybe a little earlier or later radio would have picked up the lead song.  Of course it isnt the strongest song ever, but its very catchy and could spread to radio.  The lyrics are shallow at best, i know, but the music makes up for it.  Mirwais is a genius, and I am a big fan of him, owning his acclaimed solo album \\"Production\\" as well.  But while the lyrics are lacking, the beats are very original, and while similar to music, they are still not like much of anything you could find in music today. no one realizes that this folk/techno thing is actually original and innovative.  But compared to the other albums, especially coming off of 2 of the strongest albums in her career, this album is very lacking.  It feels hashed together last minute. But oh well, its still madonna.
0807205583|4.0|Sabriel was an awesome novel that left many readers hanging with questions and anticipation.  The same can be said for Lirael.  I was quite skeptical when it first came out because sequels usually aren't nearly as good as the first one.  However, this wasn't the case.  It took a while to get used to some new characters, and put the old ones on hold, but the story line was very gripping.  Lirael doesn't answer all of the questions left from Sabriel, but it does introduce a new abhorsen and foes.  It also creates the same chilling mood with more necromancers and greater dead.  By the end I couldn't wait for the third and final novel to be released, which I'm sure will be just as good.

B000001EC1|5.0|Being a huge fan of the band, I know this greatest hits collection could've even been better than it was, but this is a good start for newer fans. In my opinion, some glaring omissions were: \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", \\"Wild in the Streets\\", \\"Let it Rock\\", \\"Blood on Blood\\", \\"Born to Be My Baby\\", \\"Living in Sin\\", \\"In these Arms\\" and \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\\" if you were just going on popular tracks alone. But not too shabby boys!!!
B00005K3GS|5.0|this cd is just sensational, full of catchy house beats, my favourite song is &quot;chillin&quot;, a stand out house track that really sound good and gives me goosebumps when i listen to it.
B00006CXSS|4.0|BAND OF BROTHERS is an excellent (especially for television)adaptation of an excellent book, but with a different mood and style from the book, reminicent of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with its eerie, grainy and choppy combat camera work. Like that movie, BAND OF BROTHERS leaves one thinking about each episode long after viewing. The actors are not well known, which adds to the realism. I can't say that I actually enjoyed watching the series, but am glad that I, well, survived it.<BR>   However, my main reason for writing this review is to disagree with some points in a previous review, that by a &quot;German infantry officer.&quot; He makes some controversial, but interesting, observations about the war and the German army that I found myself agreeing with on many points, although some are too general (There WERE strong, experienced and well-equipped German units in France, and the Germans certainly respected American units like the 101st Airborne for good reason).  With all due respect, though, I must hotly debate one statement he made in regard to the bombing of Dresden. This refers to the alleged strafing by American P-51 Mustangs of civilians trying to escape the fires at the riverbank. Germans who were there (some of whom I have personally spoken to) have always disputed this accusation, and indeed, after the fall of the Soviet Union, proof emerged from KGB documents and former East Bloc intelligence officers that the entire episode was fabricated by &quot;disinformatzia&quot; experts to discredit the United States, especially in Germany. I am referring only to the supposed strafing episode, not the larger issue of the horrible firebombing of Dresden, which has always, and hopefully will be continued, to be researched, written about, and debated.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin live. The people who actually witnessed this phenomenon remember it with a sort of reverant awe. Although, listening to their live album output (up 'til today) the band sounds sloppy and bored. Sure, there have been some muddy bootlegs promising hope. I have many of these. <br />After popping in this new release in my thumping car stereo, a chill went up my spine, like only Zep can produce. First off, compared to the bootlegs, the sound is crisp and THICK. Bonham pounds your ears out. The performance is wizardly. Plant and Page at the top of their game. Unlike the BBC Sessions, this version of the band is a little older and tour-worn. They're spot on. They're also in their favorite part of the world, Southern California, and it SOUNDS like it. I'm sure the groupies were impressed with this set. Over the Hills, never a live staple, actually tops the album version. It EXPLODES. Dazed, well, those who are familiar with the live versions of this can expect another doozy. The acoustic numbers show the remarkable range that NO band, NO band has come close to since.<br />In all, this is an absolute must have for any rock and roll fan. Can't wait to watch the DVD. Peace.
B00008PX8P|5.0|like oh my jesus. this dvd is a must for anyone. i mean anyone. the quality of the sound, picture, just everything is great. watching the band progress from how they performed when they were just starting out is insane and still having that great energy when their time was up making music is just unbelievable. watching jimmy page do his song \\"White Summer\\" is the most amazing thing in the world. it shows off why hes such a great guitarist till this date. the solo of moby dick from John Bonham on the drums is a lesson to all drummers that you dont have to sound heavy just know your equipment well and you can outshine everyone else by your extraordinary skills at being the best at what you are. same goes for any instrument. anyone can add effects and the whole get up to make them sound better but when you sit there and just explode out with it by using the basics it shows how much better you are at it then relying on other things to make you the best. Robert plant never loses his great voice it just seems to get better more or less through all the concerts. still rocking out as always. John paul jones is still being all like \\"yeah im here im rockin\\" vibe. this has everything youd ever want from a dvd of your favorite band live. its just perfect. a must for EVERYONE. BUY IT NOW! ...
0140177396|4.0|This book is the powerful story of two young men, George and Lennie, trying to fulfill their longtime dream of owning their own land. In the meantime, they work at a small ranch to try to gain enough money to buy their own land... <BR>          A major theme that has caused controversy among many schools throughout the country is its bad language. According to Christopher Moore ... there are over 122 curse words in the book and is thought to be an \\"unChristian mindset\\" for children. Some other controversial themes that have caused the book to be banned in many schools are its \\"...moral statement(s), treatment of the retarded, and the violent ending.\\"  <BR>...         Personally, I thought that this was a very good book that showed true frienship, through \\"thick and thin\\" and I don't think that it should be banned in schools.

B00006JJ1O|2.0|i am a big album buyer and collector and i won't recommend buying this album because of the hype it got over ONE SONG....&quot;all the things she said&quot;. the album itself is not nearly as good as they say if you've listened to it. I recommend doing your research before buying cd's and listen beforehand. <br />they have a hit song &quot;all the things she said&quot; which is fantastic no doubt but that won't make up for an average done album.
B000003S09|4.0|There's no denying the impact this album has had on the rock world.  &quot;21st Century&quot;, &quot;Epitaph&quot; and &quot;The Court of the Crimson King&quot; are timeless mastepieces.  I'm not a metal fan, I despise Maryln Manson and the like, but Greg Lakes violent sound pleases me; like his work with ELP, yet with Crimson even more aggressively so.<BR>&quot;I talk to the Wind&quot; and &quot;MoonChild&quot; have great melodies but the repetitiveness and &quot;flowerchildy&quot; themes are tiring(and yes I know this album was made in the 60's, but for a band like this to write such lyrics is just plain wrong).  For this minimal flaw I have dropped my grade to 4 stars, despite how much I respect this album.
6305882592|5.0|I was fortunate to see this film when it first came out, when I was close to the age of young Harold of the film. There are not many films I can say really had a positive, deep and meaningful effect on me the way this film did. WOW...!  Ruth Gordon is absolutely DELIGHTFUL and magical as Maude, Bud Cort \\"just right\\" for the part of Harold. Oh, we should all have a \\"Maude\\" in our lives!  Now it is 30 years since I saw the film for the first time, and I now feel the same as I did then: I want to be like Maude in my old age -- creative, alive and enjoying life profoundly. The sexual implication in the film (that 17 yr old boy made love with, and fell in love with, an 80 year old woman) would only bother the most repressive of minds. It is pure poetry. What DID bother me was the ending, which I will give away now only because I feel it is the only real flaw of the film. Maude, at such a height of enjoyment of her life, chose to commit suicide. Yet even this disappointing ending cannot blow out the beautiful light of this film. The musical score with songs written and sung by Cat Stevens are just superb!  This movie is funny, stimulating, wild, profound and serious all at once. This is one of the few films I would ever pay full dollar for: It's a classic, and it's that good!
B00005JMK0|5.0|Boy gets girl with the help of a quirky computer. \\"It's alive.\\"  If nothing else, you have to feel good at the end of the movie or there is just something wrong with your demeanor.  Great 80's soundtrack.  Written well, acted well and even if the story line is a little off the wall you have to fall in love with Edgar (computer). Considering the way computers are taking over our lives, this film is ingenious in the way we are shown how a computer can change your life and even help you become a better person in the long run. I wish I had a computer just like Edgar!<br />All mine ever says is, \\"Goodbye Master\\" when I turn him off!  This movie is priceless!
B000001IQH|5.0|I say it is Rancid's best work, SO FAR...you never know what those guys are gonna make on their newest album, i remember when i first heard Rancid,I thought they were to hard for me, and instead listened to nofx. as I matured into a bigger and better punk rock fan, I began to like Rancid more. I was in a local music store, looking through the c.ds, looking for nofx, when i found the only c.d i didnt have in their nofx cds was the rancid and nofx split record. So i bought it and then went to another store, since i was with my parents, hahaha, went into the store, ploped myself onto the floor and popped the c.d in. i was blown away, i never knew how much i would love rancid, and i still do. That c.d was great, BUT ''...and out come the wolves is better''. All the songs on it are energetic and 'fun' (haha)I also was inspired to pick up a rancid c.d because i saw a kid in a theme park, and he had a rancid shirt on, then i remembered the time i listened to rancid, and then i ended up looking for a c.d by NOFX  and instead got 2 for the price of one. And i;d suggest any one who likes punk or ska to pick this c.d up, i mean i payed alot of money for it (about 20 bux)and wen i put it into my cd player, i couldnt help but bob my head along to the music, and tap my feet...hahaha,id suggest u buy this cd
0060090383|5.0|Marian Keyes, I believe is the best writer in her genre today.  I have read other British/Irish Chick-Lit books as it were by authors such as Jane Green, Anna Maxted and Lisa Jewell, but Marian Keyes is by far the best!!  I love her fast paced writing style and her turn of phrase.  Many times while reading this book, I found myself laughing out loud. The way Ms. Keyes uses dialogue and descriptions of people and events throughout her storytelling is truly masterful.  Her characters always sparkle and there is a real authenticity to them.  One can tell just by reading a couple of chapters tht the author really cares about them.<br />Rachel Walsh is a 27-year old woman who hits rock bottom and is forced to face her addictions, her issues with denial, and her life that has come apart at the seams.  She must leave New York and travel back to her native Ireland (against her will, I might add because of course she thinks there is nothing wrong with her) to enter a treatment center.  Right from the start, the reader is drawn into Rachel's world and we follow her roller-coaster ride of a journey through addiction, denial, loss, acceptance, and redemption.  I think the idea that just because this book is written about drug addiction and treatment, that it can't or shouldn't be funny is wrong  This book is so good because it is funny and because it is real and because the reader learns to care for an inassuming heroine.  I am a huge fan and will keep reading as long as she writes.  So, keep 'em coming Marian!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|The 3 CD set is fantastic from beginning to end, but here are some words on the more notable tracks. <br />Heartbreaker that has a nice jam that has Page wandering into Tull's tune Bouree of all things before coming back into raucous rock finish. Since I've Been Loving You was a staple of their tours and this version comes across better than the live version from The Song Remains The Same movie. The Bron-Yr-Stomp that finishes disc 1 manages to have the feel of being performed in a pub somewhere with the whole crowd stomping along and still fill the staduim it's actually played in. The Dazed And Confused is 25 minutes long and delivers with some nice soloing.<br />The best is saved for disc 3 with a 23 minute opener of Whole Lot Of Love that medleys it's way through a couple of rock classics (Let's Have A Party and Hello Mary-Lou, Goodbye Heart) and one lesser known blues number (Going Down Slow) and Plant brings it right back to the tale of the hard woman to finish it off. The closer tune of the set, Bring It On Home is fitting tune (hailing back to Willie Dixon who wrote it and to their studio version of so long ago) and is a great example of their balance of blues and Zepplin's unique rock sound.<br />Buy this one and you're sure to have it on repeat for a couple of weeks to come.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Led Zeppelin had the reputation of being one of the best live bands in its time.  While its albums could vary from the great (Led Zeppelin IV) to the confused (Houses of the Holy), their live shows were terrific.  But it has been 30 years since these shows were recorded, and many people's tastes have changed.  So how do these CDs hold up today?<br />To start with positive statements , the sound quality is excellent.  Similarly, the performances of most of songs are of album quality -- this is not a case of an artist or record company scrapping the bottom of the barrel to make some money by releasing something the band would have never put out in its prime.  The acoustic songs, which the group tended to drop from their later performances, also work very well.  The song selection is good, and everything on disc 1 is excellent.<br />The weakness of the CD shows up on discs 2 and 3, with the inclusion of a 25 minute version of Dazed and Confused, a 19 minute version of Moby Dick (mostly a drum solo), and a 23 minute performance of Whole Lotta Love.  While the inclusion of this material accurately reflects the group's performances, they seem self indulgent today.  The structure of the jam songs is weak (in contrast to extended performances by the Allman Brothers, where live performances seemed well-thought out), with some weird sounds thrown in mainly to sound weird.  I think you had to be there to appreciate them.  It is hard to imagine that many people are going to listen to Moby Dick more than one or twice.  <br />Still, the band is great shape througout the CD; Page is consistently inventive, Plant in fine voice, and John Bonham is, well, John Bonham -- a somewhat heavy handed drummer but perfect for this group.  John Paul Jones was always something of a cipher -- that may be unfair, but he did not contribute much to the group's live performance.<br />If you are a Zeppelin fan, this CD set is essential.  If you are a more casual listener, the fine performance of thegroup and the fairly reasonable of the group makes this a good addition to your collection.

B00008OWZC|5.0|My mother will tell you that I have been a Led Zeppelin fanatic since before I was born - if a zygote can truly hear the sounds from outside. Of course, the only thing missing from the Zep catalog was a good official live document. As we know, *The Song Remains the Same* just can't cut it. Everyone knows that those performances were recorded near the end of a massive world tour, and the band was dog tired and probably apathetic about the whole project. Now we finally have a true mindblowing live set, with these performances recorded at two shows in 1972, when the band was just reaching their peak and weren't yet too big for their britches. The stipulation that these recordings remained \\"undiscovered\\" for thirty years seems real fishy to me, but I won't jinx it, because these performances are a revelation for serious Zep fans who don't feel like wading through sketchy bootlegs.<br />The sound quality here isn't quite as amazing as it's been hyped to be, and even the performances themselves aren't totally flawless. But the success of this package is at the spiritual level. The band is ruthless and hungry and interested in moving the audience's minds as well as their bodies. One major problem with Zep's live performances, especially later in their career, was the fact that on stage Jimmy Page couldn't replicate his intense multi-tracking gimmicks of the studio. But here Jimmy was still able to make up for that disparity with sheer heaviness and off-the-cuff improvisation that rarely missed a beat. \\"Immigrant Song\\" features a brainmelting solo that was not present in the studio version, and Jimmy unexpectedly throws in a brief round of classical guitar during the raucous solo in \\"Heartbreaker.\\" The rest of the band was at the peak of their prowess as well. John Paul Jones is the unsung hero of the three acoustic tracks that conclude disc one, supplying very elegant melodies on the mandolin; while he and John Bonham effectively hold down the fort (in surprisingly funky ways) while Page and Plant are off on a rampage. The 19-minute version \\"Moby Dick\\" features at least 17 minutes of soloing by Bonham, and he actually manages to keep it interesting.<br />As a lifelong Zep obsessive who was tragically born too late to see them live in their prime, all I can say is... It's about time! Life is good.ays) while Page and Plant are off on a rampage.

B00008OWZC|5.0|The 3 CD set is fantastic from beginning to end, but here are some words on the more notable tracks. <br />Heartbreaker that has a nice jam that has Page wandering into Tull's tune Bouree of all things before coming back into raucous rock finish. Since I've Been Loving You was a staple of their tours and this version comes across better than the live version from The Song Remains The Same movie. The Bron-Yr-Stomp that finishes disc 1 manages to have the feel of being performed in a pub somewhere with the whole crowd stomping along and still fill the staduim it's actually played in. The Dazed And Confused is 25 minutes long and delivers with some nice soloing.<br />The best is saved for disc 3 with a 23 minute opener of Whole Lot Of Love that medleys it's way through a couple of rock classics (Let's Have A Party and Hello Mary-Lou, Goodbye Heart) and one lesser known blues number (Going Down Slow) and Plant brings it right back to the tale of the hard woman to finish it off. The closer tune of the set, Bring It On Home is fitting tune (hailing back to Willie Dixon who wrote it and to their studio version of so long ago) and is a great example of their balance of blues and Zepplin's unique rock sound.<br />Buy this one and you're sure to have it on repeat for a couple of weeks to come.

0671510991|4.0|When reading \\"Diplomacy\\", one cannot help but be awestruck by Dr. Kissinger's grasp and passion for history. The wealth of raw knowledge; the depth of understanding of major players' motivations and goals; the discipline of thought necessary analyze over three hundred years worth of Western political history -- these abilities are, simply put, impressive.<br />In this tome, Kissinger details the history of Western diplomacy since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that ended the Thirty Years' War, albiet from an American point of view. Interestingly, he starts the book by comparing the foreign policy philosophies of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, i.e. foreign policy by way of Realpolitick (or raison d'etat, depending on the era) or of pure morals and international law, respectively. The battles between these two schools of thought is the focus of the book. Frustratingly, the book takes no real position on this central point. No wonder Michiko Kakutami described the book as \\"often vexing.\\" <br />The majority of this book is quite enjoyable to read. Dr. Kissinger's writing is elegant and skillful, and he often writes an engrossing narrative. Occasionally, however, the book can become a burden to read, especially when it describes a time period that the reader does not find particularily interesting. In these sections the rich detail can become overly-rich. This is almost unavoidable given its massive scope. <br />Kissinger also glazes over some events that I thought would receive more detailed coverage, especially the peace between Israel and Egypt during the Carter administration. He seemed to have made a very concrete decision not to touch Middle Eastern diplomatic history, which now, more than ever, seems central to American foreign policy. <br />This is not a book that should be tackled by everyone. It assumes that the reader has a firm grasp on modern Western history, not stopping to define terms or provide a narrative of the events; it instead jumps right intoevents and begins to explain the nuanced positions of key nations. The book can also become bogged down in detail. That being said, for a student of history, this book provides the reader of the insight of a true master. It also provides unique insight into American foreign policy, which seems destined to be hypocritical because of the inherent contradiction between Realpolitick and Wilsonian ideals, both of which American trys, in vain, to implement. <br />****
B00008PX8P|5.0|Let me just start off by saying you should jump out of your chair and buy this DVD NOW! I have been consistantly avoiding Led Zeppelin's music for over a decade and a half now. Having grown up with it on the radio every day, I had grown tired of it. I can remember playing the Jackson 5 board game with friends at the tender age of 7 while our host's older brother came in with II (on the day of its release)and blasted it on the stereo. It was love at first listen. I must of sung every Zep song at least once in the number of bands I was in growing up, right up to the stuff off of \\"In through the out door\\". Although I was on to playing fresher music, I watched Zebra play Zep until 5 in the morning at Hammerheads on Long Island on more than one occasion. But eventually I grew tired of hearing the same studio tracks on classic radio again and again and drifted to newer music and stations that didn't play all the old stuff time and again. After this long hiatus, I was shopping for DVD's yesterday and I decided to pick up a copy this for my sons. Something for me to play for them in the future when they might appreciate it. My God, I just wanted to look at a song or two and ended up listening to a lot in its entirety and a lot of sampling for three hours straight. This DVD is simply amazing. I don't care how cynical or jaded you've become, you'll love this experience. The sound is incredible and the video is better than you might expect. [...]!

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney sure knows how to do DVD.  &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is considered by many to be the best animated film of all-time and Disney definitely gives it an in-depth treatment on DVD.  Both the original and the expanded IMAX edition of the film are included on the fist disc and the movie looks amazing.  The colors are so vivid and they almost jump right off the screen.  The sound is amazing too, especially on the big musical numbers like &quot;Be Our Guest.&quot;  The special features on disc 2 are pretty good too, with several small documentaries about the life of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; from fairy tale to pre-production to the actual movie and even on to the Broadway version now playing in New York City.<br />Fans of Disney movies, cartoons, musicals, and just very good movies in general should without a doubt check this special edition out!
B000002LQR|5.0|This album is pure genius. From the funky slap of Flea to the excellent guitar playing of Frusciante, this album is one of the best albums of the 90's. Makes you want to listen from Power of Equality, to the end of the Robert Johnson Cover They're Red Hot, this is one amazing cd.

I currently have it on CD.  <br />I don't have the musical vocabulary to tell you what is wrong.  However, this is not the Bat Out Of Hell that you know.  The instruments sound good.  The vocals sound good.  The only thing I can say is that the new 5.1 mix and new Stereo mix have changed this near perfect album into something else -- and its not as good.<br />Do yourself a favor, skip this SACD.  It seems like a rush job.  Get Every Breath You Take (Police) (SACD) or Synchronicity (Police) (SACD) or Boston (Boston) (SACD) or Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) (SACD) or Satch Plays Fats (SACD) or Sea Change (Beck) (SACD) or In Blue (The Coors) (DVD-A) or Tigerlilly (Natalie Merchant) (DVD-A) if you want good examples of what high definition audio can be.

B00008OWZC|5.0|While the 1976 Led Zepplein live album, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" showcased the band's live prowess positively, \\"How the West Was Won\\" is better in sound quality, song quantity, and song selection. The buzzing guitar that remains active throughout \\"Song\\" is from time to time harsh on the ears and could even be unlistenable. \\"How the West Was Won\\" plays Jimmy Page's live guitar sound with a polish, and the songs from this album sound as if they were recorded live at the LA Forum/Long Beach Arena in 2003 rather than 1973. There are 3 completely full discs here, as compared to only 2 full CDs of music included with the \\"Song\\" package. While many of the tracks from \\"Song\\" are on this collection, such as \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Rock and Roll,\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" gems such as \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" that weren't previously released in live form, showcase Zeppelin in their finest hour. For [$$$], \\"How the West Was Won\\" is a steal for classic rock fans. This is the rock and roll Holy Grail of albums that reveals the greatness that was Led Zeppelin in concert. And it might be the best live rock and roll album ever released from the greatest hard rock band ever put together.
B00008CLOA|4.0|I don't think I need to add anything about the content of this classic album. It's a great album ... enough said. However, sound quality of this 30th Anniversary remaster has a split personality. Kenneth Stuart said it well in his review about the quality of the CD layer of this \\"Dark Side\\" ... not very good. Better versions have been done. I agree with him that the UK Harvest CD of \\"Dark Side\\" is very good and not available now. The version in Sony's 'Shine On' Pink Floyd box set. is good also but expensive. However, the SACD layer of this 30th Anniversary remaster is outstanding (5 stars). Very natural, open, and dynamic sound. If you have a SACD player buy this one! <br />Why isn't Kenneth Stuart' s review a spotlight review when 69 of 86 found it helpful? Maybe his \\"2 star\\" rating of the CD layer was hurting record sales ... Ya Think?
B000006NXP|5.0|There are few symphonies as melodic and memorable as Brahms's Fourth, arguably his best. And, although there are other good performances (Walter, Abbado, Sanderling) of this wonderful piece, Kleiber is a master at clarifying the Classical era influences upon Brahms in this performance. True, Brahms was considered a Romantic, but like Beethoven, he could not completely escape the era that pervaded his early life. Walter in his performance of this symphony omitted this Classical nuance, and although his interpretation is intriguing and also beautiful, I feel that Kleiber's is more representative and compelling.<br />The sonics on this digital recording are excellent. Unlike earlier DG recordings, the strings are sweeping without the \\"edge\\" that made you want to soften the treble. In a nutshell this is a great symphony performed magnificently in stunning sound quality.

B000001ES4|5.0|&quot;Once upon a time, two children overheard their parents plan to abandon them in a forest, as they could not afford to feed them.  But the children cleverly gathered small white stones, and on their long journey into the forest, they secretly dropped them onto the ground.  At nightfall, left alone, the moon illuminated the white stones, and the reflection became their guiding light.  So the fairytale about Hansel and Gretel goes.<br />Each song on the album can be compared to a white stone.  Listen and let them lead you into your own secret garden.&quot; Fionnuala Sherry &amp; Rolf Lovland<br />How 'White Stones' touches me goes beyond words. Every track is a treasure. Suffice to say, it will be with me forever. I've heard lots of new age music but this is one of the very best because of so many factors not just technically but emotionally.  Music, for me, should balance both of these aspects and White Stones does perfectly.  I'm a violinist and have heard many others but there is something very Special about Fionnuala.  She plays with passion from her heart.  She has played violin since the age of three.  Her violin is obviously her best friend.  She has enormous talent, unbelievable expression and is one of the most vivacious players ever.  Rolf is the master mind/composer and an exquisite pianist who leads the band like a conductor but gives Fionnuala so much room.  Them playing together is a truly a vision. I own 'A Night With Secret Garden' Dvd which I whole-heartedly recommend if you love this cd and want to see a violinist dance about and smile instead of the typical orchestra setting. 'White Stones' is for everyone who loves beautiful Music, but if you're a musician, I think you will especially appreciate this.<br />Each song on White Stones is truly the definition of Beauty. My favorite song is 'Poeme.' When I first got this cd, I couldn't get past it and it was only the second track! I listened over and over. 'Poeme' is one of those rare tracks that I have come across in my lifetime that stirs my heart so deeply, I often weep at the true, pure, unbridled emotion of it! I can play it on my violin and when I do I feel so wonderful.  I wish I had the sheet music of the entire cd, it would be so much simpler.  If anyone knows where I can get this, please email me and you will have a friend for life!<br />There are liner notes about each song and I want to end with the note to 'Poeme': &quot;A song without words - an unspoken story.

I'm no music critic, but as a fan, it doesn't get any better than this.

0446677450|3.0|Robert T. Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad presents the differences between the ways the rich and the poor and middle class think.  Growing up with two dads, his own educated dad, and his friends rich dad, he is able to compare the two groups mindsets and presents his reader with ways to approach money.  He emphasizes the fact that today's normal education is not enough because it does not teach people enough about money, rather is teaches people how to get safe secure jobs.  One of the main problems he suggests is the different classes understanding of assets and liabilities.  He also explains that people need to take risks by investing in things such as stocks, mutual funds, and real estate in order to make money.  The book presents ways that one should approach money and change their actions and thinking in order to be more successful in attaining money.  The book is interesting but how much of it is realistic is probable debatable.
B000002BQK|5.0|I've come to realize the great talent of Mariah Carey from an early stage of her career, when she sang Vision Of Love on every possible Talk Show in america. Since then, she's been through some changes, to say the least. Her music took a whole new direction back when this albums was released. Up to that point, Mariah Carey was the undisputed queen diva, beating any other competition, both in sales and radio-play (she earned 15 #1's in less than 10 years). Unlike fellow divas Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, Mariah was not afraid of taking chances; Butterfly marks the beginning of a new era and the arrival of the new Mariah. No more standing on a stage in a black night gown singing power ballads. Mariah broke free from the prison-like home she shared with hubby Tommy Mottola to seek for a new life. And indeed, the change was immediate. Reception for the album was overwhelming and it sold millions around the world. Mariah earned 2 #1 hits from this album, Honey (an up-tempo R&B track) and My All (a latin power-ballad). Butterfly includes some of the best work Mariah has ever recorded; \\"The Roof\\" is a sexy, lushful R&B song about past love; \\"Breakdown\\" is probably the best and most innovative song Mariah has ever done; \\"Butterfly\\" is one of the most cherished Mariah ballads ever. Personal, emotional, beautiful. \\"Outside\\", which closes the album is a hidden jam. It's well written and features some amazing vocals. If you wanna hear the best from Mariah Carey, look no further than this.
1565847873|5.0|One of the previous reviewers mentioned that \\"Dogs of Riga\\" might be difficult for Americans because of its pervasive 'Scandinavian gloom'. True, I think, but what makes this novel even more unsettling is the thick, murky atmostphere of mistrust and suspicion depicted in the countries of Eastern<BR>Europe in the early 1990's. It is difficult for Americans to empathize with the fear and suspicion of those times, which is the setting of this novel.  The repressive and grim background  is indeed the leading force in the novel: it is a force which still impacts life in much of the Eastern Bloc today, accompanied by suspicion and corruption.<br />Against that setting, then, the characters assume heroic proportions. The desire of Wallander to do his job well and bring closure to the deaths, the courage of Major Liepa to confront corruption, and the passion of Baiba Liepa to revenge the murder of her husband--all assume epic dimensions when viewed against the social backdrop. The plot is thickened by the lies, fear, and deceit by which even the ordinary citizen must survive. The labyrinth is constructed with masterful prose and an observant eye, hallmarks of Mankell's craft as a writer.<br />\\"Dogs of Riga\\" is a classic of the genre. More complex and better crafted than the typical police procedural, it is a 'must read' for the epicurean mystery reader.
B00008RH3L|4.0|For those, like myself, who have waited, impatiently, for the DVD release of this film your day has come. The classic Coen Brothers quotable is better than ever. Once again we can bring the characters into our home and discussions, all the while telling the nay sayers to 'dangle'. A film that has reached such cult status for it's plot, casting, cinematography, and dialogue should not be missed. The transfer is wonderful. Clear and crisp images. Great colors and, as expected, a huge upgrade in sound quality. The special features are the only weak point, in my opinion. (There could've been more.) Beggars can't be choosers though and to have such an important film made available to the DVD generation is just what the 'genre' ordered. Great job!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|For those of us who weren't old enough to see Zep live when we were kids, this is a nice treat.  It sounds great and it really showcases just how mighty Led Zeppelin were, in their prime.  Just wait until you hear the version of the Immigrant Song on this set.  It ROCKS! I wasn't sure about buying the DVD, but after listening to this disc, I'm buying!  It puts any of the previous live recordings of them to shame, mainly because it is like a freeze frame of when there was no other band that could touch them (and personally, I don't think any other band has reached these heights since!).  If you have always appreciated Zep's music, don't even hesitate. If you are a kid just dicovering them for the first time, I can't really think of a better starting point.
0440237688|3.0|I had high hopes for this book, because I love Lois Lowry's Anastasia Krupnik series. Unfortunately, what started out a promising, fascinating read really fizzled at the end. The author did a great job creating a Utopian world that isn't all it seems to be, but I think she copped out towards the end. The resolution of the story is too ambigious for my liking. When I invest the time and effort into reading a challenging story like this one, I expect a payoff at the end, and this book disappointed me. It's one of those \\"Well, the ending is whatever you want it to be.\\"  If you don't mind that kind of story, then go ahead and read it. If you prefer your stories more neatly packaged and fleshed-out, skip it.
0380002930|5.0|I would like to state first off that THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK.  Not only is the story more complicated for younger readers (and more than a simple \\"adventure\\"), its subject matter and themes are serious and not relevant to most children.  That is evident in all the previous reviews by children (who were usually forced to read the book in school) who either call the book boring, too long or stupid.  It is difficult for many to understand entirely what this book represents and as a potential reader, you must recognize that prior to a decision to read this book.  That is not to say children can't read and enjoy this book; to the contrary, the story transverses all age groups (my point being that many people assume that because of the grade at which it is assigned in most schools it is written for children, which it IS NOT--can I make that clearer?).  What children miss and what I feel is the essential ingredient to this work is in its allegory which manifests itself ultimately in Adams' portrayal of rabbits as humans.  It is up to the reader how much of this allegory he/she wishes to embrace (and I'm sure I've embellished more than a few allegorical connections myself).  It has been said before, but the rabbits in Watership Down represent specific and irrefutable, even if simplified, characteristics of the human race.  They also live and breathe in a rabbit world littered with the political and social structures that dominate our civilization (as humans).  Adams' work also describes, on a somewhat diminished scale, the attitudes of man towards nature; besides other rabbits, mankind seems to be the strongest enemy and most obstacles the rabbits must overcome are man-made.<br />For these reasons (and many more not listed), I feel Watership Down is best read with these factors in mind, which to me make it a decidedly mature story and a mistake to be considered a children's book.  There are many summaries of the plot below, so I won't go into detail here, except to say that it is a well written story and wonderful adventure that can be enjoyed on many levels.  I would encourage you to read it and decide for yourself what it will give to you.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is a great book that I enjoyed very much.  Basically, it is about two friends named George and Lennie who try to live and work in a normal life.  George is short, but very intelligent while Lennie is the opposite; he is tall and strong.  However Lennie also had a mental disability that severely impacted his and George's goal.  Due to the disability, George has to take extra care of Lennie and show him what's right and wrong.  The only thing he  couldn't stop was Lennie's love of petting soft things, like animals.  This was a bad thing because Lennie always accidentally kills anything he pets.  This aspect of the disability and the disability in general lead to many difficulties in George's life and many conflicts with the locals.  Of Mice and Men is a book filled with suspense and action that will keep the reader flipping through the pages.<BR>   As you all may know, Of Mice and Men is currently banned from schools for reasons that are unknown to me.  Whatever those reasons may be, I stand firmly by my position that the novel should not have been banned.  The only reason I can think of to ban the novel is that it morally sets a bad example for the readers.  One of its many themes is that frustration can have an impact on people, like George.  Using this theme in his novel, Steinbeck sends a message to the reader saying anything (and I mean ANYTHING) that gets in the way of living a nice, normal life should be eliminated.  Despite the negativity of this message, I believe that every person who reads this novel is old and mature enough to not take that message too seriosly and to not implement it in their lives.  In my opinion, there are only two reasons why people read.  One is for the sheer fun and enjoyment of it.  The other is that sometimes, people have to do it in order to get something done.  Notice how using a novel's themes in life is not included in the two choices.  However, there are exceptions.  There are definitely books that DO have an impact on someone's life, but in most cases this does not occur.  There aren't too many books in the world that are powerful enough to change the way a person thinks or acts.  <BR>   Speaking of worlds, Of Mice and Men is both positive and negative to the literary world.  It's negative because it sends the reader the bad message that was previously stated above.  On the other hand, the novel is positive to the literary world because it clearly depicts how hard life is when living with a mentally retarded person that must be monitered constantly.  The reader can actually feel the frustration and anger inside of him/her as he/she reads about Lennie doing something stupid again.  I know I did when I read about Lennie continuing to pet a rat that he has already killed.  A lot of respect and recognition should go to the people who have to deal with people such as Lennie.  Also, the novel is positive to the literary world because it's a dang good book.  Don't be fooled by the minute size of the book, it's definitely well worth the time to read.  :)
B000069CWE|3.0|I am a HUGE Linkin Park fan--half the cloths I wear is Linkin Park merch, I have Linkin Park posters and stickers covering my walls, etc...--but I hate Reanimation. I loved Hybrid Theary and Meteora, I even own unreleased CDs like \\"EP\\" and \\"2.0\\", which are both great! but Reanimation is terrable--it doesn't even sound like Linkin Park. the whole album is this techno-rap stuff. it's like eifel 65 meats Eminem. ALL the music on there is computer generated, there is practicaly no guitar or drums (although there is a fair amount of turn-table--which I like.) then they have these guests on there--some of them good, some of them bad. Motion Man completely mutilated In The End. but Forgoten is prety good. there are a lot of bad songs, and a few decent ones. but honestly, I fealt [tricked] when I bought that CD. I had come to trust Linkin Park (I am in their fan club, so I've heard quite a lot of their music--doesens of unreleased demoes--and they are all good) then they made THIS! It's like I just wasted my [money] ... I was also very dissapointed. If Linkin Park ever releases another remix album (which they wont--Mike Shinoda said it was a one-time thing) then I won't buy it. the reason I gave the album three stars, is because I understand how much talant and work went into it. they did some truly amaising things on that album. Things that  very very few people can do. but I don't like it simply because it's not my style at all. It's not what I know and love Linkin Park for. If you like Eminem and Dr. Dre, you will probably like Reanimation--because it sounds more like them than Linkin Park. but if you like Linkin Park for the rock aspect of it (which I do) then don't waste your time or money.

B000000993|4.0|Undertow is a trip through the darkest corner of the human physcie and is a fine example of agressive depression rock. The band does what they failed to do with thier first album, immerse you in their world and make you think while you listen. You get a plethora a feelings from the music that you don't get from a lot of the cookie-cutter cuts you hear from day to day. <BR>     <BR>With that said, this album falls short of what Tool is capable of. The CD is very bass driven (not necessarily a bad thing) and is not very explorative when compared to thier later works. The songs are not as catchy and the CD does bog down in some places. My biggest problem is that you have to really work to get into this album, you can't just throw it in and enjoy like a lot of CD's out there. Having gotten all of the bad out of the way though I can say this album is still one of the best of all time. You just need to be in the right mind set, the right mood. I would recommend a new Tool fan start with nema and then try this one out.<BR>     <BR>While not on par with the later works of Tool, this is an amazing album that is well worth the purchase. It complements the newer music quite well and is quite good, if you have the time to put into it.
B000002OYB|4.0|This is an great Meat Loaf album! Although it dosen't have the power packed ballads that are in Bat 1 and 2, It is one of his best albums. It beats the pants of his CD's from the mid to late 80's. It's probably 3rd on his greastest albums list, although I have yet hear his newest album. I like the upbeat rock songs on this album, especially &quot;Runnin for the Red Light&quot;. &quot;Original Sin&quot; is a more traditional Meat Loaf song, which was penned by Jim Steinman. Overall this a great album, I recommend it highly.

B00006IU73|5.0|It seems working with Opeth has had an influence in Steven Wilson's songwriting, though it works well. The crushing metallic riffs of &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; sound right at home with the folk melodies and Yes-like vocal harmonies of &quot;Trains.&quot; This album is PT's most guitar-oriented record and features some of the best solos as well. This album is diverse and well thought-out proving PT to be the best neo-prog act.
B00008URYM|4.0|This single for American Life/Die Another Day doesnt really give Madonna any justice with her 2 hit tracks on her new album 'American Life'. Although I would recommend this single to you if you are a die hard Madonna fan. But if you dont want to spend that amount on this particular single, get the 'Die Another Day' single which features the radio edit, and several kick[in'] remixes, OR get the 'American Life' single, which does not feature the radio edit, but does feature six cool remixes for you to enjoy. This single I am currently rating was the first out of a string of releases, which is why it only has two songs on it. But for your full Madonna enjoyment, buy her new cd 'American Life', I highly recommend it.
B00008OWZC|5.0|These recordings from their early 70's stint of So Cal are truly amazing.  Buy this set, crank up your stereo and experience the power and magic of the mighty Zep live.  The remastering of these recordings is incredible.  Check out The Immigrant Song and Over The Hills And Far Away because they will blow you away.  This set will truly satisfy your need for a Zep fix.
6305736650|5.0|This is a flawless masterpiece of American cinema about  <BR>star-crossed lovers who fall in love in Paris and meet again in Casablanca and rekindle an old flame. The characters couldn't be more perfectly played with Bogart as Rick and Bergman as Ilsa<BR>and nobody can sing &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; like Dooley Wilson. Widely considered to be the greatest movie of all time and critically acclaimed story of undying love against a huge backdrop of World War II, this certainly is a masterpiece of cinema! If you like love stories, Humphrey Bogart, or just  great classic films, this is a movie I highly recommend1
0064407667|1.0|My husband and I are always on a quest for series of books to read together (we have read and thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Philip Pullman's Dark materials, and Taran Wanderer series). We were informed the Lemony Snicket Unfortunate Events series would be a good one to try out, if not for oursleves, then for children we knew. We picked the first in the series up while on a car trip to test it out. I can not express how disappointed we were. Not only were the \\"vocabulary lessons\\" annoying, they are completely unneccessary - children learn new words through proper use and context, and if it can not be figured out through these ways, then the extra effort to go look it up in a dictionary is a good learning method as well. Besides that, the words he chooses to define versus the undefined ones is absolutely absurd! And any child who needs the word \\"rickety\\" or \\"perished\\" defined is too young to be reading about such subjects as child abuse and implied sexuality (the uncle and theater members' thoughts of Violet), or to be exposed to such violence as shown by Count Olaf (threatening to cut Violet's face). In conclusion, since the book's context is too mature for the youngest of readers, and the vocabulary lessons as well as the simplicity of the plot make it inappropriate for older readers, I can not recommend it for anyone.
B00000K19E|4.0|BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING ELSE: I LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; follows a young computer programmer named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves). He is searching for something in his life, although he does not know what. He is contacted by a mysterious man named Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) who tells him that the world is not exactly what it seems to be...<br />Honestly, people. I'm ashamed. Half of the reviews here praise this movie for being &quot;revolutionary,&quot; &quot;mind-blowing,&quot; and &quot;visionary.&quot; Yeah, it's a good movie (though Keanu needs to go to acting school), but ITS JUST A FUN ACTION MOVIE WITH SOME COOL IDEAS. You must consider, though, (although I have not seen much of the other stuff that people say it borrows from) that the idea is not exactly original. Even if it is, I don't see how it is &quot;mind-blowing.&quot; It sure didn't change the way I think.<br />The other half of the reviews keep on saying that the plot had holes, the acting was awful, and the FX were overrated. First of all, the FX were awesome. Second, yeah, Keanu can't act, yeah, the lines were cliched, but nobody was expecting Lawrence Olivier or Shakespeare anyway. Finally, the plot may be full of holes, but can't you just stop being the nitpickers you are (I'm one too) and just try to let yourself have fun with this somewhat intelligent action movie?<br />P.S. I wish the DVD had a better commentary. Although Carrie-Ann and the Editor come in great, the director sounds like he was a hundred feet from the microphone. Can't hear a word that he says.
0385504209|5.0|I find recently hard to find books that are &quot;hard to put down&quot;, but The Da Vinci Code was the embodiment of that phrase.  This book is a masterpiece!
B00004U2GH|5.0|My father had the original release in his record collection when I was a kid.  I used to listen to it and wonder about the sort of sounds that JC made, with his voice and his band.  San Quentin was made for a lot of things, a concert it was not... giving the audio of the CD a spooky reverb that always made me listen with ernest.  Hearing the guitar bounce off the walls, and you can, really makes the sound a bit peculiar.  This is JC at his prime, and I must tell you that every song has power and influence and this material helped him not only get into the country hall of fame but the rock and roll hall of fame as well.<br />Amazing stuff.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Well, I have to admit to being an avid Buffy fan... so my point of view is a bit biased, however this soundtrack is fantastic!!! It has a permanent position in my car's CD player. It includes every bit of the musical numbers and a few bonus tracks of background music from other episodes. (personally I just play the musical numbers)<BR>It's amazing how addictive the music becomes. When I first saw the show, I thought it was a lot of fun and very well done. After I recieved this album as a gift, I listened to it, then played it again... and again. I just don't get tired of hearing it.  <BR>As for non-Buffy fans, I can attest to it being a worthy purchase for any lover of comedy off-Broadway musicals. My mother has always been interested in the off-Broadway musicals and she's never even seen the Buffy series. She heard it while we were driving in my car and wanted to get her own copy.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I didn't know what to think about FM making a cd without CM in the lineup.  But, I do know that any great FM cd depends on two people, and that is LB and SN.  LB really shines on this record, considering that he does NOT use a pick, he just plays the music on this recording with passion and determination that other bands with this experience could very well take a lesson from.  A great outing.
B00005YUTD|5.0|The baby einstein videos are all great.  This is no exception.  While I think that the quality of baby Mozart is better, my daughter has absolutely no preference.  She loves all of the videos, and has enjoyed them since 3 weeks.  It's a great way to soothe and entertain her, while still being educational.  It's a great 30 minutes for mom and baby- the music is so relaxing, you'll just lay down and watch it with her to unwind!!
B000002LOE|4.0|Losing my religion was the great song off of this package.  I think this shows the last cd before REM started messing with thier sound, of which I like some after this, and don't like ONE after this (Adventures in High Fi) but other releases like Reveal really sound great.  This is the leaving point for REM.  This recording is wonderful, and should be noted.
B000000OQF|3.0|Thats it. Thats why the band did not survive. Axl destroyed it.
B00006J3T4|5.0|if you love music with wonderful story lines, played by a master craftsman of the picking technique.. this is your CD.  Devil Woman and Coyote are my favorites on this record but they all are good.  MK takes a very genteel turn on this record, just relying on his fingers and it is brilliant.
B000008MLU|3.0|Okay, so the story is, the Ryko 2-fer of these albums is rather odd. Lumpy Gravy is fine-sounding, but is only two tracks, making finding your favorite section rather difficult. The newer, single-disc version is the better choice.<br />But We're Only In It For The Money is really odd. Zappa chose to re-record the drums and bass for the entire album, and then remix it. The plus side is that the sound is rather clean, and all the previously censored bits are all back in force.<br />The negative is that, while the drums aren't too bad, the bass is ridiculous. It sounds NOTHING like a 1967 bass should, either tonally or melodically. ANd it just clashes with everything else. The drums have their own problems, sometimes sounding too 80's like, and sometimes just not mathing the rhythms of the music. <br />Luckily, the original version has been re-issued as a single disc from Ryko. This 2-fer version is interesting, but not really how most fans originally heard this album.
B0000026UV|5.0|I bought this once, and played it to death.  These two should have made more music together.  Sadly, CA is gone now, but MK really carries his legacy, him and Steve Howe do anyway.  If you want a bluegrassy blues fingerpicky recording that is full of fire, this is it.  quite good.  Legendary as far as I am concerned
B00008OWZC|5.0|I listened to Disc 1 on small computer speakers---through an Internet offering. I was stunned. Think you never want to hear \\"Stairway\\" again?  Well let me change your mind.  I was jumping around the room playing air guitar like I haven't for years. This is Zep at their absolute zenith and I will be purchasing this 3 CD set and the new DVD. I can't wait to hear them on full size speakers. I am so impressed by what I heard I am going to see if they still sell Led Zepplin T shirts.                            Update February 2007: The purchase of this 3cd set and the DVD have proved to be very worthwhile purchases. They represent the best audio and video documents available of this great band.
B000002MU3|3.0|This is a good recording.  I admire the band for just tossing most of its sound and trying new things... I just was more shocked by its brashness.  A lot of fans thought it was REM trying to survive the grunge movement... I didn't think that, but it was totally noisy.  I kind of like song oriented pretty music from REM.  Get REVEAL for that, it is great.
0451169514|1.0|This book was written when Stephen King had become a household name--and it's clear his editor was either intimidated by King's growing reputation or just horribly lazy.<br />&quot;IT&quot; is ridiculously long and burdened with with an excess of characters and an excess of dreary, self-indulgent verbiage. Scenes that should have been startling and tight are dragged out for pages and pages and pages. I don't know if King was deep into his cocaine addiction by this time, but the book certainly reads like it was written by someone sky-high on coke and completely out of control.<br />Avoid this book. Reread classic King instead: the admirably concise Carrie or The Shining (which rarely drags and earns its length).
B000002MJR|3.0|I like the CD but it sounds so polished that it is sorta hard to believe that it is live.<br />when one hears a talented guitar player like MK playing live... once would like to hear him stretch out the song, or play his solo a bit longer and maybe embellish the song for the delight of the audience.  Nothing like that happens on this recording.<br />That is not to say that this recording is not good, for it is great but, it is so much like the original recordings.. you could really accomplish the same thing by just buying a best of Dire Straits CD (of which there are a couple to select from).
B00008OWZC|5.0|Absolutely amazing live album. Without a doubt the best one I've ever heard and I've heard many. Why?? Not because the might Zep is my favorite band. It's because this album encapsulates perfectly what it means to play songs with conviction yet fast &amp; loose, with precision yet with absolute abandon, with unrelenting power and heaviness but with (help me out here, Jimmy) &quot;shades of light and dark&quot;.<br />This is pure rock and roll elixir. The band at its pinnacle. The band at its most professional. A fine edge blade sharpened by years of touring. So in sync that they almost read each other's thoughts. If you ever saw them in concert or video, you know that they didn't even look at each other much to stay on beat. It was symbiosis. Supernatural.<br />Jeez. Absolutely awe inspiring!<br />Pay attention world! Pay attention all you people out there who have given up on rock and roll! Pay attention all you musicians who hope to mean something to somebody someday. THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|I love this cd. So expressionate. The song PONO is great, and you get the steamy feeling while MK writes and plays and sings about any topic, whether it is a threesome in You and Your Friend or any other topic. Quite an underrated recording. I have bought it two or three times. Really good stuff.<br />The CD is most likley the best that Dire Straits ever made.  The songs flow and have a very humerous tone that MK can give to songs.  Songs like 'YOU AND YOUR FRIEND' and 'MY PARTIES' are genuinley fun to listen to, and MK tells a great story stocked with juicy guitar riffs that have jazz elements to them.<br />It is a very good representative of Dire Straits, and it is the swan song for dire straits, but a very effective one.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men  is about two friends, George and Lennie.  \\"George is small and quick and dark of face\\", while Lennie is \\" a man of tremendous size and has the mind of a young child.\\"  Lennie has a mental disability, although his devotion to George is very strong.  George returns this loyalty and obedience to Lennie.  However, Lennie often gets himself into trouble, sometimes harmless and shameless, but other times very serious.  <BR> This novel exhibits many controversial themes from a moral and social standpoint.  One of these themes is that women corrupt and cause evil in society.  George, repeatedly through out the book, tells Lennie to keep away from their boss', Curley, wife.  George is convinced that she, along with the rest of the women in the world, will cause trouble and are evil.  However, Steinbeck portrays her as a helpless character who hates her husband and her life.  Although Steinbeck may want her to seem innocent, she is not and her flirtatious actions towards Lennie, virtually, cause her death, as well as his.  <BR> Another controversial theme exhibited in this novel, is racial segregation.  One of the main characters, Crooks, is isolated from the rest of the men on the ranch because he is black.  Steinbeck depicts him as a lonely and miserable man.  He lives in a room separate from the other men, next to the barn, and is denied the basic rights that the other men have, including playing a simple card game with them.  However, Lennie does not understand the problem with skin color and insists on spending time with Crooks.  Lennie often gets scolded by George for his actions, but Crooks is left with most of the blame, simply because he is black.  <BR> Although, this book is controversial, I believe it positively contributes to the literary world.  This book is thought provoking and teaches the reader to be thankful for their friends, while accepting others, no matter what race they may be.  I would suggest this book to anyone who understands what friendship is and how powerful it can truly be.
B000003TAR|5.0|I like it.  when you need a cd to just blare out and get all your pent up whatever out of your system.. this is a good one to do it with.  the loud guitars and bass and hooks make this nirvana a great selection.  for its genre and class it holds good weight.
0451196716|5.0|Stephen King was an anonymous to me before I read this great book. I've seen his movies before but never actually enduldged into one of his text pieces before. This book to me was a great piece of metaphors and similes. A real graphical Novel. I like how he starts his book off as a mystery. You never really know whats going on until around page 40. I like the mystery. It allows me to endulge fully in the words and pictured put into my head. Rather than spelled out for you by most writers. <BR>  A group of kids decided they want to walk instead of play like everyone else their own age. A walk that not only endangers their life but, gets lots of attention...not a normal walk. A walk that could and does result in death. A walk that is proven to be a perfect campaign for buisnesses and cheering, but a death march. As the story goes on page by page you begin to feel what the ghost walkers feel. You begin to realize their fear and mistake it as your own. You as the reader are given an easy task, a task that can be completed because of King's writing abilities. That task consist of living the long endorous walk that those are commanded to do. To survive the sureal life that is given to you.
B000002A3T|5.0|I liked Momentary Lapse Of Reason.  And for good reason, 'On the turning away' and 'Sorrow' plus 'Yet Another Movie' were great songs, and I am not mentioning some others that were great on that record.  BUT, make no mistake about it, DB is a way better product.  Sounds so much more like a Meddle era, or possibly WYWH product.  Cluster One is incredibly PF type of opening, and very relaxing.  The rocker songs like WDYWFM and KT are just great songs to 'air guitar' to.  The album is better than MLOR for another important reason, it flows.  Each song flows into each other, something floyd has always been able to do, but MLOR really didn't do all that well.  Songs like HIGH HOPES and LOST FOR WORDS really grab your attention with the lyrical message.  I really think that most PF fans like this CD, and the ones that don't are in denial.  I bet Roger Waters would like this CD if it was called anything but PINK FLOYD, but that doesn't mean that it will not go down as a great PF recording.  Which it is.<br />************<br />A couple of months after writing this review... I bought this CD when it came out, and I tell you, everytime I put this CD into a CD player and someone hears it, they almost ALWAYS (as if on cue) ask who it is, and they really like it or, is THAT PINK FLOYD?  It is a classic, and some classics will never be known until way after the release, but this one is going to stand up to the test of time due to the great music, the great flow and ebb of Richard Wrights keyboards and DG's wonderful guitar playing throughout the record.  ALSO, I think the lyrics are great throughout the recording and those who will listen to them without thinking of anything but the present will be pleased.  Anything else is just prejudice.<br />It is my opinion that if this had been released by anyone other than PF, it would be viewed as a great recording, but unfortunatly for PF, they compete against themself everytime they release something.  If they release something and it is not on par with, sound like, be like, imitate DSOTM or THE WALL, then it is automatically panned as crap.  Or, if it doesn't have someone's favorite bass player on it, it is automatically panned.  I encourage people to view this as a stand alone recording.  Then, it truely has legs, and will outrun most anything in anyones collection.<br />But, a lot of people really dislike this recording, and I could be totally wrong.s not on par with, sound like, be like, imitate DSOTM or THE WALL, then it is automatically panned as crap.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|I agree, few of these cuts do the Beatles justice.  Being mainly a fan of John Lennon, I would pretty much cut out most of the Paul-based songs and recommend anything written by John (Lennon-McCartney was a short-lived writing duo, as by Sgt. Pepper's they had pretty much cut down their sharing of music and lyrics to asking each other by mail for help, respective of John's criticism of much of Paul's lyrics, not to mention his absolute disgust with the song Yesterday while telling Paul, when Paul wasn't sure he knew what he meant in one line of Hey Jude, John said: \\"Leave it alone.  It's the best thing you've ever written.\\")  Considering the lyric Paul was questioning of himself, I would have to agree with John.<br />What Gregg wrote about this album is essentially correct, but one thing is puzzling: Why did he buy this CD?  If he was around for the early releases (which includes a B side 45 RPM release of the Beatles cover of an amazingly well-done rock version of the song \\"My Bonnie\\" on the Swan label), why listen to anything but early Beatles on vinyl and in Mono and the quite correct kind of stereo of the day with the instrumentals on one track and vocals on another?  I'm a vinyl freak, and while I do have a few Beatles albums on CD, I also still own a turntable to play original Beatles Albums (For a \\"purely John\\" album recommendation, one should consider \\"Walls and Bridges\\").  <br />Actually, one should probably buy this album for the one cut \\"Paperback Writer,\\" and everything else should be appreciated on vinyl.  I have given this CD a fair rating because there are some Beatle classics on it, but I wouldn't have chosen nearly this many songs for a collage of the Beatles.  It wasn't necessary and is too much to consume in a timely manner.  If this album truly is an introduction to the Beatles to younger generations, it is probably a mistake and much too long, but it isn't so bad as to be completely ill-chosen to represent *some* of the best of the Beatles.  Samples are nice, but they should leave a good taste in your mouth, and this album has little taste by those who chose the songs by how many were sold and/or played on AM radio.
B00006IR5S|5.0|No one can review themes and past melodies like John Williams.  He can rearrange a theme five different ways, keep the magic, but have you believing that you're hearing a different piece.  He has done that, yet again, with The Chamber of Secrets.  Familiar themes return and new music emerges: Fawkes' theme is my absolute favorite!!  It reminds a bit of Yoda's Theme from the Star War trilogy.  Anyone who buys is going to have to realize that it's part of the Harry Potter saga, so it will have much of the music heard before.  However, this is an incredible CD and I think stronger than the first.  Williams' use of leit motiff, a certain theme for certain characters is illustrated on this CD beautifully with Fawkes and Lockhart.  If  you're a Harry fan, you should pick this up.  If you're a Williams fan, you must pick this up.
0375422307|4.0|Simple, beautiful illustration and humane tone characterize this introduction to a human tragedy, the Iranian revolution of 1979. Satrapi is a young woman of Vienna and Paris now, but grew up spending age zero to twelve in Iran. PERSEPOLIS is her testament to the crimes committed first by the Shah and then the thousandfold worse crimes created by a revolution which was supposed to address the problems.
0440237688|4.0|This book really made me think about the views on the future and how incredably imposible having a perfect world would be. The beginning of this book really opened my eyes to the exact set up Lois Lowry describes the future to be like. It made me think of how things would be if the world were completely orgagnized. But 12 year old Jonas had to take on the memory of the world, finding the real dirt at the core of this \\"perfect\\" society. Departure was out of the question in the role he was assigned, but with the help of his adviser, The Giver, he had an escape ahead.
B00005K9QP|5.0|I have already written extensively on Eric Clapton's Cream/Bluesbreaker period on several websites and for what it's worth, even got a credit in the recent book \\"Cream\\". However, I feel compelled to spell out to any youthfull players who have not heard this LP and only know the warp speed licks of Van Halen, Steve Via and Eric Johnson, or think Jimmy Page was the original guitar slinger, think again - AND AGAIN! Listen carefully and hear how this LP featured a young Clapton literally redefining the parameters of Electric guitar. His majestic, fluid solos, powered by the incredible sound of a Gibson Les Paul plugged in to a Marshall, set the NEW Gold Standard for all blues rock players then and now and in addition, sent a shock wave through the world of aspiring guitar slingers. In Cream he went on to set more benchmarks that have influenced generations of players. Listen and experience the record that amazed Hendrix, Page and even American blues masters, Mike Bloomfield and B.B. King. I remember that era when the only guitarists around were tinny sounding rockers or obscure blues players and Clapton was like a super novea exploding in the dead night sky of the guitar cosmos. I have played guitar for over 38 years and still marvel at his control, composition and fluitidy when considiering he was only 20. This is the holy grail of electric blues guitar. Thank you again Mr. Clapton, for the timeless inspiration.
B0000073I5|4.0|This album contains lots of good songs and lots of good ideas. Unfortunately, when you hear it today you can notice it is a little dated. But, as I said, there are lot of good songs here. The mood is Genesis meet Kansas and a little of eletronic tons. I grew up listening to this album, I had it on vynil and I still hear it from an old cassete. I suppose this CD has a better sound and sure is a must for Genesis fans. There is the great &quot;Overnight Job&quot;, the beautiful &quot;Time and Time Again&quot;, there are lots of incredible instrumental pieces, the bass is powerfull, the drums are strong and the vocals very inspired.<BR>All in all you will have loads of fun hearing it, specially if you are a Genesis fan like me.
B00000K19E|3.0|This a descent movie, and one of the few &quot;remakes&quot; that actually gives the original a run for its money.  This movie is obviously based on &quot;Dark City.&quot;  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has more special effects than &quot;Dark City,&quot; but the plot is basically the same.  A man learns that the life he has known is a farce and that the entire world is being run by a higher sentenance.  As he learns more and more about the world, he is being hunted by those that want to keep the status quo.  <br />While &quot;The Matrix&quot; stands on its own two legs, so to speak, the legs are different than the original.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; leans heavily on spectacular effects and a decent plot, &quot;Dark City&quot; relies on strong acting and plotline.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a great movie that you don't have to think very hard to follow, and &quot;Dark City&quot; is a superb movie you have to pay close attention to in order to follow.  I recommend both with &quot;Dark City ranked as a &quot;5.&quot;
B00004NRWH|4.0|It's much better than Silver Side Up -- more raw and real. I recommend listening to &quot;Leader of Men&quot; and &quot;Old Enough&quot; -- they are good songs to judge this cd by, if you get your hands on them somehow.
B00008PX8P|5.0|For me, being a younger fan of hard rock, I was born after the began stopped touring together.  I have only heard bits and pieces of them play live, and the only time I have seen them live is in &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;.  This DVD has every filmed performance they have ever had.  There is no band that can top this.<br />When I bought the DVD I also bought &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; and again its another amazing record.  By far the best track on there is the 25 minute jam of &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot;.  <br />These two are must haves for anyone.  Zeppelin fan, Hard Rock fan, or any random stranger you meet on the street deserves to have these.
B00008OWZC|2.0|Um, excuse me, but in all this excitment over the &quot;long overdue&quot; live CD from Led Zeppelin, have we overlooked the outstanding &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; released in 1997?  For my money, the BBC sessions are much tighter and exciting than this overblown three-disc set.  Don't get snowed by the hype.  &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is nothing more than &quot;Song Remains the Same Redux,&quot; giving us yet another(!) 25-minute version of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and another (!) 20-minute version of &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; which sound pretty much like they did when released last time around.  There are a few highlights, though -- &quot;Black Dog&quot; sounds edgy and mean.  The live versions of &quot;Dancing Days&quot; and &quot;The Ocean&quot; are as energetic and rollicking as the studio recordings.
B00008PX8P|5.0|What a stellar collection of performances for this group. I have never seen Jimmy Page in motion like this before. I was expecting the best when purchasing this DVD and what I got was the best. There is no way that Zeppelin could top this...except...maybe...a tour?
B00006ALGL|5.0|not much more to say other than that... this cd is absolutely brilliant. i couldn't ask for more for a debut release. damien rice is going to blow up, and he deserves it. he's a genuine performer who writes from the heart. complete lyrical genius. catch him live whenever you can. this man can make up a song from scratch on stage. brilliant!<BR>oh... and if you were wondering... i really really really like this album :D
0060012218|5.0|There are so many things to like about this book. It's a fast-paced, well-written story that isn't a downer to read. There is lots of humor, but plenty of drama, and none of the characters are perfect. I like that there are almost no adults in the book as I believe that adults and kids exist in parallel worlds that do overlap, but neither understands what is really happening in the other. I also love Russel and wonder how much he is like Mr. Hartinger. In fact, I almost feel as if I know the author through the book and think he must be an interesting fellow.<br />I'm glad the book isn't full of doom and gloom like so many gay novels. It's refreshing to read about relatively happy, well-adjusted gay kids, and I was especially glad Russel simply accepted he was gay and didn't have to come to terms with it. You can tell from the book that the author really likes and identifies with teenagers. YA fiction is truly some of the best writing today and this is a welcome addition to the genre. I hope Mr. Hartinger has more books in the works and since I'm really a huge fan of fantasy, I would love to see a fantasy book with a gay character. How about it, Mr. Hartinger?
0385504209|3.0|The premise of the book is intriguing and the history presented made it a real page turner.  The big disappointment for me was figuring out the final cryptex code well before the book's noted symbiologist, historian, and crytologist.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Simply fantastic. The menus are very cool - some menus are fan shot bootleg footage containing full songs! You can see the band maturing as the DVD progresses and the Knebworth stuff was much better than I'd thought. <br />Plus - Bonzo singing backup vocals! JPJ on Mellotron! (Sadly, no sign of the triple necked acoustic so far though.) Also, witness Page's playing get sloppier as his guitar gets lower over the years! :) The Swedish TV bonus footage is amazing too by the way. The french footage is pretty bizarre - check out the audience.<br />Just buy this. If not for yourself for your kids.
0140177396|5.0|I am a 16 year old High School Student who read The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck as a school outside reading assignment.  At first I resented this assignment but after I read the first 15 pages the last hundred flew by all in one sitting.  This was a great book.  It was a short read that keeps you entertained to the very last page; once you pick it up I doubt that you will ever put it down.  One thing that I loved about this book was the relationship between George and Lenny.  These were two totally different people.  George was a short man with a strutured apperence while Lenny is a very large man with a round and unreconizable apperence.  These two friend complete each other in that they compensate for each others errors.  For example George is the intelligente one and Lenny is the really dumb one and George is always having to clean up after Lenny's mistakes.  Even though sometimes George could be a little mean and unsimpathetic I believe that this was true friendship.  <BR>        This novel takes place in southern California by a town called Weed.  George and Lenny are ranch workers that go from ranch to ranch just looking for jobs.  There are many very interesting charaters in this novel that add to the story.  Curley is a character that adds alot of drama and action to the novel.  Curley is the bosses son who was just married and feels that he must prove something to his new wife.  He likes to pick on big guys becaues he is a good boxer and is a short man himself, so naturally he picks on Lenny.  This fued that goes one way from Curley to Lenny and is very entertaining. <BR>            In many schools across the country this book was banned.  I do not understand why this book was banned because it does not contribute negatively but without a doubt positively to society.  It contributes positively because it provides the read with many lessons about friendship and trust.  I would highly recommend this novel to everyone of all ages.  If you are looking for a short but awesome read for a weekend, because that is all it will take, this is the book for you.  Between Steinbeck's deep description and great talent in weaving a tale you'll be more than satisfied with his novel.  <BR> I rated this book with a five out of five stars.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I'm not going to detail the plot, but this has honestly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Christian Bale manages to portray a man attempting to hide his emotions and yet racked with newfound feelings, sensuality, and guilt in a way that is both heartwrenching and joyous. This movie reminds us to be more aware of the beauty, art, pain, and even ugliness that surrounds us. It reminds us that without expression, interpretation, and awareness we are not really living, that we take for granted our senses and the things we enjoy and also dislike. Regardless of the flimsyness of certain parts, or the borrowing of familiar themes from novels and movies, this is a fantastic and honest attempt to make us aware of our lives, to renew discovery without and within ourselves. It emphasizes the yin & yang idea that there is a balance, and you can't rid yourself of evil completely without also losing what it is that makes things good. free speech and expression goes both ways, and the good can not be extracted from the bad as if it were some seperate entity.<br />Beautiful movie.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I hated this CD, HATED it, the first three months I owned it.  Heck, I almost sold it back to the store.  But for this CD, patience is rewarded.  At first, the sonic dissodence that floats in and out of the arrangements seems like a trite annoyance, a weird-for-weird's sake homage to Radiohead or something.   But keep listening.  Eventually, the sheer pop brilliance of songs like 'Jesus, etc' and 'Heavy Metal Drummer' starts poking through the haze... then, it all starts to come together.   Eventually, you can see that all of the chaos and noise and the music is actually a carefully-planned part of the same brilliance.  YHF is indeed the best CD of 2002, but it may take the better part of a year for you to figure that out.
B00008S2VF|5.0|I'm nearly speechless.  As others have already stated, this is by far, her most exceptional work.  Madonna never ceases to amaze me.  This album will touch you in every possible place of your mind, body and soul.  Madonna has the power to rock your body or rock you to sleep with her profound words she has graced us with on American Life.
B00008OWZC|5.0|\\"Silently Ravaging America\\" was one of the alternate titles that Jimmy Page could have chosen for this 3 CD Live Set.  This was one of the bootleg titles of the show from the LA Forum that appears co-mingled with the Long Beach concert two days later in this release.  For all fans of Led Zeppelin this CD set fills a \\"Live\\" void that other classic rockers were able to placate during their tenure.  I listened to all three CD's through head phones blaring.  The quality of the recording is first rate but more importantly the live improvisations and variations of Zep classics make this CD set worth the investment.  One of the criticisms that has carried through with Led Zeppelin is that they could not replicate in concert what they released in the studio.  Jimmy Page was well known as a fanatic studio mixologist that would create multiple complex guitar tracks over one another.  It is said that in concert John Paul Jones helped play some of the guitar parts to compensate.  On this CD, in songs such as \\"Heartbreaker\\" and 23 minutes of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" Jimmy proves his real world worth and lays to rest any doubt about his raw talent.  Robert Plant also shows his voice was loud and strong in 1972.  However, true strength is displayed in John Bonham's drumming.  There is a story that when Led Zeppelin recorded studio albums at Headley Grange they would put John Bonham in another room away from the microphones because he hit the drums so loud and hard.  One listen to this live version of \\"Moby Dick\\" and you will understand what they meant.  This is definitely Led Zep at it's best.  This snap shot in Zeppelin history will dispell the old so called faults.  If you enjoy live music from classic rock bands this 3 CD set is a must have.  It's posthumous release will help spawn new fans and help the mighty Zep ravage again.
B000002WFF|5.0|I have 80% of all that Elvis recorded and this one is my favorite hands down. This is a group of recordings that are unmatched, belonging together in such a way that you must hear to appreciate. I never grow weary of listening to it again.

B000088E6D|2.0|Michael Buble has a very good vioce.  If he can only put a little more heart into the songs.  He failed to bring out the emotions in each of the songs.  Overall, not too bad for a first timer.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Yes it's true, Pet Sounds is as great as they say it is. This is a work of pure beauty. Some people looking for &quot;clever&quot; tricks and novelty won't understand just why it is so special and unique. Open your heart and let Pet Sounds become part of your life.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD is great.  Robert Plant is past his youthful period of wild screaming and made up lyrics, but still has his pipes intact.  Jimmy Page is at the peak of his power, turning in a show stopping performance on every track, even Stairway to Heaven.  If only I could figure out who the uncredited guest vocalist is on Bron-Y-Aur Stomp!
B00005JLRT|4.0|This movie for me is a conflux of mixed emotions. <br />It's great in the sense that the film is a really fun picture to watch (especially the very impressive third act), but it's also aggravating in the sense of pacing. <br />They go, they stop. They go, they stop. Over and over (INCLUDING in the aforementioned very impressive third act). <br />I liked this film in the sense that I could have nitpicked it to death, but it was enjoyable enough to suspend my disbelief. But I will agree with other reviews that I have read that say that John Logan and Brent Spiner were trying too hard to re-create the feel of Wrath of Kahn.<br />On the DVD front, I will say that I like this film as well. Having recently watched First Contact, I noticed that (at least on my Pioneer Elite HDTV) there is a noticable improvement in visual quality. Images are much more vibrant and have much less noticable grain inherant in film to digital transfer. <br />The audio is also (not surprisingly) impressive. The surround channels are constantly active, from the normal background rumble of the ship, to the zipping of quantum torpedoes flying by. <br />I was a little disappointed in the extended/deleted scene catagory. I was really hoping that these deleted scenes would be fully-finished scenes, preferably re-inserted to the film. Neither of my hopes was met, and I think it was a large detriment to the film itself. Two of the scenes included would have drastically helped the character development of the film and setup the recurring themes to a little more satisfying extent. <br />Overall though, I can recommend this film to pretty much any Trekkie (and no, I don't call them Trekkers...), and anyone who might have a passing interest in Trek. It's a strong action flick in it's own right, and it DOES have a sense of higher morals (not a big sense, but it is there).
B00008OWZC|5.0|There was such a cult feeling surrounding this group when they were huge in the 70's, and their previous live offerings don't come close to showing what this group was capable of.  This release, however will not only refresh the memories of those who knew, but a new legion of fans can now become obsessed with this supergroup.  The 3 cd set gives each member of the group to shine, but it is truly the Jimmy Page / John Bonham show.  Zep was obviously focused at this time in their career, and it shows.  Buy this set and enjoy....
0767817648|4.0|<br />As a boy growing up in the 80's, this was just about as cool as it got this side of Star Wars.  Although my tastes have become somewhat more sophisticated over the years, I still enjoy a well-crafted action movie, and this certainly qualifies.  Although the movie at times becomes campy due to overacting or poorly choreographed action sequences (hey, Badham didn't have $150M to work with, OK?) the movie's themes regarding the dangers of advanced technology as a tool of repression and protection of the homeland against terrorists still ring true.  And besides, the helicopter is still really cool, even if the cockpit is reminiscent of Knight Rider's KITT (another 80's must).<br />Technically, the film is quite good overall.  Especially in the chase scenes, one gets the feeling that Badham and his crew spent hundreds of hours in the air to get the quality and quantity of footage necessary to pull this movie off.  The editing, however, leaves something to be desired at times, particularly the ADR, which on numerous occasions does not appear to match the actors' mouth movements.  Otherwise, however, the film is masterful, especially considering the technology used to edit it at the time.<br />If you are looking for high art, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for Matrix-like special effects, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for an entertaining action movie from the Reagan era, you're in the right place.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek: Nemesis, the tenth film in the star trek movie family and from all points the finally TNG movie. The movie had so many bad reviews from both trek and non-trek fans and movie reviews. I had lower my expections and was expecting the worst. Nemesis was one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen. I went to see this movie to be entertain and that was what occurred. The action and special effects are the best I have seen in any TNG or TOS movie. I was suprised how good Nemesis was, from the plot and acting of Patrick Stewart(Picard), Brent Spiner (Cmdr. Data and B-4), Tom Hardy (Shinzon) and the rest of the cast. The features on this DVD is excellent as well, behind the scenes stuff, and deleted scenes. The movie itself on the DvD look and sound excellent.
B00005JLT5|4.0|By &quot;one of the best&quot;, i mean an astonishing movie.  I myself am very picky about movies, and had extremely high expectations for this one.  Amazingly, it met, and went beyond my expectations.  In my opinion, it is one of the greatest films ever made. The acting, directing, and nearly everything else about the movie was flawless.  It is excellent.
B00005JM03|4.0|Mark Wahlburg stars in a remake of the 1969 film (note to directors/producers:  there's a little thing called 'originality'.. try it sometime). <br />Mark plays a thief who plans a major gold heist in Italy with the help of an old pro (played by Donald Sutherland), a computer hacker (Seth Green), a demolitions expert (Mos Def), and a get-away man (Jason Statham). <br />The plan goes perfectly but one of the other members of the group (Ed Norton's character) gets greedy, takes the gold and leaves the rest of them for dead. <br />The group decides to get the gold back with a little help from a safecracker (played by Charlize Theron) who also happens to be the old pro's daughter. <br />The movie has amazing action sequences and stunts.  The writing fades a bit about an hour into the movie.  About the only rediculous part is the blatant product endorsing (mini Cooper cars, Pepsi Blue).  Some clothing line might have made a mint if their name showed up on Charlize's near see-through tank tops.. guessing it was quite cold on the set. <br />Also getting some audience interest is a mechanic nicknamed 'Wrench' played by Franky G, who made over half the female crowd go \\"Wooo!\\".  Maybe the steroids made him forget his last name.  ;) <br />Movie warnings: profanity, no Marky Mark singing (thank God), no sex scenes, three 'yeah rights', and the emergence of the acting career (non-speaking role) of Man Show Juggy girl Julie Costello as Becky, the cable girl.<br />If you're into the adrenaline rush movies with added comedy in the right places, I would highly recommend this one.

076790592X|3.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is the true story of a man who rekindles a friendship with a college professor during the last days of the older man's life. I found this book to be alternately wise, trite, depressing and inspiring. Mitch Albom describes the strong bond that developed between himself and Morrie Schwartz, his sociology professor. After graduating, like most people, Mitch lost touch with his college life and concentrated on a career. He did not see Morrie for many years. Then, by chance (or fate), he saw a television program featuring his old teacher, now terminally ill with Lou Gehrig's disease. Mitch  contacts Morrie and embarks upon a final \\"course.\\" This turns out to be a series of lessons on life itself and what is and isn't truly important. Mitch Albom tells us that he achieved success as a sportswriter, and this is consistent with the book's style, which is more popular than literary. Although Mitch taped all of the sessions with Morrie, the book is essentially Morrie's philosophy of life as told and interpreted by Mitch (though we do actually hear --in the audiobook version-- Morrie's voice at the end). Another thing that must be said about Tuesdays With Morrie is that, apart from anything else, it is the story of a man dying a painful death from an incurable illness. No matter how insightful and courageous Morrie is in the face of this situation, there is an undeniably depressing element to the story. There are detailed descriptions of the toll the disease takes on Morrie, so sqeamish readers should be forewarned. As for the lessons themselves, it's hard to argue with most of what Morrie says --he is obviously an articulate and warmhearted teacher-- but much of it is also rather obvious. For example, there is much about society being too materialistic and love being more important than money. It is also fairly self evident (if unfortunate) that a person with little time left on Earth will appreciate life more. On the other hand, hearing these truths from a dying man may inspire the reader to appreciate his or her own life more fully. Morrie obviously conveyed a great deal to Mitch; only a small portion of this can be passed along to the reader, who has never met Morrie. One thing the book communicates is the importance of connecting with other people. I suspect the most important part of the lessons learned by Mitch were nonverbal, and required Morrie's actual presence. Unfortunately, some of life's most important lessons come off sounding like cliches when distilled into formulae. Despite this, there is enough wisdom in this book, along with some truly touching moments, to make it worthwhile. Tuesdays With Morrie reminds us that life should never be taken for granted.a dying man may inspire the reader to appreciate his or her own life more fully.

B00008S2VG|4.0|This was the first Madonna record I didn't run out and buy on the first day of release.  After hearing 'American Life' and 'Hollywood', I felt Madonna unfortunately finally made an awful record.  It seemed like she put no effort or thought into this music.  I felt she regressed in her musical ability to create such feel good music with the best in the industry.  Now Madonna raps.......why, she doesn't need to go there, she's much too mature and experienced to have to jump on this unfortunate rap and hip-hop phenomonon in this country.  After finally getting around to actually listening to the rest of the album though, I was surprisingly shocked to realize this is a great album after all.  I especially love the last two tracks, 'Sunlight' and 'Gone'.  I'm more drawn to the faster technoish songs on this album than the slower ones, but overall I feel I can finally start listening to the whole album instead of dismissing the whole thing as [...].  If you have been a long time Madonna fan and haven't bought the album b/c of the single 'American Life', buy it....you won't be disapointed in the rest!!!!!
B000002KBH|5.0|This album is perhaps the Dead's best (in the studio, at least).  All but a couple of the songs were live staples, speaking volumes about the content.  The first song I played from this album was \\"Brokedown Palace,\\" and I loved the feel of the song.  As I peered further in, I found other great songs--\\"Box of Rain\\", \\"Ripple\\", \\"Friend of the Devil\\", to name a few--that I really can't stop listening to; I'll put them on, and then I just have to listen to it again, and before long, I've spent an hour listening to just one song.  <BR>The folksey atmosphere that this album carries with it is very unique, but that should not dissuade any potential listeners who have traditionally disliked folk or country.  This album is neither of those, but it very cleverly mixes the best elements of those styles, and adds a liberal quantity of rock.  If you are looking to get into the Dead, this is a great starting point, and you will not be disappointed with your choice.
0316666343|5.0|I agree with others here...this was a wonderful book, but I must say that I was a little disappointed by the ending.  It seemed like Sebold just wanted to wrap it up.  Overall though, I loved it!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Trying to compare the quality of &quot;The song remains the same&quot; soundtrack to &quot;How the west was won&quot; is almost like comparing the Beatles &quot;Live in Hamburg&quot; to McCartney's new live CD. The sound on HTWWW is awesome, and absolutely demolishes any past Zeppelin live recordings. The sound is so great that it makes the &quot;band&quot; seem tighter, and much more polished than on previous live releases.  Highlights (and there are many) are The Ocean, What is and what should never be, Dancing days, Rock n' Roll, and Bring it on home.  These tracks blow away the studio versions, and if you don't believe me, then purchase this fantastic CD.  You have to hear it to believe it.
B0000028WD|4.0|You can reasonably expect that of the 29 performances collected on this 2-disc set that you are going to really like at least half of them.  Just know going in that you are going to hear Dylan songs you have probably never heard before (e.g., &quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie&quot;) sung by artists you have never heard before (e.g., The Clancy Brothers with Tommy Makem).  Okay, I have seen Tommy Makem in concert for years, but my point was that YOU might not be up to date on Irish folk music.  But after you hear them doing &quot;When The Ship Comes In&quot; in the style of the &quot;Irish Rover&quot; and other classic Irish pub songs, you might have to go check them out on their own turf.<br />As you can expect, there are some solid covers by some major artists, starting with John Mellencamp's &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; Stevie Wonder's &quot;Blowin' in the Wind,&quot; and Tracy Chapman's &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin',&quot; continuing with &quot;Richie Havens' &quot;Just Like A Woman,&quot; Neil Young's &quot;All Along the Watchtower,&quot; Chrissie Hynde's &quot;I Shall Be Released,&quot; and Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers on &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35.&quot;  There is even old timers June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash singing &quot;It Ain't Me, Babe,&quot; while the youngest generation is represented by Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready on &quot;Masters of War.&quot;  My choice for the two best tracks on the album would be Eric Clapton's stellar blues version of &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot; and Lou Reed ripping through &quot;Fool of Pride&quot; like a man possessed.  Half the energy on the disc is on that one track.<br />The main thing is to remember this concert was basically a giant party.  In that spirit the O'Jays doing &quot;Emotionally Yours&quot; is more interesting than Roger McGuinn doing &quot;Mr. Tamourine Man&quot; essentially the same way the Byrds did way back when.  I was going to comment that not many of Dylan's contemporaries showed up for this concert, but even when your have George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Willie Nelson, and Stevie Wonder showing up, you still do not have anyone of Dylan's stature.  After all, neither Elvis nor Frank Sinatra wrote the songs they sang (which may explain why they were two of the greatest performers of the 20th century), and only Lennon &amp; McCartney are going to compete with him as a songwriter.  But why the Beatles get the melodies, Dylan wins on the lyrics, which is no contest since he is the American poet laureate.

0805047905|5.0|Much like the jazz song accompanying my worst nightmare, in which every band member plays something different all at the same time, seeing one of my twin daughters approach me out of the corner of my eye carrying \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" brings about a cold sweat and makes me want to reach for a tube of airplane glue and a warm lager.  I originally checked this out of our local library for them in the hopes of temporarily weaning them off the glass teat world of Barney, Little People, and Kipper, but little did I realize they would take to it like flies to garbage, memorizing most of it within a few hours.  Shortly thereafter, I tried to hide the book but it kept reappearing until the mere sight of it became about as welcome as Roger Clinton backstage at a Marilyn Manson concert.  My selfish motives and petty complaining aside, \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" is full of colorful pictures, an easy-to-learn rhyming scheme and by its very nature is trance inducing to most kids under the age of 3.  For that reason alone, it's a godsend.
0060012358|4.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld series has topped British bestseller lists for years and has a sizable fanbase in the United States as well. Now with \\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" Pratchett expands Discworld from adult fantasy to young adult fantasy as well.<br />A boy, a cat, and a troupe of rats arrive at the town of Bad Blintz. But while Keith is normal, feline Maurice and his \\"educated rodents\\" are not -- they speak, think, and are self-aware (they ate wizards' garbage). And they have a nice racket going, where the rats pretend to infest a town (they gnaw things and \\"widdle\\" on the flour), and Keith poses as a piper to lead them away. But something is wrong with Bad Blintz -- there are no native rats, yet the rat-catchers claim that there's an outright plague of them, and are producing rat-tails to prove it. (They bear a remarkable resemblance to shoelaces)<br />With the help of a too-imaginative-for-her-own good girl, Malicia, Keith and Maurice begin to investigate why all the rats are gone, and what the rat-catchers are up to. But  when they discover the conspiracy, Maurice starts hearing the voice of something down in the sewers -- something evil, something powerful, something that can command hundreds of rats...<br />So help me, I'm an idiot where funny titles are concerned, and \\"Amazing Maurice\\" is further proof that they often c. Much as he gave a new spin to MacBeth in \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" here he gives a new spin to the \\"Pied Piper\\" legend, with some interesting philosophy and his trademarked humor as well. Does the idea of talking animals and preteens make you cringe? Don't -- Pratchett handles it with rare style.<br />There's plenty of humor in this book, from the names of the rats (Dangerous Beans, Additives, Big Savings, Toxie) to Sardines, the tap-dancing rat with a hat to the incident with the laxatives. His dialogue is still brilliant. (\\"Think of my dear wife and my four lovely children who'll be without their daddy!\\" \\"You're not married. You don't have any children!\\" \\"I might want some day!\\")<br />But Pratchett doesn't forget the deeper currents either -- the sense of evil he builds up is very genuine, and Spider is one of the most unique fantasy villains he's created. Also good is the attitude of the Changed rats: they cherish their greater intelligence, fear their instincts, and gradually we see them overcome some of those ratty instincts (rather than eating one of their dead, they bury him like humans do).<br />Keith is a nice character, seeming dim  but surprisingly intelligent; Malicia is a pain in the butt, and only seems to gain any brains near the end. Maurice is the character that Pratchett does best -- he seems, initially, to have no good characteristis, but he's a good person underneath. (With a dirty little secret involving one of the rats) The Educated Rodents are all given individual personalities that Pratchett juggles very well. And Dangerous Beans, a little blind rat, has one of the best scenes in which he confronts the mysterious Spider.<br />\\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" isn't actually that different from Pratchett's adult fantasies, and older fans of that series will enjoy this one just as much as the kids.

0393057658|4.0|The only negative review so far at this site seemed to confuse the author's craftmanship with his subject.  This is a well-written, quick read, which, if you are any kind of baseball fan, will cause you to stop repeatedly and think about what you've just read.<br />Every baseball fan has asked themselves over and over, why are marginal players overpaid?  Why are millions invested in ONE player to the detriment of the team?  Why does ownership seem trapped in some preconceived notion of what a ballplayer should look like?  This book seeks to answer those questions and present an alternative view of how to run a winning team.  And here, in a nutshell is that answer:<br />Position players should be signed based on the On Base Percentage.  Pitchers should be signed based on Strikeouts, Walks, Home runs allowed and groundballs.<br />There.  That's it.  Time to go home and enjoy your vast savings, Mr. Steinbrenner.<br />Of course it's more complex than that, but perversely, Major League Baseball seems to have based its criteria for quality on a completely subjective and error-prone system: Wins, earned run average, batting average, runs batted in.<br />The book does a wonderful job of demonstrating how a small germ of an idea took hold, slowly grew, and then became embraced by people with the position to do something about it.  It's the Revenge of the Nerds and it's positively engaging.<br />Billy Beane comes off as some 21st Century tortured prince, except he's not Hamlet trying to avenge his father's death, he's every jerk high school jock you ever met who, as an adult, hates himself.  Freud wouldn't even get out of bed for this one.  <br />It's sad because he and his computer geeks could actually save baseball from itself. But there is not one incident of joy reported in this book. It would be nice to read that he turned down the Red Sox job because he wanted to stay close to his daughter, but she is never mentioned as a consideration.  It's just a shame that someone whose eyes were opened to the real value of ballplayers doesn't carry the exhileration of someone lost, now found, but rather wields it like some terrible weapon.<br />And objectivity, statistics and mathematics notwithstanding, the fact is that nine Miggy Tejadas are preferable to nine Scott Heddeburg (sp?).
B00006LLNU|4.0|There is no title, only a pair of parentheses. The tracks have no titles. There is no cover design except a jumble of silver tree branches and dark gray forest photos. There are no words in the cover booklet, only a series of silvery, ghostly shots of grass/branches. This lack of adornment only emphasizes the quiet, powerful music of Sigur Ros, with no distractions.<br />The music ranges from soft piano-driven numbers with a slight whining effect (the first track), slow and soft (the second track), a richer and less ethereal sound (the third track), a slow, steady drumming accenting the singing (the sixth track), and a hybrid of the haunting and the percussive (the eighth).<br />The high, clear vocals of J&oacute;nsi are haunting and almost spiritual at times, as if a ghost were singing. In some tracks (like the last one) the vocals become more solid and less ghostly, with a sort of sweet coldness. Utilized with stunning effect are guitars, piano, synthesizer, percussion, and who knows what else. The result is a stunning panorama of music.<br />It's not perfect -- occasionally the music can become somewhat repetitive, such as the drum beats that repeat themselves with no variation. And, of course, despite the Icelandic background of Sigur Ros, J&oacute;nsi doesn't sing in Icelandic. As with the drums, he sings quite repetitively as well.<br />This album has a sort of quiet, cool beauty to it. Though not perfect it's harmonious, ethereal, calming, quite pretty to listen to.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This 3 cd set is just unbelievable! Zeppelin at its best! Blows away The Song Remains The Same Live! They could have just been 'on' for those 2 shows or the recording exceptionally reengineered or both. Go buy the cd set and the dvd as well. You will not be disappointed! Excellent! It was a long time coming but well worth the wait! Great music that only Zeppelin could do!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Well here it is, the moment all LOTR fans have been waiting for: the release of the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien's/Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. And to sum up what I thought about the movie in one sentence: The Two Towers is a magnificent sequel to an equally magnificent film (The Fellowship of the Ring). And, for all those long-time Tolkien fans who thought Peter Jackson went far too astray from the books, this movie stays very faithful to the book, minus some unnecessary dialogue/scenes, that would have bogged the film down. Though, I should mention, some end sequences that were in the original publication (Book) have been moved to the last film; The Return of the King.<br />     The first thing I would like to talk about is the mood of the film; the Two Towers has very dark and depressing feeling to it (which I like) that really expresses the dire situations the characters are in. The film really has a very foreboding presence to it. It really makes you feel as though you are there, at Helm's Deep, waiting to fight, waiting to die. And thins rings true to all the scenes, whether your with Frodo and Sam on their impossible journey, or with Merry and Pippen, trying to free them selves from the orc's grasp. Whatever scene it is, it makes you feel as though you are apart of the movie. A feeling I thoroughly enjoyed.<br />     The Computer Generated Images (CGI) are amazing. They blend in with the rest of the scenery so well, it almost seem as though they're real images rolling across the screen. All through the film this holds true, even in the battle scenes in Helm's Deep where a huge amount of Animation was used, it still looked real! And, when you talk about CGI in the Two Towers, you have to, of course, mention Gollum. The CGI the filmmakers use to make him is also spectacular, making him have that almost-real look to him. Gollum is one of the most life-like CGI characters I have ever seen on film.<br />     The cinematography is, as the first filmalso was, the best I have every seen; the exuberant colors, the razor sharp tint of the actors eyes, the exciting camera angles that make this movie all the more breathtaking.<br />     And the plot of the film is (of course) amazing! The Lord of the Rings book saga is probably the best literature written in the 20th century. And all of that masterful storytelling is carried over on to film.<br />     I thought I should also mention the comedy in this film, mainly delivered by Gimli, the dwarf. His comedy really lightens up this very dark film without making it corny.<br />     `So,' you might ask, `Is the Two Towers, the second film better then the first?' (The Fellowship of the Ring) To state it simply... No, in my opinion, The Fellowship is a tat-bit better the Two Towers. But I certainly couldn't argue with anyone who said other wise...
B00008OWZC|5.0|Zep has finally released live material that does their legend justice. As a fan since 73 I was disappointed in the Song Remains the Same soundtrack and wished there were more uninterrupted live concert segments in the film of the same name. There are many excellent Zep bootleg CDs out there but here we have the crystal clear Jimmy Page treatment of sound. The DVD has even more amazing sound- you must have that as the companion to the CD. The only drawback is that after seeing/listening to this music the current [...] state of the music scene is even more apparent. ENJOY!
B00008OWZC|5.0|This album is a compliation of two California concerts. This is Led Zeppelin's first live album since \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" soundtrack, excluding BBC Sessions. Zep is not afraid to improvise, and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" occupy 45 minutes alone. These recordings are very different from the quiet studio recordings; the guitars are at full blast, the drums crash, and even the muted noise of the audience can be heard. There are countless surprises in this album. Among other things, \\"Black Dog\\" begins with the intro from \\"Out On The Tiles,\\" as it usually does when performed live. This album contains many great songs like \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Stairway To Heaven,\\" and the ever-popular \\"Immigrant Song.\\" Why bother with bootlegs when you can have the high-quality sensation of a concert in your own home? This is a must for any fan. I would recommend this and BBC Sessions if you want awesome live albums.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Released in conjunction with the 2-dvd set, also entitled \\"How The West Was Won\\", this is absolutely the best \\"live\\" Led Zeppelin cd I've ever heard. Actually comprised of three cd's taken from 1972 performances at The LA Forum on June 25th and The Long Beach Arena on June 27th, this impressive collection of concerts shows the creativity and energy that Led Zeppelin possessed. Almost everyone of the songs performed has something extra that the original studio album versions seems to be missing. And that is, the extra guitar solos that Jimmy Page injects into these songs giving them a whole new feeling. He constantly improvises on the original lead guitar breaks which add energy to the song(s). A good example can be heard in the twenty five minute version of \\"Dazed And Confused\\", which is actually a medley with the songs \\"Walter's Walk\\" and \\"The Crunge\\". You hear blues guitar licks, solid rock licks as well as the use of the classic violin bow guitar technique that Page is so well known for. Other examples of Page's improvision can be heard in \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". And enough can't be said of drummer John Bonham, one listen to the nineteen minute version of \\"Moby Dick\\" is enough to prove that he was clearly one of rock's best drummers. Singer, Robert Plant's voice is strong throughout the concerts, although every so often he strains to hit those high notes (ex. \\"Immigrant Song\\"), nonetheless his vocals are a trademark of the group and without him there would be no Led Zeppelin. His vocal interplay (scat) between he and Page's guitar licks is exciting and can be heard in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" which is a medley and contains the songs \\"Let's Have A Party\\", \\"Hello Marylou\\" and \\"Going Down Slow\\". Bassist John Paul Jones playing is excellent and as always adds the needed bottom end to the Led Zeppelin sound. He also plays synthesizer and acoustic guitar as well. <BR>The songs performed are from the albums Led Zeppelin (\\"Dazed And Confused\\"),Led Zeppelin II (\\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Bring It On Home\\"), Led Zeppelin III (\\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", \\"That's The Way\\", \\"Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp\\"), Led Zeppelin IV (\\"Black Dog\\", \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"Going To California\\", \\"Rock And Roll\\") and \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" (\\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\", \\"Dancing Days\\", \\"The Ocean\\"). I might add that the group sounds much tighter than their performance on the live 2-cd called \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". The sound quality of \\"How The West Was Won\\" is excellent and you actually feel as though your sitting in the audience when listening to it. This is an exciting three cd \\"live\\" set and no rock lover young or old should be without it. Even better though, is the two dvd set that includes more songs from various concerts during the different stages of Led Zeppelin's career. Highly Recommended!
B00008PX8P|1.0|As a lover of good music with real heart, soul and guts I am very disappointed to have wasted the money on this.<br />Jimmy Page's guitar work is painfully clumsy and unimaginative, Baldwin is as ploddingly pedestrian as ever, Bonzo is drumming to the tempo of a different tune every time and Percy struggles to inject any charisma throughout the DVD...<br />Keep away from Led Zeppelin. They only ever came close to being good once....
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have yet to watch this DVD from beginning to end. What I have seen is just awesome. I have made it as far as Moby Dick on disc 1 and cannot stop watching Bonzo at his finest. I have goose bumps just thinking about it. My wife who has watched it with me and knows not a lot about drums already knows that it is awe inspiring. <BR>How many more times is equally as awesome as Moby Dick.<br />The only thing about this DVD is it makes me wish I was my age now in the 70's because there is nothing like seeing Zep live, but this is the closest I will ever come. The sound is great, the video is great, and Zep is of course Zep. <br />If you are a Zeppelin fan of any kind get this DVD now!
B00008OWZC|5.0|short review: standout tracks: i can say i liked allsongs, all cds...however in the following order 1st, 3rd, and 2nd cd.  a great mix of folk and rock throughout.<br />long review: A dronin, internationally folkish, blue grassy, funky swingin, rockabilly, blues drenched, hoedownish, salsero rockero, techno-loungin, bach-ified, rockin-stompin, rollin fest.  Nice rhythm section too...a foot that plays like fingers, fingers that play like feet...a guitar that sings, and a voice that bends like guitar strings...<br />Singer is in a concise & controlled yet ecstatic & rappin mode throughout(no lemon advertisements thk goodness, just bluesy moanin)....he's great on the folksy songs.  The lead guitarist is sloppy... but what a sloppiness.  He likes to solo all over the place.  Makes the history of guitar playin, ala townsend(who i like very much ala liveleeds), look smooth as a silken motor-machine....but this zep page of history is made of sheep's wool & strong leather on the outside, with a wrinkled cotton-linen shirt on the inside...and chamois-blue suede shoes on the feats....which aint all that bad is it? a contemporary-celtic-saxon-spanish-baroque-bluesman to say the least...<br />I thought the grateful dead were eclectic...i have heard other zep live stuff but this is so deep of a package.  You get a nice blend of all styles.  Personally i like listening to the music as is...without any video to distract from it.  The audio experience lets the music speak for itself...just like listening to any album for the first time.<br />...check out the samples first if your hesitant...at amazon & the [internet site]they are the same.<br />cheers zep for a job well done...then and now...you got nothin to prove in my book...for now at least...

Some kid told me, when I confronted him about that, that &quot;well, lots of the beatles albums were only 30-40 minutes long&quot; well duh. back then they had VINYL. VINYL doesn't hold much more than 40 minutes of music. What's Linkin park's excuse? Oh that's right, they aren't musicians, they're deep fried pre-packaged music industry bullcrap.

From the very first song on disc 1, it is clear this is a band in their prime, more powerful than anything that's ever been heard before. Highlights from disc 1 : White Summer, Page sitting on a chair and Bonham listening in the backround with his eyes closed. Moby Dick : blows the Song Remains The Same version out of the water, I've been a Zeppelin fan for years and years and I didn't realize Bonham was that good, and I always thought he was the greatest drummer ever! I would put his work on that solo against anything any drum solo any drummer has ever done. How Many More Times : awesome. the breakdown in the middle of the song, the crowd comes alive and repeat every grunt and hiss Plant makes. Dead silence except for him and the crowd of thousands hanging on his every breath. Great Stuff.<BR> Disc Two only gets better. Highlights : John Bonham singing harmonies in The Ocean and Bron Yr Aur Stomp! The acoustic set is for me the peak of the whole thing. John Paul Jones works the mandolin while Jimmy Page sways the the sweet sounds of Going To California and That's The Way. absolutely beautiful stuff. Which makes the next song, In MY Time Of Dying (perhaps their heaviest song ever) all that more awesome, the slide solo on that song is amazing. I personally liked the Madison Square Garden outakes if only to hear The Ocean and Misty Mountain Hop.<BR> Finally Knebworth, which proves that they were still the best band around, they might have been overblown and tired of the whole thing by then, but when you hear Achilles Last Stand or Nobody's Fault But Mine, you realize that nobody can touch this band. Plant's voice is great here especially on Achilles, he manages to get every part in there, since the recorded version had about ten different voices.<BR>In conclusion, this is the definitive Zeppelin experience, it is so much better the SRTS it's sad. Get it at all costs.
0679721037|5.0|With all the diverse happenings of World War Two only a few events have left a lasting mark on our conscience, as well as the areas at which they took place: the bombing of Pearl Harbor; American internment camps; German labor and extermination camps; the Battle of Britain; and the atomic horror, Hiroshima.  These have become common World War Two lore in the United States.  But with all the dry, one-sided history texts we learn from a change of vantage becomes refreshing and sometimes even necessary.  This is where supplemental readings become invaluable to seeing history in a broader perspective.  Books such as Hiroshima allow the reader to transcend the cold facts of history texts.<br /> John Hersey's Hiroshima is a series of detailed journalistic accounts taken from various survivors at Hiroshima.  August 6th, 1945, an infamous day for many the world over, and many more in Japan and more so for the survivors of what some people believed a needless travesty.  However for Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fuji, Mrs Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terfumi Sasaki and the Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto this day was a day of immeasurable luck against all the odds, this was the day they lived and this is a book chronicling their stories.  A last minute decision to help some one move old clothes for a goodwill drive, the luck of the Irish saving a Japanese man suspended by parts of his own house, a woman struggling to free her own kids from the rubble and then clothe them, a quickly timed decision to go this way instead of that, each of these stories relating to the blinding flash of the noiseless death that each of them lived through is remarkably told by John Hersey.  <br /> John Hersey's book brings to life the horrors unleashed by the atomic genie of the age in a vivid, horrific and humanly emphasizing way.   It gives depth to one of the last acts of World War Two and a glimpse of how \\"Human\\" the declared enemy is.  It gives us a comparative look at ourneighbors in the world and how our differences are our similarities, as well as our common interests.  I found this book to be of great interest and added a wealth of knowledge that allowed at least one aspect of the war to be grounded in my reality.  It shows the reader an uncensored view of the life during the war and in Hiroshima at the time of and after the bombing.  It gives the reader everything from daily routines and chores that the citizens were occupying themselves with, the response to the flash, the confusion of the citizens, the after affects of the fallout, the state of the ruinous city, are each described by the six individuals interviewed by John Hersey. I believe this is a great read and a written memorial to all those who lived, died and were born throughout this time-it also serves as a great warning of the power we as humans have to create, or create destruction.
B00008OWZC|5.0|While Led Zeppelin made great studio albums, their one live album left a lot to be desired. This record fixes that problem. All three CD's are well-mastered and sound great. The songs Page picked are a good variety of their first four albums. Now, I just need to get the DVD. This album is a keeper on my Ipod.
0743201140|5.0|All your life you probably have been told to work on your weakest link, to develop what you are missing, to become a renaissance person by turning all your weaknesses into strength.  This is nice, but completely utopic for one thing, and really painful for another.  Who wants to really seriously focus on their weaknesses.  If they are weaknesses, there are for a reason.  It is because you really don't like doing those things.  But, within a Protesto-Judeo-Christian upbringing, this was not an acceptable answer.<br />Well, maybe now it is.  Comes now this wonderful book, who allows every one to go out swinging on their strength alone, and become the best you can be.<br />The test alone, with the website follow up, is worth the price of the book.  In my case, the finding of my best 5 strengths was right on the mark.
1401200613|5.0|Whether you have the actual issues this book contains (Batman 608-12) or not, you should pick this one up.  Loeb writes an amazing story and Jim Lee's work is fantastic.  While I don't think it's Lee's best work (for that buy X-Men Mutant Genesis), it's still amazing.  And at the price Amazon is selling this book, there's no reason not to get it.
1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby takes the &quot;geek-ishness&quot; of avid music lovers and weaves a funny story of loves lost and the soundtrack to life. Each new character is described by the movies and music they love, which makes perfect sense to pop-culture junkies.<br />It reads quickly and fluidly once you find the character's voices. The London vernacular and slang take a few pages to get used to, but once I read the book with an &quot;English accent&quot;, the characters took immediate shape and depth.<br />I would describe it as the man's take on Bridget Jones.
B0000027RL|4.0|This is still one of my favorite CD's for just kickin back and listening to great rock.  Being a fan of heavier metal rock, this is a relaxing CD for me.  My favorites are Even Flow, Alive, Why Go, Black, and Jeremy.  From the harder drum and bass of Why Go and Porch, to the laid back vocals on Alive, Black, and Jeremy, to the almost too soft tunes of Oceans and Garden, wrapping up with the almost mystical finish of Release, this is one great CD to add to any rocker's collection.
B00005JLPK|2.0|This is an awful movie of the life of one of the best painters of Mexico. This is because Salma is playing Salma not Frida. If you really want to see a really good movie about this painter watch \\"Frida, Naturaleza viva\\" with Ofelia Medina it's in spanish but you can find it with english subtitles.
B00000E2VC|5.0|I`m surprised to be the first to review this CD, since this is a well-known recording.  The playing is outstanding throughout and has been a top recommendation in many publications (albeit, mostly French). <br />The Italian master`s playing is one of the seven wonders of piano and this recording really captures is raptuous sound in what Hifi buffs will find very satisfying.  The repertoire chosen by the Maestro is proof that Chopin`s music is of the ages and for the ages.  The Mazurkas are played with a great sense of architecture and mystery.  The Sherzo is a marvel, Michelangeli having an uncommon breadth and technical facility that reveals the music behind the score, not just sheer virtuosity.  A Chopin recording to end all Chopin recordings.  Highly recommended!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I highly recommend this set to anyone with a DVD player and who is a Zeppelin fan!<br />My favorite section is the \\"black and white footage\\" of them performing such classic songs as How Many More Times, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, Dazed and Confused, and Communication Breakdown.  I especially like the How many More Times on this performance.  I like when Robert introduces each member of the band and when he gets to Jimmy Page, Jimmy starts doing the riff to \\"Smokestack Lightnin'\\". <br />The other material is superb as well.  Love the acoustic set of Earl's Court, and the Kashmir from \\"Knebworth\\".<br />Only negative I have so far for this set is that they should have left in the \\"Black Mountainside\\" intro. that goes into Kashmir on the Knebworth show.  But it still is excellent!<br />What I like to do is watch it all in order (pretty much).<br />The RAH footage is superb as well.  Highlights: White Summer/Black Mountainside and the Moby Dick.<br />It does look to me that there is still unsynched footage in the MSG show.  But the color is brilliant/vibrant and the performance spectacular!  Love The Ocean.  Bonzo should have sung more with the band!<br />Bottom line: Zep fans rejoice!  Because this video is the best that Zep has to offer and Page & Co. delivers us the goods for sure!  A+++
B000089RVX|5.0|wow when i bought this album i had no idea it was going to be soo dark! it was kinda scary, but i absolutely loved it! Amy lee has the most beautiful voice ive heard in a long time (besides christina aguilera). this cd is worth every cent i paid for it. she does sound like a heavier sarah mclachlan but when i heard this album it reminded me of linkin park. when im reading this review im surprised that so many people said the same thing. its liek gothic and dark rock. to anybody who doesnt like them you have some serious issues. stop trying to critique things so carefully. you way outnumbered by people that like them so just give it up!
B000002LPD|5.0|Subsequently it's been all downhill. Balance had it's moments but was far from cohesive. For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge was released at the perfect time, a few months before grunge took over, murdering Hair Bands and hurting Van Halen themselves in the process. Eddie's high-flying guitar antics seemed to fall out of favor. For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (F.U.C.K) was indeed the hardest rocking of the Sammy albums. Their decision to work with Ted Templeman was a wise choice, the production is a leaps and bounds improvement over OU812, I can actually hear Mike's Bass again.<br />Here's my song-by-song analysis:<br />1.Poundcake-Terrific opener. Eddie used a drill to make those guitar sound effects. (And in all fairness he wasn't the first, Paul Gilbert of Mr. Big had done so before him.)<br />2.Judgement Day-Fast tempo rocker, love the chorus.<br />3.Spanked-Sleazy lyrics, the mainframe has a mid-night feel.<br />4.Runaround-Hook-heavy. You'll be singing it all day!<br />5.Pleasure Dome-Epic song. Mood setting and atmospheric with Out of control drums and a screaming chorus.<br />6.In N'Out-Boasts a mid-paced swagger. Catchy as hell.<br />7.Man on a mission-Delightful opening lick. A full throttle track, crank it up.<br />8.The Dream is Over-Excellent lyrics about trying one's best in society.<br />9.Right Now-Great song, no question. The keyboard/Bass intro is extremely catchy. You may remember the video constantly flashed messages and facts on the screen. If there's one thing I dislike it's that this song was overexposed, the video won an MTV award, and it was even used in commercials to tout Crystal Clear Pepsi (In hindsight that was a gaffe).<br />10.3:16-A guitar instrumental dedicated to Eddie's newly-born son. \\"3:16\\" being his date of birth. This isn't a technically impressive track like \\"Spanish Fly\\", but still though it's not bad.<br />11.Top of the world-Sounds similar to \\"Dance the night away\\" but don't let that deter you. The bridge is noteworthy, with the steady \\"oooh, oooh\\" backing vocals.<br />\\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" proved to skeptics once and for all that the Sammy Hagar-era could rock relentlessly without keyboards. This album marks Van Halen's last go-around with greatness, Besides the botched David Lee Roth reunion attempt that occured 5 years later.
B00003CXA6|5.0|God like, is the phrase I use to measure this movie. But If you really like this movie buy the collecters edition. My true love in life is the battle of Gettysburg. I've been there eight times and I owe it all to this Movie. If there was one thing I could say to Ron Maxwell and Ted Turner for making this movie would be &quot;Thank You.&quot;
B00008NRL8|4.0|I've had the foreign version of this CD since I walked into a middle eastern restaurant and heard Gotan's version of Frank Zappa's &quot;Chunga's Revenge&quot; playing on the stereo. (I'm a HUGE Zappa fan and I really enjoy it when other bands tackle the challenging music of the master.) <br />Everything else here is pretty good, too. I like their other cover version here, as well--Gato Barbieri's &quot;Last Tango in Paris.&quot; <br />You're not gonna get up and dance with this one but if you want to relax or fool around with your significant other, this CD will do you just fine.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the definition of a haunting CD.  Like everyone else (probably), I bought this CD because of Bring Me To Life and was left scratching my head after the first run through.  Amy Lee is an incredible vocalist that at times has an Enya feel (if Enya crossed over into goth).  I think that it's unfair that others say Evanescence is a knock off of Linkin Park though - Evanescence brings a much less contrived, holistic aspect to the table - sans the hip-hop record scratching.  This is as close to a desert island CD as I have found in months.
B00006BTCA|5.0|As one who has disliked a lot of the new rock this year (bland rehashing) I expected to ignore this disk, too.  Especially disturbing was the comparison to 'old tyme' favorite Joy Division.  Alas, these lads have lived up to the bruhaha of the media giants.  We're not talking the most exciting rock you've ever heard just some of the most intense and expressive you've got in a bit.
B00008S2VH|2.0|As a huge Madonna fan, I was very disappointed with this album.  She should have written a book of poetry and put out a dance album.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|.. that anything could be this bizarre and disconnected with reality, and still be funny an entertaining.<br />I went into this movie without any expectations.  I was told &quot;It's weird&quot; and even &quot;It's stupid&quot; but such 2 word reviews don't really tell me anything.<br />Anyway, here goes:<br />We start out with our anti-Hero, Donnie Darko, who is leading a bizarre night life. Every morning, he wakes up far away from his bed in his pajamas.  He also sees things.  Things like giant rabbits. Oh, and air planes fall on his house.  Also, time travel.<br />Yes. Weird.  Many little things set this apart from other movies. From it's wonderful characterization (Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance), to it's slow yet not-boring pace.  I left the theatre wondering what I just experienced. My mind attempted to make sense of everything, and I realized that is exactly the intention.<br />This movie wasn't pretentiously cerebral, dealing with esoteric concepts. This movie was about the struggle of an immensely intelligent kid who is more than a little crazy.  The philosophy comes in the form of his explorations and thought processes.  He sees the world so clearly, yet nobody else does.<br />A fascinating look at the mind of a dark young man.
0553274503|5.0|This book is very deep and full of interesting and thought provoking analysis of a science experiment that in effect helped, but then turned on the main [challenged] adults. During this time, he gets the opportunity to have an experiment on him to increase his intelligence, something his mother always wanted for him when he was younger. After the experiment is performed, his knowledge increases and he becomes a genius, absorbing all types of information at rapid speeds. While many will view this book as one man's journey through this, it is really about sexual experiences and emotional breakthroughs throughout his \\"new life\\". After the experiment he starts to understand what his emotions and sexual abilities mean and he utilizes them. This is truly a work of art by an amazing author, Daniel Keyes who spent a tremendous amount of time into the completion of this book.
B0000636UN|5.0|I am amazed. Sheryl Crow, with her humble beginnings, managed to strike a chord with the American populace.  Her previous albums were successful, but not nearly to this extent.  However, unlike most pop music, this album has redeeming musical qualities. Instead of ... carefully tailored lead singers (with the music being secondary) Sheryl Crow comes through loud and clear on every track.<br />I found myself tapping my foot right from the beginning, with my favorite song from the album, Steve McQueen.  Throughout the album, a great mix of styles and moods presents itself, from brooding, almost painful qualities in Safe and Sound.. to the upbeat Soak up the Sun, and C'Mon C'Mon.<br />Great album!
0930289331|5.0|Frank Miller - that says it right there.  Anyone who's read Batman: The Dark Knight Returns knows exactly how capable he is with this character of writing an amazing story.  Many of us know how Batman began, but this gives us a totally new perspective - it makes the Dark Knight more human... and it does the same thing to Jim Gordon.  One one hand, it makes him more dangerous (his fight with that fellow Detective) and on the other, more sympathetic (his love of his wife, and yet his very visible humanity, shown in his affair).<BR>  <BR>The only thing to say is that if you're interested in an evening of good reading, take this and BM: TDKR (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns), and even TDKSA (Dark Knight Strikes Again), settle back, and you've got some well-drawn pages ahead of your eyes.
B000089RVX|5.0|I don't know where they came from, but I like it!<br />This group rose to fame after two of it's song (My Immortal and Bring Me to Life) were featured on the Daredevil soundtrack.  Instead of playing to the formula, they have created a series of songs, each unlike the others.<br />The strong points of this song, in my opinion, would be My Last Breath, with a slightly faster paced, almost lonely quality that makes it absolutely irresistable.<br />The composition in this album is rather common, but it shows uncommon strength and individuality. In a sea of assembly line music, we seem to have a bit of inspired music.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Holy smoke!<br />The sound and picture quality of this DVD set is exceptional - from the band who helped launch thousands of ships!<br />It truly does look and sound as if it were recorded yesterday!<br />An amazing band that stands the test of time...Rock On Zep!<br />Thanks Jimmy and all those involved...
B000089RVX|5.0|Oh GOD people, this isn't *anything* like Linkin Park. So, they're both dark? I think it's only because of the rap on &quot;Bring me to life&quot; that people got this comparsion. If anything, Evanescence sounds more along the lines of Lacuna Coil or Tapping the Vein. <BR>For those who don't know, this not their debut album. They have two EPs and another full length album, &quot;Origin&quot;. Which is amazing! For those who say Evanescence have no variety in their songs, you ought to get your hands on Origin. There is less of a nu-metal sound and more pianos and such.<BR>Fallen, while not having the amount of variety as Origin, is still a beautiful album. Yes, I agree that some of it sounds alike, but *shrugs* it's still lovely and her voice hits me every time with its pureness and emotion. <BR>I would highly recommend this album and eagerly await their next. Hopefully they will blend components of &quot;Origin&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot; together and create a masterpeice!
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I am a fan of the 1960s George Pal classic movie and when I saw the preview of the 2002 remake I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately this movie was a complete disappointment. Where do I start?, well, The storyline is completely different than the book and the 1960s original. The movie has no scientifical explanation and/or fascination regarding time travel in general. The soundtrack does not draw you in. I get the feeling that this film was a quick put togheter project rushed out to the big screen hoping to make it big relying on the success and the following of the original movie. The only thing I liked was the actual machine, althought not as stylish and elegant as the original it is nevertheless a beautiful piece of machinery, more on the mechanical side than the classic one. Overall: MEDIOCRE.
B000002UAR|5.0|After the ground breaking `Rubber Soul', experimentation was encouraged in the Beatles camp. It was the results of this experimentation that was partially the reason for the hiatus from the concert scene at the end of 1966, after Candlestick Park. This is the start of the `classic studio Beatles period' for me. Although I respect other reviewer's rights to opinions, I cannot believe how low some ratings for REVOLVER are here. Some have even dared to call it boring. Call it many things, but `boring' is not a word that can be applied to this release. There is not a `duff' track on this album. REVOLVER is a perfect jump off point for those novices just leaping into the realm of the Beatles' studio releases. <br /> <BR>TAXMAN - A word or two of protest about the British Tax system from the normally placid Mr. George Harrison (although John Lennon had claimed to have written part of it). From the fake count-in to the fade out, this is musical sneering at it's a finest (no wonder Lennon claimed partner authorship!) The guitar solo, like the rest of the song, is jabbing and angry.<br />ELEANOR RIGBY - A piece of orchestral brilliance from Paul McCartney about the last days and death of a lonely spinster. The string arrangement adds a touch of sadness and desperation to the tale. Also, who would not kill to have written these lines: \\"All the lonely people, where do they all come from; all the lonely people, where do they all belong?\\"<br />I'M ONLY SLEEPING - John Lennon was notoriously lazy, so it is only fitting that he write a hymn to doing nothing (beating Brian Wilson by three years!) Gently rolling number with effective use of xylophone in the mix. McCartney's accompanying harmonies always impresses me.<br />LOVE YOU TO - A fine example of raga-rock from George, stating that there are some heartless folks out there who just get off on `labelling' other folks. Like it or not, George Harrison played an integral part in bringing Indian Music into Mass Western acceptance.<br />HERE, THERE, AND EVERYWHERE - A beautiful ballad by Paul, extolling the virtues of his lady love and his need of her. One of the few songs on this album that gets by with just the `two guitars, one bass and drums' set-up of older Beatles releases.<br />YELLOW SUBMARINE - A classic Paul contribution (with some help from Donavon) for Ringo Starr to lay his vocals around. Suits his `down home' voice just fine and would be the impetus for an animated classic film in 1969. Check out the nautical sound effects and John bellowing through a megaphone.<br />SHE SAID, SHE SAID - The results of a conversation between John Lennon and Peter Fonda, this was an indication the era of the `lovable mop-tops' was coming quickly to a close. Lennon sings in a droning pitch as if unbelieving of what has occurred. Psychedelic classic here one year before the Summer of Love.<br />GOOD DAY, SUNSHINE - Bouncy McCartney number about being in love on a bright, sunny day. Sing along harmonies in the chorus, and a rinky-dink piano arrangement, makes this track impossible to resist.<br />AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING - One of the first examples of Lennon's love of the nonsense lyric at work. Great harmonies in the chorus and effective lead riffs lift this track out of the ordinary. I prefer the version on `Anthology 2' where our heroes are affected with the giggles while laying down the vocals for this tune.<br />FOR NO ONE - The flipside of \\"Here, There And Everywhere\\". It's the wreckage of a break-up and the female half is handling it much better than the male half. The mournful horn solo brings a touch of pathos to the occasion. Another classic from the pen of McCartney.<BR> <BR>DOCTOR ROBERT- An ode to a doctor well known for dispensing chemical `goodies' to innocent rock stars and the like. Lennon's tongue is wedged firmly in his cheek for this one. A parodic blow is dealt in the coda, where our boys sound like a heaven bound choir.<br />I WANT TO TELL YOU - The weakest of the three Harrisontracks on offer, but that's not a bad thing; with Harrison laying bare his state of mind. The pace is bouncy and George's voice is soft and seductive.<br />GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE - Paul getting more than a little soul into his musical diet. The horn arrangement comes directly from the `Motown sound', and McCartney's voice owes more than a little to the master, Little Richard. They had been doing soul covers since the `Please Please Me' album. This is Liverpool soul.<br />TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS - We are going on a scary mind trip courtesy of John Lennon. The drone in his voice and the audio effects make it seem like this trip could be dangerous and/or fatal. Just perfect door opener into the world ands strange times of pschedelia.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is another classic album from the best band in the history of rock-n-roll.  All of the tracks are killer, but there are a few that stand out like:  The 25 minute plus Dazed and Confused, and the 23 minute Whole Lotta Love.  This CD really catches the band in their prime, and at that time there was no better music out there belive me.  You would be doing yourself a favor by picking this one up.  I highly recommend it. Now all we need from the band is one more reunion tour.
6305949972|5.0|I've not seen this movie in a very long time, and it wasn't until just recently that I revisited it. The Nightmare Before Christmas' title sounds like something from a horror movie, but it certainly isn't one. Sure, everything looks grim and creepy, but that's just the setting. The story of Jack Skellington feeling as if everything is a routine for him and wants to experience something different was kinda touching, as is with the songs he sings to himself in the film. The music is creepy at times and is beautiful when needed, and it's all composed by Danny Elfman; who in turn also wrote the songs, and does Jack Skellington's voice. TNMBC was skillfully animated, using the stop-motion style, which most likely took them quite a while to finish. The end product looks pretty good too, especially for a movie released back in '91. Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors, and this film didn't let me down. Not only did it bring back some nice childhood memories, but it also made me feel good in the process. Those parents who aren't sure of showing this film to their kids because it may scare them, at least consider that the movie has NO violence either than a stitched-up lady jumping from a building, but she doesn't get harmed as she puts herself back together. If your kids can handle the creepy looking monsters and creatures, by all means let them watch this movie. They most likely will never forget it.
B000059QYB|4.0|When my 18th birthday arrived, I was still deep inside the mousy, shy girl from private school who only liked her soft music and Shakespeare. Then, with an interest in 80s music anyway, I bought this album. Although Billy Idol is anything but \\"hard music\\" by today's standards, it got me into a harder edge of music than I had ever listened to before; a new horizon. It was all downhill from there for me, and I've never looked back. Today, two years later, Guns N' Roses, Poison, Warrant, AC/DC, etc. dominate my stereo and I have Billy to thank for that. Nearly every song on this album is a hit, with the possible exception of a few released in the early 90's. The obvious hits, of course, are \\"White Wedding\\", \\"Rebel Yell\\", \\"Dancing With Myself\\",and \\"Cradle Of Love\\". Surprisingly, his cover of Simple Minds' \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" is very good, though it's doubtful many younger people will know it from The Breakfast Club. But I'm sure that if you don't tell them that it's an old song, they will love it. The point is, get this album. It encapsules Billy Idol at his finest.
6305971099|3.0|The HALLOWEEN films are alright but some are tiresome like the worst series parts 2,3,and H2O.and the best series are parts 1,4,5,6,and RESURRECTION.this one opens with a plot but gets far from the plot when Michael kills teens and then goes after his neice who's in a clinic for the traumatized.the man in black thing is too silly and unneeded and Michael's mask was terrible and silly.the funniest parts come from when Michael kills the teens in a barn,throws Dr.Loomis off the stairail,and then punctures holes in the laundry shoute and tries to kill his neice and in the laundry shoute then looks up the laundry shoute in his mask is hilarious.more funny than scary.Rated R for graphic violence/gore,language,and some sexuality.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan and all I can say about this DVD set is \\"oh my [...]!!\\" it is fantastic. First off the 5.1 digital sound and DTS is unbelievable and the picture quality is fantastic too!! The performances are unbelievable!! If you are any kind of Led Zeppelin fan you probably went out the first day like me and bought it. I can't wait for the weekend so I can have some cold ones and crank up my Dolby digital system with Led Zeppelin!! Every thing about the collection is awesome seeing that all we had was The Song Remains the same. You can really tell how the picture quality has been done over in the Madison Square Gardens portion of the DVD because we all know what the quality was of the edition, just wait to you see and here that portion of the new DVD set!!

0316548189|5.0|A Long Walk To Freedom by Nelson Mandela is a truly inspiring life story. All who have the chance should read the story of Nelson Mandela. The story is that of a legend and is of epic proportions. Nelson's struggle through life in a Minority controlled South Africa is greatly depicted in this writing. <br />The autobiography of Nelson Mandela does more than just shed light on the facts of Nelson Mandela's life; it allows a person who has never been subject to racism to have an understanding of what it might feel like. This aspect of the book is what I loved so much. I loved how I could be drawn into the book and almost feel the events that occurred in the story. This feeling of attachment or understand of Nelson's life is brought to life by the writing style of the autobiography. Nelson Mandela brings the reader into the story with intense detail and by the use of many South African terms. The use of South African names gives a more real feeling towards the people instead of just having another character, the reader feels like he is getting a special addition to a great story.<br />The descriptive qualities of the book change it from just another autobiography of a great person to a must have and a must read. The life story of Nelson Mandela is all the reason to get this book but when the story is written in such a way that it draws in the reader and makes him feel as if he is there and experiencing nelson's pain and joy. Then the book must not be ignored and is a must have.

0060263857|5.0|I am an English major at a private liberal arts college who spends her time reading many of the world's greatest pieces of literature  and, still, this remains my favorite book. <BR>Any hopeful writer should attempt to craft their work at E.B. White's level. For an author to be able to touch the lives of both children and adults through a passage of fifty years shows talent. <BR>The book covers wonderful ideas such as friendship, sad facts such as death, but even contains many touches of humor (Check out the chapter entitled, \\"The Miracle\\": Charlotte has just written \\"some pig\\" in her web. Mr. Zuckerman quickly believes that Wilbur is no ordinary pig. His wife responds to his quick belief in the unusualness of the pig, by stating,\\" 'It seems to me you're a little off. It seems to me we have no ordinary spider,'\\" to which Mr. Zuckerman responds, \\" 'Oh, no. It's the pig that's unusual. It says so, right there in the middle of the web.'\\").<BR>So, stop waiting for kids to show up in your life and just sit down and read the book. You'll giggle, you'll cry, and at the end you'll agree that, \\"it's not often that someone comes along who is a good writer and a true friend. Charlotte was both.\\"

0743200748|3.0|The late historian Steven Ambrose wrote definitive accounts of the American West, Lewis and Clark, Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon, and the World War II generation. Each topic emerges in some form or another in Comrades, Professor Ambrose's essay indirectly devoted to his father and directly dedicated to friendships among men.<br />At times quite moving, and at others nauseatingly maudlin, Professor Ambrose ruminates about a largely ignored area that may be the most important aspect of history. Ambrose opens with a chapter dedicated to the friendships he had with his brothers. This bodes poorly for the rest of the book (think Dr. Phil and/or Oprah) although that initial reaction proves deceptive. Professor Ambrose ends with a powerful chapter devoted to his friendship with his father. Despite its eloquence, though, the final chapter seems disingenuous at times as the author lauds a man whom he has subtly and not so subtly accused of mental, verbal and physical abuse. This is hard to square with blind praise even if the poetry is beautiful.<br />The book also is weak because of its brevity. The short format does not lend itself to adequate examinations of Ambrose's personal friendships as well as the relationships historical figures such as Crazy Horse and He Dog enjoyed. This brief book required the author to focus exclusively on either the personal or the historical, and he attempted both.<br />Nonetheless, passages of shining prose and heartfelt joy about friendships with other men ultimately save Comrades. Male relationships need further and much deeper exploration, and Ambrose's courageous attempt to tackle the subject, however cursory, is commendable.

This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves. What will Frodo do when this happens? The answer to this question, and the fate of Middle Earth will be revealed in the next books, The Two Towers, and finally, The Return of the King. <br />By: Jud

B00005OAIE|2.0|Let's get real. Mayer is Dave Matthews with less guitar songwriting gifts and less musical originality. Some people don't like Matthews but respect his musicianship at least. I was one of them until Matthews kept expanding pop-rock guitar and doubled it up in his live shows (but that doesn't mean I idolize him either). So Mayer is trying to one-up Matthews in his own style but it's a useless attempt because Matthews has more innate musical knowledge and talent - period. But imitation is the proof. I at least appreciate Mayer's betterment of the pop songwriting nonsense present on today's radio, but that's really the only comparison you can make where he comes out on top. Compared to real singer/guitar/songwriters like Elliot Smith and Paul Weller and lot's more who never make it on MTV, it's a joke. I think I heard some MTV [VJ] refer to Mayer as a guitar god which makes me puke. Sure, Mayer is a guitar god compared to Avril Lavigne. This is the sorriest state in music ever when a guy who even slightly expands the norm of pop creativity like this is misled into delusions of grandeur by profit-hungry flacks. But I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise when it comes from a culture that praises completely non-talented people like Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton as well. The music industry has abandoned the market of anyone over 21 or anyone with a sliver of musical education.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a phenomenal book. I absolutely loved it. But to tell you the truth I wish I had waited until I was a little bit older before I read it. This book made me feel a lot of mixed emotions but the strongest emotion I felt throughout the whole book was fear. First it made me think a lot more about life. It made me think about how important I it is to live your life to the fullest everyday and not take for granted what you have because... tomorrow isn't always promised. That's the part that frightens me it made me think a whole lot more about death. I realized that I should never go to sleep mad at anyone for the sheer fact that he or she or I myself may not be there the next day. These questions came to mind when I finished the book and truly thought about it. How will I die? Could this happen to me? When is my time? When I go is it really the end or will I be able to watch over my family and loved ones from the heavens above just as Susie did throughout the book? In all honesty, this book was amazing every detail kept me hooked.  I couldn't put it down I would read until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. I just think that people shouldn't read this book until they're ready to face the true and very harsh realities of death and loss. Until they are ready to breath in a fresh breath of the real world and be ready to grasp the concept that death will come...Are you ready?  <br />     [...]
B00003CY6M|4.0|Serendipity is a light, romantic comedy that is hard to resist.  It stars the always solid John Cusack and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale.  The chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal and really makes the movie what it is.<br />The two character's struggle to find each other is very entertaining to watch, if not predictable.  But, what's wrong with a movie being predictable, yet fun to watch?  Nothing at all.  <br />The movie is extremely funny in certain parts, but comedy is not the main attraction.  Serendipity has a good meaning that will either put people off or engross them.  You either have to believe in fate or not to like this movie.  And even if you don't, it's still enjoyable to watch.<br />Serendipity is a cute movie that should be mandatory for first date couples to watch.  Even the men will enjoy this one.  4 Stars
0316548189|4.0|Nelson Mandela's A Long Walk to Freedom is a compelling story that follows the life of a freedom fighter from his humble beginnings in a small African village to his inauguration as the first black president of a free South Africa.  The book is filled with many delightful stories, collected over an entire lifetime. Through Mandela's eyes the reader experiences life in South African during the apartheid government, especially the hardships faced by an African active in politics.  I found that one of the most interesting sections of the book was when Mr. Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island, which, in reality, ate up twenty-seven years of his adult life.  It was intriguing to watch as the lives of prisoners changed with the passing years and new characters were introduced, some of them quite memorable.  As much as I enjoyed the story itself, there were times that I felt that the book dragged, weighed down by in depth descriptions of South African political battles and trials, many of which did not appeal to me.  I would recommend this book to political and history buffs who enjoy such passages, but not to the reader looking to read a good story.  Also, there were times that I felt that Mr. Mandela was trying to hard to insert deep philosophical thoughts into his writing in the form of metaphors and similes.  Overall, I believe that despite its shortcomings many readers will find this book an interesting read, perfect for nights when one's mind craves a thought provoking story.

0385335482|5.0|This is the tale of a sweet, naive and imaginative (pathologically so) shopaholic who has a very creative job at a very fabulous financial newsletter.  Haha, in her dreams it's fabulous and creative.  Becky Bloomwood is one of the most refreshing characters I have come across in a long, long time.  I read this book in one sitting.  I was so in love w/her character and all her friends and acquaintances and crazy circumstances that she got herself in.  I just could not put the book down until I finished it.  To me, reading this book gave me the best feeling.  Becky Bloomwood is so sincere and earnest there is just no way you will not like her.  This book will just put you in the best mood because it is laugh out loud funny, the heroine is a moral, upright person (except for the totally ridiculous fibs she comes up with-but all for a good cause) that any girl who LOVES to shop and then might have overwhelming credit card bills can relate to on so many different levels, and her love life will have you grasping your sides in pain and then your heart, which many girls might be able to relate with also. (how's that for a run-on sentence!)<br />So if you want to read a book that makes you happy, go out and buy this book right now!  You won't regret it!  Thank you so much, Sophie Kinsella, for creating a character that I think I love more than Bridget Jones!
0805062971|4.0|I read Fight Club over the course of several days.  Although it is not very long, it is much denser than most novels out there.  The most enjoyable thing about it is the unique (to me) style of writing.  I suppose it was written as a narrative in the second person (i.e. everybody is referred to as 'you').<BR>Fight Club is very scathingly witty, and contains many gems which you might find yourself quoting after you finish.  Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed the movie more than I did the book, but the book is definately worth your time.
B00000IMCW|5.0|This is a great movie! The gore is plentiful and the music is creepy and very cool. George A. Romero is the best when it comes to zombie movies, and of his trilogy, this is probably the peak. It has a really nice old-fashioned feel to it. It is better than most horror\zombie movies because: the dialogue isn't cheesy or corny, the effects are good, and unlike most of today's over-used slasher-psychopath movies, it has a really good story. If you haven't seen it, rent it, special order it(it is out of print, unfortunately), or wait for the special edition DVD that is supposed to be coming out soon that will include the theatricaly released version, the director's cut, and a disc for bonus features.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was lucky enough to attend the concerts that are included in this cd. I remembered the concerts as being incredible, but always wondered if the years and recreational drug use had colored my memories. This is even better than I remembered.  The sound quality is suprisingly good and the muscular, 70's feel had me head-banging like a teenager all the way home on the freeway. This is Led Zepp at their peak. If you are a Zepp fan, run, do not walk to buy this 3-cd collection. You will fall in love with Zepp all over again.
0425173755|4.0|Review of Murder on the Orient Express<br /> The book has for a protagonist a detective called Hercule Poirot, a famous little Hungarian detective with a funny mustache, who is always complaining about the people. During his stay at the Stambul Hotel he is called to go to London to solve a case. The problem is that when he is inside the train that is going to transport him to his destination, a murder is committed, and he has to solve the mystery before the police arrive to the train that it's stuck in a snowdrift. He is sure that the murder is inside the train, for all the clues that are in the site of the murder. He begins to interview with the passengers and maybe one of them is the real murder. All the passengers give him different opinions about the murder, and their relationship with the Armstrong Family. A lot of mystery and clues would help him to solve this strange murder of a famous gangster (Ratchett) and finally find the culpable. During the whole book the question is who did it? And all the clues are going to show the answer for that question. I liked the book, for all the funny way of Poirot's interviews and how he interacts with the people also I liked how the line owner and the doctor during all the interviews thought that the interview was the murder.

It is time for you to break into the 90's and buy yourself a DVD player.It is your job now,armed with this box set,to untangle and correct the Zepmyth that this band is Heavy Metal. They spawned Metal bands but were not a metal band. Need proof? Use your scene selector function on your new player and track the acoustic numbers.Somewhere along the way,upcoming bands felt the need to play loud and louder,fast and faster but forgot to keep the creativity,sensitivity,and artistry that the Leds possesed. Teach your children well. On to the under 30 crowd.Unplug the X-box and fire up that state of the art home theatre system that maxed out your Visa card,plop down on the couch for a truly mind blowing experience. Remember that these guys were your age when they produced what could be described as The Holy Grail of rock n roll.
B000089RVX|5.0|I usually don,t write reviews for music that I buy,because most of what I buy is the usual (rap,nu-metal,rock type of music),but this music is definately a great mix of dark metal-chamber gothy type of music.Don't try to compare their style with anybody elses,because their style is a blend of different influences playing together.Base it's great sound to itself,and not what you have previously put into a specific style or genre<BR>                 
B00008OWZC|5.0|FINALLY!  The finest live band in rock history is now properly documented.  The thing that made them so great was that they were able to escape the limits of the rock-n-roll medium.  They improvised like a jazz band.  Listen to 10 versions of any song from any tour and you will find that no two were ever the same.  &quot;Tangents within a framework&quot; was how Jimmy Page liked to describe their shows, and how correct he was.  Now that we have the sampler, it's time to open the vaults and document each tour the same way.  1971 has been done (BBC Sessions).  This release covers 1972.  Let's get on with 1973, 1975, 1977, 1979, and 1980.  If I can purchase every show from a Pearl Jam tour (and I love Pearl Jam), I should be able to have at least one representative show from each Led Zeppelin tour.  Get to work, Jimmy!  I'll help if you like!
B00008S2VH|4.0|Hey, all you slicing and dicing Miss Maddy here. I for one am quite impressed, though 4 stars, Die another day, has so got to go, suprised she included it at all. As for the title track, is a bit overdone, but I feel that this is her most personal, and somehow regretful album. A lot of regret towards 'Hollywood' and for myself, I couldn't get out of LA fast enough. But the other tracks, yet not really pop radio friendly, and a glimpse into an older and wiser Madonna. I think 'Love Profusion' and 'Xtatic process' are two of the most beautiful songs in her career to date. It is on replay most of the day, and I think you should all give it another listen... and listen this time. There is much wisdom in those words.
B00008I8IF|4.0|After multiple listens to Rainy Day Music, I am more and more convinced of the strength of this album.  But, likewise, its flaws become just as apparent.  This is not to say they override everything there is great to say about this album, which many of the other reviewers have pointed out.  <br />But the album definitely suffers from the lack of Karen Groteberg in the background.  Tim O'Regan's backups are admirable, but the extra dimension that Karen brought to the group is sorely missing here.  Just think how these songs would sound with her voice layered in - adding brightness to the melancholy and melancholy to the brightness.  She always acted as quite a foil to Louris' voice and Rainy Day Music could do with it!  And don't forget about her piano playing - the piano is pretty sparse here, especially in comparison with eariler albums.<br />Also, no matter how many times I listen to the album, I get the sense that it's too bright for its own good.  While the album is dark in spots (&quot;Tailspin&quot; for one) I can't help but feel the shadows and corners of the disc, of its sound need to be as fleshed out as the bright, sunny sections.  Listening to the album I get the sense that I'm staring at a humongous iceberg whose whole mass floats above the water for all to see, and where's the mystery and challenge in that?  And after all that negativity - I still love it!  Just goes to show what an incredible band is able to do even when they don't get everything right.  But then again, who EVER gets anything right?
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is cool. I like how they have such a variety of different songs and words.(themes) I really like it even though I was kind of late getting it.

B00008OWZC|5.0|I wonder...how old were these guys when they wrote and recorded this material ?  Very young weren't they.  So listen to the music and you will clearly come to the conclusion that nothing today comes close to the level of genius and virtuosity displayed by the guys in Led Zeppelin.  This music is timeless.  It is classical music in the rock and roll genre.  Bands today try to reach their level but don't come even close.  There are some really good bands out there today, but only a few reach legendary status.  This music is art in its purest form.  For those who want to reach the next level, be humbled by these masters.  What I am trying to say is that as young as they were when these recordings were made, these guys were already on a league of their own. <br />In terms of sound quality, and performance wise, these recordings are superb.  So are the image and sound on the DVD set.  My only wish is that the DVD's would have been presented in a widescreen anamorphic format, but that's just me.  Both the CD and DVD issues rock.  I could not recommend them more.  If you don't get this music...

0316548189|3.0|Nelson Mandela's autobiography, &quot;Long Walk To Freedom&quot;, has often been dubbed &quot;Long Crawl to Freedom&quot; by fellow classmates.  Mr. Mandelawas, and is, a strong political figure in South Africa, insturmental is South African leadership. However, any man who can write 625 pages about himself is overdoing it a bit. <br /> The autobiography has a detailed history of the ANC, pre-dating even Nelson Mandela's life. Yet, the novel seems to be Nelson's &quot;name-dropping&quot; biography, constantly describing the famous (and infamous) people he's encountered. Perhaps to a native South African, or a historian, the names could be infomational. For a 16-year old student, the  names simply became confusing and complicated.  We understand Nelson Mandela is a great man, but how much do we really need to know about his life? <br />Perhaps the most disapointing part of the entire novel is the ending. Though Mr. Mandela did aide in somewhat acheiving political equality for all South Africans, he sumarizes his entire 600 page novel in the last 20 pages of the book. It makes you wonder why you read all the details to begin with. The novel was informative, and fairly easy to understand, but the length is a major deturrent in ever reading this novel again.

I couldn't give you any of the lyrics on this most wonderful Radiohead CD.  All I know is that the music that they write and play is masterful.  My daughter introduced me to this CD a couple of years ago, and it remains one of my favorites.  Great stuff....

B00005R87Q|4.0|\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is one of the those movies that you didn't expect to be very good when you went to see it, but ended up loving it in the end. It's a film filled with fast-paced action, romance, and incredible cars.<br />The story revolves around an undercover cop, Brian, who is trying to crack a difficult case in which a group of people hijack trucks on the highway and steal their goods. Instead of doing his job, Brian gets caught up in the lifestyle of street racers and must choose between his job and duty and his friendship and loyalty.<br />I would suggest this film to people who are fans of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as well as people interested in a cool action-packed film that will have you on the edge of you seat and saying, \\"Wow!\\"

B00003CXXS|3.0|I was so excited to see &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; when it was released in the theaters, but I was disappointed in this installment. The first two films had me on the edge of my seat. Granted, this one did too at moments, but I think the whole storyline just turned me off. The fact that a couple hired Sam Neill's character to find their son who had crashed on the now deserted island where the former Jurassic Park existed had me shaking my head in disbelief. I thought more could have been done to develop this storyline, but I think the special effects and the dinosaurs made up for that.<br />This was also the first in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; series that was not directed by Steven Spielberg and it definitely showed. Don't get me wrong, the director of this film did a good job, but that spark that Spielberg brings to his films was missing.<br />&quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; was a pretty good movie and I would suggest it to those who are fans of the series, but at the same time, don't get your hopes up too high because they may (or may not) come crashing down.
B00005JL78|3.0|It was ok worth seeing once however it was just a typical scifi no ground breaking stuff very predicictable. The computer animation was good but most computer animation these days is pretty good.
B00005OM5L|5.0|I have followed Eric Clapton for many years.  This DVD brings it all...great \\"licks\\", vocals and backups.   Eric has truly mastered his art.  If you are not truly a Clapton Fan..you will be after watching and listening to the great one!!!
B000051ZST|1.0|I like \\"Road\\" movies. Thus I was looking forward to watching this movie. What I don't like however, are movies that try to be funny, but fail, miserably, in their objective.<br />What I dislike even more are false claims. This movie, by having the audacity to call itself \\"Road Trip\\", is claiming to be the `Daddy' of all road movies. But, not only doesn't it better the classic road movies, it fails to even equal the most mediocre of road movies.<br />This movie only deserves a review because it stars the legendary Tom Green (star, writer, director of the 5-Star movie \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\"), and because it does have one funny scene it - the \\"Milking The Prostate\\" scene.<br />Get your rubber gloves out.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I had my doubts about this set. The Song Remains The Same from '73 is so crummy that I wondered how good could this one really be? Turns out it is pretty spectacular, the band is on fire. Two things really stand out for me: Jimmy Page was a production innovator / master / perfectionist in the studio and those obsesively perfect renditions of these songs have been burned into our minds by classic rock radio. Turns out he was a passionate / no-net / seat of his pants improviser too and this take no prisoners ethos was equally matched by the rest of the band. Also, this is such a reminder that the blooze-jam approach was the fashion of the day in '72 and in many ways, there is really not that much separating the 1972 Led Zeppelin in their approach from Santana and The Grateful Dead in the same period (listen to Santan'a Lotus live album from '73 or the Dead's Europe '72 to see what I mean) even if the resulting music is miles apart.<br /><br />Incredible!
0425173755|3.0|This book made me guess till the end, and it was almost impossible to guess who was the killer.  This is the only book that I have ever read which is very thrilling, exciting and confusing.  A murder is committed on the small train that is scheduled to go from Istanbul to Paris a couple of decades ago.  A guy named Ratchet is killed and found in his compartment in the morning.  Mr. Poirot, a Belgium detective who was in charge of the inspection, tries to investigate and interview with all passengers, trying to discover decisive clues from the passengers, but the accurate evidence never shows up anywhere and all reasonable possibilities of a murderer are gone.  The murderer gets far away from the solution as time passes.  After all, he found that all of them are related to the specific person.  Who would know that all passengers were murderer and connected with the Armstrong's family whose young kid were kidnapped and killed?  They conspired to kill Ratchet who kidnapped the little young girl.  They take the same train and killed him.  I was surprised to get to know all truth at the end of the book.  I guessed a lot and noted whatever is recognized as important evidence, but never thought like that.  It didn't released me out of wondering until I found the answer.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I have a standard Pioneer DVD player and the movie fails to start upon selecting the widescreen or standard format.  I then tried the DVD on my brand new Apple Powerbook with its DVD player program - it killed the program.  Finally, I tried to play the DVD on my ThinkPad T30 (brand new), and it crashed that player program too.  It kinda makes one wanna say &quot;jeepers creepers!&quot;.  The cover art on the DVD case looks cool.  For those of you who can play it, I'm jealous.

0385504209|1.0|Brown constructs a 3rd rate mystery to carry a boatload of amazingly interesting facts about the early origins of Christianity and the Holy Grail. I wish he would've just written a book on the substance and spared the extremely amateurish and poor writing. I was also irritated to see how much he ripped off \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" by Umberto Eco, which was light years ahead of this extremely disappointing book. If you're a fan of fine writing in mysteries, like Alan Furst, you'll be very disappointed in the Da Vinci Code.
B000059XYM|4.0|Who ever thought of the idea of putting Scary movies into one big funny act! Movies such as Halloween, Scream, Scream 2, I know what you did last summer, Sixth Sense, and Blair Witch Project. This movie had me laughing all night. Although it can get gross in some parts but overall this movie is funny!
B00005JLRT|4.0|Now for the critics out there, if you actually sat down and paid attention to the move or maybe even watched it a few times you would  come to appreciate it. It is a bit of a clich of previous Star Trek moves but that's what brings people back to moves such as this one you can always expect the expected and some times the unexpected if you catch my drift. <BR> The movie was way better than  Star Trek Insurrection but not quite as good as First contact and I am not even going to compare it to captain Kirks generation because you will never have moves as good as them but that's a different topic all together. Now as far as graphics they where by far the best I have seen in a Star Trek movie, the ships the phaser fire and the battle scenes where all flawless. As far as the action there was plenty of it and the fighting scenes that involved Picard and Praetor Shinzon where darn good considering Picard is getting old. I also liked the part where Picard rams the Enterprise into the Schimitar that was a bit unexpected and probably got people sitting on the edge of there seats I know I was. And last but not least the scene where Data blows up the Schimitar and dies was sad but the part that actually brought a tear to my eye was the part after that scene when Counselor Troy hugs Riker and starts crying<BR>Right through to the scene where they are all standing around drinking wine and telling story's about Data.<BR> All in all I thought it was really good how ever I did feel that it was rushed a little bit just falling under 2 hours. But I would most certainly give it 4.5 stars. I honestly don't think it got the credit it deserved and I hope its not the last Star Trek movie to be made.
B000002UA2|5.0|this is simply a classic cd.i often have heard PF fans asking how did u find dark side .... and the wall.no one ever has asked about this album.this is a classy cd on its own,just look at the starting two tracks,its so powerful -it just takes u to a different world.the rest of the tracks are also very good and all the songs have the PF's classy psychedellic touch.this is not only for the PF fans but a must for all the Psychedellic rock lovers.its amazing,but its sad that very few have heard of this.just take my word and buy,i gurantee.
B00005JLTN|4.0|Twice have I seen this movie in the theaters now, and twice I came out feeling fullfilled, as well as full of anticipation for the third installment.<BR>Let's get one thing straight: this movie should not be watched as a sequel to 'the Matrix'...in fact it is primarily a set up for what I would expect to be an explosive finale to an excellent mini series...it builds on concepts set forth in the first movie, expands on them but leaves enough for the viewer to guess about the nature of the Matrix, the future of all the characters and the war itself.<br />The movie starts slow...until the now infamous 'rave scene' (ridiculed and bashed by countless, but considering that the humans are gearing up for a final battle I actually believe that it is a very appropriate scene) it takes a while for the movie to get started. But once you get past that the movie takes off in a fierce rollercoaster ride that will last over an hour...once it gets going the movie is over before you know it, leaving you wanting more.<br />Some scenes are indeed redundant, like the fight between Neo and the Oracle's bodyguard. That fight, though a delight in choreography, felt a little out of place in the grand scheme of the entire movie.<br />Overall it's very enjoyable, thrilling, and I would recommend it to anyone who asks.

Well this is on my top ten best movie list (I don't know where, it's not in order) This movie is a great movie that has message. And an inspiring movie ...I have no problem with the movie, only some people. It is a tincy tiny bit overrated, because everyone think this is THE BEST when there are also other great movies(Schindler's List, Deer HUnter, Apocalypse NOW) out there. But it is as good as everyone(well almost everyone) says it is
0316548189|5.0|LONG WALK TO FREEDOM by Nelson Mandela is a inspiring, touching book that spans the lifetime of one of the world's living legends. It transforms Nelson from a larger than life revolutionary, or a poster-boy of the antiapartheid movement, into a man with real emotions and longings. <br />The book opens with Nelson's childhood, explaining the gradual process in which he discovered the oppression of his people by the ruling whites. He realized the state's favor of the tribal system (in which Africans are broken into groups, or tribes, and are not permitted to be with a member of another.) This ensured the separation of African tribes, for if they were to group together sooner, they could have slowed apartheid based solely on their much higher population.  Nelson himself rejected this notion every time it was mentioned his tribal upbringing forced him to look up to the civilized whites. It was not until years later that Nelson learned his true calling. <br />He was sentenced to life in prison for a charge of treason in 1964, a charge he could not deny due to his organization's involvement with sabotage. As well his illegal trip out of the country in which he was a fugitive from the South African police. Even in prison he served as a revolutionary, fighting for better treatment of the prisoners. He accomplished so much that the state would simply impose a new, harsher warden when Nelson had molded the previous one into his will. The South African government saw him as a leader of the revolutionary movement, and made clever attempts on his life (once, attempting to fool him into an escape, so he could be killed in a gun fight at the airplane that was to take him to safety.)<br />His release from prison was one of the major news events of the year. The very fact that he survived prison intact provided a much-needed jump to the revolutionary movement. Serious negotiations began (they had started prior to his release as well, but with no advancement) Long walk to freedom comes to a close with a multiracial election, the greatest achievement by the revolutionary movement.<br />Nelson struggled with his position as a leader, he found himself wishing someone else could have taken his place, and he could have lived his life as a normal family man. His visits with his wife were rare, but cherished throughout his prison sentence. He recalled them to brighten his mood, repeating every word spoken by the two in his head. <br /> In addition, LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is a testament of South Africa's darkest years; it describes a time of desperation for blacks, and leisure for whites. Nelson catches himself deeply disturbed by the sight of a white beggar, poverty was normal for blacks, it was a tragedy for whites.
B00000K19E|5.0|\\"You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.\\"  These revealing words spoken by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) touch just the very tip of the enormous iceberg that is \\"The Matrix\\".  Released in early 1999 without much fanfare, but with surprisingly high number of positive critical reviews, \\"The Matrix\\" became a science fiction and cinematic juggernaut not seen since the days of the original \\"Star Wars\\".  It produced a mind-bending story dealing with a fascinating take on reality.  It also revolutionized the movie industry through its use of mind-numbing, computer-generated, special effects including the now-famous stop-motion technique known as 'bullet time'.  In the same manner by which George Lucas redefined the special effects industry with \\"Star Wars\\" in 1977, which created an influence which has been seen in countless movies in the quarter-century since, the Wachowski brothers did the same following \\"The Matrix\\".  The 'bullet time' technique has been borrowed, ripped-off, and parodied in so many forms in the past four years, one forgets that it was only four years ago that this was introduced to the masses.  <BR><BR>The premise of \\"The Matrix\\", for anyone who has been living under a rock since 1999, can be derived from the very quote at beginning of this review.  It posits the notion that the world we see and live in is not the true reality.  Instead, it is a computer-generated 'virtual reality' designed to make the human mind believe it is living a normal life when, in truth, they are simply crops to be harvested for energy by a vicious race of machines who took control of Earth some 200 years earlier.  The very method by which the machines keep humans in bondage is also the means by which many of the humans strike back to reclaim humanity's domain over the world.  It is called The Matrix.  A cranial connection into this elaborate computersystem is what enables the machines to control the human mind.  It is also how the few bands of rogue humans who have managed to escape the system will free other humans and seek to bring about the machines' destruction.  Operating on the theory of 'nature always finds a way', a few anomalies among humans realized that the Matrix wasn't real, broke free, and began the struggle to free all humans connected to the system.  The leader of one of these rogue groups, Morpheus, believes he is destined to find 'The One', the individual who will be able fight the machines and defeat them.  He believes this 'One' is Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), better known as Neo.  He believes that Neo will be the one who can defeat the machines and their 'Agent' programs in the Matrix where so many before him failed. <BR><BR>There is a definite mentor-student relationship that takes place between Morpheus and Neo, as well as all the obligatory training and education scenes as Neo comes to understand what reality is.  Where this might seem perfunctory in other movies, in \\"The Matrix\\" it is amazing as each new path inspires a sense of awe in the viewer.  Some believe this movie has no plot or a convoluted one.  In truth, it is a plot with such depth that this movie has developed an almost religious following among its fans and in-depth analysis among academics and philosophers.  There is not one frame of wasted film throughout the entire movie.  Each character has a defined purpose and each one fits perfectly into the overall story arc.  In addition to Morpheus and Neo, there is the tough, yet vulnerable Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and the Judas-like Cypher (a slimy Joe Pantoliano).  \\"The Matrix\\" also introduces the audience to one of the best cinematic villains to come along since Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator and \\"Star Wars\\" Darth Vader.  It is one of the 'Agent' programs designed to eliminate the threat posed by these humans.  He is called Agent Smith and he is played with such frightening menace by actor Hugo Weaving.  Seemingly indestructable and definitely unpredictable, Agent Smith provokes the greatest fear among the brave band who do battle inside the Matrix.  <BR><BR>The beauty of \\"The Matrix\\" is that it is still as strong four years later as it was when it was first released.  The phenomenal success of this film led the Wachowskis to create trilogy out of this story.  It has the power and potential to be as strong a remembered as fondly as the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy.  To be able to be there at the beginning of such an amazing story now lets me understand how audiences felt in 1977 when they saw \\"Star Wars\\" for the first time.
B00005JKZV|1.0|The DVD release of \\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" was met with a lot of excitement to fans of Tolkien's who enjoyed the movie. There was the movie (!!!) plus all those cool little featurettes that you could only previously see on the web, plus a little this, a little that... <br />Hidden away within the folds of this release, there was also \\"a look at the special edition\\" that would follow a few months later. A great many people jumped and bought this first release not realising that the Special Edition would have all that and so much more. I fell for the gimmick once, but won't do it a second time. <br />If the Special Edition will be anything like TFTR's, we can expect a much better movie which will have all those extra scenes woven into the tale rather than set aside and disconnected. It is a fact that these movies have been pretty long in their theatrical release, almost too long for Hollywood. Who would then want to buy the special (and uncut) release? The answer is the Tolkien purists who can appreciate a well-told tale that doesn't sacrifice part of the narrative to please market constraints.
0451169514|4.0|IT, by Stephen King, is a very excellent book...for the most part.  He almost effortlessly jumps back and forth between 1958 and 1985, tying the two disparate time periods together.  He weaves an excellent tale of seven friends banding together to fight a shape-changing monster from beyond space...<br />...for the most part.<br />So why ISN'T it excellent?<br />1) The two characters that seem to get the most 'page-time,' Bill and Beverly, are very irritating.  Hardly a chapter goes by without us hearing what a great leader Bill is (though we hardly ever see proof of it) or how wonderfully beautiful Beverly is.  After a while, it gets annoying, and you wish IT would just go ahead and eat them.<br />2) At one part near the end of the book, there is 'a certain scene.'  I don't want to mention it specifically, but you'll know it when you come to it.  It is pretty much utterly pointless.<br />3) Also at the end, it is revealed that our heroes must do something else aside from destroy IT.  This new plot thread was practically brought up out of nowhere and then discarded soon after, meriting only a brief reference.  It's as if Mr. King suddenly decided to add a reason to make their actions all the more necessary.<br />4) Right at the end (notice where most of the problems crop up?), he uses my all-time least favorite literary device.  Again, you'll know it when you read it.<br />But don't let this stop you.  Buy this book, read it, and enjoy it.  Just be prepared for a disappointment in the last hundred pages or so.
B0000931QR|5.0|This album is very suprising, when i saw the news of a new album on their website i was very excited and downloaded the first track of the album from their website. <BR>This was great marketing as having that one song, which was mp3 format, burned to cd i could play it continuously, a constant reminder to buy the album! However, an amazon pre-order is just as easy. <br />I have to say that although i have played that one track almost non stop in the car i am still happy to listen to it when the full album goes round again and again in the car. You can not get bored of this music.<br />This album is a breath of fresh air and almost every track has a different style, however it still keeps the recognisable LODVG sound that we all love.<BR>Yes yes, needless to say that she is a stunning girl, with a smashing voice, but the whole band seem to have inputted all of their backgrounds and tastes in to this marvellous effort.<BR> <BR>I can not recommend this enough, i still love the first two albums, and out of my many cd's, LODVG are always off the shelf and in the CD player. <BR>I just really hope they dont keep us waiting for another album as long as they did with this one. <BR>It was definately worth the wait though.<BR>To all those native spanish readers, this is waaay too muchos para mi a escribir en espanol, pero debo decirle, esto es el escuchar maravilloso y muy diferente que los primeros dos álbumes. Recomiende altamente
B000003TBP|5.0|Though this cd was released in 1996, if I'm not mistaken, it reminded me so much of 1986.  I have no idea why, maybe it was the rapping, maybe it was the donkey!  Anyway, this is Beck's most accessible CD.  It is great and a wonderful experience.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This disc became better and better with each song. From the first concert on disc one you can see the progression of the band. By the time you pop in the second disc (after watching the first a few times) the experiance becomes an event. <BR>This is a must have disc for any fan and the price is far less than the enjoyment you get from the band
B000002505|5.0|The shadow of John Coltrane looms larger over this album than Miles', as it opens with 'Love Supreme' and follows with 'Naima'. <BR>But the two guitarists - ably supported by among others Billy Cobham (drums) and Larry Young (organ) - find their own voices really fast. A great album, full of power and touching beauty, sometimes breathless and sometimes gentle, and just as satisfying in its way as the recordings of the first Mahavishnu orchestra. John McLaughlin took the spirit of the greats that had gone before him and carried it forward. Later, on the Electric Guitarist album, he asked 'Do you hear the voices you left behind?', but it was surely here he really sang for Coltrane.
B00005RFVL|1.0|What an insult to legendary artists this record is. This immature, karakoe, clown absolutely ruins every tune on this record. Who the hell does he think he is? Not only is his arrogance simply foul, but the disrespectful nature he performs this 'karaoke' to the artisits on this album is disgraceful. This whole CD is just one long sickening circus - anyone who gives it a good rating should probably be in bed by now; this album is for kids, and ones who can't hear at that.
B000084T18|1.0|What in the name of heck has happened to the music and its industry these days? I mean, as soon as rap came right through the door, I was horrified. Besides, all rap is is really fast-talking. I don't think it should even be considered music either. First Eminem, then Nelly, and now 50 Cent? I think music history has gone way down-the-mountain these days, but I think it's mostly 50 Cents' fault. <br />Why do you think I really dislike him and his CD? 1) I don't like the fact that his album is called \\"Get Rich\\" because it sounds like he's-you know-Nelly. I don't like it when rappers talk about money because it seems like they only care about getting rich (i.e.\\"Air Force One\\"). 2) I don't like his lack of clothing, I know, it has nothing to do with the CD.  Today in this music world it seems like they're only receiving money for their bodies, when all they need to get onstage is raw talent. When you step on the stage to sing, they want you to sing not see how fast you can talk including words you made up that can't be found in the English Dictionary. If you don't buy this CD, they won't make money, and they can't show themselves off. 3) When I hear him on his CD, he's often mumbling, or sounds more like he's half asleep, or like he's too afraid to step up to the microphone or something. 4) His songs all sound the same, many of them referring to guns (I wish I could shoot 50 Cent) and sometimes maybe violence. If you're going to make a CD, don't talk about cars and money and getting rich in every song. I'm kind of surprised his \\"In Da Club\\" was #1 on the top 40 one week. 5) I don't like his language. \\"Wangsta,\\" is a word that's very strange and if you were to translate that to a genius that speaks Chinese, he wouldn't understand a word you're saying.<br />As a result, poor lyrics and misunderstood language, lack of clothing, lack of talent, and overplaying on the radio (which I'm amazed by) I'm giving him a 1/5. I kind of wish I could give him a 0. In order to save yourself from this CD, do yourself a favor, turn off the radio, and buy something else new like Evanescence or Lillix, as they have exciting songs and they aren't boring or aren't loud enough, or talk about guns all the time. You'll be glad you did. And I hope someday that the music could be back the way it used to be-with people whom can actually sing and who have talent. Thank you very much for reading my opinion.
0425173755|4.0|I had a really fascinating traveling experience by reading this Agatta Christie's novel.  She just converts the reading process into a thinking one by using a singular mixing of characters from different countries and social status; a Russian Princes, an American young man which works as a secretary, a French count, a British valet, etc.  A murder was committed at the Calacia car of the Orient Express during its travel from Istanbul through Paris.  All the 13 passengers have alibis.  Only a pipe cleaner, a scarlet kimono, a monogrammed handkerchief and a watch pointing to 1:15 a.m. are the physical evidences.  You will be able to follow step by step the inquiries of the famous detective Poirot, who by interviewing all the passengers discovers a strange relation between the victim, the Armstrongs which are a wealthy American family, and the murderer.  By the end of the novel, you'll discover that all your assumptions were far away from the most unexpected answer.

B00008OWZC|5.0|The Who had LIVE AT LEEDS and The Stones had GET YER YA YA'S OUT.  LED ZEPPELIN has released the ultimate live recording, HOW THE WEST WAS WON.  The three disc set starts with LA DRONE and 14 seconds later IMMIGRANT SONG blasts from the speakers followed immediately by HEARTBREAKER and BLACK DOG.  ROBERT PLANT introduces OVER THE HILL AND FAR AWAY and PAGE begins to play the delicate beginnings of the song.  JOHN BONHAM'S drums have never sounded more powerful and lift each song to another level.  SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING sounds strong but the real highlights on disc one(in my opinion)are STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN and GOING TO CALIFORNIA.  Disc one closes with THAT'S THE WAY and BROY-YR-AUR STOMP.  Disc two starts with A 25 minute version of DAZED AND CONFUSED and then into excellent versions of WHAT IS AND WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE and DANCING DAYS.  Disc 2 closes with a 19 minute version of MOBY DICK with JOHN BONHAM in top form.  JOHN BONHAM'S drum sound like thunder throughout the three disc set. Disc 3 begins with WHOLE LOTTA LOVE and then into ROCK AND ROLL and THE OCEAM.  BRING IT ON HOME closes disc 3.  The music sounds great, the musicianship is top notch with PLANT and PAGE in great form.  JOHN PAUL JONES is an excellent musician as well and adds mandolin, keyboards and bass to the mix.  I heard JIMMY PAGE live in 1977 with LED ZEPPELIN and again in 1986 with THE FIRM.  Hearing his guitar on the three disc set brought back memories of those concerts I saw in Oklahoma City.  My only complaint is the packaging.  There is no booklet and no photos, just a brief statement from JIMMY PAGE about HOW THE WEST WAS WON.  I highly recommend this<BR>three CD set.  I will be purchasing the DVD in the very near future.
B000002R48|3.0|This is a very good Cd but if we compare this one with the nexts DT albums could be the worst one, maybe is just that in my opinion James has give to the band on each song more than<BR>C. Dominici gave in the entire disc. But any way was a good start.
B000002AGN|5.0|When I heard that Sony remastered this CD, I immediately grabbed myself a copy. Dave Brubeck's &quot;Time Out&quot; isn't just a great album; it also gives me fond childhood memories from when I first listened to this recording as a toddler.  At the risk of recycling a cliche, it's one of those vital albums that transcends musical boundaries, and it's accessible to the masses while also remaining cutting edge.  Producer Teo Macero, who is also responsible for some of Miles Davis' most essential recordings, brings out the very best in each of the players on this record. In my opinion, the very heart of this 1959 release is the exceptional &quot;Take Five.&quot;  The dynamic interaction between Brubeck's piano and Paul Desmond's expressive saxophone makes this one of the most unforgettable and powerful pieces of jazz ever played on a vinyl record.  Other album cuts like &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; and &quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk&quot; are timeless pieces that are so effortlessly graceful they seem to walk on water.  Along with Miles' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and Coltrane's &quot;A Love Supreme,&quot; Brubeck's &quot;Time Out&quot; is one of THE essential jazz recordings to own.  It's a 100% risk-free purchase; even more so with the newly repackaged and remastered edition.  But don't just take my word for it.  &quot;Time Out&quot; is an experience that has to be heard to be believed.
0553812173|4.0|What you have to remember with &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; is that it is part of a series that interlinks and forms a intriguing and rivetting tapestry. I will admit that it is not as good as the rest in the series that I have read, but it is still a great read and what flaws it may possess can be forgiven for introducing you to the others.<br />&quot;Gardens&quot; is one of those books with which you lose time, turning page after page without noticing until you see that an hour has passed by.<br />I found Gardens of the Moon well paced and leaving enough mystery to keep you in anticipation of what's to follow.<br />The characters are a refreshing change from the traditional &quot;pure young hero&quot; type as each possess flaws and behave as real people would. Erikson is also unafraid of challenging the old invicible hero theme, which (admittedly) is more apparent in the next book [decidedly so], the characters are as mortal as anyone else and their mortality gives them a greater sense of reality.<br />A great read which introduces you to even greater books in the series.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Tremendous release from perhaps rock's greatest live band. For a band who built its reputation largely on their live performances there has been very little live material commercially available except for the 1973 Madison Square Garden concert on The Song Remains The Same soundtrack which Zeppelin themselves described as only an average concert. This DVD makes up for that and more. All songs are presented uncut with superb sound and picture quality. Disc One starts with a fully restored 1 hour and 40 minute concert from The Royal Albert Hall in 1970. The picture quality is excellent and the 5.1 sound mix superb. Disc One also includes a 30 minute mini-concert in front of a Danish TV audience along with some other television appearances from 1969. Disc 2 starts off with a restored performance of Immigrant Song followed with 4 tracks from the Song Remains the Same Concert (full, uncut versions of Black Dog and Since I've Been Loving You, along with the previously unseen Misty Mountain Hop and The Ocean). As the picture fades on the 1973 Madison Square Garden Concert it immediately fades into the 1975 Earl's Court Concert. Here Zeppelin shows why they were leagues ahead of their 1970's contemporaries like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath with a stunning acoustic set in which they perform Going to California, That's The Way, and Bron Yr Aur Stomp. They then follow with blistering full band electric versions of In My Time of Dying, Trampled Underfoot, and Stairway To Heaven. The scene then shifts to 1979 and Knebworth where Zeppelin turns in superb performances of Rock and Roll, Nobody's Fault But Mine, Sick Again, Achilles Last Stand, In The Evening, Kashmir, and Whole Lotta Love. All in all the two DVD's included with this set include approximately 3 1/2 hours of live concert material along with about 90 minutes of extras of which approximately 55 minutes are additional live performance material. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to see rock music being performedat its best.
B00005O5JV|5.0|Fun movie.  Highly recommended.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B0000508U6|5.0|Wow, what a break through.  Finally we see a very talent bunch create a real and vividly raw cd.  I would highly recommend this one to everyone....
B00004STJD|5.0|This movie is sooooooooooooooooo funny! I was falling of the couch when I watched it.<BR>You should be able to understand French, the original language. It is absolutly Hilarious!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I thought this was a good beginning to the Potter series.  Here you are introduced to Harry and his life and how he ended up in magic school.  It not a movie for younger kids but for older kids it's entertaining and fun.
B00008K7AM|1.0|A movie called &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; doesn't even show the hot high school cheerleader (Rachel McAdams), but a goofy-looking man who switches bodies with her. Insanely disappointing! Rob Schneider plays that silly woman with a man's body on the outside. This movie was ugly. I was apalled with how many urinal jokes there were and how Taquito wore those small clothes. Dreadlock boy should've banged his head with the drumsticks. Oh yeah, that little brother was the unfunniest thing that I've seen in a long time. &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; had more laughs. This movie is unapproved by me.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a laugh out loud movie for the whole family.
6302787300|5.0|Ridley Scott's &quot;1492: Conquest of the Paradise&quot; is a rip-roaring adventure movie, surprisingly faithful to the history, filled with virtuoso settings, and a perfect cast.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|i have listend to godsmack since they first came out and i own all of their cds i just want to say 'faceless' in my opinion is the best so far i mean the guys rock no matter what and i just wanted to say that. so if your wondering what i think i say this is 1 of the greatest cds i have ever heard so buy it and if you dont have the rest of godsmacks cds then buy them to ok rock on
B000022TSH|5.0|I saw Chinatown a few times and never quite got what happened. Then a family member began attending a university in LA, and I visited the area in depth for the first time. I finally understood one of the basic plot lines about water acquisition, and I also began to understand the relationship betwen the Los Angles Basin and the San Fernando Valley. A native or resident of the area can appreciate this film even more. Some kind of geographic and historical background is probably essential to truly begin understanding it. The plot itself is already complex and demanding enough.<br />I rate this film among my top 30 favorite films, including it together with its sequel The Two Jakes as one unit.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is the \\"based on fact\\" story of a Scotsman who rallied some of the clans to fight a brutal english King.  The film captured the politics of the times.  The battle scenes are awesome.  The manner in which Wallace was betrayed and killed is based on fact, and the film does capture some of the brutality on his death.  The sad fact is that this kind of brutality existed then.  Many of the famous \\"victors\\" treated their enemies the same way.  Alexander the Great was known to slaughter and torture.  In our present day we have Sadam Hussien and his sons.<br />When I first saw this movie I wasn't aware that it was based on the real life of a scottish patriot named william wallace. I saw it with friends and all my friends laughed when I speculated that it had the feel of real history. One of my degrees is history, but this was in almost medieval times, not my emphasis. Ticked that my friends laughed I researched and discovered the truth. I was correct. Even the part about what drove Wallace (the murder of his wife) to be a fanatical leader is based in fact.<br />Somehow knowing that this movie was based on fact stirs the blood even more. Why? Because if it was fiction, ones reaction to events is very different.
0790742780|3.0|Falling Down is a movie about the average Joe's frustrations with a sick world.  The performances by Douglas and Duvall are both outstanding.  The big problem that I had with this movie was that it seemed that the director was trying too hard to prove his point.  Here's two examples to show what I mean.  First, Douglas' encounter at the fast-food restaurant is a bit overblown.  I admit that it is frustrating to miss breakfast by only a few minutes at one of these restaurants, but is it really that big of a deal?  It almost seems that the director had to justify Douglas drawing his automatic by having the employees act like complete jerks.  Even then, one must realize that the employees are under stress just like Douglas is and can hardly be blamed for getting angry when a customer disagrees with a blanket policy set by the company's corporate headquarters that they cannot change.  The second example involves Duvall's encounter with his captain.  The captain says something to the effect of, &quot;I know it's your last day, and just so you know, I never liked you.&quot;  My initial reaction was that Duvall is surrounded by the same sick world as Douglas, but would a real boss, no matter how cruel, really say that?  Once again, the director is simply trying to prove his point by stretching the limits of our reality.  Falling Down leaves us with a feeling that we live in an absolutely detestable world.  Maybe sometimes we can agree with this statement; however, I think that the director failed to realize that the world really isn't as bad as he portrays it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Jimmy Page has produced another masterpiece...this is an amazing package with remarkably good picture and sound. Choose your own favorite segments, but the 1969 Danish TV segment is extraordinary, with a bunch of youngsters sitting cross-legged, several feet away from the band as they launch into a blistering set from the first album, including &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. The violin bow makes an appearance, and the song clocks in at a sleek 8 minutes. Little did that young audience know! The other set I love is the acoustic material from Earl's Court.....mesmerizing! <BR>This band did it all like no other, and here's a chance to enjoy...over and over.
B000002AD0|3.0|This is a 95% instrumental recording which is about 90 minutes long.<br />The Sound is great and so is the booklet, written by Greg Rollie, which describes the concert and the sound/structure of the songs.<br />However, the recording is basically an endless jam showing off Carlos Santana's guitar playing.<br />The keyboards of Greg Rollie and percussionists are given solo space in most of the song,s but guitarist Neal Schon also could have been given a a number of solos, but as far as I listened to, was given little if any.<br />An album I would recommend for lovers of Santana's guitar playing.<br />For those who love Santana the band, I would have to question the purchase of this recording.
B00005JLK1|3.0|Ok, so this isn't really that scary, and admittedly it is highly derivative, but having said this I still find that this movie is good fun.  As others have commented, this movie has a memorable opening and the tempo of the movie thereafter is maintained.  Unlike some movies that die half way or drag on at the end, the plot here moves along nicely, with the supernatural encounters coming in at regular intervals as the truth about the ship and her passengers is gradually revealed.  The ghost ship in the movie brings back memories of the overlook hotel from \\"the shining\\", and supernatural forces of both good and evil are present.  The acting is more than respectable, and above average for a movie without household name actors in it.  Special effects are well placed, and overall you get the feeling that you have got what you paid for after seeing this film.
006017322X|5.0|To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee was intriguing to my soul.  I have never felt such great leaps of passion towards a book.  In this Novel I found myself almost crying, surprised, laughing and in complete awe at the end.  At first, I picked this book thinking it was just another boring English novel, I was mistaken.  Harper Lee has proven to America and the world that great litature exists.  It taught me many lessons about life such as the horrors of discrimination and standing up for what's right.  Harper Lee writes through a 6-year-old girl and in first person.  The action behind scout's tale is her father's determination as a lawyer and a liberal to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl, although he did not do it.  The books' setting is in a realistic racist and segregated town in Alabama in the 1930's.  The author does a wonderful job making each character distinct and different.  This book brings to surface the idea of how unfair and cruel society can be and how racism can affect so many lives, in ways we cannot imagine.  The reader gets to see how the family grows both together and apart and also how it copes with its day-to-day lives.  The Novel deals with such issues as racism, neighborhood togetherness and the bonds that either grow or are lost between parents and children.  I am proud to say that this is my favorite book.  This novel is a must for all growing children.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I'm an old Fleetwood Mac fan, through all their incarnations. I still have albums from before they started playing with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. This cd is ok, I love anything Lindsey does. However, not being a Stevie Nicks fan, and really missing Chris McVie, I was definitely disappointed.  Too much Nicks!!

B00008PX8P|5.0|I just got the DVD set today. I first saw a link about this DVD set about a week ago and listened and watched some samples from it online.  Having seen the band at a &quot;Day on the Green&quot; in Oakland, CA back in the day, and going to the Benefit Premiere opening of the Song Remains the Same in San Francisco, CA I was hoping that this collection of live concert footage would reconcile what I saw of Led Zeppelin live and what I saw in The Song Remains the Same. I'm very pleased to say it has and then some. Those out there worried about the MSG footage...no need to worry! The sites and sounds bring me back to the days of massive stadium concerts and crankin' the volume up on my stereo until the vinyl LP spin'in on the turntable would start complaining it needed better acoustic isolation (no slab of granite just put the turntable on a heavier piece of furniture.)  I heartily recommend this to new and old Zep' fans!
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust In Peace is Megadeth's best album. This was the best lineup of Megadeth as they sound reborn here after the uneven So Far, So Good, So What. \\"Holy Wars\\", \\"Hangar 18\\", and \\"Lucretia\\" are among the best tracks they've ever done. \\"Hangar 18\\" indeed may be one of the most powerful tracks in metal, particularly the outro when Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman trade wicked lightning fast solos during the closing jackhammer riff. The rhythm section of David Ellefson and Nick Menza are fantastic here, particularly on tracks such as \\"Five Magics\\" and \\"Poison Was The Cure.\\" They would breakthrough to the masses on Countdown to Extinction, but that album isn't as consistent or heavy as this one. A thrash metal classic. This and the Peace Sells album are definitely their best.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Linkin Parks' material doesn't stray too far from their earlier releases. Except this time it's in a much shorter package, udner 40 minutes.<br />On top of that, about half of the songs are fast forward material. These tracks are the typical repetitive stream of unimaginative lyrics and beats.<br />When this CD is at it's best though, it rocks. Tracks like 'Hit the Floor' gives this CD hard edge that keeps this album just above water. It is also a big plus that they keep their lyrics completely clean.<br />I give this album 3 stars for a good effort.
B00006879E|5.0|I discovered Maroon 5 on tour with matchbox twenty, and decided to plunk down fifteen bucks on \\"Songs About Jane\\" at the show, after being impressed with what I heard on stage. After seeing them live for a second time, I'm completely hooked. Adam Levine's voice is like a blend of the oft-underrated Pat Monahan (Train) and Jay Kay (of Jamiroqui) that yielded beautiful results. Every song has its own life and personality. Add to that their incredible live show (Levine's vocals are so strong it's shocking), and you've got a band with truly great things ahead of them.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Just when you thought there was no better way to listen or see Led Zeppelin, along comes this DVD (and the companion CD) to give Zeppelin fans a whole new reason to live. Strip out all the cheesy fantasy footage from \\"Song Remains the Same\\", go back to some ealier, better, less burned out Zeppelin and add great production values, and you have the new DVD.<br />One quibble: The first cut on disc 2, \\"Immigrant Song\\" is clearly the audio, but not the matching video. In other words, they used some digital effects to obscure the visual performance on screen to make us think we are seeing and hearing a live performance of \\"Immigrant Song\\". I can't undertand why they would include such a low-rent trick on an otherwise remarkable DVD, but nothing is perfect. This DVD comes awful close, though.
B00008972S|5.0|This film is no doubt, one of the greatest pieces of cinematic work that has ever existed.  Its stunning visual beauty, heartwrenching story, and deep-rooted emotions that run through all come together to create an absolute marvelous film.  To call it a modern version of Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is not giving this film its due credit; it's far more than that.  With the classic forbidden love tale, it also channels the emotions of childhood friendship, gang hatred, racism, and loyalty.  <br />Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer give the performances of a lifetime as the two lovers, Maria and Tony.  They are so perfectly matched and convincing that I almost forgot they were only actors.  The way they look at each other is timeless, even though in real life it's been reported that they didn't really get along that well at all.  The colorful supporting cast carry on fame of their own, and deservably so.  The hatred that brews between gang leaders Bernardo (George Chakiris) and Riff (Russ Tamblyn) is so deep and menacing it's frightening at times, and Anita's (Rita Moreno) display of fun agitation and odious dismay is astonishing.  All of these actors are top-notch; they reportedly are all extremely close, yet the hatred they are required to display towards each other in their performances is brilliant.  <br />And then, of course, there is the directon and the story.  The choreography in this film is simply breahtaking.  The dancers perform stunts and moves that one wouldn't think were possible (and there's interesting tidbits about this on the extras).  The film is also cinematically and visually stunning, from the opening park scene to the alleys and the rooftops.  The direction is also fantastic and cleverly planned; there is pratically no dialogue until a good 20 minutes into the film, yet you can still sense hatred through their eyes and their opening choreography.  <br />This DVD would be a fanstastic addition to any collection.  Though I expected more from the extras, I definitely don't regret buying it, because watching the film in DVD format is great in itself.  This is my favorite musical of all time, and I've seen lots of them.  No other musical has come close to this one, and many recent ones have adapted the similar tragic love story (Moulin Rouge) that was done in West Side Story.  So be sure to pick this one up soon -- you won't regret it.
B000066NW0|5.0|A great album, one of the best i've heard for ages. My favourite tracks are Unwanted, Losing Grip,Mobile and Naked. All the other tracks are very good too. One of the best points about this album is the music is actually performed AND WRITTEN by Avril herself. Rock on girl!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Wow, what an album. Being only 18, I've always loved Zeppelin, but never really got a chance to taste them live.  I assume this album is as close as I'm going to come, and the more I listen to it, the more I wish I would have been alive in the 70's. The opener of disc 1 is Immigrant Song, and its pretty much a kick in the balls that will drop your jaw if you've got the right soundsystem.  The highlights are definitley the 23 minute version of Dazed and Confused, and the crazy 19 minute drum solo known as Moby Dick.  Buy this album, now.
B00005JLWN|1.0|Honestly, I don't have much to say, except for that was the biggest waste of my time ever!  Such a knock-off movie!  Remind you of The Matrix at all?  Un-humanly people (i.e. agents), underworlds (i.e. Zion), and a hero who can handle them all (i.e. Neo)... Yeah, Christian Bale should never attempt an action figure/hero role again!  Biggest piece of crap ever made!
0743244249|5.0|The 'plot' is a limo ride through a major city. But it's a one-day excursion as much as is Joyce's 'Ulysses.' That one day may just as well be a year, a lifetime or an era. Time is distorted; events are surreal; what seems coincidental, isn't. Don't expect everything to make sense in a rational, cognitive way.<br />A man begins his day with everything, and ends it with nothing. His ideas, beliefs and body slowly lose their integrity. The story is not a puzzle with clearly edged chunks of interlocking pieces, but a constantly spinning web whose strands are spun by employees, lovers, a wife and a barber. As the story evolves, the man devolves. There's dry wit and Monty Pythonesque lunacy. There's the microcosm reflected in the macrocosm and vice versa. Even when inane, the ideas expressed are fascinating.<br />COSMOPOLIS sometimes enlightened me, and other times confused me. After my mind digests it a bit, I'll read it again.
0316548189|3.0|I felt that this book, the autobiography of Nelson Mandela, was very well written. It went into wonderful detail and made you picture the rallies and towns that he went to and visited, it made you feel as though you were there beside him throughout the entire book . . .if you lasted that long. I thought as though the book seemed to drag on, not even the detail could save this book. At times, it just made you want to shut the book and think to yourself &quot;Why am I reading this again?&quot; or &quot;When is this going to end? Where's the next chapter?&quot; which I found me asking myself quite a few times, but I continued on the journey. The book had great use of literary devices mind you and the chapters are short, some only 1.5 pages long others possibly 10 pages and pictures were included so you got more of a feel for the book and time period to help you understand. The use of all the African words and names everywhere was also a bit tiring, I, myself, don't speak African, but I found it interesting to learn some new words, but not on every page. All in all, it was a nicely written and put together book, I just found it a total snooze and now I would like to go to sleep.
0375422307|5.0|Being an American woman roughly Marjane's age, I grew up knowing nearly nothing of the conflict in the Middle East, certainly not understanding it.  This work fantastically illustrates all that happened in Iran (a lot!) in the late twentieth century, and how a teenage girl came to understand it and form her own opinions.  It is extremely well-told and illustrated.  I read the book in one setting and anxiously await the next two volumes to be translated into English.  For any fan of graphic novels, I highly recommend this one.
0440236304|4.0|Excellent read, however those not versed in the WWII military venacular (e.g. B.A.R., D.Z., O.P., etc.) may have problems following some aspects of the book.  Those who have read other accounts of the Normandy campaign (or other millitary history of the european theater) will tear through this easy and enjoyable read.  Burgett was a very hard man, who killed 27 germans in one fire fight, and scores of others during the war.  He proclaims to not understand the need for his colleages to mourn the loss of a buddy when there were still more nazis to kill!  This book is a perfect compliment to Band of Brothers, it details the same training and battles of the same regiment only A company instead of E company.
0553381350|4.0|&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; by Thomas Wolfe details the manned space race between Russia and the United States. It focuses on the United States' effort to put a man into space. The story of the first seven American astronauts is told, along with a description of test pilots, scientists, and others involved with spaceflight during this time.<br />It is an excellent read, with just the right amount of storytelling, personalization, and technical details. The people are exposed as real people, not put on a pedestal, the way many books tend to treat historic figures. The movie version is good, the book is even better. Read this book whether you're a techie or just interested in this stage of American history.
B000002UAU|5.0|This in the greatest musical masterpiece of all 20th century music, regardless of category.  The only other competition comes from the Beatles themselves, as Abbey Road, Revolver, and Rubber Soul are also phenomenal in their brilliance.
0719062683|5.0|Literary theory tends to have a strange effect on writers. Look at the the title of this book:<br />\\"Beginning Theory\\"<br />Notice that it isn't \\"Beginning Literary Theory\\" or \\"Beginning Cultural Theory\\".<br />Can you imagine a subject where the academics involved are so conceited that they believe that their theory is so self-evidently more valuable than any other, that henceforth it 'need not speak its name' and is to be known as 'theory'.<br />This odd effect also licenses the writers of 'theory' to write in a manner which erects formidable defences against any reader who is unprepared to surrender gracefully in the face of overwhelming unintelligibility.<br />This book simply fails to deliver on the unintelligibility front, its simple helpful style leading the reader to the unmistakeable conclusion that the rest of the books on this subject are written equally accessibly.<br />They are not.<br />If this book were written by a true literary theory devotee, it would have been shortened further still, to \\"Beginning\\".<br />Pretentious?<br />All the more reason to buy this book, it cuts through the usual mystification like a scythe, leaving even the likes of Derrida in a more explicable state.<br />Up until I read this book, I believed that literary theorists (sorry for leaving the word 'literary' in) were utterly incapable of stringing together a sentence without it drifting off into something whose meaning was far too precious to be contaminated by such banal things as understanding.<br />A real nightmare awaits many who are inspired by this book, because they will find almost every other book on the subject not only harder to read, but much less fun.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Listening to this soundtrack will change you, for the better.  You can feel the pain, the sacrifice, the suffering and the love that motivates the fellowship members to endure.  Especially in the heart-rendering &quot;Breaking of the Fellowhip&quot; sequence.  Howard Shore made me feel as if I was one of the nine.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely loved P&amp;P, it's my favorite book. I had gotten the version w/ Greer Garson &amp; Laurence Oliver, but didn't like it much, b/c although it was entertaining, the makers really cut out a lot of the important and &quot;juicy&quot; scenes that were in the book. Plus many characters were also omitted. <BR>     <BR>     But this version of P&amp;P is absolutely the best one out there. Not only are the dialogues straight out of the book, except a few, but the movie stays very true to the book. In any scenes that were added to the movie, one does not feel disappointed b/c the added scenes not only enhance the movie, but also make it more entertaining. <br />      The costumes were true to the times, and so were the actors that played their parts. The casting director has done a wonderful job in choosing the actors, b/c they actors really give life to the characters they play. One does not get the feeling that they are reciting a bunch of rehersed lines, but that they are living the part &amp; replying as if the lines were of the vernacular for them.<br />     If you loved the book, there is just no way you won't love the movie. Plus since it's  by A&amp;E and the BBC you know the movie has to be worth it. The extra footage that is given in the DVD is also entertaining to watch, especially the &quot;Making of P&amp;P&quot; segment.<br />     All in all, the movie is an absolute must have!
B000002UAO|5.0|Is this the first perfect rock album?  Perhaps not the first (Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited was released earlier that year), but it's certainly one of the earliest rock albums to push popular music as an art.  It set the standard for a great record: There's no filler (although What Goes On might be an exception), it fuses different musical styles (rock, folk, bluegrass, piano and sitar!), transcends it's influences (clearly Dylan), all the while having thoughtful lyrics, memorable melodies and superb production!  A tough balancing act, for sure...which is why only a handful of artists ever release truly great records.<br />&quot;Great&quot; is definitely the word for Rubber Soul.  Start off with the irresistbly jazzy &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; follow that with the incredible Norwegian Wood (be sure to introduce the sitar to rock for the first time,) throw in perfect vocal work (compliments of John and beautiful harmonizing) and write a song as beautiful and nostalgic as In My Life and you, too, can have a timeless album.  If you can't, don't get depressed: remember that this is the product of two of the absolute greatest (McCartney and Lennon) working together on all cylinders.  Of course, they were also being assisted by a future great (George) who was just coming into his own with two strong contributions himself (Think For Yourself and If I Needed Someone.)<br />Rubber Soul was only the first of a streak of masterpiece albums that inspires people even today, and sometimes it's overlooked because of its successors.   Don't you make the mistake to miss it.  The Beatles defined the 60's with their early work; this was the first of their albums to transcend that time.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Even though I am not a comic book-based movie fan, I really enjoyed Sam Raimi's fun and reverent adaptation of Stan Lee's web-spinning, wall-crawling Spider-Man.<br />I have to admit that I did not see this movie in my local cinema.  At the time I was saving my limited movie-going funds for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which opened two weeks after Spider-Man.  I was also leery of having to pay to see a comic-book movie adaptation. I had loved the first two Superman movies, missed the third entirely until it came on TV (and hated it), saw the laughable Superman IV turkey, then had been further disappointed by the Batman franchise.  I did see the 2000 X-Men feature  film, but only because my best friend Rogers loaned me his DVD.<br />Even so, the critical reviews on Time and elsewhere had given Spider-Man a pretty good \\"buzz,\\" so when another friend asked me what I wanted for the holidays, so I requested the Wide-screen Special Edition.<br />My friends, this movie and its DVD version do not disappoint!  Like Richard Donner did in the first Superman feature film, director Sam Raimi gives us a reverent \\"origins of' story that fairly captures Stan Lee's original storyline.<br />The screenplay by David (Jurassic Park) Koepp introduces us to Peter Parker, a nerdy high school senior who is not very popular.  As played by Tobey (Pleasantville) Maguire, Peter represents the vast majority of teenage boys who excel academically yet, because they aren't socially skilled or good looking, are teased or even ostracized by their fellow students.  If you watch the opening scene where Peter has to run after the school bus, you'll understand.<br />Spider-Man is really the intertwined tale of the origins of both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, a.k.a. Norman Osborn.  As played by the talented Willem (Platoon) Dafoe, Osborne is a charismatic yet ambitious scientist who wants to get a military contract for a \\"super soldier.\\"  With a physical enhancement formula, a technically advanced armored suit, and a neat-o powered glider, this super soldier will, hopefully, give Osborn's OsCorp billions in funding, and establish Norman as a visionary entrepreneur.<br />However, this being a comic book adaptation, is a recipe for disaster.  When one of his top scientists warns Norman that the formula needs to be researched further (which would mean missing the Pentagon's deadline for bids) and warns of really nasty side effects, Osborn decides to test the formula on himself.  And before you can say Dr. Jekyll, poor Norman - as the soon-to-be-departed scientific naysayer predicted - goes suddenly and tragically insane.<br />Meanwhile, while on a field trip to Columbia University, Peter Parker has his own rendezvous with destiny with a genetically altered super-spider.  (This is just one of a few \\"re-imaginings\\" of the original Spider-Man concept.  In the comic book premiere issue of 1962, the spider had been affected by radiation - a dark little allusion to the then prevalent threat of nuclear war.  There are other revisions...more on those later.)<br />Although I am not an expert on Spider-Man - nor any comic book superhero, for that matter - the movie is faithful to its sources.  Spider-Man (like DC's Batman) becomes a crime-fighter when crime touches his family.  In Peter's case, his motivation is the senseless death of his uncle (in the movie, by a robber who car jacks Ben Parker after taking the money from a cheapskate wrestling ring operator). Not only does Peter seek revenge for his uncle's murder, but he also feels responsible: When Peter has a chance to at least call the police to report the robbery at the wrestling entrepreneur's office, he doesn't do so because he was not paid the promised prize money.<br />The rest of the story revolves around two plots: Spidey's clashes with the Green Goblin and his relationships with  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (Peter Franco), who is Norman's son and, according to the legend ofSpider-Man, destined to become the web-weaver's nemesis, the Hobgoblin.  In this, what seems to be the first of a hopefully successful franchise, the seeds of conflict are planted in two ways.  First, Peter and Harry, who start the film as best friends, compete for M.J's affections.  Second, Harry will, by movie's end, come to hate Spider-Man with a passion.<br />The film, like most adaptations of novels or comics, does tweak certain things to fit into contemporary culture or for dramatic reasons.  Spidey's webs, originally designed by Peter and incorporated into his costume, now are organic mutations.  The fine spidery hairs that form on his hands and fingers to grip walls and surfaces are also new inventions, as are the changes in the timeline (in the movie, Peter and his fellow teens are graduating seniors, where in the comic they were underclassmen).  Nevertheless, this movie, like Warner Bros.' 1978 Superman: The Movie, are fine examples of how a comic book hero can make the transition from the printed page to the silver screen.<br />The DVD is chock-full of extra features, including two commentaries on the feature film disc, branching \\"Web-I-sodes,\\" TV and theatrical trailers, and exciting DVD-Rom features (such as Record Your Own Commentary).<br />Even if you are not a big fan of comic book movies, this is a good movie to own.Spider-Man, destined to become the web-weaver's nemesis, the Hobgoblin.

020161622X|5.0|This book was recommended by a co-worker, and he mentioned that at a previous gig, his manager got a copy for everyone in the department. This is not a reference book, but it is technical in nature. As such, it is meant for programmers and those who work closely with them (analysts, QA engineers, and project managers could benefit from it as well), but it isn't dry or boring in the least. <br />It contains quite an assortment of gems gleaned from the wisdom of very experienced coders. Although you won't find anything earth shattering, you will find a collection of concrete examples that you can use to immediately improve your skills. These are not the latest methodology fads (i.e., UML, OOP), but rather things to think about while you are writing code.<br />As an example, have you ever gotten a program to work, and although you're not exactly sure how, you figure you better leave well enough alone, lest you break it again? This is &quot;Programming By Coincidence,&quot; Tip 31, page 172.<br />I would strongly recommend this to newer programmers, especially. If you look at the talented coders in your organization, chances are they are practicing a lot of the ideas in this book (and most likely they own a copy).
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Trim the fat off this CD and you may have had a four star album. But for some reason, we have 18 songs where 12 would have stated the case so much more elegantly. As it is, &quot;Say You Will&quot; seems more like &quot;Buckingham Nicks II&quot; than a Fleetwood Mac disc, and not necessarily because Christine McVie is gone. Songs like &quot;Morrow Turning Over...&quot; sound less like Mac songs and more like Lindsey's &quot;Go Insane&quot; material. And for all that has been made of Nick's &quot;Illume 9-11,&quot; it doesn't ring near as true as &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; (or Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Rising&quot;).<br />As has been stated on so many other posts, 9/11 and the WTC tragedy permeates &quot;Say You Will.&quot; Sometimes it works (&quot;Peacekeeper&quot;), other times it's a muddled message (&quot;Murrow..&quot;). At other points - and these are &quot;Say You Will&quot; at its best - there is a fine line between allusion to tragedy and failed romantic ventures (&quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; and &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;).<br />There are moments on &quot;Say You Will&quot; that remind you of brilliance past. &quot;What's the World Coming To&quot; opens the disc with the kind of romantic wistfulness that made their eponymous 1975 album such a marvel, and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; sounds like Nick's held a leftover from &quot;Rumours&quot; that she still hadn't placed. It is also nice to hear that the players have not diminished in time. As it was on &quot;The Dance,&quot; these musicians are still masters of their craft. When it all gels, as it does on &quot;What's The World Coming To,&quot; the title track and &quot;Bleed To Love Her,&quot; it's worth the time of wading through &quot;Say You Will's&quot; frequent misfires.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Plan on watching this one twice!   This glossy and visually stunning thriller by David Lynch is mind-boggling upon first viewing; however, upon subsequent viewing -- the story unfolds and reveals secrets missed on the first viewing.  Give this one a chance.  Watch it at least once!  The brilliance of the film was not evident to me until the second viewing.   Superb &quot;thinker&quot; film!  Keep your mind open (and I don't mean the love scenes!).  And here is a hint, pay close attention to what is shown the scenes during and right after the opening credits!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Having already purchased and watched the newly released 2-DVD's I can clearly state that my love for Led-Zeppelin has become intensified greatly. As a missionary for Zeppelin, I strongly recommend this DVD. The new \\"presence\\" of Plant, Page, Jones, and Bohnam are extremely powerful and moving, both emotionally and physically. Each member of band has his monsterous moment. From Bohnman's thunderous drum solo on \\"Moby Dick,\\" to Plants painfully sensitive vocals on \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" ties all of it together (Not to mention the overwhelming talent of Page and the ever so underrated John Paul Jones). At the end of this five and half journey I found myself wanting more...and you will to. Very well done in every possible aspect. Only minute drawback was the absence of \\"Tangerine,\\" \\"Ramble On,\\"(both to the acoustic set) and \\"Heartbreaker.\\" Buy this DVD and you are promised not to be let down. The visuals are great, the sound quality is amazing, and best yet, Led-Zeppelin can finally receive some credit and respect.
B000089RVX|5.0|this cd doesn't exactly have the happiest lyrics ever, but it is still an amazingly good cd.  I would reccomend this if you are into heavy-ish music with meaningful lyrics. I would also recomend 12 Stones' new cd, because it is also a great buy.

0316548189|3.0|The reason I enjoyed A Long Walk to Freedom, was how it showed Nelson's perseverance and how even when all odds were against him he stood strong. Throughout this book, it describes Nelson Mandela's heroics becoming a \\"freedom fighter\\". This happened when he was in court awaiting his sentence and instead of folding under the circumstances, he stood, not only for himself, but for all suffering black South Africans. From Nelson's childhood he learned the views people had on black citizens. He was very appalled because of the views whites had on blacks and how they treated them with hatred. He strived and worked hard to become a lawyer only to be neglected and unfairly treated in court. Whites gave the blacks no say in the government and took their lands from them which they had lived on long before whites moved to South Africa. Nelson joined a group that rallied and protested many unfair regulations the government set for the black population. With his persistence in protesting the government's laws he acquired many followers. Many of his protests ended bloody and many died fighting for their freedom. The black people did not quit and were relentless to gain peace, land and most of all freedom.  He greatly influenced his wife Winnie who led many groups when he was sent to jail for many years. She raised their many children while being tangled up with fines, and appearances in the courts for her actions and protests. Though Nelson Mandela had many discouragements and struggles, he was able to make the largest black freedom movement in South Africa. He is a fascinating man because be started in poverty and through hard work and determination, became one of the most influential men in South Africa's history.
0812550706|5.0|This is one of the finest novels you'll ever read. This is a book I have bought several times, yet that I still don't own, because I inevitably give my copies away to those who I feel should read this amazing story.<br />First, it's a simple story, with deftly drawn characters and an incredible plot. It's a book to be read in one sitting, if you are inclined to such an activity. Ender, the precocious hero of the tale, is 3 years old at the book's beginning, but by the end of the book, he has saved the entire human race. His story is compelling and vastly entertaining. <br />But ultimately, this book and its sequel, Speaker for the Dead, are about more than just a good story--- they are about tolerance, understanding, compassion, humanity. They offer an easy way into a large-scale understanding of what our place is in the universe. This won't clobber you over the head as you read the books, but perhaps after reading them you will be a little more inclined to try to understand another culture before denouncing it-- much as Ender must learn to deal with the fact that he was unwittingly responsible for the destruction of an entire race, without even understanding their identity or motives.<br />I first read this book and its companion (I find the following books-- Xenocide, Children of the Mind, et al-- interesting, but Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead stand alone to me) when I was about 15 I think, and they have had a lasting impact on me. Since then, these books are the most recommended and gifted titles I have owned-- given with the intention of fostering an interest in science fiction, as well as with the idea that they can also demonstrate some of the more honorable and desirable traits humans can display. If everyone who reads this book can identify and learn even a little bit with Ender, I think Card will have done a great service to that readership. <br />Highly recommended, and suitable for young adults and adults alike.

B0000931QR|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I was a bit disappointed and thought La Oreja were repeating themselves. Then I listened to it again, and again, and realized how wrong I was. It's been a month now and I listen to it at least three times every day!<br />This album requires more attention than El viaje de Copperpot. Lyrics are more complicated and it takes a while to appreciate the real genious of most songs.<br />THE HIGHLIGHTS<BR>ROSAS. It's up there with LA PLAYA as one of the best pop ballads of recent times. love the chorus. choruses are La Oreja's specialty. <BR>BONUSTRACK. the untitled, electronic track 15. interesting, nonsense lyrics and a great voice effect that turns Amaia's singing into a keyboard.<BR>LA PAZ DE TUS OJOS. again, a monumental chorus. 'come and tell me that story about princesses and love that I once told you'. intense.<BR>GEOGRAFÍA. a new sound for La Oreja, a mix of South American and Spanish folk, with creative lyrics about creating an imaginary country with one's loved one.<BR>TÚ Y YO. simple lyrics but a beautiful vocal arrangement in the end, with Amaia and Xabi's voice in the background. <br />There are so many other good tracks such as:<BR>LA ESPERANZA DEBIDA. it has a certain 80's U2 appeal to it in the second half.<BR>UN MUNDO MEJOR, inspired by La Oreja's experiences in Cuba.<BR>ADIÓS, again, a powerful chorus and a very subtle ending.<BR>PERDÓNAME, it's like two songs in one. A very jazzy intro and then a rock chorus.<br />There are two tracks I don't dislike, but definitely believe they're not as good as the rest:<BR>PUEDES CONTAR CONMIGO was not the best choice for a best single. Along with DESEOS DE COSAS IMPOSIBLES, I consider it to be a filler track.<br />In the end, La Oreja's third album is their best, but it needs your full attention before showing its true colors.<BR>PS: try downloading the B-Side for PUEDES CONTAR CONMIGO, called CORONEL. should have been on the album!<br />Title translation:<BR>WHAT I TOLD YOUWHILE YOU PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP<BR>1.

0380977788|3.0|The tale of a girl that did too much exploring, and eventually it all came back to haunt her.<br />\\"Coraline\\" by Neil Gaiman provides an interesting look into the mind of a little girl. . .if she was as mature as a 30-something. <br />While this is obviously a children's book, it's hard to believe that a pre-teen girl could be so mature. Her exploits while exploring her flat and the neighborhood are the only thing that gives testament to her age. Otherwise she wanders around in a haze, seeing everything through the eyes not of a child, but of a far older person. Mr. Gaiman takes this character beyond \\"mature for her years\\" straight into the realm of an adult trapped within a child's body.<br />When it comes to the suspense of the novel, it isn't exactly riveting, but it is there. While it was quite predictable in its outcome, the twist of the other children was quite invigorating in this otherwise bland novel.<br />The most interesting character of the entire book was not the people, but rather it was the cat. Gaiman gave the cat a delicious amount of attitude, making it the perfect foil for the tone of the novel.<br />Overall, the book is not exactly one that will send people into a mad frenzy searching for it, but it isn't entirely awful either. It gets stuck about in the middle, making it mediocre at best. The main flaw is in the characterization of the people within, not the set-up of the book. If the characterization was improved, even slightly, the novel would be all the more better for it. It gets 3 stars for being about average, though 2.5 would be more accurate.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Until this album came out I was one of those people who wandered around, nasally lamenting that rock was dead.  The only rock albums I owned were pre-1980.  I had moved on to techno and rediscovered jazz and lounge music due to the deplorable state of what was passing for rock and roll.<br />Then I heard this album.<br />Damn, it was exciting to hear a band that sounded like they meant every note of their music.  The White Stripes have truly created a modern classic with &quot;Elephant&quot;.  It remains to be seen if this one will stand the test of time, but for now it remains an utterly catchy, well-crafted piece of artistry.  &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is right up there on the flat-out-most-fun-rock-songs-ever list.  &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do with Myself&quot; and &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; have a great retro feel and Meg White's voice is adorable!  &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; is a bluesy hard-rockin' tune, and &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot;  is utterly divine, a very basic rock song dressed up with an unconventional melody and a folk-sing-a-long sensibility.  The rest of the album is filled with enthusiastic, bouncy songs that improve with subsequent listenings.  Bless the White Stripes, rock has risen from the grave!
0688163173|5.0|Our daughter read this book before I did, and she did peek ahead at the ending.  It kind of spoiled the rest of the book for her. The final resolution to the story is so unexpected, that most people would not ever figure it out on their own. I am now anxious to read it again and see if there were any clues that I missed that would have lead me to anticipate the end.  The writing was tight and fast-moving, and the book was hard to put down.  I still feel that MYSTIC RIVER is better, but it was entirely different too.  I've also read several of Lehane's Elvis Cole mysteries, and he has become one of my favorite authors.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|I bought this album because I was so impressed with Adam's debut &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. This follow-up is a little too mainstream for me. Perhaps it is more complex, but I miss a little bit of the angst or the heartache of his first album. I guess a number of reviewers before me have summed it up.

The story held me for about the first 400 pages, ... The last half of Leviathan was absolutely brutal with the worst run on sentences and longest paragraphs I have ever seen.  I was so disappointed in the ending. ...

B00008S2VH|1.0|Yes, some of the lyrics are introspective, but that doesn't mean they're good. I had high hopes but these songs and their ideas have all been heard before. This is no return to form but more like a sampler or reflections of what's on the radio today by others working harder and better at their craft. None of the songs stay with you. Rudimentary acoustic guitar to hip hop beats does not lead to a 5 star record, especially when the playing ( mostly by Madonna) is so amateur. Sometimes playing safe is not the way to go.
B0000004V2|5.0|You can't really be called ground breaking when the best lyric on you've written you pulled straight from the bible. But it took several thousand years before that book got patched up with some new material making it acceptable to the masses; it only took 20 years for the Stone Roses to perfect sixties rock. Bible thumpers might want to ban this, as it's easily the most danceable rock album of all time.
B00008OWZC|5.0|For decades now, the only official live Zeppelin album has been The Song Remains The Same (not counting the amazing BBC sessions).  Members of the band admit that The Song Remains the Same is not Zeppelin on a magical night, they just said it was them on an okay night.  That all changes with the release of this album.  How The West Was Won features a great setlist, and is one of the best live albums ever released.  Plant's voice is in great shape, Page's guitar is amazing, JPJ's powerful bass lines are outstanding, and I believe this album features some of John Bonham's best drumming, which of course means it's some of the best drumming ever commited onto tape.  The band mixes in an acoustic set with the harder rockers.  This is a must have for Zep fans, as is the new DVD.  Buy now.
B000000OQY|3.0|This is really 2 short EP's released as 1 album - the first side is their old \\"Live like a Suicide\\" EP, which was recorded LOOOOONG before Appetite came along, and the 2nd side is a collection of some acoustic songs recorded in a very relaxed style.  The idea was to give the fans something to hold them over until their next studio release - which was probably a good thing since it took so long for Use Your Illusion (I and II) to come out.  As such, the quality is not great and the songs are decent, but it is not an true album.  Just keep that in mind and you won't be disapointed.<br />The live songs aren't bad - he actually sounds better here than on their recent double live album.  The cover of Aerosmith's Mama Kin is easily the highlight.<br />As for the accoustic songs, Patience is the most popular.  It's a good song, very different for them at the time, but it suffers a bit from \\"stairway\\" syndrome (i.e. a ballad overplayed to death by the radio).  Of course, GNR would take this to new extremes later with November Rain, but that's a review for another day.  You're Crazy is a bit of a shock from the original - MUCH slower and sung in a different style - but once you stop trying to compare it to the original version (difficult, I must say!), you will like it.  Used to Love Her is interesting - it's a catchy song with a nice rhythm, very happy sounding, but with a bit of a morbid message.  For the record (and contrary to popular belief) - Axl is NOT singing about killing his girlfriend in this song; he's actually singing about a dog he used to own!  This may not be any better for some of you, but oh well.  One in a Million is another interesting one - it's basically Axl just getting some bitterness out of his system.  Unlike Used to Love Her, the music matches the lyrics in this one.  It has a darker sound to it, to go with Axl's hate-filled John Rockeresque lyrics.  He has taken a lot of heat for this one, and I can't say that I agree with what he's saying, but Ihave to give him credit for not being afraid to put this out there.  It's probably the best of the acoustic songs MUSICALLY.
0812550706|5.0|Enders game is one of the most spectacular books that I ever had the pleasure of reading.  The author, Orson Scott Card, has just out done him self on this book. This science Fiction book is just full of drama, and adventure has you follow him through training and into combat.<BR>   The setting of the story directly affects the motivations of the main character.  For instance, Ender is the main character and he chooses to go through training to fight buggers because he is in outer space. Ender has the determination to do his best to fight off the buggers.  When he has to, he will do his best to save what means the most to him. For example, his sister Valentine encourages him to save the world.  Another example is that when Ender is in a very peaceful place he has the motivation to do very little or nothing at all. Ender won't do anything at all until an out side force comes in and acts upon him to do something. Ender doesn't want anything to do with fighting or killing buggers unless he has to defend someone. Enders surroundings, outer space, and the influence of the people whom he cares for gives him the motivation to make choices, to create an interesting story.<BR>   Ender's game was, in my opinion, was better than all the best science fiction books, like stare track and star wars. If I could choose any science fiction books in the world I would choose Enders game for the drama, adventure, setting, and of course characters.  Harry potter comes in a close second place. This book for all of these reasons is one of the greatest and best books I have ever read. I believe that the adventures and characters have captured my interest and Ender's Game will continue to be on my all time list of favorite books to read.
6304711875|4.0|In this film, there is a character who doesn't scary movies for the exact same reason I don't : \\"What's the point? They're all the same. It's always about a killer attacking a big brested chick can't act who runs upstairs instead of out the front door so she can get cornered. It's insulting.\\" Needless to say, that very same character does just that while being pursued by this films killer. But that's because SCREAM is making fun of all the overused (not to mention totally illogical) cliches of horror films, and this is what makes it so fun. It may not be possible to film a more horrifying scene than this films opening 10 mins.And as for the women in the film, yes, there is a blonde with a huge chest that gets knocked off here, but it's cool because it makes fun of about 2000 films with the exact same situation.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Wow!!  This is even better than expected.  The video is terrific and the sound even better.  We finally get to see clear pictures and great sound of those moments for which Zeppelin were legendary.  For those who've made a career out of bashing LZ, I'd like to hear from you now.  These shows demonstrate the energy, creativity and raw sensuality of a Zeppelin live show.  Though much of this was available on bootlegs these versions are stellar.  Of particular note are the Earl's Court pieces, though through it all the playing is crisp and never contrived.  A truly great DVD which shows why all the fuss was made about the best rock band ever.
B000002I6T|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews about this fine album. The main reason for writing however would be to question what reviewer 'Autumnfair' from San Antonio said about the first voice to be heard on the album being Neil Young's. I don't believe it is.......I think its David Crosby's voice but I'm not 100% sure.........Neil unmistakable voice comes in after a few bars..  If you like CSN&amp;Y and early Neil Young you'll like this album. The overall mood captures the late 60s west coast era very well..

Godsmack is a one of a kind band and their cd's are experiences worth buying.
B000001G89|5.0|If you want CARMEN to sound like an intimate \\"opera comique\\" rather than a \\"grand opera,\\" then this is the recording to buy.  The cast of Berganza, Domingo, Cotrubas, and Milnes make a superb team, both in the music and in the dialogue.  Berganza makes Carmen's music sound so tasteful and elegant, and there is no lack of character in her performance.  Berganza's Carmen is coolly magnetic; one senses that it is because she is an independent woman that Don Jose is both fascinated and frustrated by her.  Domingo's singing of the \\"Flower Song\\" is especially beautiful, and his mounting rage in the later acts is terrifying (I am chilled every time I hear his line just before he stabs Carmen, \\"Pour le derniere fois, demon, veux-tu me suivre?\\" -- \\"For the last time, you devil, will you come with me?\\").  Milnes is in wonderful voice as Escamillo. He really makes the \\"Toreador Song\\" into a narrative (rather than just a \\"song hit\\"), and he is charming and funny in the spoken dialogue (Listen to his line to Carmen in Act II, \\"J'attendrai alors et je me conenterai d'esperer\\" -- \\"Then I'll wait and content myself with hoping\\".)  Cotrubas projects innocence but also spirit as Micaela.  As in her recording of LA TRAVIATA, she sings beautifully with Domingo.  Last but definitely not least, Abbado brings a truly Spanish feel to this French music.  All in all, this is the perfect \\"opera comique\\" CARMEN.
B00005JKPF|5.0|X-MEN 2 is definately a movie to rave about this year. Not only did it have the characters of X-MEN, it introduced newer mutants, such as Nightcrawler, whom I think was ferocious and funny at just the right moments. In the beginning, I had no interest to see X-MEN. Now, a couple years later, I see X2 and I'm blown away by its exciting theme and excellent plot. I didn't think I would be able to follow it, since I didn't see the first. But, surprisingly, I had no trouble and enjoyed it to its last scene. (my favorite part was the beginning, when Nightcrawler almost kills the President! That was hilarious)

B00008VGL6|5.0|Typically when an artist covers a song its either a hit or miss. This is an album of hits.  Martin takes these songs and makes them his own.  Although Martin defintely does not lack the talent to create and write his own music, his interpretation of these songs is mesmerizing.  He puts you in a dreamlike state you'd rather not awake from. Hopefully the Counterfeit series will become a trilogy sooner rather than later.
B000002IAS|5.0|stephen arnade palm bay florida; This is it, the best rock-and-roll from the 70's.  Delaney and Bonnie with Dave Mason and Eric Claption.  Its live and everyone was at their peak in their career.  Dave Mason, Eric, Delaney Bramlett, and Bonnie Bramlett. Delaney and Bonnie combined; Gospel, Soul and Rock-And-Roll.  A really unique band !!  I read somewhere that the Eric Clapton guitar-solo on the song &quot;I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT&quot;, was rated the number one guitar solo ever.  Its live, its spontaneous.  They announcer even use some slang from back then.  Calling this a &quot;swing place&quot;.
0451207521|4.0|Jackdaws is a book from one of my favourite non-genre categories:  World War II spy fiction.  I usually find these books to be page-turners, and this one is no exception.  Follett ratchets up the tension, sprinkles a couple of interesting characters into the batter, and then hits \\"blend.\\"  The result is a taut thriller that is very pleasing to the palate.<br />Follett presents a thriller that will make you keep reading, no matter the fact that the light should have been turned off long ago.  The plot twists and turns until it's almost pretzel-shaped, with Dieter getting ever closer to his goal.  In a way, it is almost reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen, except that the people in question aren't all criminals, their just misfits.  They are thrown together in a haphazard manner and expected to pull of a mission in enemy-occupied France.  While it is slightly unbelievable, Follett avoids the clich&eacute; of having everybody become crack secret agents once they are in France.  Mistakes happen, stupid things are done, and Flick ends up having to improvise mightily.  I found this a major plus, because you didn't always know what was going to happen, even if the ultimate outcome wasn't always in doubt.<br />Follett concentrates on three characters: Flick, Dieter, and an American officer named Paul Chancellor, who becomes romantically interested in Flick.  This provides a good narrative force for the story, as the viewpoints are limited and we see a lot of the other characters only through these three pairs of eyes.  I think it made it more interesting, and it also emphasized the personal nature of the story as Dieter and Flick interact even when they're not together.  In fact, while I found Paul interesting in his own right, I think the story would have worked better without him, or at least without his viewpoint.  It would have narrowed the focus even further, and made the inevitable meeting all the richer.<br />Flick is a very dynamic character, well-rounded and interesting to read about.  She's torn because she's constantly away from her husband, and she doesn't trust him with the other resistance fighters.  He's always been a lady's man.  She's also brutally efficient when necessary and she's quick on her feet.  I really liked her, and I thought she made a wonderful protagonist.  Paul makes a good foil for her, despite what I said above.  I did find the sections from his point of view to be kind of dull, though.  He doesn't add much to the mix that he couldn't have added as a minor character.<br />Dieter, on the other hand, is fascinating.  He's certainly the villain of the book.  He's a Nazi officer through and through.  But he's humanized as well.  He finds that he's falling in love with his French mistress and he truly seems to care for her.  He doesn't know what is going to happen after this invasion, but he ultimately decides that he wants to be with her afterward.  On the other hand, he's capable of being brutal (though Follett provides a character in Sergeant Baker, who's just a sadist, as a counterpoint to Dieter).  He doesn't like torture despite being good at it, and he even remarks that this makes the best interrogator.  If the interrogator enjoys the pain too much, he loses sight of the goal and won't be very efficient.  I found him very interesting to read about, despite not liking him in the least.  He made the perfect villain, and his fate is actually a little surprising.<br />Follett falls a little short in the other characters, though, especially the women.  The other Germans are rather faceless, but that's their job in the story: to be the strongmen for Dieter to use.  But the women, I think, should be more important than they turn out to be.  They get a lot of characterization as Flick recruits and trains them, but once they drop into France, they become almost invisible.  The only one who gets much characterization is Ruby, and that's because she's effectively Flick's second in command.  The others get short shrift, and it's too bad.  They appeared to be interesting characters at the beginning.  I'm not saying they should be viewpoint characters, but more should have been done with them than actually happened.  They fulfill their roles, but they aren't very interesting doing it.<br />There are some choppy places in the book where Follett's prose and plotting fails him too.  At times, Follett over-writes, emphasizing things that don't need to be.  He makes a point of saying that only two characters in a scene know something, and then he says it again during the conversation with the other people in the scene.  It was distracting.  Also, there is one point where Flick and her party shoot two guards, but when Dieter comes upon them, one of them is still alive enough to gasp out what happened.  Flick has been shown to be cautious to the point of paranoia and efficient to the point that she never leaves anything done half way.  Yet she doesn't slit this guard's throat to make sure he's dead?  I didn't buy it.  It seemed like the guard was only alive so Dieter could find out what he wanted to know.  It smacked of author intervention.  Niggling things like this are spread throughout the book, never actually killing it but always sitting in the back of your mind.<br />Despite these flaws, however, I found I could not put this book down.  I raced through it because I wanted to see what would happen next.  It is a great example of the genre and an exciting read.  If you like this sort of story, you should pick it up.<br />Warning for the squeamish: there are a couple of torture scenes that you may find unsettling, especially the first one.<br />David Roynd it's too bad.

0316666343|5.0|When we first dive into The Lovely Bones, Susie Salmon is exploring Heaven. She's a 14-year old girl who was lured into a neighbor's \\"hide-out,\\" only to become the victim of rape and murder.

B00005NTN5|5.0|If you need only one reason to get this DVD, here it is: the audio commentary track. It is absolutely hilarious, and in many cases very insightful.  Directors and Executive Producers Andy and Larry Wachowski join editor Zach Staenberg and Technical Consultant Susie Bright, along with Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon in a very candid and comical commentary on the visually stunning achievement that is Bound. Jennifer joins in at about 1:07:00 and finally Gershon shows up at 1:17:44. They all add meaning to each single scene, my only wish is that they would have included the bloopers/deleted scenes. I actually laughed out loud many times during the commentary. In fact, this is the first time ever I listened to a complete commentary track. It is a must for all cinema buffs out there.  They keep talking about Laser Disc, I guess the DVD format was not out just yet. Yes, there was life before DVD <br />Very few cons:<br />The commentary track seem to be damaged  - it is not a physical defect on the disc itself. The audio goes out at 52:06 and comes back at 53:30.  Not a big deal, but we will probably never know what was said in those 84 seconds :)<br />Towards the end the commentary kind of breaks down because everyone talks over each other.<br />The movie itself:<br />What can I say? It is extremely sexy, funny, technically well crafted, beautifully shot, spectacularly edited  It is a love story,  a gangster movie, a sexy thriller, a caper flick, it is a lot of things at once. It is amazing what $4.5M and a superb cast & crew can do. Joe Pantoliano (Caesar) steals the movie, but the performances of Tilly (Violet) , Gershon (Corky), and specifically John Ryan (Mickey) are extraordinary.<br />Of course there are many parallels with the next Wachowski brothers project, The Matrix (or is it the other way around?). For starters, we can appreciate the first conceptual bullet time  time slows down dramatically during a shooting sequence. Obviously we couldnt foresee Matrix-type  visual effects but looking back we can witness the birth of something revolutionary. Zach Staenberg also edited The Matrix, and of course, Joey Pants delighted us in The Matrix as well. Im sure there are more things in common.<br />Forget about the R-rated version  get the unrated DVD. The unrated version shows an astounding one-shot love scene not shown entirely in the theater release. Youll see why. Technically alone it is good to watch ;)<br />Few special features  that would make the DVD even better:<br />1. Bloopers<BR>2. Deleted Scenes<BR>3. Maybe a Directors Cut ???<BR>4. Cast interviews<BR>5. Making of  featurette<br />For everything that it is, Bound deserves a solid 5 star rating.
0316548189|4.0|Nelson Mandela brought his life and the history of South Africa for the past century alive in his vivid autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom.  This is the first autobiography I have ever read, and I must say that Nelson Mandela can write with extraordinary talent.  The imagery and vivid accounts Mandela uses to display 100 years of history in apartheid ridden South Africa show the reader the true horrors that blacks went trough day to day.  <BR>Mandela takes the reader through his childhood in the Transkei, and then his troubled adulthood in Johannesburg.  In Johannesburg, Nelson starts the first black law firm and begins to start a political life.  He shows his development from an ignorant citizen to a fierce opponent to segregated society.  Mandela also shows his life underground, in prison, and the prevail of good over evil.  In addition, this book shows the development of the African National Congress, and other influential organizations that still strive to create racial harmony to this day.  This book is the sacrifice 27 years of a man's life for the betterment of society.  <BR>The book is not only a good historical count, but also a great read.  Nelson uses excellent literary techniques, colorful metaphors, imagery and personification to write a life story, which proves to be successful.  <BR>Every high school student should read this book to lessen racial prejudice in the United States and to preserve a tranquil society.  I salute Nelson Mandela for his accomplishments and thank him for sharing his story with the world.<BR>If you are interested in the triumph of good over evil, the end of a racially prejudice society or just a good read, pick up Long Walk to Freedom and let Nelson Mandela teach you about a culture and the changes he helped to make.
0385507755|2.0|James Frey is a gifted writer, his prose is sharp and engaging.  Some people are saying this is among the best recent books about addiction--maybe it is.  It illustrates the horrific symptoms of alcoholism and chemical dependence which any alcoholic or addict will identify with--Frey's case is a garden variety one.  <br />Frey rejects the sound medical and clinical advice that has worked for millions of people for 67 years.  He decides to get sober his own way, which is also pretty common, and explains why so few people who try to get clean and sober stay fail.  <br />Treatment on addiction is open for debate, and certainly there is more than one way to find happiness.  But based on the text in this book and interviews Frey has given, it is clear that his way is not facilitating the joy and serenity common to those who find a higher power and help others recover.  Arrogance, big ego, and low self esteem plague the book, and since it's nonfiction, must plague the author.  Maybe the book is one of our best portraits of addiction; it is definitely our worst portrait of recovery.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Everyone who's gushing over this DVD collection is absolutely right - It looks great (considering), it sounds great, and there are lots of songs I wouldn't have expected. And let me repeat another's sentiment: Page's violin bow routine is very cool in 5.1!    I'm pretty much chiming in here to point out the fact that virtually every menu screen has some kind of footage/live audio accompanying it. Be sure to browse all these while you're navigating the meat and potatoes.    One more thing: I don't think anyone's giving the \\"bonus materials\\" their due. There are a bunch more live performances here (disc 1) that aren't making some track listings. Check these out too. There's some goodness in the credits too.    And I hope you like Dazed and Confused; you'll hear it quite a few times across the set.
B00008WG3U|5.0|After three years of waiting for an all-new full-length studio release, NOFX fans will not be let down with this amazing new album.  In their newest release, NOFX gets a little more serious, with songs like &quot;Separation of Church and Skate&quot; and &quot;Irrationality of Rationality&quot;, while still keeping the fun, upbeat humor through songs like &quot;She's Nubs&quot; and &quot;Anarchy Camp&quot;.  Somewhat ironically, though, they mention in &quot;Separation of Church and Skate&quot; that bands should &quot;stop writing songs about girls and love&quot;, yet the CD contains a song about a girl (&quot;We Got Two Jealous Agains&quot;), granted the song is rather humorous, being about falling in love with someone that has the same record collection as yourself.  Overall, this new album, while not up to par with, say, So Long and Thanks for All The Shoes, is still definitely an album not to be missed.
0345350499|5.0|werd. the mists of avalon IS the definition of the ultimate work of historical fiction. it's so superbly realistic in its fantastical description of love and trechery and christianity v paganism in the arthurian area. reality and fantasy and inseperable in this believable story.<br />i think that i loved and hated each one of the characters at time, which makes them so, so real. i read this 900 page book in two weeks, and every moment of my spare time was devoted to it. the story starts with the death of the king before uther and ends with the death of arthur, it spans three or more generations. its amazing when you're on page 600 and you start thinking of how many years have gone by... its almost unfathomably.<br />the dissarray that the end of the book is incredibly moving. i was jolted at the closure of the story, and found myself weeping even though almost everyone knows what became of arthur.<br />words cant begin to describe how much i loved this book. as soon as i read the other books pertaining to this one (the forest house is the one im on now, its not quite as good as the mists of avalon.) i will surely read this book again.
B000001FFJ|4.0|So I listened to Rain Dogs. And at first I thought it was the worst [money] I spent in my lifetime. But you really can't go wrong with Tom Waits. By the second listening, I was singing along. My family hates it, but I beg to differ. You get to like it after a couple of listens, and you have to admit, it's mighty good bed-making music. I prefer his experimental songs/dark caberet music, but his blues and rock and folkis good nonetheless. Does he have a mouthful of marshmallows?
0316548189|3.0|Long Walk to Freedom is an experience to be remembered.  Although the book is an autobiography, the details are exquisite.  It is apparent that Mandela wrote this book not to boast over a life of fame or fortune, but to guide us through a lifetime struggle filled of humiliation and pride, success and defeat.  Throughout Mandela's journey, we learn insight into Mandela's thoughts, and the long walk he took to overcome the odds.  Although his struggle was not easy, Mandela never quit, and for that he is a man to be commended by millions.  Perhaps, Mandela wrote this book to teach us all a lesson in the true merit of human heart,  \\"No one is born hating another person because of the color of their skin, or his background, or his religion.  People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\\" (622)  Though the book is long, and at times tedious, it is filled with a variety of storylines that keeps the reader intrigued.  Between the fight to keep his family alive and well, Mandela also battles the South African government, other political organizations, oppressors of freedom, and the South African court of law.  In doing this, Mandela shows how a man's life is not only a complex event, but also a road with many paths.  He also shows us how one man's paths can cross and change the course of history, and the oppression of a nation.  This book is bound to keep readers captivated, as it involves more than one element of Mandela's life.  No matter your name, your age, or the color of your skin, Long Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela is a book that will guide you through a struggle that we all are fighting for; the struggle against discrimination.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Hardcore fans of Bowie's older hits may not all love this album because it is more modern and unusual.  but one of the fine points of Bowie's creative genius is his constant evovling of musical style taking ideas from various forms and inventing new ones along the way.  his odd mix of an overal &quot;pop&quot; skeleton mixed with very creative and modern styles is one of the most interesting things about his lage body of work.  He has a unique ability to do something really &quot;out there&quot; and still make it appealing to mass audiences.  this album is one of my favorites of all, it has a sort of story-theme, which is odd enough and very interesting.  there are songs which feature jazz and techno inspired passages as well as interesting tracks of sounds and speaking.  this is Bowie at one of his most experimental stages and i think its the first time technology was caught up with his creative visions.  also featuring the production talents of ingenius visionary Brian Eno (producing also U2s &quot;the Josua Tree.&quot;) and the talents of several skilled musicians including bizzare guitar player Reeves Gabrels, doesnt just play the same old thing youve heard a million times but uses samples, effects, and just creative guitar playing to accentuate sometimes and other times drive the various styles of music present. this album is in my opinion one of the greats in a time where most music good or bad is still just the same old song and dance. people who like something different will like this album but as i say, it is also &quot;pop&quot; enough for causual listeners in some places.  i would also recomend a quieter, softer Bowie album, HEATHEN, Bowies latest release.

6305127689|3.0|The best of the best? Well, not the script. THe acting isn't that bad. Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards could never be bested by any other duo for Mav and Goose. Same for Val and Rick Rossovich as Iceman and Slider. Great chemistry for the two teams as they verbally abuse each other while trying to vie for the honours at Top Gun. Special FX for flights and airfights are great. Kelly Mcgillis is somewhat misplaced as the roamantic interest for Tom Cruise. The rest of the cast is well placed, and so are the other bits.<br />Highlight: Iceman / Slider engaged against 5 (or was it 6?) Mig 28's and barely keeping away from becoming cannon fodder. Really tense. <br />Lowpoint: Mav trying to lure Charlie (McGillis) into lustly ventures. Bad lines.
B000003H34|5.0|Man, the first review I se for this album is the one wroted by a soft, havy metal guy, how knows nothing about it. This is not only the best album of Anathema, which by the way is the best band of all times, but is also one of the most wonderful albums ever made by human. Not only \\" The silent enigma\\", \\"Dying wish\\", and \\"Shroud Of Frost\\", but every song is great. If you know something about sad and melancolic doom metal, this is the best experience you will ever have. Like extas or trans of emotions. After Darren Wight left they not that great anymore, but this album will stay always in the same holy shelf where I kip \\" The Angel And The Dark River\\". No other words, is done by gods ! The best lyrics and music that can exist.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Simply put this dvd set is awsome! I like many of you out there own just about everything Zep that was made available both musically and visually. I have heard some rare live performances on the radio. I have seen, heard, even owned (shhhh!) bootleg material. In some cases some were pretty exceptional and others some pretty terrible in quality.  Bootleg video and audio quality always lagged and never saw this kind of an upgrade.  In the nutshell this has both stuff you may have seen as I mentioned and perhaps some you haven't but both are now brought up to a very high level giving you a great visual and sound experience.  Kudo's to Jimmy Page and the producers for bringing these to light and back to life in the way they have. Truely must have been a labor of love.  It has been a little long in coming however worth it. The only thing that could make this better perhaps is follow up releases giving us the full live shows like Earls Court and Madison Sqare Garden, Seattle (which I don't think there was any of here), Knebworth and who knows what else? The only full version concert offered here was 1970 Royal Albert Hall which was excellent particularly given the acoustics of that arena.  We all know that live video of the band is rare and limited (what a shame due to poor management choice at the time).  We know the band is legendary and Zep will still be enjoyed by up incoming musicians and listeners for generations to come but the music is changing and the demographic is now getting older so why not just put these out there now in like or better quality? Perhaps it will inspire and instill a much needed lesson these days by showing how talented musicians and the way they attacked, played and presented there music really should be?

0790729342|5.0|Hard to believe this film is over 20 years old.  I recently watched it again on DVD, and although certain aspects of it seem a little bit dated given the movie technology of today...still the chase scenes are the finest ever put the film.  Whenever someone goes flying in the air, or a vehicle crashes head on with another,  it's ALL REAL!!!  No computer graphics in this one, this is the way it's supposed to be.  I can spot a digitally altered scene a mile away and this pure action film making at it's best!!!   A true cult classic that deserves it's admiration and respect.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Simply put this 3 cd set is awsome!  Like it DVD counterpart it has to be heard to be appreciated.  Greatshow, great performance, great quality.  Fortunately Zep recorded musically through their sound boards a good many of their shows.  This was perhaps a flawless performance of the band in their prime presented in great sound and while video of the band is unfortunately rare we can only hope more of the music like this itself will follow? most
B00005JL78|1.0|I've read the favorable reviews for this and I strongly disagree with ALL of them. This movie does not compare to Blade Runner, it's not Tom Cruise's best performance and if you're a Philip K. Dick fan, you'll be as disappointed as you were by Total Recall( a whole 'nother story, although I usually like Roger Zelazny). About all I brough home from this movie was that they had a big special-effects budget and Lexus has a new car they're promoting. There were only distant, tangental relationships to the short story that this movie took it's name from. Like Total Recall, the protaganist has the same name as the story and there are elements of the original story in the plot line, but they're few and far between. If you feel you have to own it, buy it used, otherwise rent it and then let someone else be plagued by it later.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Everyone artist or group comes out with a Greatest Hits album at some point in their careers, however only acts like the Beatles or Elvis have the luxury of having enought #1 hits to actually require an album of just that, #1 hits. Sure many Beatle fanatics are going to whine that there were great songs left off of this album, but it is what it is, a collection of #1 hits, and is a good starting album for someone just getting into the group, as hard to believe as it would be. To those new listeners who like this album, and are anxious to acquire more Beatle albums, I would recommend \\"Revolver\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"1967-1970\\". If you like these songs, then even dig a little deeper into \\"the White Album\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\".<BR>My personal favorite Beatle songs would comprise my favorite \\"Best Of\\" album would be:<BR>1. I'm So Tired (White Album)<BR>2. Something (Abbey Road)<BR>3. Baby You're A Rich Man (Magical Mystery Tour)<BR>4. I Am the Walrus (Magical Mystery Tour)<br />5. A Day in the Life (Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band)<BR>6. Tomorrow Never Knows (Revolver)<BR>7. Wait (Rubber Soul)<BR>8. Rain (Past Masters Vol.2)<BR>9. Hey Jude (Past Masters Vol.2)<BR>10.

B000089RVX|5.0|I don't buy CD's. Hands down, I just don't. My personal collection includes the Tarzan soundtrack, Journey's greatest hits, and an 80's best cd.  I don't download it, either.  I just don't listen often enough to justify wasting [money] on a cd.  However after listening to \\"Bring Me to Life\\" and not quite catching all the lyrics I decided I had to risk the money and purchase.<br />Amy has an amazing voice, and the songs are hauntingly beautiful.  Yes, some of the lyrics do repeat as one critic noted, but this is not just another Linkin Park type thing.  This band has a sound and a set all their own.  The songs can be Goth, I suppose, but I think it really depends on the person listening to it.  I never for a minute regretted having spent the money.  My only wish is that the CD were longer than its current 45 minutes.
B00009APK1|4.0|To me, Tolkien's The Two Towers was probably the hardest of the trilogy to make a movie out of.  Yes, there were many things left out of Jackson's movie, but for the regular movie goer or someone who is just beginning to enjoy The Lord Of The Rings it is great.  The way Jackson mixed the action of Aragorn and company with that of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum made me happy.  I think that was one thing that I least enjoyed about the book.  Despite inaccuracies in dialogue, setting, and timing I think the movie was excecuted pretty well.  I cannot wait to see the extra footage in the extended DVD.
6305971099|4.0|This sequel (98 minutes) is way too long because the story is short. It starts off speedily and entertaining.

Her sister Rachael is going to a party (leaving her sister alone, damn shame) and Rachel's homegirl Tina is checking up on Jamie, then leaves as well...The party gets ugly and the final showdown in the Myers house is one of the worst big chasings in the series. It's kind of creepy the first time around, but it gets memorable and known by the second time around. Anchor bay released it with a good transer and sound quality, but there is only 2 extras...a trailer and a 17 min. Documentary. Oh well, it wasn't the most important sequel anyway. Great addition to the series, pretty good DVD, hoping for a SPECIAL EDITION like the new 2 disc set for part one that comes out in August. Overall movie grade:B

0689859368|4.0|Written in the spirit of Harry Potter and The Series of Unfortunate Events, Books One and Two of the The Spiderwick Chronicles are delightful. Thanks to Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, the Grace kids' story, complete with rhyming riddles, injured griffins, and hobgoblin spit, is artfully told. I have only one complaint...the third book isn't out yet!
0393057658|4.0|I thought the book was a fascinating look inside the Oakland A's and Billy Beane's methods of staying on top despite the market realities of being a small market team.<br />However, the book left me wanting more detail or just a longer story, but that in and of itself, says I was enjoying what I was reading....even if it ended too quickly
B00006G8K0|5.0|Dracula has been through many, many incarnations since Bram Stoker's novel first appeared.  Some of them are quite good and some of them are laughable.  And after all these years, Hammer Studios' \\"Horror of Dracula\\" stands at the top of the pile. <br />Why?  If nothing else, Hammer paid close attention to setting the proper atmosphere for most of its films.  The castle, the costumes, the period detail, even the wood of the stakes looks perfect.  An impressive fantasy world was constructed with this film, a world that you can get lost in.  Add to the package wonderful acting and the presence of two great horror actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  (Will we ever see their likes again?)  A great package.<br />Although very tame these days, for the time, the sexual undercurrent of the film was quite daring.  Remember, this was 1958.  The film-going public was used to films about creatures from the sea, mutant ants, and flying saucers.  \\"Horror of Dracula\\" really made people sit up and take notice.  And it still does.  The film also contains one of the most memorable endings in the horror genre.  Not to be missed.
0380715430|1.0|Bill Bryson's book MOTHER TONGUE has an admirable goal, to present the evolution and current state of the English language in a simple and intriguing fashion. However, it is a book full of factual errors. On nearly every page this is an urban myth, folk etymology, or misunderstanding of linguistics.<br /><br />Bryson writes charming travelogues - [[ASIN:0060920084 The Lost Continent]] is a book I'd recommend to any foreigner wanting to learn about rural America - but he is an amateur with an interest in wordplay and not a professional linguist. Much of the book appears to have been thrown together from older books on language for the popular reader, especially those of Otto Jespersen, Mario Pei, and Montagu, which themselves have been criticised for errors and oversimplications.<br /><br />The errors of the book astound from the start any reader with the slighest knowledge of language. Bryson speaks of the Eskimos having a multitude of words for snow, though this urban myth causes linguists to shudder and has been soundly debunked in [[ASIN:0226685349 The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax]]. Bryson goes on to say that Russian has no words for \\"efficiency\\", \\"engagement ring\\", or \\"have fun\\", a preposterous statement that can be proved wrong by any Russian speaker. His knowledge of British history is also shaky, as he asserts that the Saxon invaders eliminated entirely the former Celtic inhabitants, but in reality they merely imposed their language and Britons now remain essentially the same people genetically as 4,000 years ago.<br /><br />Every reader who speaks another language besides English will find a most annoying mistake in THE MOTHER TONGUE. For me, once a speaker of Esperanto, it was Bryson's ridiculous summary of the language. He begins by misspelling the name of the language's initiator. Then he asserts that the language has no definite articles - it does - but then gives a sample of the language in which this definite article he just denied is used twice (and misspelled once).<br /><br />These are only a few examples, the book is filled with multitudes more.<br /><br />While the birth and growth of the English language is a fascinating subject, it's a shame that it is spoiled in MOTHER TONGUE by an abundance of errors. If you are interested about how English got the way it is today, I'd recommend trying another book, one preferably written by someone with a degree in linguistics.se are only a few examples, the book is filled with multitudes more.

B00000K0E5|5.0|GoldenEye is the absolute summit for Bond filmmaking. Pierce Brosnan's debut as 007 singlehandedly revived the series, which had been without a new entry for six years prior. And then, this masterpiece exploded on to the screen. For all those who are curious about this movie, and have never seen it, here's the breakdown:<br />Hero: James Bond, 007 (Pierce Brosnan) - Sent to investigate the theft of a prototype stealth helicopter, that leads him to the theft of a high-tech Russian EMP space weapon, called GoldenEye.<br />Villain: Alec Traveleyan, 006 (Sean Bean) - Bond's former ally and close friend, believed killed in the opening sequence, turns out to be the son of Russian Kossacks, and the head of the Janus group, bent on destroying all electronics in London after robbing it blind.<br />Girl: Natalya Simyonova (Izabella Scorupco) - A computer tech who survives the test of the GoldenEye weapon on it's housing facility, who is rescued from an exploding helicopter by Bond. As they search together for Treveleyan and GoldenEye, romance and longing grow between them.<br />Bad Girl: Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) - An agent of the Janus Group, who works as a pilot and assassin for Treveleyan. She is Bond's first lead into the Janus Group, when she tries to kill him by crushing him between her thighs.<br />Henchmen: General Orumov (Gottfried John), a Russian traitor who steals GoldenEye, and Brois Grishenko (Alan Cumming), a computer genius recruited by Treveleyan to control GoldenEye.<br />Bond's allies: Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), a former-KGB agent and former target of Bond, who sets him up with Janus, and Jack Wade (Joe Don Baker), CIA agent who aids Bond in his mission.<br />    Bond's mission takes him from the French Riviera, to St. Petersburg, Russia, to Cuba, where Treveleyan plans to signal GoldenEye using a satellite dish buried under a lake. <br />     The action/fight sequences are incredible in this movie, such as the thrilling opening airplane divesequence, Bond's sauna encounter with Xenia, the archive escape/tank chase through St. Petersburg, and of course, the final showdown between Bond and Treveleyan at the top of the satellite cradle. <BR>If there was one movie to start viewing the series with, this is it. One certainly not to be missed.
B000063UR2|4.0|Well, I have never found the movie LEGEND to be one of the more satisfying movie experiences in my years of watching films.  Though sporting a beautiful visual style and striking cinematography, I found the story to be very thin and uninteresting.  Regardless of Tim Curry's incredible performance as Darkness, I was never really drawn into the plot in any way what-so-ever!  The electronic score by the pop group Tangerine Dream didn't help matters.  The added songs, which were VERY out of place for a fantasy film of this nature, literally sent me running away never wanting to return.  Such was my experience with director Ridley Scott's fourth screen adventure.  <br />After reading numerous stories about the film being tinkered with by studio executives, I was always a bit curious as to what it would have been like in its original form.  I felt that it was very unfortunate that Jerry Goldsmith, a composer of many beloved movie scores including ALIEN, POLTERGEIST, and several STAR TREK films, would have his score unceremoniously ripped away from the film and replaced with a pop score in an effort to appeal more to the masses.  What would the film be like with his original score intact again?  These were wishful daydreams that I never expected to see happen.  I was wrong.<br />LEGEND Ultimate Edition DVD is a wonderful release that is well worth the money.  Finally, Ridley Scott has been afforded the chance to go back and fix his movie, restoring it to his original vision, along with the original music.  The changes have done wonders for my overall enjoyment of this film.  Firstly, the Goldsmith score immediately helps to draw you into this fantasy world and never lets you go.  The conclusion of the film being set to actual music instead of pop-singing is awesome to say the least!  Twenty-four minutes have been added to the movie, allowing the story to proceed at a more natural pace.  The quick edits designed to get us to the action were painfully obvious in the Americancut of the movie, but here we are allowed to actually get to know the characters and to care for them.  So much more is revealed about the relationship between Jack and Lily instead of simply &quot;telling&quot; us that they are in love like the previous release did.<br />The extended version gives us plenty of additional details, so the opening scroll of the previous edition is wisely avoided this time around.  The audience is smart enough to figure out what is going on in the movie without having to read several paragraphs at the beginning.  This change now lets you feel that you are actually &quot;viewing&quot; the complete story instead of picking up in the middle of it. Now there is no need to be caught up on what exactly is going on before you even get started!<br />Some of the dialogue has been altered too, as well as some of the actual scenes themselves.  Changes have been made to the voice of Darkness' Father when he instructs his son on how to &quot;win&quot; Lily.  The dialogue has been altered to some degree also, and all for the better I might add.  The mood in Darkness' halls is now even more creepy, and the actual seduction of Lily has a more haunting element than before.  Now we actually see several shots of the dark phantom -like face of Darkness, with his glowing green eyes, secretly watching Lily - shots that was pretty much absent from the American cut of the film.  Very eerie!   Also, a wise choice was made to remove the scenes that actually show Darkness at the beginning of the film.  This sequence is now carried out using different camera angles during his conversation with Blix, being careful never to show Darkness himself.  We do not lay eyes on the true face of Darkness until Lily does, and it is so much more effective that way!  Also, the opening dialogue with Darkness at the beginning of the film has been altered.<br />Other scenes have been extended too, including Jack's encounter with the horrific Meg Mucklebones in the swamp.  This sequence was a waste of time in the American version, but here it is very entertaining, with Jack being forced to attempt to sweet talk this ugly monstrosity to save his own skin.  Very entertaining to say the least.  Also included is a scene where Jack must solve a riddle presented by Gump in punishment for the &quot;sin&quot; of revealing the Unicorns to a mortal.  These added sequences make the film more believable in my opinion, as opposed to the all-too-quick pacing of the edited version!<br />Note that there are a couple of scenes that are included in the American Edit that are not in the Director's Cut.  Firstly, there is a lot more kissing between Jack and Lily at the beginning of the film.  This is a good exclusion to make seeing that this works against the image of Lily being the &quot;pure and innocent&quot; victim in the story.  Secondly, there is a scene in which Jack and Gump are attacked by some sort of long clawed dwarf monsters while in the dungeon halls of Darkness' lair.  The scene is only a few seconds long, but did not really serve the story in any way.  Thirdly, the scene in which Gump places the broken horn of the Unicorn back onto its forehead is nowhere to be found.  I find this omission to be very puzzling, seeing that this is a very important element in the conclusion of the story.  The movie does show the two Unicorns together, but the scene of it being restored should have been kept for the Director's Edition of the film.<br />I recommend this DVD to anyone who was ever even remotely interested in this film before.  If you did not like it, give the alternate version presented here a chance.  I don't think you will be disappointed!
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is a great book that I enjoyed very much.  Basically, it is about two friends named George and Lennie who try to live and work in a normal life.  George is short, but very intelligent while Lennie is the opposite; he is tall and strong.  However Lennie also had a mental disability that severely impacted his and George's goal.  Due to the disability, George has to take extra care of Lennie and show him what's right and wrong.  The only thing he couldn't stop was Lennie's love of petting soft things, like animals.  This was a bad thing because Lennie always accidentally kills anything he pets.  This aspect of the disability and the disability in general lead to many difficulties in George's life and many conflicts with the locals.  Of Mice and Men is a book filled with suspense and action that will keep the reader flipping through the pages.<BR>   Despite the magnificence of this novel, it has been banned to due certain reasons that were very controversial.  The constant swearing, violence, and the setting of bad moral to others lead to the banning of this novel.  The swearing starts as early as page 3.  \\"He [George] said angrily,\\" ...  'Jes' a little stretch down the highway...  God damn near four miles...  Didn't wanta stop at the ranch gate, that's what.  Too God damn lazy to pull up.\\"\\"  On this page, notice how the word \\"God damn\\" was used repeatedly.  This word is especially offensive to people who love and respect God, such as devote Christians.  The violence that occurs in Of Mice and Men also got it banned.  The killing of many innocent animals due to Lennie's love of petting soft things is a good example.  Using the theme of weakness of the human mind, Steinbeck sets a morally bad example for other people.  Steinbeck sends a message to the reader saying anything (and I mean ANYTHING) in the world that gets in the way of living a nice, normal life should be eliminated. <BR>   Speaking of worlds, Of Mice and Men is both positive and negative tothe literary world.  It's negative because it sends the reader the bad message that was previously stated above.  On the other hand, the novel is positive to the literary world because it clearly depicts how hard life is when living with a mentally retarded person that must be monitored constantly.  The reader can actually feel the frustration and anger inside of him/her as he/she reads about Lennie doing something stupid again.  I know I did when I read about Lennie continuing to pet a rat that he has already killed.  A lot of respect and recognition should go to the people who have to deal with people such as Lennie.  Also, the novel is positive to the literary world because it's a dang good book.  Don't be fooled by the minute size of the book, it's definitely well worth the time to read.  :)
B00006F83Y|3.0|I enjoy just about all forms of rock, old and new, but, folks, this really ain't new stuff.  While I absolutely love &quot;No One Knows&quot; - in fact, never tiring of it - it borrows from some old school rock like Deep Purple and Led.  Again, some fantastic songs abound, although a few duds fill up space on the album.  (Thank God my CD player quickly skips these tracks and the silly &quot;radio bits&quot; in between songs.)<br />Still, I recommend Songs For the Deaf.  I predict a few of the tunes will grow on me over time.
0375414932|4.0|This is a 500 (or so)-page fictional diary of a man from the start of his adult life to his death, containing imprints of his experiences in England, continental Europe, America, Africa and France. The big insight you get out of this: how much you lack control over your life. When you're young, you have optimistic thoughts of the future, unduly intensely colored, as such thoughts are, by the influence of hormones and the camaraderie of youthful friends. Little do you know (and even less can you control) what lies ahead.    Logan Mounstuart graduated from Oxford determined to be a writer and to write books of consequence. Then, his lover spurned an offer of marriage, his subsequent marriage fell apart, he found temporary happiness in a second marriage but was sent off to fight in WWII, during which he ended up in solitary confinement for two years. As he rotted in Swiss prison, nursing an insect farm to keep himself from going nuts, his wife, notified that he was dead, remarried and then was killed in an explosion. He received hints that the assignment that landed him in solitary confinement was a set-up engineered by a Duke who had it in for him. He came back and attempted to carry on, but he was never able to build up to a cadence.     After several twists, which included overseeing an art gallery as the urge/ability to write slowly petered away, a marriage to an American lawyer, a sexual relationship with an underage woman, sinking into such desperate poverty that he had to turn to eating dog food, a stint teaching in Africa, he ended up broke and mostly alone in France, where he died.     In this \\"diary\\" is the story of a person whose life was controlled by events outside his control. There is something about British fiction in particular that I love - it assumes the essential \\"losership\\" of humanity and then queries what a person can eke out despite this. In other words, the Big Issue is resolved: The world is emphatically not your oyster. Ultimately, you (or humanity) won't amount to much -- but more importantly, pen-ultimately, you (the person) are beaten. Life and its accidents will likely \\"get\\" to you, whether or not you plan otherwise. There is general truth to the notion that most of what you can achieve is out of your control.     Now that you know this, how do you live your life - what do you do with this depressing information? I find the answers to this question eternally fascinating. Anyone with a similar bent will like this book.    However, I should note that while the portrait of life led by LMS is neither pretty nor optimistic, it doesn't leaving you wallowing in negativity or pessimism either: If you accept the premise that much of life is determined by chance/accident, then achieving what LMS did -- writing a few books, teaching, having some adventures, occasionally getting intensely close to a lover -- is not so shabby a set of achievements.

0316548189|4.0|Going into Long Walk to Freedom,  I was skeptical about the possibility of actually enjoying a 600 page auto-biography about South African politics.  After a while though, I actually began to enjoy it as the story drew me in and actually made me feel as if i was a part of history. The book made me realize that Nelson's story isn't one of bland politics, but of the struggle for freedom that goes on all around the world. Before i read this book i new nothing of what happened along Nelson Mandela's rode to freedom, but this book showed me all of the highs, and lows of his life. It described the protests and rallys, heated debates, betrayal, and a life in prison. All of which were quite exciting.  What really made me enjoy this book though, was the hope that it can bring to the world. When someone reads this book, they realize something important about freedom and equality, and it brings us one step closer to our dreams of peace. Long Walk to Freedom shows us that the seemingly impossible can be achieved, but it isnt an easy task. While the book as a whole was good, it did, however, have some downfalls.<br />While most of this book kept me on my toes most of the time, there were several portions of it durring which i found myself dozing off. This book IS a story of politics, and because of this can grind along at an extremely slow pace at times. Also, i found myslef reading what seemed like the same thing over and over again in this book, which was basically : the africans make  a protest/move for peace, and then the government puts it down etc. etc. While i realize that this is what actually happened, that doesn't mean that it's interesting.<br />Overall, i would recomend this bok to anyone who is interested in a true account of a man that shaped the world. I would say that most anyone could pick this book up and start enjoying it, but if you cant take a little boredom, than you might want to think twice.
B000002UAO|3.0|As I put this CD into my car player, I eagerly anticipated hearing the music that would take me back to the fall of 1965, when this became my all-time favorite Beatles album, and remained so, even after Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, White Album, Let it Be, et al., came out.<BR>Expecting it to start out, as the original did, with \\"I've just <BR>Seen a Face,\\" I was startled to hear \\"Drive My Car\\"! Was I really so old that I had misremembered that that song came out later? NO! It has been added! I like that song, but it doesn't fit the overall totality that the Rubber Soul songs add(ed) up to. Nor does \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and certainly not the flat and inferior \\"What Goes On.\\"<BR>And though I love \\"Nowhere Man,\\" again, that's \\"Yellow Submarine\\" stuff, not Rubber Soul. Why put it here?<BR>And if it isn't bad enough that the original \\"weave\\" was disrupted by those songs' inclusion, what's worse is that two of the best, \\"It's Only Love\\" ( a magnificent piece, intelligently written and beautifully sung by John, with harmonies from Paul) <BR>and the aforementioned \\"I've just Seen a Face\\" were left off!!!<BR>It's like taking the \\"White Album\\" and slipping \\"Doctor Robert\\" and \\"Act Naturally\\" in the place of \\"Julia\\" and \\"Blackbird.\\"<BR>(Or, putting a scene from Romeo and Juliet into Hamlet!)<BR>They don't fit -- and the album experience I looked forward to is NOT what I got. I just don't understand why they tampered with the original this way! <BR>It's still worth buying, but don't expect that '65 experience. That's why I gave it three stars instead of five! <BR>From: Puzzled in Raleigh
B000060P79|5.0|This is a really good cd, and the only reason people dont like them is because they're too \\"soft\\"- if youre into really hardcore stuff, you're not gonna like this,...the cd's really good...i really recommend it, because every song but one is good, and i dont think it gets old at all.
B00008OWZC|5.0|If you like Led Zeppelin, then you will love this CD.  The audio quality is amazing for being recorded in the 70's.  The Track selection is great.  Dazed and Confused will blow your mind and so will Since I've Been Lovin You and Going to California.  If you like Zeppelin at all, or even if you don't, buy this album right now!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD without knowing anything about the group or the Daredevil sound track. What a wonderful suprise! The music is outstanding and topped off with perhaps one of the best female vocals in rock n roll. In my opinion the group is extremely tanlented. I can't wait until their next release!
B00008OWZC|5.0|I cannot believe I am the first person to express my opinion on this absolutely amazing live recording.  To start with anything you may have read about this piece of music is absolutely true. I have never been privileged to hear what I consider to be the most astounding &quot;live&quot; recording ever issued.  I never saw Led Zeppelin perform live in their heyday but after absorbing this effort I am able to feel the impact they must have thrust upon the listener.  This is hard rock at its absolute finest.  And every instrument can be heard most distinctly.  Of course you have the thunder of John Bonham's drums, the masterful playing of Jimmy Page, the steady thump of John Paul Jones's bass and of course the most distinctive voice of Robert Plant.  Anyone who remembers those great artists from the seventies should purchase this outstanding recording.  It is both breathtaking and astoundingly beautiful.  A true testiminial as to what rock once was and may not ever be again.
B000084T18|5.0|When listening to rap music you cant be close minded and only see it for what you hear.  50 cent has his own story and he tells it through his rhymes and his style.  His way of putting the lines together create a very unique style and one that no one else has yet to muster.  If you think he is just another rapper tlaking about guns, and death, and murder, then you really haven't listened to the album and heard his story.  The reviews that say his music is jsut like all the others... well you surely aren't a true hip hop fan and should stick to country music, cus you don't know music when you hear it, 10 million sold... CAN YOU ARGUE!
B00008PX8P|5.0|As Robert explains in an interview, the band did not release singles because they felt  it was important to take a look at <BR>the complete work of a band at that moment and that was only evident by listening to a complete album.<br />Well I will say that you cannot understand the impact and fury of the sonic force known as Led Zeppelin unless you see and hear the experience live.

B00003CXFV|4.0|The 2000 film \\"Erin Brockovich\\" is named for the woman whom this true-life story is about.  Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was an unemployed, poorly educated, single, twice-divorced mother of 3 young children trying to find work to make ends meet.  Following a car accident, her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), was unable to win her lawsuit against the other driver in part due to Erin's irascible and antagonistic demeanor.  Frustrated, Erin storms into Ed's office following the trial and demands a job from him.  He reluctantly hires her and sets her to work on a seemingly simple real-estate deal, but the deal is anything but simple as medical records of the involved homeowners are included in the file.  As Erin investigates, she meets the homeowners, Pete and Donna Jensen (Michael Harney and Marg Helgenberger respectively), who have been repeatedly sick for a long time, as well as their children.  The potential buyer is not an individual, but a major corporation that has an industrial plant very close to the couple's home.  Erin's investigation leads her to some potentially damaging information about the corporation's doings near the Jensen's home that has also affected many more people within the immediate area.<br />Though the story about sick homeowners and corporate doings is powerful and thought provoking, the time in the film devoted to Erin's homelife is far less compelling in part because of Julia Roberts' acting.  Julia Roberts earned the Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Erin Brockovich, but that was probably due more to the politics surrounding the film rather than the quality of actual acting.  The film was also nominated for four other Oscars including Best Supporting Actor (Albert Finney), Best Director (Steven Soderbergh), Best Picture and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  Other notable actors in the film include Aaron Eckhart as Erin's unemployed biker boyfriend George and the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo as a waitress.<br />Overall, for its engaging story about sickened residents in a small community but less than stellar acting, I rate \\"Erin Brockovich\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  If you have never seen the film, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.
0140277447|5.0|It is a great book about what happened in Nanking in December 1937. The author presents facts without any exageration. It is very sad that the Nanking Massacre has been largely forgotten in the west. I keep asking myself why? Is that because the victims of the Massacre were Chinese instead of the westerners? The number of 300,000 victims was calculated by International Military Court (Far East) not by the Comunist Chinese as some of the readers might believe like the reader from Arlington. At that time, it was the Natioinalist Kuomingtang that governed China. Again the reader from Arlington said \\"There were independant international journalists present during that time. Why didnt any of them report this alleged atrocity?\\" I referred other readers who want to find out the truth to read an eyewitness report \\"All Captives Slain\\" from then New York Times reporter, F. Tillman. This article could be found in Modern History Soursebook. Even the Germans helped the Nanking citizens at that time. A German business man and Nazi party member, John Rabe, rescued thousands of Chinese from the atrocity of the Japanese army. Detailed information could be found in Rabe Diary. <br />As a freelance interpreter, I went to Nanking with Finnish Broadcasting Company in 1998 to interview two survivors of the Nanking Massacre, between them was the woman whose story was recounted in Iris's book. Though at that time, almost 60 years passed, I could still clearly see the scars left on Madame Li's face by the bayonet used by the Japanese soldiers. <br />It is time to put aside racism and face the truth. Holocaust shouldn't be recognized only in connection with who the victim is. Victims of all color have the equal right to be recognized. No life of a certain group of people is more important than that of another group.

In an era where any cause can be enobled by the shifting of focus to children, this movie is a wonderfully putrid antidote.<BR>   While the Saddam Hussein incidents raise hilarious parallels to our recent un-needed war with Iraq, truly consider this film in the time when it was released, not in the \\"post-9/11 world\\".<BR>   Example:  Blame shifting during the Blame Canada number: a stark ccondemnation of this country's wonderful ability to pass the buck concerning the actions that our youths take.  If those discordant voices remind you of the great blame debate after the Columbine incident, it is most likely good that you are seeing this film, for in its obscene art, it shows us how we can sometimes be:  evasive, unreachable, irresponsible:  The mothers who want their children to grow in a \\"smut free environment\\", start the third world war (in which they never place themselves at risk) to make the world safe for sensitive American children.<BR>    <BR>   A cautionary tale:  Censorship and labeling of things as evil are generally opposed by enlightened people---until their children's innocence is threatened.
B000089RVX|3.0|When I heard Bring Me to Life for the first time I loved it. The day &quot;Fallen&quot; came out, I rushed to the store and bought it, expecting a great record. Unfortunately, one listen was enough to tell me that although Amy Lee's voice is beautifully haunting, the song's aren't quite up to her potential. Basically, the songs would be great as singles, but when they're all together on one CD it's like hearing different variations of the same song over...and over...and over, with the exception of &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;, which are both beautiful piano/vocal/strings arrangements. But then, looking at what I just wrote, I see that those songs are similar, musically, but to a lesser extent than that of the rest of the songs. I don't regret buying the CD - I do enjoy a listen every now and then, and Amy Lee really does make you wish you had her talent with piano and vocals - I just think Evanescence has the potential to be better than this.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This Led Zep live CD set is way better than their previous live release \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", which sounded terrible in my opinion.  First, \\"How The West Was Won\\" is a much more complete representation of a full Led Zeppelin concert.  Second, the song selection is awesome!  And third, the sound production is superb!  This is a no brainer purchase for anyone remotely interested in the music of Led Zeppelin, even if you're just a casual fan.  I can honestly say that this is now my favorite Zeppelin recording after listening to it several times now.  GO BUY IT!!!  NOW!!!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Sometimes I just crave rock, good rock, legendary rock... and here it is. Enjoy!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I think I saw Led Zepplein in Charlotte NC.  Just not real sure.  This double disk set is a piece of rock and roll history.  <br />Caution: this ain't no Carpenter's kinda' music.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I doubt that any other Music DVD will ever come close to this masterpiece unless it's by YES. Everything is perfect ( cameras, sound, etc ). <br />Yes is one band that \\"gets better with age \\" unlike some of the other older groups that now sound horrible.<br />GET THIS DVD IF YOU ARE A YES FAN , GET IT GET IT GET IT
B00005JL96|5.0|Disney has had a slump since lion king. Emperors was good but Lilo and Stitch was amazing. For all you people who gavce it 1 star reviews maybe you should loosen up and come into the 21st century. I'm not a sadistic kid or anything. I'm a devoted christian that leads a highschool youth group. Lilo and stitch had some silly points and maybe some slightly mean one but no ones perfect. I'm sure you one star people aren't by any means. Another thing for you \\"Disney's Family Values people\\". LIFE ISN'T ALL HAPPY!!! Stop whining. It had no plot fine... but look at things like monty python. It's an awesome movie and it couldn't have less plot. Or even that Spongebob Squarepants show... I mean I hate it but kids love it or even Veggietales. Not everything has to have a plot. Also you people who were like \\"I can't believe other people liked it\\", who are you to judge?! People have their own opinions. If your close minded then fine Lilo and Stitch isn't for you but I loved it and I thought using the Elvis theme was excellent. If I could, I'd tell you all this in person too. Also this movie is nowhere near PG-13. There is no blood, no bad words, no bad themes. Also for those of you who called Nani abusive she's not. She's just an older sister and that's how they show affection. Again Lilo and Stitch is a great movie about a cute alien and a even cuter little girl. They meet, have fun, and are completely compatible. What more do you need? =0) Have a nice day!
0316548189|4.0|At first glance, \\"The Long Walk To Freedom\\", the autobiography of Nelson Mandela, is very intimidating. The book is as thick as the bible and it's bold title made me want to run far away from it and never return. Upon receiving the book, I thought to myself, \\"HOW AM I GOING TO READ THIS?!\\" That night, the book sat alone on my kitchen table across from me. I stared menacingly at it. In a rush of adrenaline, I grabbed the book and ripped open the cover. Slowly I began to read. One page, two pages, pretty soon I had read ten WHOLE pages! Surprisingly, the book wasn't frightening at all! It was very interesting and more story-like than I had imagined. The author does a great job of enticing the reader while teaching us about Nelson's life. I got to learn a lot about political South Africa while also getting a glimpse into Nelson's personal life every once in a while.  Nelson was not truly a stern political leader, in fact he was quite lighthearted. The book reveals this through a few comical stories and touching moments in Nelson's long life. It successfully ties factual yet personal information into a great story that should be read by anyone who enjoys good, thick books.
6305508550|4.0|One of those films that gets better with each viewing. The first three-quarters of the film are excellent and worth 5 stars, though for me the last part of the film is not nearly as good. If you like this movie then I strongly recommend you check out a British TV series called 'The Office' which is fantastic. Only available in the UK so you'll need a muti-system DVD player and TV but well worth watching.

B00004T8RK|1.0|I love Pearl Jam but this one is enough to make me lose faith.
B0000029DD|5.0|As I write this six years to the day that Jeff Buckley drowned in the Wolf River, I can never quite get over how great a loss he was to music, and to musical intergrity. It also seems a shame that so many people - even great music lovers -  never got to see the man perform, or completely fulfill his awesome potential.<br />Buckley was quite simply one of the greatest rock vocalists of all time, and also a marvellous songwriter and guitarist. <BR>As for 'Grace', I'll never forget the first time I heard it and many years on it still sounds just as fresh, rich and exciting. 'Last Goodbye' demonstrated his genius for writing classic pop tunes instilled with passion and heart, while the Leonard Cohen 'Hallelujah' is breathtaking in it's vocal delivery. 'Lover, you should have come over' is one of many magical moments, especially as Jeff soars mesmerisingly to &quot;she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever&quot;. There is no real weak point to the album, aside from the 'hedge-trimmer' interlude in 'So Real'. Even geniuses aren't perfect. <br />Just one slight qualm.. if any of you have ever heard 'Forget Her', a song that Jeff omitted from the the final album edit at the 11th hour, you'll be sad that one of his greatest ever songs was never released. But hey, in ten songs on 'Grace' he achieved what few artists fail to achieve in a lifetime. So we'll let him off. <br />Happy anniversary Jeff...and thanks for the music.
0425173755|4.0|I have read this book when i was very young. It was just for fun then. I read this book when i'm 24 now, for fun again. But it is very different feeling i have between when i read this book when i was a kid and i read this in the age of 24.<BR>this book is mystery. And I think this book deserves to be called the 'Mystery'' There are several passengers in an unusually crowded oriental express train. Somebody is killed in the train. There seems nobody came into the train. It means the murderer is still in the train! Let's see how Mr.Poirott, the detective, finds the murderer. And be a detective yourself, too.
B000068TPN|3.0|The Japanese gentleman below is quite correct. Those who are not American, or who are not rabidly pro-American, might not like everything about this film, especially given the current political climate. There is a great deal of \\"gung-ho\\" in this film, which is absent from, say, Platoon. In fact, this is possibly the first serious Vietnam film since Green Berets not to hold a left-wing p.o.v. Thos who accused Black Hawk Down of being incrediblyt pro-American haven't seen We Were Soldiers! <br />Although the film ostensibly shows both sides of the conflict (unlike BHD), it really doesn't show the Vietnamese point of view, except to depict them as essentially like the Americans; which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it seems forced. A film like Black Hawk Down is, to me, much less discomfiting; it does not pretend to show both sides, and can therefore concentrate on other matters.<br />However, I would diasagree that this film is unrealistic in its depiction of combat. That was what war was like. The North Vietnamese might go down pretty easily, but that is becayse of America's superior technilogy. The body count really was that high!<BR>Besides, Americans are going down all the time, too, and at a tremendous rate.<BR>Not too sure about the close range of combat - that strikes me as a little dodgy, especially as the battle essentially takes place on an open field. I thought combat firefights were generally at 50 - 200 yards' range.<br />The combat in this film is undoubtedly superb. The platoon tactics and ambuscades etc., as well as airstrikes, helicopter missions and so on, are depict3ed with loving accuracy. I thought many of thge more spectacular shots were CGI enhanced, but no - even the cyclonic napalm attacks are 100% real! The uniforms are also very realistic. <br />Despite its gung-ho sensibilities, this film definitely does NOT glorify war. That should be made plain. The film is pretty much as anti-war as Platoon. The wounded men really look wounded; andsome of the wounds are hideous indeed. Also, somehow the lack of a \\"Private Ryanish\\" grittiness to the film image somehow makes the carnage look worse. The litter and debris among the corpses really show how desperatr the fighting was in this battle - and how concentrated the fighting was, too.<br />However, there are downsides to this film. The dialogue is forced, and often plays on sympathies that audiences might not share. There is much forced emotion in this film. The film lacks some coherence, and the pacing is far from perfect. Often there is a sense of repetition in the combat, taking away from the adrenaline rush. Also, the story of life back home seems emotionally forced too, lacking any grit.<br />The lack of grit to the characters is possibly due to many of the characters' still being alive in real life. Given defamation laws, it isn't really possible to depict them with any flaws. Unfortunately, this makes even Hal Moore a little too perfect, a little unmemorable. The only character with any nasty traits that I remember is the guy who shouted at Snake (?) and nearly had a gunfight with him. He isn't even named.<br />Incidentally, one reason why this film lacks the angst of most Vietnam films is that it is a battle between regulars.  In the early stages of the Vietnam War, it was still a war of volunteers. Hence there are no guerillas or burning villages here. We Were Soldiers presents the point of view of a regular soldier, whereas Platoon presents the story of conscripts v guerillas.
B00005JMC6|5.0|I haven't seen the DVD but saw the film in Christchurch in February.  I started crying 3 minutes into the film and the man next to me started 5 minutes into the film.  The waterworks continued throughout the film.<br />I have been waiting since February for this film to be shown in the US.  If it shows up within 60 miles of my home, I will be there with any of my the friends that trust my movie judgement.  I will buy the DVD ASAP (and I only own 4 DVDs).  The book is nice, but it is easier to read after seeing the film, due to the the multiple languages.
B000002MNL|4.0|This was the first Morrissey solo album I got. I bought it on the strength of hearing one song &quot;why don't you find out for yourself&quot;. This is a class track and it still remains my favourite on the album. I can't believe that a song as musical and with such great lyrics doesnt get more airplay.<br />There are other excellent tracks including &quot;Now my heart is full&quot; and the epic &quot;speedway&quot;. I have been really impressed with this album, probably the first of many for me. Give it a go!
B0000029DD|5.0|i would give this 10 stars. This is my all-time favortie album and all-time favorite music artist, Jeff Buckley. There's something so amazing and beautiful about the way he sings, he's pouring out his soul on this album, letting you experience what he's feeling. Even though we don't know Jeff Buckley personally, you feel you do, by the songs, there's this connection. \\"Mojo Pin\\" is the first track, and it remends me of how this is the first song on the album, the part when it starts out \\"ooooooohhh\\" its introducing you what's coming up,that the story is just starting, there's something more magical coming ahead . \\"Mojo Pin\\", his voice sounds so incredible on it. \\"Grace\\" just gives you chills, like it feels like that's how death will really be like. \\"Last Goodbye\\" is just great, I can never get tired of that song, the end is especially great, that's my favorite part when he goes \\" did you say, no this can't happen to me..\\" The guitar is the beginning is great.<BR>\\"So Real\\" is great. \\"Hallelujah\\" is such an amazing love song,it has a deeper message behind it and its the real thing, real love. \\"Lover, you should've come over\\" is my personal favorite, it breaks your heart, makes you want to break down and cry. I've never heard any other artist like him who can change how you feel and make you feel so good and sad at the same time. I think he's the artist of the 90's, he's the best thing since, well, nothing really in my opinion.There is no 'since'. I will always have a big spot for Jeff in my heart, I love him. If you haven't heard this cd, trust me go out and buy it now! It will move you.
B000026HWR|5.0|This was my first taste of Mr Terry Callier. I remember putting the CD on and being mesmorised for nearly 9 minutes listened to the majestic 'Dancing Girl'. This is a truly epic piece of music which takes you on a musical journey into the sublime. The CD is worth buying just for this one track.<br />Then comes another Terry Callier classic 'What Color is Love'. These two tracks have become 2 of Terry's most played during his musical pilgrimage around the world. <br />This man is a true talent, buy this CD and try to go and see him live. This CD will never leave your collection
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love this movie! I thought the twist of the movie was great by having the monsters fear the children! So adorable and funny..my nieces and nephew love it too...(Originally bought it for them to watch and I watch it more than they do..)
B00005UWBQ|3.0|No really good. Kinda boring at times. Alright with good thrills. Score: 73/100
B00005RIKD|5.0|I absolutely love this cd...great compliation of many great hits...I listen to it all the time!
B00003CXXR|5.0|Entertaining with cool special effects. Funny. Better than Lost World. Score: 97/100 A+
B00008PX8P|4.0|The DVD and accompanying CD releases are EXCELLENT. Crisp video and audio, excellent engineering. I 'm so grateful and excited that this material is finally being released after being on the bootleg market for YEARS! And that's my only complaint, why not release ALL of the Danish Television show? I have own a copy and the entire show is AWESOME. Why only the one Australia track when there are THREE tracks in existence. Why only partials of great shows when bootleggers and collectors have the entire performances? Collectors usually fall into two categories, completists or selective. Completists want everything, regardless of quality. Selective want the best available, usually from each tour . Page and Co. could release documentation of  each tour every nine months, naming each release as Volume 1, 2, etc. By releasing portions of shows, they are only making the bootlegs more valuable and sought after. I know there are many Zep fans that do not have acess to the bootlegs so I truly do appreciate this release. There is no need for the overkill of Pearl Jam releasing all their shows from a few years ago as pseudo bootlegs, but a more cohesive output would have gone a long way towards pleasing everyone and making $ for the Zep. This really applies to all artists who get bootlegged. Release one live CD of an entire show and you will reduce bootlegging. Do an initial release of a new CD and include a limited edition second DC with out-takes or unreleased tracks. Or do a mail in for the second DC so you can track the buying habits of your fans. For more established artist (you hearing me Neil Young?) release one CD of each tour every year, not a partial like your Silver &amp; Gold DVD.  OK, this soapbox is starting to collapse. In conclusion, I will hang on to my bootlegs as well as this release. A huge THANKS to the Zep for putting out this great material for all to enjoy.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Great movie for anybody 2 see. Clever and funny. Score: 100/100
B00000099Y|5.0|Emotion. Depth. Character. This Album has it all. This album really shows what this band is capable of. Everysong is a different sound, a different feel. Until this album I thought all songs should be 3 mins long and that's it (I still believe in this therory for a lot of music out there though). I never would have thought that I would listen to an 11 minute long song, and have it be my farvorite song. Period. (My favorite song is Push it by the way.)<br />The best part is that every song defies classification. The first song, Stinkfist, has soft mellow vocals, power ballad guitar work and heavy hitting percussion. It equates to a sound that grabs you no matter what mood you are in. The album itself has this very feel. It's heavy, driven, controlled, random, smooth and powerful. This album is amazing. <br />If you are looking to experience music instead of listen to it, it's time to get this album. If you are already a Tool fan...well then you have the album and know what I'm talking about.<br />I also recommend picking up Tool's Lateralus with this one. They complement each other wonderfully.
B00003CX8I|4.0|Lots of fun and a surprise around every corner! Cool special effects and funny! Score: 95/100
B00005QAPH|5.0|The first time I saw 8 1/2, I grasped bits of its structure but didn't really understand it. It challenges you to understand it. Then I listened to the commentary track, and everything fell in place, more or less. <br />The story, if we can say there is one, follows Guido, a movie director, staying at a health spa while trying to organize his next movie. His problem is that he has no idea what the movie is about, nor does he know what he is doing. Everything in his life lacks balance and he cannot admit the truth to himself or others, so he looks inwards to try to find answers, while being hounded by disgruntled actresses and journalists. <br />8 1/2 has a multitude of narrative levels, even its own critic. At a first viewing, you have an utter but &quot;Beautiful Confusion&quot;, as the movie was first supposed to be called. But there *is* a method to this madness, and if you are very patient and have the DVD commentary track, you can understand it, I promise you. I think I managed that, but it's difficult (I don't want to give it away, however tempting it is). There is a reason why it's called an art students' favourite. <br />Contrarily to what some ignorant critics have said, 8 1/2 is not about creativity or making a movie or somesuch nonsense. There is strictly no movie-making in this movie, as Guido has no screenplay, and no idea where he is going. Trying to explain this movie cannot be done, unless you simply tell the truth - that it is an exploration of Fellini's psyche and problems. The movie itself feels more like a sustained emotion than a movie, because we are basically exploring one gigantic theme, and we just don't know it. It is not an easy movie to watch emotionally or to remember, because the storyline is fragmentary. It's more like a dream than an actual story. <br />From the opening dream scene of Guido trapped in a car, to the bath house (the most inspired scene I've ever seen), to the unfinished spaceship structure, 8 1/2's style is the equal ofits content. This is a beautiful movie to look at, and its black-and-white cinematography is not only great, I didn't even notice it was black-and-white unless a commentator mentioned it !
0425173755|4.0|This book is writing by the British Agatha Christie, who is a very fascinate writer, in short this book talked about a bunch of people who are worried because someone died in the Orient Express, so they have a detective who's name is Hercules Poirot, he is trying to find who is the murder, because the tragedy occur inside of this train. Everyone was with a lot of mystery and at the same time nervous, in the beginning, they found so many things like a kimono, cigarrete, handkerchief, and things like that, but the weird thing was that everyone was a suspect. In the end, the detective investigated all the truth, nobody can imagine the end because is fascinate, the end of this book has a lot of mystery, I really love this book, if you like drama, this is the perfect book for you, and also can keep you awake all night. When you started to read this book, I can promise you that you can't stop. Just read it and then you can see what I talking about.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I don't have a whole lot to say. This is one excellent CD. It's all the live songs I've always wanted but could never get. The song selection is fantastic. Jimmy Page is superb and Robert Plant does a whole lot more singing than on Song Remains the Same. Bohnam is incredible on Moby Dick. Buy the CD. You won't be disappointed.
B00008OWZC|5.0|It is aggravating what this release has done to me. A child of the 80's and 90's, chances are that I will never see Zeppelin live. This album makes me sorely wish otherwise. I've listened to live albums before, and I've listened to and own all of the Zeppelin studio recordings. This collection is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The moans and deep, exotic rifts during disc 2's 25 minute rendition of Dazed and Confused are enthralling and mesmerizing. I cannot stress enough how imperitive it is for any Zeppelin fan to buy this album. Not only can I truly test the limits of my sound system, but it is as close as I can get to hearing them live. I say this even having seen the excellent Led cover band Zoso.<br />If only I could have grown up in the 60's...
B00008PX8P|5.0|I just barely got this, and it is phenomenal.  Disc One is from their earlier years, the Led Zeppelin I through Led Zeppelin III era.  The second disc covers the rest of their career.  Along with the Royal Albert Hall, Madison Square Garden, Earls Court, and Knebworth concerts there are extras too.  Promos, interviews, a whole mess of stuff.  There are also songs from Coda on the first Disc, including White Summer, We're Gonna Groove, and Bring It On Home, plus the BBC Session's C'mon Everybody and Something Else.  There is also a promo with Travelling Riverside Blues.  The second disc combines great songs from Physical Graffiti, Presence, In Through The Out Door, and Led Zeppelin IV.  My favorite concert section is the Earls Court section which includes acoustic songs of Going To California, That's The Way, nad Bron Yr Aur Stomp.  Overall if you buy this you get songs from every period and style of their music.  Nothing bad to say about it.  If you are someone that enjoyed The BBC Sessions, The Song Remains The Same, or any concerts they have been to, you will love this DVD.
0316548189|3.0|It is tough to say whether or not Nelson Mandela's &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot; was a good book. It is mostly based on historical fact and lacks the intimate personal feelings that one would expect from an autobiography. Some chapters seemed to fly by while others were tedious to get through. It is probably not a book that I would have read on my own time (I was assigned to read it in school). I probably would recommend this book to people who have a strong interest in South African History (particularly in Mandela's sturggle towards freedom). Although he does a good job at explaining all the political organizations, I still found it difficult to keep them all straight. <BR>Overall, this was an &quot;ok&quot; book, but nothing extraordinary.
B000002I25|5.0|A dark poetic masterpiece of raw energy.Jim Morrison invented the modern rock star, and this is him at his best. A primal growl of dark poetic mastery. Morrison looks death in the eye and pulls the listener along for the ride.
0316548189|3.0|It is tough to say whether or not Nelson Mandela's &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot; is a good book. <BR>It is mostly based on historical fact and lacks the intimate personal feelings that one would expect from an autobiography. I would say that about one eighth of the book is Nelson truely telling the story of his life, and the other seven eighths is Nelson throwing out political terminology. Although he did a good job at explaining all the different political terms and organizations, I still found it difficult to keep them all straight. My favorite parts of the book were the parts where Nelson told the reader about his family life and his attempts to find and equilibrium between being a father to his country/people and being a father to his children. <BR>Had I not been assigned to read this book for school, I probably never would have picked it up and been exposed to  the South African culture and history. I definately do not regret reading it but I do think that it could have been a couple hundred pages shorter.<BR>I probably would recommend this book to people who have a strong interest in South African history (particularly in Mandela's struggle towards freedom). <BR>Overall, this was an &quot;ok&quot; book, but nothing extraordinary.
B0000024ZT|5.0|This is where it all started, raw, hungry, and always entertaing. Bruce proves that he has alot to say about America and it's seedy underside of kids and trouble and growing up.
B00008OWZC|5.0|The new three CD compilation &quot; How The West Was Won&quot;,is simply outstanding. Recorded during the band's 1972 tour in Southern California clearly expresses the musicality of the great foursome.One can sense the complete confidenceand wilingness to experiment withoutregard of the outcome. I recommend thisCD especially for those people who didnot experience LEP live. It is the REALDEAL my friends.
B00005JKPF|4.0|This movie rules! It's way cooler than daredevil, which was too dark and violent, and it is much better than the Matrix Reloaded.<BR>First of all, the movie HAS a storyline. The Matrix movies are only made so that they can show you the action scenes, but the story is poor and imitated.<BR>While Daredevil was violent and had a heavy rock sounftrack, X2 had a good theme and an extraordinary plot.<BR>I think the movie is based too much on evolution, it exagerates. After all, evolution is just a theory.<br />But this is, along with Spider-Man, THE MOVIE. I've never seen a superhero movie that good!<BR>If you didn't see it, why are you wasting your time reading this? Go now!!!!!
B00005A46T|5.0|My best friend tried to get me to like their first album, and the only song that caught my attention was \\"spit it out\\", it took this album to sell me on this band. People can bash them all they want, but all I have to say is, yes it has been done before, but they do have their own sound, they certainly weren't the founders of masks on stage neither was gwar, I think that concept goes way back into the late 70's early 80's with alot of bands. I love gwar too!! I don't judge this band though on the singers opinions. Anyway, I have noticed one thing when it comes to masked/make-up bands, its seems every time there is a new one, people seem to have a love hate relationship for them, and easily coin them as unoriginal, so they ware makeup/mask big deal, they still kick [*] and put on a good show. Also recommend their DVD: Disasterpieces
B000000WJZ|5.0|this cd really cooks.  the sounds on the songs are just incredible and the passion is unmatched by SP on any other release that they will come up with.  The songs have a great catch to them, and SPACEBOY is just icing to a great cake.  This is worth anyones time and money.
0385504209|5.0|I was unable to put this book down.  It was one of the most enjoyable reads I have had in a long time.  Dan Brown has been able to weave an fast paced, intelligent, entertaining story.  Pure fun.
B000001DTM|5.0|This cd is emotional, even for U2. It is the first hair line cracks in their christain faith.  They start to question and start to experiement.  And it shows, it is not the total experimentation that went with dance groov POP, but the beginning of U2's mind and thought patterns as rich wealthy rock stars starting to put out thoughts on recordings, and the results are fantastic.  WHO IS GOING TO RIDE YOUR WILD HORSES is a fantatsic song for any band, any era.  quite a cd.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Don't walk, run to get this movie.  If you like the Matrix, you'll love this.  It's twice as good.  I started to write a review and it was turning into a small book so I've decided to go with the \\"less is more\\" approach and simply say that this movie is amazing.  It makes no sense that this wasn't a major blockbuster.  It's the best sci-fi film since Aliens.  GET THIS FILM NOW!!!
B000001FS3|5.0|The cd before this, is where I picked up on u2, the unforgettable fire.  While TUF was a great CD and while I was in high school I quite enjoyed it.. I was not prepared for the power of TJT.  this cd hit the stores while I was in college and everyone EVERYONE was knocked off guard.  I think everyone I knew had a copy or two.  Every song was powerful and well put together and established u2 as the act of the 80s.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is just awesome!  At first I wasn't sure about it, not really liking female lead vocals, but this CD totally changed my mind!  It's incredible and would highly recommend!
B000000W5L|5.0|RIP THIS JOINT/VENTALATOR BLUES/SOUL SURVIVER are just three songs that will make you love the stones forever.  some say they wished the stones never made anything AFTER this recording, but that is all flap chap, the fact is, this is the best stones ever.  And the songs, all of them (Sweet Virginia, Tumbling Dice) just are treats.  A MUST HAVE.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|UFO with Michael Schenker was one of the best (if not the best) melodic hard rock bands to come out of the U.K. in the 1970s. While their studio albums with Schenker were really good (especially \\"Force It\\" which kicked ... from point A to point Z), taken in a concert setting, the very best tunes from that era simply blow away the studio renditions. Check out the soaring guitar solos in \\"Let It Roll\\" and \\"Rock Bottom.\\" Also, Phil Mogg (the lead vocalist and primary lyricist) never really gets his due and that's a shame because the man has one of the most expressive and melodic voices in English hard rock. He SINGS without screaming, a la Rob Halford. This is required listening for fans of 1970s hard rock. Unbelievable.
B0000028M7|5.0|Rooster/angry chair/would?  this is the pinnacle of this band, and a high point in lows it is.  The pain and the agony detailed in Layne Stanleys voice over the bulldozer grunge of Jerry Cantrells guitars is just something of a testament to the early 90s hard rock, and this is a great example.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is truly a gift from the gods---Led Zeppelin live, in color, in power-packed full DTS sound!  I bought this DVD and watched a couple of hours for the first time last night.  I went straight to the 2nd disk since it contains many of my all-time Zeppelin favorites from Physical Graffiti.  I've seen Robert Plant in concert five times, of which only one time was with Jimmy Page, but was too young to have ever seen Led Zeppelin.  This DVD in my mind has captured the essential concert experiences spanning the band's history-making decade of music that will forever remain unparalleled and unmatched.<br />Consisting of primarily concert footage (none of the imagery found on that 'other' DVD), this DVD will take you front and center to some of what had to be their best performances.  I found myself in awe of the band's energy, talent, and prowess in the performances from Madison Square Garden (1973)  and Earl's Court (1975).  Immigrant Song and The Ocean are absolutely incredible, and the version of Going to California is the best I've ever heard.  After viewing these two performance, I was well into the groove and thought I had seen the best of Zeppelin.  As the DVD rolls around to its final live performance (Knebworth, 1979), I was not prepared for the awe-inspiring set that concludes with performances of In The Evening, Kashmir and Whole Lotta Love, which basically left me speechless.  This is Plant and Page at their abolute best--you will never see a better live performance.<br />I'm not sure why the decision was made to price this DVD less ... because its value is well worth 10 times this amount.  Buy this DVD now--you will never regret it.
B000002HMH|2.0|They should have taken time off.  Spent some time in rehab or just wait for musical inspiration.  And I think I am being generous by giving 2 stars.  If it were not for the song Hero of The Day, this would be ONE star.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is a true song-writer, and is just herself. She claims she's NOT punk. Made people mad cause she wouldn't wear stuff that she didn't like. She wears her own clothes in her pictures. It's hard to find real poeple like Avril anymore. A lot of them are fake. That's what makes Avril rock: she's herself. She writes her own songs and everything. And for those of who don't believe me, go look for yourself instead of talking bad about her. Let Go is my favorite CD! And Avril is my favorite singer! Just try Avril, she's real.
B0000009SY|5.0|I bought this in college, and have never ever been without it.  I have bought it numerous times before finally mastering it down to MP3 and stashed on a hard drive for later use... it is classic.  It is a top five of FZ recordings that you just have to have, and if you don't have any frank, this is a good one to start off with.  Don't be offended easily, and have a good laugh, which you will.  The guitar playing is immense, and one of frank's most memorial solo's is on this cd set by the name of 'watermelon in easter hay'  this song was played at fz's funeral, and one of his last requests was that nobody can play this song live except for his Son Dweezil.. fz was that kind of fella.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay.  Wow.  I was skeptical about this album before I gave it a listen, as I thought &quot;In My Place&quot; stunk.  And it still does.  But the rest of the album makes up for this disappointing single.  The dark, slamming riff of &quot;Politik&quot; draws the listener into the emotional rollercoaster of an album.  I grabbed the album because of that song, but now I barely listen to it, because the real stand-outs are the mellower, more emotional &quot;The Scientist,&quot; &quot;Warning &quot;Sign,&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam.&quot;  I also love the trippy tracks-- &quot;Clocks,&quot; which the radio somehow can't burn out, &quot;Daylight,&quot; and &quot;A Whisper.&quot;  &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face&quot; is also quality.  <br />This is what I call &quot;my breakup&quot; album.  I can really relate to the emotional content of the lyrics.  And that is why I refer to Coldplay as &quot;my boys.&quot;  I bonded with these songs when I went through my breakup.  Solid, humanizing record.  Buy it.
B000002UAR|5.0|with songs like TAXMAN and AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING, this cd would best just about any recording out there, but this is the beatles and all the other songs are just as good and really everyone who hears the music wants to sing in its pop genius creation.  This is a great beatle record.
B00005NKK8|5.0|I use this in my US History classes to set the mood for seveal decades in the modern era.  Good Mix.
B000002B2X|5.0|This five song EP is just grand.  I love every song, and I just wish AIC could have found strength to record whole albums.  but every song on this recording is just fantastic.<br />I highly recommend this to everyone.  Power, strength and even has a HEART cameo.
B00008PX8P|4.0|WOW...What else can I say this is Zeppelin at their finest.  Bonzo is on top of his game when pounding away, Page has amazing solo's, Jones collides well with the beats and Plant, well you know.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was their weren't enough interview footage, I fall more in love with the band after hearing them explain themselves. Anyways a must of live DVD.
B0000009S3|5.0|Frank loved this release, and I must tell you, just based on the song GUMBO VAR... it is incredible.  but many people who don't even like fz love the song PEACHES EN REGALIA... my wife digs it too.  I think this is an adventours recording, but not as off the deep end as some of his other ones (which, I must say, I love it when he goes off the deep end) so do yourself a favor, and go get this.
0385335482|5.0|This book revolves around Rebecca Bloomwood who is a self-confessed shopaholic and despite being a financial journalist, she has no clue on how to curb her enormous spending. A large portion, primarily the first half shows her suffering through the constant instances of avoiding the bank managers and having a crisis in the romance department. Particularly funny are the letters from the bank which show off her extremely lame excuses. LOL. Soon things take a turn for the better as she writes a sensational article in the Daily World. She soon features in television shows and make big bucks. She also manages a good catch, Luke Bandon. It ends happily for her. LOL.
B0000009SG|5.0|songs like ZOMBIE WOLF and FIFTY FIFTY just stand out as classic wild songs from outer space.  Even for Zappa, these two songs are some of my favorite constructions that he ever came up with.  Totally amazing singing from an artist that only made it on to one FZ recording before overdosing  which makes you wonder just what would have happened to the FZ catalog if this person had not done what he had done and overdosed.  The guitar playing on this CD is just legendary.  FZ plays as if he is possessed.  The strings on his guitar shine with SG beauty.  A must have for those who really enjoy FZ shredding.  This is an essential, as most FZ recordings are, for any music fan that likes something different and entertaining.
B00005YUTD|5.0|I purchased Baby Bach for my daughter at about 2.5 months old, after receiving Baby Mozart.  She was immediately fascinated with both videos and at 6 months old, she still loves to watch them!  She likes the robots and the puppets best, and has begun to recognize pieces of music when she hear them on other videos.  The Baby Einstein series of videos, especially the music ones (Baby Mozart, Baby Bach and Baby Beethoven) are by far the videos she enjoys the most!
B000002HJD|5.0|when jim speaks to you, you most likely want to do what he did when he recorded these poems, light candles in the studio and just listen.  This man had the great verse of people like ginsberg or whitman, but he was a rock star and nobody looks at his writings as the gems they are.  I like JM writings (and you can purchase seperate material he wrote for books) better than the doors music.
0800177975|4.0|I must ask:  WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!?!?  This is a grossly underrated movie; it's actually pretty darn good.  Despite several glaring continuity errors, it's highly enjoyable.  In fact, it's arguably Arnold's best movie.  Yes, I realize that's not saying a whole lot, which is actually part of my point.  This is much better than most of his other films that were far more successful.  Where's the logic?  If you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe yourself a guilty little treat.
B000002UAX|5.0|Yup, the beatles were in turmoil on this recording, and as legend has it, even Ringo quit during the making of this recording but came back (what was HE going to do?).  This cd has all sorts of styles and adventers.  GLASS ONION and LONG LONG LONG are just two songs that are classics and you can tell g. harrison is certainly in his own fantastic writing mode on this record.
B000002J03|5.0|Wow. I emphasize: Wow. <br />Now, to get to a more detailed analysis. \\"2\\" is one incredible ablum, wonderful all the way through, from the head-banging-friendly riff of Whole Lotta Love, to the more subtle Thank You, to Bonzo's manic fist-pounding in Moby Dick, and back to another head-banging riff in Bring It on Home. Led Zeppelin truly displays that they ARE the kings of rock 'n' roll on this album.<br />While \\"2\\" is jaw-droppingly awesome all the way through, it's not as versatile as other albums, such as Physical Graffiti or \\"Led Zeppelin 4.\\" This is, however, by no means a bad thing. \\"2\\" is straight ahead blues rock, and the best ever produced. A few lighter songs are thrown in, such as Thank You and the Lord of the Rings inspired Ramble On(one of my all time favorite songs). <br />Really, this album is pure bliss, showcasing the amazing musical work of 4 incredibly talented musicians. Being a guitar player myself I greatly respect Jimmy Page and his work. This album is a must, as is any other Led Zeppelin album, for the aspiring guitarist. Just listen to the Whole Lotta Love solo or Heartbreaker and you'll see what I mean. God, I love those songs. I don't know how many brain cells I've lost to those two headbanging. Anyway, the drumming is also awesome. John Bonham is definitely my favorite rock drummer of all time. That guy was a freakin' beast, he can pound the life out of his set and make it sound great! I mean, listen to Whole Lotta Love or Moby Dick, and he's playing most of Mobdy Dick WITH HIS FISTS! Robert Plant, while not my favorite singer, makes Led Zeppelin. He has soul and manic energy, and can fit the atmosphere of any song perfectly. And there's always Jonesy, the one mand band who plays everything else other than drums and guitar. <br />Another song which I need to mention is What Is and What Should Never Be. I LOVE this song, especially the end. Jonesy really showcases his prowness as a bassist on this song, and Plant is wonderful. As all Led Zeppelin songs, I love the guitar, it sounds sort of Hawaiian-ish. <br />This album just flat out rocks all the way throgh, I mean, there's not much else I can tell you. Once again: Wow.
B0000009SE|4.0|this CD is pretty good.  The song Big Swifty really takes on more meaning as frank would tour and change the construction of the song live.  I recommend buying this to hear where it started and then get different bands throughout his long CD collection (YCDTOSA versions TBBYNHIYL and MAJNH are good examples -see his catalog and you will know what those stand for)a good recording, but like I said, these songs breath better live.

B0000009SI|5.0|This cd is fun.  Simple as that.  Seems as though FZ wanted to broaden his fan base with this release and the follow up OVERNIGHT SENSATION.  I think frank did broaden his fanbase, but FZ was too creative to keep his medium within those boundries and he went into overdrive in the late seventies 80's.  Great songs, and great fusion of musisicains... like george duke, jean luc ponty, chester thompson and ruth underwood to name a FEW...even a guest appearance by the famed CREAM bass player Jack Bruce.  Great stuff.
0425173755|4.0|There is a train called Orient Express that go France from Turkey with fourteen passengers include in famous detective Poirot. When the train stopped because of the snow, a man called Rechett was killed by someone. There was a clock that had stopped at 1: 15, one pipe cleaner, two different shapes of matches and a handkerchief that had the initial `H'.  The compartment had been locked inside and there were no footprints on the snow outside of the train.  Nobody could escape from the train and everybody had an alibi. Then who was the murderer? How could Poirot find the murderer?<br /><br />While I was reading I could not stop thinking about murderer and the method. Everybody had an alibi then who could have killed Rechett? How could the murderer kill that man and why? This book amplified my anxiety about these questions. And when I finished the book I couldn't have imagined the solution without Poirot's tact and cleverness. He just solved all my questions in the end. It was terrific! If somebody wants to read this book I'll recommend strongly right away.  Just keep thinking `Who did it?' You are going to be surprise.
B000002I2I|5.0|This is my favorite doors.  Simple as that.  With powerful emotive songs like WAITING FOR THE SUN and SHIP OF FOOLS and BLUE SUNDAY, you just can't miss with this cd.  You can scream at parts with JM and sing at others, and it truely is a psychedelic derliction of sound.
B00008PX8P|5.0|It really does not get any better than this... my life is complete.
B0000009RX|4.0|I always wanted and wished that frank would have rerecorded this cd with any of his later lineups, just live, and see what would have happened.  Don't get me wrong the cd is great, it is just that the recording methods back then were so poor, and frank was using every inch of the tech back then.  I just wished this was recorded later and talk about a masterpiece.
078062582X|4.0|\\"The book is sooooo much better than the movie\\".  \\"If you have a brain, don't watch this movie\\".  Well, tsk, tsk, aren't we the intellectual snob?  Listen, if I wanted to \\"read\\" this \\"story\\", I would have gone ahead and bought the book.  I certainly didn't buy the video itself for the rich, intellectual content either.  Demi Moore is nude.  That is why I bought it.  I didn't see much difference between the unrated and R-rated versions, though the unrated version claims to have two extra minutes of footage.  Of what, I don't know.  No big deal, really, except you're out about ten bucks for another version that is basically the same.<br />Again, most of us who own this video or DVD likely bought it with the realistic expectation that we wouldn't be seeing Oscar-caliber material.  We bought it to see Demi Moore nude! What else really matters when you have THAT? Some people just expect entirely too much out of a movie. <br />I was actually pleasantly surprised, though.  While it certainly isn't award-winning, the film is often pretty funny and sometimes touching.  Something tells me the actors and director had nothing more than this in mind when making it.  Demi Moore is hot...when you stop and recognize that fact as the dominant selling point in this you'll enjoy it more. A decent, although not great storyline is a nice bonus.
B000002MG1|5.0|I am not saying that REM will not make anything this good again, because they did, with REVEAL, but it was a while between these two releases where they sorta were uninspired I think, with possible troubles in the band, and health issues.  but, this recording has all that one would want from an REM release, emotional songs, with EVERYBODY HURTS and STAR ME KITTEN, MAN ON THE MOON and other outright gems, this CD is excellent, and deserves nothing less than a five star.. if you look at all my reviews, I normally grade from 2 to 5, with reasons, and the reason this one gets a 5 is because the songs are so well crafted and played.  Total Package from REM
B0000028UK|5.0|...that this is even better then the phenomenal Ten???   YES!   It is better in every way.   The vocals are just as - if not more - breathtaking as they were on Ten, the guitars and drums are even more perfect, and the lyrics have improved(If that's possible.).   The best album ever recorded PERIOD.   It's breathtaking, a sheerly brilliant, flawless masterpiece!   My grade: A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B000000W5N|5.0|Brown Sugar/can't you hear me knocking/Dead Flowers .. this could very well be a greatest HITS cd but it was just another classic stones recording.  A decade later they would record so so material, but for this era, these are the songs summer and fun are made of.  Get it, and crank it.

B000002G23|5.0|What else can you ask of a box set but to contain the whole collection of material plus rare stuff and live stuff.  This box set has it, and has it remastered. (remastered about 10 years ago ish when it was released...) so this box set has everything, and not a bad price.  So, if you wanna get your collection complete, or you just want to dive in head first... get this collection.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I love this album. The White Stripes 2nd best behind their debut.   The tracklisting:   1. Seven Nation Army   2. Black Math   3. There's No Home For You Here   4. I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself   5. In The Cold, Cold Night   6. I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart   7. You've Got Her In Your Pocket   8. Ball and Biscuit   9. The Hardest Button To Button   10.Little Acorns   11.Hypnotize   12.The Air Near My Fingers   13.Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine   14.Well It's True That We Love One Another      Brilliant.   Just sheer brilliance.   I was extremely impressed with this album. After hearing it I immediatly bought they other three releases. That's how good it is.   Amazing lyrics and guitar. Great drumming too.   Another thing that makes it so unique is the fact that there is no bass player. And there's no need for one!   I would advise anyone who likes good music to buy this.
