B0036S4CTS|4.0|I loved the book.

B0055CJ8T2|3.0|1st listen to the CD, I give it 3.5 stars which is pretty good.  Its a cool cd to listen to.  The few Techno dance songs could have been left off and put on a movie soundtrack instead.  However she did have some catchy songs so I think shes going in the right direction with her music

B00425S1H8|5.0|All USB-serial adapters seem to be touchy.  I've used several & they all disrupt my computer when it communicates to the serial device (they crash my software).  I'd recommend avoiding using serial devices with computers that don't have built-in serial ports for this reason.  If you must, then this adapter is as good as any I've found yet (outside of a much more expensive serial-IP conversion device that runs perfectly, because most USB-Ethernet adapters operate very stably).

B002SJIO5E|4.0|District 9 is a great movie, and Sharlto Copley does an incredible acting job in this film, in my opinion.  The only reason I couldn't give this 5 stars is that I ordered this Blu-ray this past April, and when I entered the code to redeem the digital copy included, I kept getting an \\"invalid code\\" error.  I was perplexed until I noticed in the fine print that the digital copy has to be redeemed by 12/29/2010. Come on, Amazon, you can do better!
B000BGPKJ4|5.0|LA PIANISTE (THE PIANO TEACHER) goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet. In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict.<br /><br />The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed. Grady Harp, July 11
1451629184|2.0|I wanted to help this poor girl get a start with her new life, and I was very curious, so I bought the book.  The beginning was OK, explaining how she was abducted and indoctrinated.  She also included a disclaimer explaining how things get a bit confusing with the writing, ( understatement!) and how she may include people she has not yet referenced, but OMG!  This is THE most boring book ever written. Whole pages are devoted to small pictures, small thoughts, and frankly terrible writing. Save your money.

B004XQO8JG|4.0|I've seen an advance version of this blu-ray, and it is a significant improvement over the DVD copy. The picture quality is quite grainy in some scenes, but this is due to source-based age and replicates this 25 year old catalog title nicely in high-def. Color saturation and contrast are about where they should be, with only minor black level crush and no noticeable print damage can be seen. A great 5.1 DTS-MA rounds out this release and while extras are sparse, fans of the film should definately pick this up. As for the film itself, it's at best just a standard B-grade Stallone cop action vehicle, but is worth at least a rental if you like macho 80's action films.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I was a bit learn after reading through the many install issues.  Fortunately for myself the install on my droidX went perfectly.

B004TTZHBK|3.0|The recipes look nice, I'll try one soon. But it's frustrating that it keeps asking me to download the 80MB of extra content, then when I say \\"OK let's do it\\", it just sort of sits there. Nothing much downloads, I can see that there is no significant internet traffic. Then I flip a page in the app and it asks me to download again. On top of that some of the screens aren't formatted right for my tablet (Asus Transformer).    So, the recipes look nice, but the app is buggy. Fix the bugs and this will become 4 stars, 5 if the recipes are great once I try them.

0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a genius for both storytelling and finding patterns in data to reveal a penetrating idea. As it was in [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] and [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]], Gladwell presents a series of engaging stories geared to convey scientific findings and ultimately prove a quasi-scientific thesis about life and success. And, while the conclusions are flawed, the reader will enjoy every second of his marvelous storytelling and insights.<br /><br />In a way, this is a quintessential self-help book. It is all about success and gives the reader plenty of examples of how people were successful with the assumption being that the reader can then take the info and use it for his own success. But, it is anti-self-help in that it constantly diminishes the value of talent and individual achievement. The thesis of the book is that outliers are products, not of their own doing, but of fortunate birthdays, environments growing up, and cultural influences.<br /><br />This is when the proofs get interesting and a little contradictory. For example, Gladwell spends a great deal of time on the concept of the 10,000 hour rule, in which he propounds that all great talents have developed, not from innate capacity, but from a sort of magical 10,000 hours worth of practice. It is a stunning proof that covers all talents from Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Joy and Bill Gates. But, if it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become so talented, doesn't individual achievement play a significant role in one's success?<br /><br />Gladwell goes on to claim that this practice time is less due to the individuals than to their environment, encouragement by family and friends, and their cultural standards. And then the questions start pouring in:<br /><br />- What of all the successful people who do not fall into these categories of luck?<br />- What of all the people in the same categories that did not get lucky?<br />- What says that these outliers would not have found another way to be 'lucky' if they had been given different circumstances?<br />- Is the goal to be successful? To be expert? To have a genius?<br />- What about the most important aspect of all these endeavors--the passion for their line of work, without which none of them could have endured so many hours of practice?<br /><br />Toward the end, Gladwell sums up his argument in a call for greater education and training resources, saying, \\"Our world allowed only one thirteen year old unlimited access to a time-sharing terminal in 1968. If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today?\\"<br /><br />But one wonders how many Microsofts there can be. It is my understanding that part of what makes Microsoft so great is that it is unique (the only software that was used in such a wide array of hardware). If there were many of its kind, Microsoft wouldn't be so great. By definition, it cannot be duplicated. And so we come to the great paradox of this theme. By definition, there can be only a handful of outliers. True, there can be many people who are smart, experienced, and inventive, but they won't all be outliers in the sense that Gladwell puts it.<br /><br />One still gives credit to the author that sparks such great thoughts. Bravo!t these outliers would not have found another way to be 'lucky' if they had been given different circumstances?  - Is the goal to be successful? To be expert?

B0049P1VHS|4.0|When I first saw the series it felt like a mix of 28 Days later/Survivors/Lord of the Flies all rolled into one,  you have the semi-hero the sheriff who awakens in the hospital after being shot by a criminal only to awaken in a seemingly apocalypse world where at first he sees no one but than unfortunately encounters the dead who now walk and eat the living with no explanation.  Afterwords when he reconnects with some other survivors is where the problems really start for the show,  I can't give away more than that because it will be a bigger spoiler for people than what I'm writing now but if you've seen other end of the world movies where the survivors join up than you'll know pretty much what to expect.  The cast were picked very well for their roles and the scenes when they have to play the emotional shots makes it seem like this is really happening to them.  If I have any complaint it's probably the story-plots that are put with the interaction between some of the written characters,  a lot of these little subplots between two or three characters we've seen so many times with other movies an the like it's more annoying when you see those scenes here then anything else.  I just hope that we don't have to deal with that kind of humdrum drama so much in the second season though I know I'll still watch the show in any case....
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but i feel like I should for this one. when I saw this as the free app of the day I was excited until I read reviews saying it wasn't working. throwing caution to the wind, however, I downloaded it (hey it was free) to try it out.<br /><br />first time I booted it on my phone (HTC Inspire 4G) it worked perfectly, downloaded the extra data, and I was off. Wonderful app for the casual chef with many great options like a built in shopping list and instructional videos and pictures to show you what to do.<br /><br />I would try this all out because, if you're even slightly interested, it'll prove a big help if it works.

B000002LUB|4.0|I never picked this one up when it was new so it was like having a DIO era Sabbath album that was new to me - and it was good. :) The more I hear of Iommi the more my respect grows - I don't think he was the greatest or anything like that but I don't know if any guitarist has matched the quality and quantity of memorable guitar playing.
B000002LUB|5.0|When it comes to the Dio-era from the history of Black Sabbath, opinions are usually sharply divided. Some completely dismiss the albums because \\"this is no Sabbath\\", others hail Dio as the guy who all but discovered Sabbath for the world. But there is a third party, too, which is convinced that the other two parties are completely missing the point. Of that company am I. For my part Sabbath with Dio has always been a fascinating alternative to the original, and of course vastly different, line-up with Ozzy. Indeed, the band sounds so utterly different in every aspect that comparisons between the eras are too ridiculous to waste time with.    My personal affection for \\"Dehumanizer\\" (1992) is probably a sentimental one. It was one of the first heavy metal albums I heard while still in the high school and it has remained one of my favourites since - quite a few years later indeed. I love the classic eloquence and simplicity of \\"Heaven and Hell\\" (1980) or the heavier and darker sound of \\"Mob Rules\\" (1981), but it is the stupendous one-album affair (sadly but inevitably) that came a decade later that remains my greatest favourite among Sabbath's creations from the Dio-years. (I have heard but a few songs from the more recent re-union under the name \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and I have no intention of hearing more.)    \\"Dehumanizer\\" is definitely the heaviest album Sabbath ever made. It also is one of the most varied, consistent and well-recorded of their works. Last but not least, it has remarkably meaningful lyrics, a far cry from the fanciful, even puerile, stuff in the earlier years. The opening \\"Computer God\\" is an excellent summary of the album. Heavy drum solo opens, then follow slow and fast part, separated by one short  lyrical episode, the former containing two great guitar solos; the text brutally exposes our enslavement by computes which, if anything, is far more devastating today than it must have been in 1992. The diversity of the album is indeed delightful. \\"AfterAll (The Dead)\\" is one of the slowest and heaviest tracks ever recorded by Sabbath, and the lyrics concerned with speculations about afterlife are rather chilling. Quite on the other pole is \\"TV Crimes\\", a wild ride dedicated to the dangerous hypocrisy of the televangelists. Some of the lyrics here are rather memorable, too:    \\"We just won't eat on Sunday  Gotta buy him a limousine\\"  ...  \\"A supermarket of salvation  Take a look inside the store  Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself  But he gives more\\"    In between these extremities, there is a lot of great stuff. Some crushingly heavy and slow tracks, such \\"Letters from Earth\\" and \\"Buried Alive\\", are reminiscent of Sabbath's slow-paced and doom-obsessed roots in the 1970s. So is the psychedelic \\"Master of Insanity\\", which could have used a longer guitar solo but it is a great song all the same, dealing with the inexorable inner urge in each one of us (perhaps the same force that Metallica deal with in \\"Sad but True\\"). Even the most commercial, figuratively speaking, stuff on the album - \\"Time Machine\\", \\"Too Late\\", \\"Sins of the Father\\" - is all first-rate heavy metal. The last of these three is perhaps the weakest song in the album, but the other two are certainly among the best. \\"Too Late\\" is particularly notable combination of contemplative ballad and guitar fireworks. And then there is \\"I\\" (first person singular, not the Roman number), surely one of the most aggressive and uncompromising things ever recorded by Sabbath, the almost ludicrously egotist lyrics included. All in all, ten terrific songs ranging from, occasionally, very good to, most often, truly great.    The album is pretty well-recorded, with mind-blowing combination of harsh guitar riffs and smashing drums - and the bass is likely to displace some of your furniture indeed. Needless to say, Tony and Geezer are at their absolute best: check only the solo in \\"TV Crimes\\" and the bass intro to \\"Master of Insanity\\" in case you doubt. So is Ronnie James Dio, which is a pleasant surprise. During the 1980s, after he left Sabbath and started his solo career, Ronnie sadly ruined his voice, constantly pushing it beyond its limits, until almost nothing was left of the fabulous instrument forever enshrined in \\"Heaven and Hell\\" (1980) and \\"Mob Rules\\" (1981), not to mention Rainbow's \\"Long Live Rock'n'Roll\\" (1978) and \\"Rising\\" (1976). By the release of \\"Dream Evil\\" (1987) Dio was already addicted to very throaty singing that didn't always come off pretty nicely. Therefore it is all the more surprising, delightfully so, that his vocals in \\"Dehumanizer\\" are much closer to the ones he did a decade earlier. At any rate, in 1992 Ronnie still had lots of power left and he still could sing tender passages ravishingly. My only slight disappointment among the musicians is Vinnie Appice who had qualified the somewhat show-offish exuberance of his youth, which is fine, but whose style still suffered from poor imagination in terms of rhythms and especially from dull work with the cymbals.    In short, \\"Dehumanizer\\" is a tremendous album, its one-off status and reportedly difficult recording notwithstanding. Both Sabbath and Dio fans are, I think, unlikely to be disappointed. Provided of course that they are not too keen on comparisons: the album defies these completely. Nearly twenty years after it was first released, it is a heavy metal classic. As it turned out, sadly, it was the last classic to come under the name Black Sabbath.

0553801473|1.0|After reading the fourth book in the series 'A Feast for Crows' I had a strong suspicion that whoever wrote that piece of mindless drivel could not have written the first three books. Now after reading the fifth book 'A Dance with Dragons' I am more certain of this than I am of the Sun rising tomorrow from the East.<br /><br />Consider this the first three books were written *and* published between 1995 & 2000. Contrast this with 5 years for the fourth book (Published 2005) and then another 6 years for the fifth book (Published 2011). Can you imagine that the same author who wrote the amazing first three books in 5 years would take 11 years to deliver the crap that is \\"Feast of Crows\\" & \\"Dance with Dragons\\"?<br /><br />More likely that George rr martin found/bought at flea market/stole the manuscripts for the first three books and now has spent the last 11 years trying to continue the story with spectacularly poor result.<br /><br />Just read the Plot Summary on Wikipedia and save some money and more importantly your time.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Wall-E is a movie that has an unlikely story but it pulls it off in a marvelous way. Pixar's ninth film is another triumph for the studio because it deftly bends comedy, action, emotion and awe-inspiring animation that should take everyone's breath away. This is a film that has very few words (especially in the first part of it) but the characters are very well rounded despite their ability to say very few words. It's impossible not to root for Wall-E, he is a character that has a sunny disposition despite being all alone and when EVE arrives, he'll do anything to be with her. This movie has a lot of messages but fortunately, they are not pushed down your throat. Wall-E despite many environmental undertones, it's a love story. And is a wonderful one.<br /><br />The animation in Wall-E is as usual for Pixar, simply outstanding. You will stare in awe as the realistic look of the space, the Earth and many other settings. The comedic timing is impeccable and is remiscent of old silent films from the 1920's. The emotion feels honest and the cast of characters is spectacular. Round this with an amazing score from Thomas Newman and you get a masterpiece.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Wall-E in Bd looks absolutely amazing. This is not surprise as all the other Pixar films looks spectacular on HD. You will see every detail, every texture. Detail is sharp and colors are well reproduced. A magnificent transafer.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also outstanding. There is directionality in every way and every sound is perfectly clear without any type of distortion.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />This is a loaded 2-disc BD set with phenomenal bonus material. On disc 1 you have cine-explore which is a commentary with director Andrew Stanton. Also you have two great shorts - Presto and Burn-E. On disc two you have a lot of featurettes that delves with the creation of the film such as story, characters, sound design among others. Also you have publicity material and galleries. But thehighlight of the disc is without any doubt the amazing documentary \\"The Pixar Story\\" directed by Leslie Iwerks that delves with how Pixar was founded and came to be the most succesful animation company in the world. Is an insightful and fun documentary that no one should miss. The documentary goes from the very beginning of Pixar when it was a Lucasfilm division until the release of Cars in 2006. I hope they do a follow up covering the rest of the films (from Ratatouille onwards). You also have some games and othe material.<br />The amount of bonus content is amazing making this one of the best BD sets ever.<br /><br />A DVD copy of the film is also included.<br /><br />Closing thoughts:<br />Wall-E is an instant classic film that proves that Pixar can do no wrong. Bending comedy, action and honest emotion with a cast of great characters and wonderful music, this movie is a must own for everyone. Disney has put an spectacular package with truly amazing video & aundio and oustading bonus material, this is a set that everyone should buy.

0345347951|5.0|1953's Childhood's End was the first novel by a man whose name would become inextricably linked with science fiction: Arthur C. Clarke. From a viewpoint of nearly sixty years later, the idea behind the novel might seem to be either outdated, done to death or both. Yet it's nether of those things as one soon discovers.<br /><br />The events covered are nothing short of epic. The novel begins with the arrival of a fleet of alien ships over the Earth's major cities, crewed by a mysterious race that comes to be known as the Overlords. From there, the novel then takes the reader through more then a century. First comes the early days when a single Overlord known as Karellen, the \\"Supervisor for Earth,\\" speaks only through the Finnish born Secretary General Of The United Nations Rikki Stormgren to bring peace to a world on the brink of disaster. The novel then jumps ahead fifty years as the Overlords finally appear into a world that has grown accustomed to their presence while humanity is at peace and yet unfulfilled. The last part of the novel begins on the island colony of New Athens before revealing who the Overlords are, their purpose in coming to Earth and the meaning of the novel's cryptic title as humanity reaches for its destiny. The results are nothing short of fascinating to reading.<br /><br />What sells all that is the characters. Clarke never loses sight of the people caught in the incredible events around them. These range from the Secretary General Of The United Nations Rikki Stormgren and Freedom League leader Alexander Wainwright in the first part, the inquisitive Jan Rodricks who becomes a major character in the latter two parts of the novel and the Greggson family who find themselves at the heart of the events in the novel's last part. Clarke writes all of these character's across all sections of human society believably and makes the novel feel all the more real.<br /><br />Some aspects of the novel may seem familiar. The first section of the book, with a fleet of alien ships arriving over major cities is an image well used in the TV show V and the film Independence Day for example. Indeed the opening of the original miniseries of V in 1983 is very similar to the novel's second chapter (something Clarke himself noted in the foreword). Childhood's End is an alien invasion story but not of the kind you would perhaps expect. As the novel reveals, invasion might in fact be the wrong word to use at all.<br /><br />Science fiction has a habit of being tied into the technology and social aspects of the time it was written. There are moments when the novel is guilty of this as it mentions outdated technology and uses (only a couple of times thankfully) racist language. Clarke though did foresee things that didn't need alien intervention to occur. Clarke at one point has a character mention that there are some 500 hours of radio and TV being broadcast and that the average person watches three hours of TV a day. In a 2011 without aliens, we're well beyond both point all ready. Clarke covers much of this predicted future in chapter six and that chapter makes for intriguing reading in its own right.<br /><br />Almost six decades on from its original publication, Childhood's End stands up well. From the epic range of its plot to its well written characterizations, this is more then just another tale of first contact between humanity and an alien race. Where it goes from there makes it a classic in its own right.s arriving over major cities is an image well used in the TV show V and the film Independence Day for example. Indeed the opening of the original miniseries of V in 1983 is very similar to the novel's second chapter (something Clarke himself noted in the foreword). Childhood's End is an alien invasion story but not of the kind you would perhaps expect. As the novel reveals, invasion might in fact be the wrong word to use at all.    Science fiction has a habit of being tied into the technology and social aspects of the time it was written. There are moments when the novel is guilty of this as it mentions outdated technology and uses (only a couple of times thankfully) racist language. Clarke though did foresee things that didn't need alien intervention to occur. Clarke at one point has a character mention that there are some 500 hours of radio and TV being broadcast and that the average person watches three hours of TV a day. In a 2011 without aliens, we're well beyond both point all ready. Clarke covers much of this predicted future in chapter six and that chapter makes for intriguing reading in its own right.

B004USRKX8|5.0|This album was released in 1971.  Listening to it today, while looking at that fading sunset on the album cover, I try to feel where the world was at that time.  If inspiring such introspection is the mark of a great work of art, then this album is completely deserving of that label.    While not the most musically talented member of the CSNY ensemble, Crosby may have been the most honest and gifted songwriter of the group.  Here he created a short collection that ranks right up there with Neil Young's \\"Harvest\\" and Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" (all released within a year of each other) as one of the greatest musical reflections by a young artist against the backdrop of a rapidly-changing world.        Listen again to \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\".  Imagine a 30-year old David Crosby.  The 60's are over.  The uncertainty of the 70's has begun.  Listen to the loneliness, joy, sadness, wonder and confusion contained in these haunting melodies.  Forty years later, as one turbulent decade has given way to another, this album speaks across time.  The mark of a great work indeed.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|The songs, singing and acting are outstanding.  The themes addressed in this 1930s Wiemar Republic setting, especially hedonism and antisemitism, are well depicted, without coming off as preachy.  You'll enjoy watching this DVD many times!
0545259088|3.0|This story started with a girl, and her wolf in the woods. A fairy story with an impossible transformation that breached two worlds and bought the young lovers together - a boy who turned into a wolf in the winter months, and turned back into a boy to be with his summer girl.<br /><br />But then the story changed. The boy was cured, the lovers united and all seemingly right with the world . . . until the roles were reversed. Now it's the girl who is a wolf and the boy who pines in the long and never-ending cold, waiting for his love to return.<br /><br />`Forever' is the third and final book in Maggie Stiefvater's glorious literary YA trilogy, `Wolves of Mercy Falls'.<br /><br />In the build-up to the book's release, I pined for months - salivating over the cover, pondering the conclusion and crossing my fingers for a happy ending. But I found that when the book was finally delivered into my hot little hands that I was reluctant to get stuck into it. Ironically enough, it took me forever to read `Forever' because I didn't want `Forever' to end. . . and by the last page I had conflicting feelings - unsatisfied but pleased, unsurprised but frustrated.<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that I knew `Forever' wouldn't be an easy book to read. For one thing, Stiefvater had set up the emotional turmoil back in `Linger' with the tragic role-reversal between Sam and Grace. The angst had been well and truly built up for the finale as Grace and Sam were written back to square one as star-crossed lovers, separated by a gulf of transformation and the endless wood. Secondly, I know that Stiefvater is a tough author. Her series is a bit of a contradiction - at once touting the current supernatural/werewolf fad, but with real literary flair (you need only look at the pages peppered with Rilke and Yeats to get the idea that this is no ordinary YA). And I know from reading her first novel `Lament' that Stiefvater is not the sort of author to finish her book in a neatly-tied bow. I knew all of this, and yet I still came out of `Forever' a little bit miffed and dazed.<br /><br />One problem I had with the book was the character of Cole St. Clair. I know that when Cole first appeared in `Linger' there were many fans who were perplexed and disgruntled by his new narrative role. I, personally, loved Cole's addition and his complex almost-romance with Isabel Culpeper. I thought Cole and Isabel as two snarky, jaded and lustful lovebirds was genius (if a little warped) - Isabel as the Mercy Falls queen bee witch, and Cole as an infamous rocker from the band NARKOTIKA who is on the run from fame, fortune and himself. True, Cole being a rocker on the run who was recruited to lead the Mercy Falls wolves was a little strange - but I appreciated his and Isabel's imperfect characters to balance out the squeaky-clean and sweet Sam and Grace. However, in `Forever' Cole really stood out to me as a glaringly odd character in the series. I was willing to take on his curious background as a world-famous musician who was self-destructive and thought the only way to escape his life was to follow a crazy, wolfy scheme. Okay. A little `out-there' but otherwise fine and interesting . . . what's hard to swallow in `Forever' is the subsequent convenience that not only is Cole a sociopathic rocker with a death wish - but he also happens to have a brilliant scientific mind (thanks to his scientist daddy) and is on the hunt for a cure to the malaria-like wolf gene.<br />Huh.<br />When you type it out like that his whole storyline does seem really contrived and down-right ridiculous. And, honestly, even with Stiefvater's brilliant characterization and pin-point writing, Cole was a bizarrely awkward character in `Forever'.<br /><br />That's not to say I didn't like Cole. I think the series needed a Cole-like character, someone whose perversely jaded outlook on life could balance out Sam's sometimes sappy-sweetness. And I think Stiefvater communicates some brilliant insights through Cole's musings;<br /><br />  \\"Life was a cake that looked good on the bakery shelf but turned to sawdust and salt when I ate it.\\"<br /><br />I also really liked Cole and Isabel's relationship. Both of them are self-destructive, self-hating pessimists who fight their attraction to one another tooth and nail. I loved their difference to Grace and Sam and their puppy love romance. But by book's end I felt like maybe Stiefvater had tipped Cole and Isabel's relationship-scales too much to the side of doom and gloom without offering up enough slivers of hope for their young souls.<br /><br />Cole St. Clair was really the only aspect of `Forever' that was out of step for me - but it was a pretty big misstep, especially because it seemed another aspect of the series was sacrificed for Cole's sake. One of the things I loved about the first two books `Shiver' and `Linger' was Stiefvater's concentration on Grace's family life. So often YA books sweep parents under the rug and conveniently write them out of the entire book. Stiefvater took that commonality and flipped it on its head - making the absence of Grace's parents into a really compelling (and infuriating) side-story that offered up plenty of home-life melodrama. I really missed that in `Forever'.<br /><br />But, of course, `Wolves of Mercy Falls' has always been the Sam and Grace show. From the moment Sam sang about his summer girl readers were hooked into their doomed romance - and with good reason. Stiefvater has turned the hotly popular werewolf story into a Machiavellian/Shakespearian tragedy of epic proportions. Grace and Sam have a seemingly impossible romance - made all the more bitter sweet for them being soul-mates of the highest order. A good portion of `Forever' articulates the rift that Grace's wolfiness has caused to Sam's life, and it's brilliantly heartbreakingly poignant.<br /><br />Throughout `Forever' I kept thinking how ingenious Stiefvater's wolf-world is. She really has turned the old werewolf mythology into an utterly unique tragedy - a conundrum to twist her character's lives that keeps readers guessing how it will all end.<br /><br />True to Stiefvater's tough, literary reputation `Forever' doesn't finish neatly. There's no contrite happily-ever-after or quick-fix finale. Rather, the book finishes with a nice open-endedness that can be read as either fulfilling or frustrating for the way that her characters seem about ready to live on - beyond this trilogy and the woods of Mercy Falls.<br /><br />3.5/5at looked good on the bakery shelf but turned to sawdust and salt when I ate it.\\"       I also really liked Cole and Isabel's relationship.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|I really like this app.  I love this app for the way it has been presented. Every recipe has steps with pictures and some places sounds as well. You Finding recipes is not a big deal you just google it and you'll end up with zillions of recipes.  What is really difficult part is to actually make you cook.  At least it made me do it and therefore it deserve 5+ from me. Best of all it is free for today only.  So far there hasn't been any problem on my tmobile HTC Sensation.
0553801473|1.0|This book has about one-fifth the \\"story line\\" even of book 4, and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux, greyscale, bad weather and maggoty food.  NOT what one would expect from the author being touted as the \\"American Tolkein.\\"<br />It's utterly unsatisfying, to the point where I am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.<br />If you feel compelled to read it, just to find out how bad it is for yourself, at least don't spend any money on it.  Go get it at the library.  You'll feel slightly less ripped off that way
0553801473|3.0|It's pretty clear what Martin is doing here. He is stuffing his books with filler in order to drag the series out as much as possible. Much like Jordan, he adds unnecessary characters, redundant dialogue, and way, way too much detail about mundane scenes and actions.<br /><br />What made me fall in love with this series is the electrifying plot twists, the story being told from the viewpoints of multiple characters, and the fact that no one was sacred or safe. Anyone could die at anytime. Instead now readers are getting a story set a snail's pace with little or nothing meaningful happening until the last 200 pages or so.<br /><br />I hope to God that in the next book he finally gets this whole series going somewhere again. When Robert Jordan starting dragging out the Wheel of Time I eventually got disgusted and fed up and stopped reading the series for almost ten years. I would hate to have that happen  here, because I really, really have enjoyed A Song of Ice and Fire.
1936719118|3.0|First off I have to say I think Derek Sivers is an awesome guy and one of my role models. I love his blog and his TED talks. However, I think this book was just lacking. I wanted it to be longer and go into more details. It's still worth reading, but it won't be something that is life changing or remarkable compared to other business/motivational books out there.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|Always loved this album and as one of a few I'm willing to sit down and just listen to without doing anything else, enjoyed the 5.1 mix.  2nd disc of outtakes/demo is interesting to listen to once but really for hard-core fans of The Who, don't imagine I'll be listening to it regularly.  The remaster of the main album is the reason to get this if you have a SACD player.

0553801473|4.0|I just finished A Dance With Dragons, and I just finished reading some of the scathing reviews.  Did these people read the same book I did?  Sure, it isn't as incredible as the first three books in the series, but it was better than A Feast For Crows (which actually gets better after a second read), and head and shoulders above any other fantasy novel produced in the last few years.  I don't understand the critics who say the book doesn't go anywhere.  It goes everywhere!  The action and storylines move along at a nice pace, and there are plenty of cliffhangers to keep readers wanting more.  The only parts of the novel that I got a bit tired of were the Daenerys chapters, set in Meereen.  It's time to start herding all the main characters towards Westeros.  And that's exactly what I think will be happening in The Winds of Winter.  Let's just hope we don't have to wait another 6 years.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I find myself rocking out to this album on a daily basis. I got it the day it came out, and I like it more and more every day. Butch and the Fighters couldn't have rocked out better. The lyrics are incomparable, the music is a refreshing twist to the bland post-grunge we are used to hearing. The roller coaster songs perfectly mix epic slow verses with face melting riffs. David Grohl is still continuing to make music that never gets old.

My initial suggestions for improvement would be to include more vegetarian options and the nutrition data.

081297381X|3.0|As many others have noted, an otherwise brilliant book is cluttered with self-flattery, confusing asides, and oft-irrelevant anecdotes. The book could be half as long and maintain the same message. It could be organized much better; one could probably read the chapters in a random order and not lose much.     Taleb  coins some helpful vocabulary for the parlance of uncertainty. The book is valuable for its glossary and bibliography alone, but beware of its arrogant tone. Though his dismissiveness of established modes of thinking can be entertaining, it often comes off as offensive and gratuitous.    If you can tolerate its structural flaws, the book makes many a convincing argument and exposes one to indispensable research.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|People should not give this app a bad rating.  I can see that most of these \\"free\\" apps are older versions of these apps.  On the android market they have the newer version of this app, which is able to download as apps2ss.  The only problem is that it isn't free.    I feel bad that these apps are being poorly rated due to Amazon's fault of not testing or checking comparability of these apps to the ALL customers with DIFFERENT types of android phones.    I know beggars can't be choosers but, I'd rather not be a beggar if the only option is downloading these broken or older version apps that crashes my phone.    The application on the other hand has a beautiful UI.  It has in-depth instructions and videos (which I can't download) that can be very motivating to anyone who loves the idea of cooking, especially cooking in less than 30minutes.
034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers    This is the story of Victoria, from her abandonment at birth, through childhood abuse, to her orphanage experiences and her difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. Victoria's life is portrayed with a depth of a feeling that pulls the reader into the story and having a caring feeling about this strange and sometimes difficult young woman. Victoria is a difficult foster child, having been shuffled from place to place, only once finding the love and affection she needed and desired Yet, the voices of the past homes and her social worker cause her to act out in ways that are inappropriate and she loses that place where she found acceptance and security; and began to learn the language of flowers. The story moves back and forth in time and place within the span of her life which brings greater meaning to why she behaves the way she does with people she meets.    Victoria Jones has spent her life in the foster care system. At 18 she is released to the street, homeless, uneducated, angry and without resources for living. The novel rotates between past and present where we learn of Victoria's triumphs and hardships. For most of Victoria's young adult life, she spent it with Elizabeth who teaches her about the language of flowers and that each flower has a distinct meaning. She carries this knowledge to present day. As she makes her own garden, then finds work with a florist, she struggles to overcome the anger and distrust that has been so deeply ingrained. Love and reconciliation come, although we are left with the reality of so many foster children and that is the struggle to accept themselves and the love others offer.  Victoria kept mentally reconnecting to her childhood to find understanding and meaning in her own life. There was a personal relationship with the flowers Victoria worked with and it was evident with all those who became involved in her world. Customers continued to come to her with specific requests for flowers to heal and/or help them in some way. During the time working at the florist, she meets Grant;  Elizabeth's nephew. He shares her love of flowers which blooms to actual love. Some parts in this novel were very sad seeing what kids in the foster care system have to go through and how it affects their future. In the end, Victoria makes peace with her life and starts a new beginning.     Part of the authors goal in writing this novel is to expose the abusive nature of the foster care systems in the United States. At times, the novel can be quite difficult to read. This is a heartbreaking story of a damaged young woman who communicates through flowers. The story tracks this young woman who became emancipated at 18 years of age, through her first year or so out of state custody. She has been in failed foster care situations or institutionalized in group homes. Being detached and removed, she throws her every waking moment into the only thing she can love unconditionally and that is the language of flowers. The language of flowers is a complex symbolism that came to social power in the Victorian ages and was only known by a select few; we find that Victoria uses every flower as a message of animosity, hate, friendship and all other things in between throughout the story.    The author includes an addendum at the end of the book called Victoria's Dictionary of Flowers. Different flowers express different emotions in the book. The flowers add color, tone, and feeling to the writing. The author uses all five senses throughout the entire book. A delightful book even as it portrays the problems our society has within the foster care system. The author writes of what she knows as she is, herself, a foster parent. A definite must read to add to everyone's collection.
1594744769|5.0|I was drawn to this book because of the unique old photos which are displayed throughout and which are an integral part of the story.  I thought it was an unusual haunted house story but it far exceeded my my expectations and really surprised me with its originality.  It's not a haunted house or really a horror story at all.  It's more akin to something like the Harry Potter series - adventure and fantasy involving kids who are young teens with \\"peculiar\\" abilities.    Jacob is a young man who has spent his life listening to the wild stories told by his grandfather of monsters, invisible boys, levitating girls and all manner of strange adventures.  As Jacob has grown older, he stopped believing the the tales and chalked it all up to an old man's imagination.  Then, Jacob's grandfather is viciously murdered and Jacob is the only person who can see the monster who murdered him.  It sends the young man on a journey to a faraway island in Wales searching for the truth about his grandfather's past. What Jacob finds is Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children.  It turns out that all his grandfather's stories weren't just wild fairy tales.  What he has found, however, may lead him into a dark and dangerous adventure.    I found this story to be really captivating.  I finished it in one sitting while on a long car trip.  The included antique photos (which the author credits as all being real photos unearthed at flea markets and antique stores) really add to the detail and drama of the story.  I did, at times, find myself comparing this to the Harry Potter series and it does have a few similarities but it is unique enough to be really interesting and entertaining.   The story ends in such a way that things are left open for a possible sequel or series. I think anyone who reads this will be anticipating the next installment, as I am, to find out what happens to Jacob and his friends. For anyone who enjoys a good fantasy adventure novel and especially for fans for Harry Potter, I would recommend this book.

B004TTZHBK|4.0|I downloaded the additional 80 MB of video/photo but it is not playing on my Acer tablet.  screen goes black for a second or two and then back to the page I was viewing just prior.  Fix that issue and I'll give the app one more star.  That issue aside, this is a brilliant app.  Quick and easy recipes that sound teriffic.  Complete shopping lists of all required items that you can choose only  what you need from.  The option to make each recipe for either 2 or 4 people and the related ingredient amounts/cook times for your choice.  I watched Oliver's programs years ago and always liked his down to earth &quot;any one can do this&quot; style.  He was never obnoxious like so many Food Network chefs were and still are.  He makes &quot;real&quot; dishes with &quot;real&quot; ingredients not out of this world and impossible to find stuff.  Hes got a conversational tone, never condescending.  I expect this app will have those same refreshing qualities that endeared me to Jamie and his TV show back in the day.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|It even has videos to supplement some of the recipes. For those people who are complaining about force closing or what not, you shouldn't complain and give the app 1 star because you have a crappy out of date phone that can't handle threw 80 mb.

I am not much of a cook, and haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but it is laid out very nicely, with a lot of information, videos, and helpful hints, so I think it is a keeper, especially because it was free today.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|When I first read this book, I wrote a review saying I thought it was an ok book. But after some thought, I really didn't like it, at all. And I really really don't understand the hype at all. As for people that get super upset at negative reviews... really? YOU DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOK. I don't understand that. There's some books that I absolutely adore & others say it wasn't worth 2 pennies... OH WELL. We all have our opinions and our right to voice them. I'm sorry that this is a rant. As for my review.. I gave it 2 stars for the fact that I didn't pay for it (I borrowed it for my Kindle) and I did enjoy the middle. But I thought the end dragged wayyyy too much. And I've always had a thing for bad boys... but c'mon? I feel sorry for females that just drool all over Travis' character. He was super controlling, violent, agressive and just all around not a nice guy. Sure he did some sweet things... does that make up for the all the violence? And if it does, again, I feel sorry for you. And I agree with some of the other reviewers.. is that how we want to show the younger audience how men should behave and how women should fawn all over those types of men? I definety don't.       Overall, I think that this story had a good plot... but very shallow characters. Bring on the \\"omg I love travis!\\" comments...
0060763280|5.0|I have read T. Harv's book twice now and got a lot out of it each time. It is so true that many of us have to change our mind's blueprint of the way we think and especially about success and wealth. There is something here for everyone interested in running their own business but even more importantly, in improving their life. We all have baggage we carry from the past and a lot of that affects the way we think about money and success. I encourage you to read T. Harv's book. You will benefit from it.

0553801473|4.0|I am baffled by all the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews for this book.  Especially about the 1 and 2 stars.  I have read quite a few fantasy books and I can still say this book along with Feast is better than 90% of the fantasy books out there.  So how can you give it 2 stars?<br /><br />The flow of this book is more like the pace of Feast with more likable characters, shorter chapters for POV characters giving it a better flow than Feast, and a bit more interesting.<br /><br />I believe that both Feast and Dance were \\"middle books\\" for this series but still are qaulity reads.
1554512115|4.0|Pros:  -Fun pictures  -Good story that moves fast (important for my 6 month old)  -Nice moral (girl realizes prince isn't what he's cracked up to be)    Cons:  -a little too short  -writing too choppy; won't be able to use past 1-2 years for fear of teaching my child that this is an example of story telling    Would buy it again.  I'm looking to entertain a baby, not award a Pulitzer.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I know a lot of people are having foreclose issues. I did as well when I tried to download the additional content. the app works without the additional download. just wait til they update to download the rest. some of the recipiesook look pretty good.. if Ican truly cook these in 20 minutes I will be happy.

B000059H98|5.0|This movie has it all action, drama, suspense, comedy, and thrills.  The actors are wonderful and it's like they really enjoyed doing the movie really got into their parts. AAA+++
B004SBQGHS|5.0|All three starts on all levels, and now working on total destruction with the mighty eagle. Another super addictive and fun game. I love this OG version too. Not a big fan of the Seaons or Rio. Between this and planets vs zombies, I'm set on mobile games.... maybe another tower defense game. But these two oldies but goodies I always come back to. It's like the Super Mario Bros and Zelda of mobile games... just a must have.
B00134XIYM|5.0|Well, she's gone.  It seemed for a time that she would make it back from the hell she was engulfed in.  How sad for everyone who appreciated this hauntingly beautiful, tortured creation.  She was just that--her own creation.  Her influence will echo though music for eternity.  As has been stated elsewhere, we have Adele, Lady Gaga, and Duffy wildly succeeding in the music business due in large part to Ms. Winehouse's influence and the impression she made on the listening public.  I think she paved the way for someone like Lady Gaga to succeed with all her idiosyncrasies and originality intact.  Amy was not one out of the cookie cutter, and she proved that an artist could succeed on the music world's stage looking otherworldly and avant garde, while singing jazz and old school r&b.  She was a true artist in the realest sense of the word.  So sad that we'll never hear her voice serenading us live on a stage again, from her heart to ours...<br /><br />On to the review of this cd/dvd package.  I picked this up at Best Buy a couple of years ago.  I was looking in her section for ANYTHING I could get my hands on--remixes, whatever, and came upon this ltd. edition.  It is a cherished favorite of mine, that I go back to--time and again--to watch the 23 minute documentary that captures many  of the highlights of her videos and onstage performances, giving her a chance to talk about her music, influences, etc, and illuminating her genius and from whence it flows.  She is as self-effacing as ever--raw, unbridled, introspective, insecure, petulant, funny, passionate, but most of all--human.  The documentary is very akin to the one hour doc that was on the dvd , \\"I Told You I Was Trouble, Amy Winehouse, Live in London\\", but this one appears to have some fresh footage exploring her craft a bit further.  I haven't done a side by side comparison, but watched the one on the concert dvd a couple of nights ago, and this one still seemed fresh to me this morning while viewing it.<br /><br />The other portion of the dvd is devoted to 4 performances by Amy at The Orange Lounge--very spare, accompanied only by a guitarist.  They're both sitting down, and it's really interesting to hear her do an unplugged version of \\"Rehab\\" which really demonstrates the songs amazingly simple structure, along with stunning acoustic renditions of \\"Back to Black\\", \\"You Know I'm No Good\\", and \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" as well.  These performances are very different from her usual productions with the theatrics of her backup dancers/singers--here Amy worked her ample magic without all the bells and whistles.  The guy on guitar (sorry, but don't know his name) is obviously very in tune with her every vocal nuance, and it makes for gripping performances of her classics that are unusually scaled back and simple productions.  Her true genius as a singer and songwriter really shines here in the absence of her usual production support.  True Winehouse enthusiasts will want to pick this gem up while they can still get it--I have a feeling that rarities such as this are going to be scarce before long.  This one is truly like having a private concert with Winehouse, as there is no audience in attendance either.  She certainly carved out a niche in music that will reverberate forever.<br />The other portion of the dvd is devoted to 4 performances by Amy at The Orange Lounge--very spare, accompanied only by a guitarist.

B004TTZHBK|1.0|the app looks fantastic but it is packed with glitches. it force closes as soon as you try to download the required 80mb download. it also force closes at random times. in addition it tells you that you don't have a licensed version and you need to buy it. I'm assuming this is because it was downloaded for free from amazon. either way, when and if this app is fixed I'll give it a 4 star review. 5 if it was cheaper.
B000063DI8|2.0|Iron Maiden entered the 90's timidly.  This album signaled a true change in the direction of the band.  Adrian Smith departed due to the fact that Steve Harris decided he wanted the band to return to it's simpler and shorter song length assault.  Enter Janick Gers, the often maligned replacement guitarist.  His inclusion is the often misplaced blame of the bands string of subpar albums, but it was Steve Harris forcing the direction on this band that was to blame.  This album is plagued with horrible go nowhere radio songs that wish they could be \\"Flight Of Icarus\\".  \\"Holy Smoke\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter\\" are the absolute nadir of the Maiden discography, with the latter being a Harris from Bruce Dickinson's early solo recordings, re-tooled for this album.  The only thing that makes me gives this a hesitant two stars instead of one is the fact that the title track, \\"No Prayer For the Dying\\" is actually a really good song.  In fact, if you listen closely, you can hear that they stole from that one to make a song on \\"Brave New World\\".  I'll let you find out which one.

0553801473|2.0|In short, I agree with what most reviewers have said: This would have benefited so much from a decent editor. It's a book which advances the plot in such a small way that all the action could genuinely have been covered by two extra chapters at the end of A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />Some of my gripes in more detail:<br /><br />1/ There are just way too many PoVs in this book. I constantly found myself wanting to skip a lot of chapters to actually get to the POV of a character I was familiar with. I didn't really care what became of Quentyn Martell and had even less interest in the Griff/Frog chapters. They suddenly appear out of the blue and as such I didn't really empathize with them.<br /><br />2/ I found some chapters (especially in Meereen) difficult to follow...compounded by lots of unfamiliar yet similar names and (in my opinion) drenched in pointless and complex lore.<br /><br />3/ The maps at the start of the book are useless. I couldn't follow where half the characters were geographically and had no idea how the maps matched up with each other.<br /><br />4/ I love a gratuitous sex scene as much as the next person...but some of it felt a little laboured and deliberately put in to shock.<br /><br />In short I would have much preferred Martin concentrate on some of the core characters and ditch some of the pointless PoVs so that the plot could have actually advanced. I remember the feeling previously when a Martin book came out: the sleepless night as I hid in the covers reading and re-reading chapters and gasping out loud at the plot twists. The previous books in the series are amazing and you can't put them down...This is quite the opposite.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I gave this a fair shake. I played several of the games to completion before deciding to write a review. In short, this simply isn't any fun. The graphics are fine and the app itself is stable, but the games are a chore, not a pleasant distraction. Further, any if the games requiring &quot;flicking&quot; are nearly unplayable. The creator has programming talent, but should get a game designer. It's obvious that the goal was to crank out 101 games, not to gave them be any fun. I'd use this app to punish unruly children if I had a mean streak.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Well worth the price even better free. Videos are great, raises the bar on the quality of apps. Glad it works on optimus.
B004XQO90O|4.0|SOURCE CODE, like the similarly themed ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is a love story in a sci-fi environment.  In both films, the hero does anything to protect the woman he loves.  In CODE, Jake Gylenhaal is a soldier who is assigned the task of preventing a terrorist attack on a commuter train in Chicago, which will result in the death of his girl friend, Michelle Monaghan.  This is accomplished by a secret government agency's \\"source code\\"---a device that gives Jake 8 minute time segments to find the bomb and the terrorist.<br />Director Duncan Jones elicits good performances from his leads, as well as Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright as the government agents controlling Jake.  Jones focuses on the people instead of producing an action film, and that's commendable.<br />SOURCE CODE is certainly a well-made film, but its predictable in its finale, and I found myself somewhat confused at the ending.  Since I don't want to spoil anything, I can't go into further detail, but I can't say SOURCE CODE is a great film, but it is enjoyable.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|We just bought a 3d tv and aquired this to try it out . It was ok . Not all scenes are 3d but it is seamless . Movie was  at times hard to follow but I am getting older  . If you haven't seen it and its been out forever give it a whirl on uniqueness  . Sort of like a digital mad max movie . Sci Fi fans will feel at home in this futuristic journey into a digital existance .
B004TTZHBK|1.0|I read the reviews about the force close when downloading the additional 80mb but decided to try anyway. No deal, I could not download twice on htc incredible. Therefore, 1star since app cannot be used.
B0055CJ8T2|4.0|I'll have to admit, this cd is not really what I was expecting of her; It seems so techno-ish and poppish, but it's pretty decent. I agree, people need to stop comparing her to Beyonce, but of course that's impossible. but she shouldn't be criticized because of it. Kelly is as, or more talented. I wasn't a huge fan of the album, but I think she's getting better and I love Kelly. Keep doing your thing and don't let anyone discourage you! Beautiful voice.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Although it took a little convincing to get my family to watch this film (\\"a movie about stuttering? sounds boring\\"), it was worth the effort, as \\"The King's Speech\\" deserved all the academy award honors it garnered.  Geoffrey Rush's performance as the therapist proved that he is a gifted actor indeed, but it was Colin Firth's ability to capture and express the anguish of the younger prince forced to assume a leadership role he didn't ask for that made the movie.<br /><br />The scene where the King was delivering his speech on the eve of WWII, juxtaposed--with great irony--to the 2nd movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony, brought me to tears.  This is a film about conquering one's fears to do what's right, whether we are talking about fighting a war that needed to be fought, or fighting one's inner demons.<br /><br />Most movies made by Hollywood are flicks that entertain lightly but age poorly.  \\"The King's Speech,\\" I'm willing to guess, will be as meaningful and moving in 20 years or longer as it is today.
0375851569|5.0|These are Dr. Seuss classics; I remember reading the books when I was little.. Now we are reading it to our girls.. Shipping was fast from this seller, collection was just over $20 for 5 new hardcover books.. Not bad in my opinion.. BUY IT!
B004EPYZPI|5.0|I watched this last weekend. It was interesting all the way through, no lags, and even though it's not an action movie you could feel the excitement in it. A few good chuckles. Matthew is becoming quite a \\"mature\\" actor and it shows in this movie.<br />The combo set, DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital is a great idea. Getting 3 movies for one price was pretty decent. I have a Blu-Ray but most do not. I can let friends watch the DVD and even offer a free download to the techies.
B001GU04N6|1.0|This vinyl is honestly the worst audio quality in my entire collection.  The sound is muffled, the instruments sound quite, and the the overall quality is poor.  This LP is now relegated to background noise around my house.  Its labeled as an original master audio recording, I just dont know what went wrong.  Maybe my copy is defective.
B003UESJ9M|2.0|I should have paid attention to most of the reviews. BORING. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.<br />I would not even recommend that a friend watch my copy.
B00007E7K0|5.0|Not much to say. Cap fits on my 58mm filter threaded lenses and on the filters themselves. Including Hoya HD filter and B+W UV filters.
B00005N6KG|5.0|it is so light that you forget you wear it. It is durable and very flexible. Sound quality is amazing but push the headphones into your ear well thus you feel the bass to the fullest. Only problem is the cord, I wish it was a little bit longer. Definitely use it with an arm band if you are doing exercise.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Downloaded this while omw to work. Looks beautiful, works amazing, super smooth. If you cant use it, report it so you aren't missing out. It also gives you the option if you want to download the extra 80 mb of photos to go along with recipes. Not needed if you can follow simple steps.  A tip: when I see a 1 star rating happening for  silly things, check it out in the  android market. it will usually change your mind.. Htc evo.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|i've never really cared for eminem all too much. i mean i dig some of his music and i will go buy the cd's, but with most of them, his stuff just gets old with me, just played out, and after a few listens i just rip what i want and sell it to someone else or trade it... that's been the case with all of his albums with me, except for \\"Recovery\\" and this one Bad Meets Evil \\"Hell: The Sequel\\". I'm glad, cuz i finally found 2 eminem cd's that freakin agree with me enough to keep them in my collection, instead of just ripping what i want.<br /><br />this cd is tight. i'm not a fan of every song on it, but i've been listening to it ever since it was released, so i am really diggin it.<br /><br />my fave song on it is \\"Welcome To Hell\\".<br /><br />i remember reading in Source or XXL a couple yrs ago about Em teaming up with royce da 5'9 for a mix cd - and i remember saying, that would be dope if it happens.<br /><br />glad they teamed up, cuz this is def a dope record. I hope they release more together too. I'd def love to see a 'sequel' to it... but since they titled it 'hell: the sequel', maybe the 'sequel' to it, will be titled 'the prequel' or something, who knows... but def hope they get another mix cd out there.<br /><br />def buy this if you are an em or royce fan, or if you are wishy washy on em like i was.. i am bigger royce fan then i am em fan, so the cd def works for me.
B003UESJH4|5.0|What is there to be said about \\"The King's Speech\\" that hasn't already been said?  It is a magnificent film, intensely moving, truly inspirational.  (Not many movies nowadays can be described in those terms.)  Colin Firth is brilliant, giving the best performance by any actor in recent years.  Geoffrey Rush is superb.  Helena Bonham Carter is radiant.  Everything about this film--directing, writing, production values, the entire ensemble of supporting players--is first-rate.  A winner all the way!
B004LFO0ME|5.0|it's rare for me to find a cd where i like just about every song on it. there's maybe 2 songs on here i don't listen to or care for, but the rest i love. i love his beats on here, and how some of them are distorted. it sounds like a new form of hip hop to me, or maybe we should call it pop hop or something.<br /><br />some ppl are going to say he's gone pop and sold out. i don't know what the dude sounded like before 'deal or no deal', so i can't pass judgement on him. i don't know how he's changed his style and what not, but if someone tells me a good old album to pick up so's i can hear his old roots, let me know. i'm always wanting to hear some new or old stuff.<br /><br />as for the cd, i love it, and i want to hear more of wiz.
B00479SVBU|5.0|The Soundfly has a powerful FM transmitter which comes through very clear on my radio, the sound is very good, sometimes I mistakenly try to adjust the controls on my car CD player because I think the CD is playing, having both a SD card slot and USB port is very convienient too. The display is good too, though since my cigarette lighter is very low on my dashboard and the unit is quite small, it takes more than a quick glance to see whats playing on the Soundfly since the fonts are small, but what else can be expected when the unit is that small! So not really something that detracts from it.  I had one small technical issue with the Soundfly however, when I start up my car and the Soundfly starts up sometimes the sound from the Soundfly is muted, I would have to turn the Soundfly off and on again to alleviate the problem (not really a big deal). I did email Satechi support to ask if this was a quirk in the unit and in about an hour I recieved a response stating that they would like to send me a replacement unit. I was not expecting them to want to take back the unit, so im assuming that my unit only may have had a little quirk. Other than that it is a very handy device and in my opinion you will be happy with this product.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is the very first review I've written but had to given how good this is and the potential for a bunch of bad reviews due to a force close issue. I too got the force close initially when I attempted to download the additional 80 MB of stuff after the initial video. However, I decided 80 MB warranted being on a fast WiFi connection and tried again and it has opened and worked perfectly since.<br /><br />The app itself is golden and really dummies down preparing and cooking some fantastic-looking and easy to make recipes.<br /><br />So before you bash this app, please try turning on WiFi before attempting to download the additional multimedia content the app wants to download.<br /><br />This is on a LG G2x phone BTW.
0553801473|2.0|I was very excited to get this book, after the disappointment of Feast of Crows.  After reading, I wish would have waited for the 7.99 version.  This book is such a waste of money.  The main story lines don't move at all, and the character development is the weakest I have ever seen in this series.  I don't want to even talk about the Daeneary's story line, complete trash.<br /><br />At the pace the story line is moving it will take him another 3 books and another 30 years to finish.  The entire book is Filler.<br /><br />He made his reputation off the first three books, and is milking it as much as he could.  I would not be suprised to learn that he needs to exstend the series by three books to finish (Ka-Ching).
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Really, read the reviews of the people that have got this app to work! I did and it never force closed. The app works wonderfully, the recipes are great and I can't wait to try them.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|Awesome Cd! Kelly did her thing like she always does. I hope people realize that she really has talent and I will continue to support her and I hope everyone else will. There are about two songs on the album that I don't like but that's only because I don't care for the techno vibe of them. My favorites are All Of the Night, Keep It Between Us, Lay It On Me and Feeling Me Right Now. Purchase this, totally worth the money!!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I'm amazed at the quality of this app. I guess it should be expected for an $8 app though. only problem I have is I'm not sure if its downloading the additional media. No way to tell :-(
0385341008|5.0|This book is just a joy to read.  It made me laugh, it made my heart ache, and I didn't want to put it down.  Everyone I recommended it to has loved it too!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Beautiful app! Love the pictures and videos. I had a problem like many reviewers at first trying to download the 80 mb file for the pictures. I had to click later instead of download now to keep it from force closing. Then I went into the menu and downloaded the file. Let it finish and install before messing with anything. App has worked perfectly ever since.   Stock Thunderbolt, downloaded app and media file using 4G.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|if this is really Jamie Oliver he is stuck in a rut.  The app appears to be pretty useable, unlike other cookbook apps the font size is large enough to be readable, the recipes are redundant though.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|\\"It's Kinda of a Funny Story\\" is the archetypal film I've come to expect from Focus Features - good acting, serious drama and enough comedic moments to draw the viewer in and offset the heavier moments. Zach Galifianakis is great in his support role; he really ties the whole story together as the wise character Bobby who seems to know everything about the people and inner workings of their unit. This \\"all-knowing\\" quality is the only characteristic that at times seems a bit inauthentic in the character. However, his personal story as a father struggling to overcome suicidal ideation is a refreshing change from the roles we usually see from Galifianakis. Keir Gilchrist delivers a fantastic performance as Craig, a teen trying to deal with all sorts of pressures from family, friends, and himself. The number of cutaway fantasy gags give the viewer a glimpse into his psyche and are usually hilarious and something most people can relate to. Having worked in a mental health hospital, I can say that in spite of a few film industry liberties, it is a rather authentic portrayal of life in a program for people with various psychological issues. Definitely worth seeing.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|i found that it worked fine but you simply cant download the file that it prompts you to dl if you are not on wifi. app initially crashed on me when i tried the dl on 3g. i turned on my wifi, opened the app and bam, it downloaded the file and worked well.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|This is album is so good. All the songs on it can explain each scene in The Vampire Diaries. If u like The Vampire Diaries and not this album ur crazy because most of the songs that are on this album are on the show. This album is great and has the perfect songs that fit to the show.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|He's a great chef and this is a great app for preparing some of his recipes. Easy to use and works well. However it is a large download - but worth it.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I love this app. It's easy to use and keeps my page count down.. gives a clutter -free look to my phone. Also makes installing new apps easy, just add them to a category and they're on your screen. would like the ability to use custom icons in the folder widgets, but not that big of a deal.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|It forces close every time I try to open it.  I have an HTC Incredible.  Another reviewer with the same phone had an identical problem.
B003UESJH4|5.0|In a world crammed with overwhelming special effects and immature angst, it's refreshing indeed to find a film that is so clearly crafted for the mature adult audience. However, what makes this film so exceptional and worthy of praise, and its multiple Oscar gold, is its centerpiece: an astonishing, once-in-a-lifetime performance by Colin Firth.<br /><br />If an actor is very fortunate, once in a rare while there comes that perfect role, when the stars align just right and script and the actor merge into a seamless creation of which history is made. While the Academy has sometimes recognized this perfect amalgam - Charlize Theron in Monster and Susan Sarandon in Dead Man Walking come to mind - many more times it has not been, as evidenced by Glenn Close in Dangerous Liaisons; Al Pacino in Scarface or Sigourney Weaver in Gorillas in The Mist. That Mr Firth actually earned an Oscar for his astonishingly understated, sublimely executed role of a king haunted by his inadequacies yet determined to rise above them restores my faith somewhat in the future of cinema.<br /><br />The movie abounds in good taste, from Helena Bonham Carter's delightful turn as a young queen and devoted wife, to Geoffrey Rush's scintillating teacher and royal confidant, to the attention-to-detail art direction and well paced story that never once flags or descends into that bane of modern film-making: manipulative sentimentality. The true story behind its creation is equally moving, proving that fact is always stranger than fiction.<br /><br />This is a film that will stand the test of time, becoming a classic that not only deserved its gold but eventually transcended it.
0545259088|3.0|I was really disappointed in the ending of this book.  There were a lot of questions that were not answered.  The author created a lot of issues between characters that were never resolved.  She also went down a lot of different paths that led to nowhere particular....they did not tie into the conclusion.  Since this book was supposed to be the final book in the series, I was disapointed.
0307593495|5.0|Reading this last book on Wallender was like saying goodbye to an old friend. This was a masterpiece of detective fiction.  I hope that Mankell will continue to write.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I really like this app, and I don't really follow JO and have never made any his recipes before. When I first opened app, it gave option to download 80 mb media file now or later. I downloaded it right away and then started using app, and it works great. I love the UI. It's organized nicely. It's easy to search, browse, or watch how- to videos. Very nice!  HTC Incredible
B004TTZHBK|5.0|If you are one of the many experiencing force closes try enableing wifi before opening the App and trying to download the 80mb pack.  I did this on my Thunderbolt after experiencing force closes and it downloaded the pack and hasn't force closed since.  The app just needs a little polishing, but this is by far the best FAOD I have experienced so far.  this is a great app for people who need step by step instruction because of the video/audio/pictures integrated in, or people like me who are just looking to try a tasty recipe! I just hope the updates in the future aren't as large other than that I can easily give this a 5 of 5
B004TTZHBK|3.0|It says I'm using an unlicensed copy and force closes... and does not download 80MB file. other than that i hope they get this fixed ASAP. might be a five star app.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|How about a lawyer that works out of his car? And this car travels thruout the movie and there is never a car chase. Right there is the unexpected. I think Matthew McConaughey and Marisa Tomei are perfectly cast and they do an excellent job. I read the book ages ago & liked the book as well as the movie. It is great to see a movie that keeps your interest all the way thru it, there is no sci-fi, horror, nor overt sex....there is plenty of violence tho. All in all, this movie is very good entertainment, it kept my interest and that is why it is 4 stars.<br /><br />I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Was worried the app wouldn't work since its been getting so many bad reviews for force closing issues. Downloaded quickly and without any issues. Great recipes and you can download pics to go with them afterwards.
B001GCUO5W|2.0|\\"Shutter Island\\" is a mystery with a twist, and I don't want to give it away.  So, I won't go into a lot of detail about the plot.  Leonardo DiCaprio and his partner travel to an institution for the criminally insane on an island, and nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />As my wife put it, about 60 minutes in, you know it's going down one of a few paths, all of which are cliches.  Sure enough, an hour and 15 minutes later, she was proved right.  The problem with the twist ending in the 21st century is that we've all seen a ton of movies with twist endings, and it has become harder and harder to actually surprise the audience.  Also as my wife put it, there's a good movie buried in here somewhere.  The characters are interesting; the idea of a mental hospital at the dawn of modern psychiatry is interesting; and the location is fantastic.  Strip away about 30 minutes from this languidly-paced film, do a few more drafts of the script, and this could be a winner.  The way Hollywood works, the remake/reimagining in 2030 will win an Oscar.<br /><br />On the plus side, DiCaprio turns in a tour de force performance, as usual.  The guy is a fantastic actor, and this is an actor's film.  If you like watching a great actor do amazing things with a character, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />At best, \\"Shutter Island\\" is worth a rent.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|its ok but just a regular keyboard nothing special ...,laggy at times as well.blah blah blah need more words amazon review sux

B004TTZHBK|4.0|I really like Jamie Oliver's take on healthy eating, but gotta say that I would probably be too cheap to buy this app. My bad. The recipes look good *and* easy, bonus star for being able to switch back &amp; forth from a 2 person or 4 person ingredient list.<br /><br />Would like to be able to mark certain recipes as favorites, or to rate them. (If you can, and I couldn't find the 411, sorry. Still on my first cuppa.)<br /><br />It works very well on the Evo Shift, with no force close issues (knock on wood).<br /><br />I decided to hold off on downloading the extra 80 mb of pics, after reading the nastygrams here. But I don't know if I need the pics. The recipes are pretty straightforward, and the app works well without 'em.
B000IZA9PI|4.0|I remember first seeing Star Trek: Nemesis in theaters and being extremely disappointed. I thought it was too dark and was missing much of the \\"soul\\" of the Star Trek TNG series, which excelled at morality plays. However, in re-watching it recently, I've revised my opinion upwards, albeit it still doesn't rank as the greatest of the Star Trek films.    First, the bad. While the movie seems to contain an interesting moral message about the \\"nature vs. nurture\\" debate, it sacrifices that subplot on the alter of action scenes. The idea of Data and Picard confronting \\"clones\\" of themselves is intriguing, but the plot device bringing them together seems forced. In fact, the whole chase scene at the beginning seems gratuitous and out-of-place for a Star Trek film.    The second major problem with the movie is that director Stuart Baird seems unfamiliar with the ensemble nature of Star Trek TNG. After the initial scene, the movie becomes a \\"Data and Picard\\" show. The other characters only have minor roles. Geordi, Dr. Crusher, and Worf have little more than glorified cameos. While everybody loves Data and Picard, they work best when they can work with the other crew members. Admittedly, Deanna Troi gets to put her telepathy to good use, but her scenes, including a telepathic \\"rape,\\" almost seem more awkward than exciting.    Finally, the Remans and the Reman plot were simply not well executed. The Romulans would have been a perfectly good enemy for the TNG crew. They've always been manipulative and intelligent. By contrast, the Remans seem like a bunch of boorish brutes. They don't seem to plan any of the attacks or do much thinking at all, leaving that up to the human leader Shinzon. And the masks just don't look realistic. They look like Romulans wearing vampire masks. Their uniforms are shiny almost to the point of looking like disco suits. I suspect the producer and director thought the movie needed a more \\"menacing\\" enemy, but I think the Romulans would have worked better.     Having said all of that, the movie does work as an action movie, if not the most faithful of Star Trek films. It's entertaining and suspenseful. The threat to Earth is serious and Picard's response to it is appropriately grave. The space battles look beautiful, especially with the green nebula as a backdrop. The damage the Enterprise E suffers in the battle is shocking, even more so than the destruction of the Enterprise D in Star Trek: Generations. Seeing the enterprise in such disrepair really raises the emotional stakes.     Despite my earlier comments about the plot, this movie does have some wonderful \\"Star Trek\\" moments. I was ecstatic when I saw Riker and Troi's wedding - a moment anticipated since the very first TNG episode. The dialogue between Data and Picard about \\"nature vs. nurture\\" recalls the best of the TNG series. Picard's reaction to Shinzon's appearance and death are silent yet laden with thought. And, of course, the death of a beloved crew member at the end nearly made me cry.    While I wish I could unreservedly praise Star Trek: Nemesis, given that it is the last of the TNG films, my reactions are mixed. There's a lot of unrealized potential and far too many poor choices. Overall, I'd give the movie 3.5 stars.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this movie but the previews got me interested in it enough to rent it on Amazon Instant.  It turned out to be a great movie.  Good camera work and acting.  I would rated it at 4 1\2 stars but that is not an option.  If enjoy SyFY and suspense you will enjoy this movie.

0307477479|2.0|Wow, this is so overrated. The writing is great but not consistently great. At first I really enjoyed the concept of telling everyone's story but it was too much. I got to the point where all the characters really blended together and I could not keep anything straight. It felt more like a collection of short stories and should be labeled as such. There are some really fantastic moments but overall I'm just not really all that impressed.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I have been a YES fan since the 70's and have enjoyed just about every album they have released.  FLY FROM HERE is YES in top form.  I have enjoyed listing to this album over and over again.  You really get into the music and story of the title suite.  The rest of the songs are just awesome.  I really love the balance of all the music and the creativity.  I like Jon Anderson, but Benoit David as lead singer, wow!  He is not a replacement but a welcomed addition.  He sounds really good and blends well with the rest of the band.  YES with Howe, Squire, David, Downes, and White have made an album worth listening to for years to come.  I highly recommend FLY FROM HERE.

0307358658|3.0|There is much that I admire about Nesbo's prose and I would love to be able to read it in Norwegian.  I think that he has a fine sense of minor characters, who often seem more complex and interesting than some of the main characters.  His descriptive passages are often evocative and insightful and even some of his philosophical interludes are arresting.  Harry Hole is a complex character who seems to be trying to evolve and change despite the rather heavy baggage he carries with him.  Ironically, while he is overly committed to following through details and getting the cases solved, he often surrenders quickly in his personal relationships when he senses any resistance, waning interest, or conflicting elements.  I found his relationship with the young boy Oleg to be in character and definitely transforming for them both.<br /><br />What is problematic for me about this novel, and this pretty much holds true for most plots involving an intuitive, off-the-ropes kind of detective like Hole and a fiendishly clever serial killer, who are pitted against one another, is that these situations almost never occur in real life.  Rarely does a serial killer personally pit himself against some famed or notorious detective because he wants to prove himself.  The bottom line is that the killer is driven to kill because this is what he is hard-wired to do.  It gives him pleasure, whether that derives from some fulfillment of sexual desire gone awry, violent tendencies, need to control or exert power, etc.  And he doesn't want to be stopped in doing what gives him so much pleasure.<br /><br />This narrative had too many fits and starts and was too long by half.  I was growing tired of the false leads, which by the way, perhaps could have been avoided if Hole learned to operate according to police procedures, which, after all, is what actually occurs in real life crime solutions, instead of flying by his much-vaunted intuition.  His intuition was wrong here more than it was right and yet he kept getting a free pass to operate this way, at least by Nesbo!<br /><br />When an author spends so much time depicting the architecture and ritual of serial killing it can be a clear sign that the reader should be ready for shock for shock's sake.  At times the scenes were just plain ludicrous and unbelievable, especially the denouement.  I found myself torn between impatience and laughter.  These elaborate set-ups simply do not ring true.<br /><br />I would also say that the novel's resolution of the conflicts that had peppered the plot were also a bit slick, not unlike something a Victorian novelist does when he wants to tie up all the dangling pieces.<br /><br />All that being said, Nesbo is still someone worth reading, but clearly you can feel that he is stretching too far in this work.ting a free pass to operate this way, at least by Nesbo!

0756405890|5.0|At first, I was just looking for a book to kill time. But no, this book did more than that.    It simply grabbed me, and drew me deep into the story, like I was actually doing the action. I wouldn't want to spoil you with details, but let me just say this book is a true fantasy story I've read in a long time.     I'm going to get the second book now, despite its kindle price. A riff off, but I think it will worth it.
0439023513|2.0|To be honest I feel kind of let down. I had hoped for things to end on a more happy note, but to be honest I found it to be very depressing. It's not that all books have to have a wonderful happy ending, I just feel like this was quite the let down. As a reader, I am not satisfied.<br />I'm also extremely disappointed in the characterization of Katniss. She always seems to fall short and really truly is a weak female character. I should have just read the first book and stopped.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|running on asus transformer. when i click on recipe it shows a big picture then force closes. this is when i dl the 80mb of media or not.<br /><br />what a tease!<br /><br />looking fwd to update that fixes this.<br /><br />will rerate when a fix come out.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Aside from the fc (hint: choose to download video later), this app works great. My favorite thing about it is the recipes are geared to either two OR four people. Nothing is worse than finding a recipe you love that serves far too many people and you have to alter it yourself (which doesn't always work). The videos are really handy, too, for novice cooks like myself. Jamie Oliver is a great teacher - a lot of other chefs assume the viewer knows what they're talking about or demonatrate little either too quickly or with almost no explanation. The grocery list feature is great and adds so much in convenience of having everything together in one place. This app is fantastic!

B004LWZW24|4.0|*Minor Spoilers*  I'm just going to jump into it and that compared to other horror movies for the past decade, this one is one of the best right behind The Ring, The Grudge, The Other's, The Strangers and Paranormal Activity.  What could have been a 5 star movie earned 4 due to the first half an hour.  It was slow.  The filmmakers tried to set up the characters, showing the mom play the piano and the dad at work and stuff but and nothing scary happens.  We understand later that it's the boy's comma that sets off the chain of scary moments and that's fine, but they could have cut all this 'normal everyday living' and got right to the comma within the first 5 minutes.    Also, I found that the filmmakers should have placed the scares in the movie in different order.  We start off by having one big scare, followed by little scares like the door creaking open and a rocking horse rocking by itself, when they should have put the little scares first, built tension then put the big scares at the end.      But the last hour, wow.  It's a good thing I didn't turn it off because the story made me keep on watching.  People are complaing about the last 20 minutes, but the movie cost just a million dollars to make.  That's really cheap for a movie nowadays so what more do you want?  With the budget they had to make this movie, it was good, overall.  If only they would have trimmed some of the fat in the beginning, it would have been perfect.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app is slick, easy to use, and best of all informative. i hate recipes that assume you're a world renowned culinary black belt. this app give you short videos on the basics, such as making a simple risoto and the tricks to a successful stir fry. the directions are clear, and show pictures in case you still dont get. i never pay for apps, but had i not got it for free, i would still consider purchasing it.
0316056863|2.0|I feel horrible assigning such a low rating, but I also feel incredibly disappointed by this book. I don't know if I just had a completely wrong perception of Tina Fey or what, but I was really surprised by what I gathered across the pages. She is seriously vulgar and some of the stuff she writes is just not funny. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying she is not funny at all. There were moments I could not help but laugh out loud. There were also moments I found to be very interesting. For example, her take on the skits about Sarah Palin. Overall though the book just did not live up to my extremely high expectations.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|This app is a good idea, but it force closes on the Droid Incredible every time I try to download the additional video. I assume there will be a fix for this at some point. It still works as far as getting the receipes and steps to make them.

0375714839|4.0|Why did it take me so long to get around to reading this book? I've written a novel, '[[ASIN:B004MPRCNC SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN]]' set during the Iranian revolution, and I've read a number of accounts of that time - '[[ASIN:1416537430 Prisoner of Tehran: One Woman's Story of Survival Inside an Iranian Prison]]' and '[[ASIN:0307339742 Daughter of Persia: A Woman's Journey from Her Father's Harem Through the Islamic Revolution]]' - being two excellent memoirs. 'Persepolis' should have been a natural for me. I remember when the movie came out and wanting to see it. My own prejudices, I suppose. 'Persepolis' is a graphic novel and that equated to 'comic book' for me. I've never been a fan of comics, and the few graphic novels I've read didn't light my fire either. Personal prejudice I know, and like all prejudice, it can be very misguided.<br /><br />I was an American teenager in Tehran at the same time that the author, Marjane Satrapi, was a young girl there. My story ended with a flight out in the fall of '78. In many ways that is when Ms. Satrapi's begins. Her family is well-educated, left-leaning and hungry for the overthrow of the Shah and democratic reform. She and her loved ones embrace the revolution without reservation. When the Shah flees in January 1979, they see this as the hard-won birth of freedom in a country too long held under the thumb of a dictator controlled by Western imperialists.<br /><br />Then comes the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the dream of freedom dies under the iron rule of the mullahs. The people's revolution evolves into a theocratic state, and rather than liberty, the ancient tenants of Islam are imposed upon the masses. Those on the left, including Satrapi's own family members, are rounded-up, intimidated, persecuted... or worse.<br /><br />Little Marjane tries to hold on to her independence as the State redefines the roles of women and young girls in the new Islamic Republic. It's a battle she cannot win. On top of all this comes the Iran/Iraq war. Sensing a weaken of Iran, their traditional enemy, Iraq, attempts to seize the Iranian oilfields. What Sadaam Hussien believes will be a 'cake walk' turns into one of the longest and bloodiest wars in the 20th century. Fearing for their child's safety, her mother and father send Marjane to Austria where she struggles not only with the fate of her homeland and family, but with her identity as a foreigner born in a nation that is quickly becoming a global pariah.<br /><br />I'm not going to dwell on the artwork, which is excellent, as I was more interested in the story than the drawings. I enjoyed 'The Complete Persepolis' from cover to cover and am ashamed that I I haven't read this fine work sooner.

0375713751|2.0|The major premise of this book is that you can't have it all, especially if you have young kids. The author is saying that it's pretty hard, if not impossible, to have a happy marriage, an exciting career that involves lots of international travel and also be a hands-on parent. And fair or unfair, it's especially hard for women. I can't disagree with any of this. But I do take offense at the author's other main premise--that grown men are really helpless children who can't take care of themselves or do the basic day-to-day things that it takes to manage a household. Good heavens.... my own mother, who was born long before the women's movement, was more liberated than the author of this book! My mother loved her kids, of course, but she also believed that women should have careers and be independent.<br /><br />I won't bother rehashing the plot, what little there is, other than to say that I was puzzled by Kate's husband, Richard. He seems to do nothing. He doesn't have a job that I could tell, but he isn't around much to help out around the house. Meanwhile, Kate is the main (or sole) breadwinner. And Richard is so fed up with this arrangement that he actually walks out on his family while Kate is on a business trip, leaving the kids with the nanny. I ask... what kind of man does something like this? Couldn't he have waited until his wife at least got home from her trip??? And what's more, why doesn't he stop being so passive aggressive, get off his derriere and offer to do something? Oops, I forgot. He can't... because according to the author, he's your typical helpless and clueless male.<br /><br />It took me until about page 100 before I saw any semblance of a storyline. I almost gave up way before then, but I kept reading to see what all the hype was about. Allison Pearson is an OK writer (I'm assuming she's a better journalist than novelist), but she desperately needed a good editor. The book is 338 pages long. It could have easily been cut down to 200 pages and nothing would have been missed. I hear that this novel has been turned into a movie starring Sarah Jessica Parker, with the action moving across the Atlantic from London to Boston. I'm hoping the movie turns out to be less retro than the book... and not yet another backlash against working mothers.

B005DC68NI|5.0|The above question is actually the only one raised by the book that wasn't answered in sufficient detail. Seriously, however, this is a must-read if you are considering self-publishing and have questions. David provides rich detail from his own experience as well as offering a good analysis of publishing as it exists today. His tone and style are pleasant, and his prose is clean and professional. Gaughran neither harangues nor bullies. He does, however, present a compelling case for why all authors should at least consider self-publishing some of what they write.<br /><br />Most helpful to those who are uncertain about the dreaded \\"invisibility curse\\" of self-publishing will be the thirty-three testimonials at the end of the volume. Each of these authors has hit or exceeded 1,000 sales a month. Their stories of how readers found what they wrote is fascinating and informative.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

0553801473|5.0|I lucked into randomly grabbing AGOT years and years ago, prior to going on a family vacation. As most fans can probably attest too, the book sinks its hooks in quickly. I was soon boarding the plane back home and realized my eyes had not left the pages during the entire trip, minus the occasional food break. I should have just stayed home, locked the door, and saved the travel expenses.<br /><br />Fast forwarding through the next books, the enormity of the world continued to grow. The amount of emotional attachment to characters intensified. Part of this attachment was in knowing that the characters could easily be ripped from the pages at any moment (ala the red wedding). The ability of GRRM to continually make characters evolve from boring to hilarious (Jamie L), unlikeable to riveting (TL), etc always seemed to set him apart from traditional writers from all genres.<br /><br />Anyway, moving on to ADWD, reading the majority of these reviews is rediculous. GRRM has somehow managed to construct a world in writing thousands of pages filled with unbelievable complexity and unparalled dialague and description, yet people are frustrated. I think part of this frustration is society, everyone wants a conclusion, to be able to go at their own pace, the \\"I want it and I want it now\\" syndrome. ADWD melds seemlessly in with a FFC, not easy when the books are written through characters, and not necessarily chronologically.<br /><br />Would these readers want GRRM to just skip all the dialogue and description and just say \\"Hey, John Snow is king, he is marrying Dany, and they live happily ever after?\\" Everyone would love to have all the books written, done, so we could sit down for two months and blast away and know precisely how all the cliffhangers and secrets are going to unfold. That said, we have the luxury of being in the middle of perhaps the greatest series ever written.<br /><br />I wanted to throw ADWD against the wall when I was finished with it. Couldn't GRRM giveus a 100 more pages? But isn't that the point of a great series? Getting engrossed in the journey? Finishing and wanted to get the next book that instant. For a thousand pages I was in the world GRRM created, trying to peice together all of the families, cities, character threads. Visualizing what the Wall would be like, Winterfell in ruins, and the sea of grass. ADWD did all of this and more. It set everything up, brought threads together, brought new characters to life, gave life to old characters, and provided the baseline for one of the most intriguing and engrossing series to come to a thundering conlusion.

0553801473|2.0|(SPOILER ALERT, there be SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!  YOU ARE WARNED!)<br /><br />First, the good stuff:  Martin continues to have excellent prose.  No one denies his talent in writing scenery, characters, location, atmosphere, etc.  His command of the English language is impressive, and the book is very well written from that standpoint.<br /><br />That said, there's far more to a good book than just pretty language.<br /><br />-  Jon Snow:  perhaps the most engaging of the POVs as we see what is basically the main protagonist of ASOIAF come into his own as a leader of men.  We see him making hard decisions to prepare the NW for the inevitable assault of the Others whilst juggling the politics of the kingdom.  This is all well and good.  Then we get to his last chapter, and Jon's character makes a completely inexplicable decision that shatters the suspension of disbelief in the novel.  Having previously chosen to stay with the NW on multiple occasions in the past (when his brother went to war, his father died, Stannis offering to legitimize him) when he was but a member of the NW, he decides to break his oath and go South based solely on the letter of a known madman and effectively abandoning his post of Lord Commander of the NW before they face their greatest threat in millennia and while they squabble internally with the Wildlings.  This comes across as not a decision that the character made, but rather something the author needed to happen and therefore happens.  Following this, we're treated with a completely emotionless and unbelievable character death when any reader worth his salt knows full well the character will return somehow in the subsequent books.<br /><br />-Dany:  The long path Dany had taken in the first three books from frightened young girl to bad-*ss warrior queen has been completely shattered.  The Dany we see in ADWD is a completely different character, one that this reader had an incredibly hard time taking seriously.  The \\"plot\\" of the book , to the extent it had one, comes to a screeching halt every time the narrative went back to Mereen.  I don't quite understand what was going through Martin's mind but he effectively killed any interest we as readers could possibly have in her story.  Perhaps he was hoping to cater towards the Twilight fandom in his descriptions of Dany's teenage crush on Daario, but anyone over the age of fifteen can't help but feel the strong urge to skip her chapters in this book.<br /><br />-  Cliffhangers:  Martin has gotten into the horrible habit of using artificial cliffhangers to keep the reader's interest.  I've lost count of how many characters have \\"died\\" at a chapters end only to pop up later, to say nothing of resurrected characters.  This takes away any dramatic impact any death might have as we the reader simply don't believe them.  Catelyn, Brienne, Tyrion, Asha, Theon, Rickon, Bran, and now Jon Snow have all suffered \\"deaths\\" as it were, only to come back.  This is getting preposterous.<br /><br />I could  go on and on.  The lack of plot development.  The abrupt transitions in the overall narrative.  The unforgivable single throwaway Jaime chapter.  On and on, we are given clear signs that Martin has no idea what he's doing with the story and is morphing into Robert Jordan (albeit with better writing) before our very eyes.<br /><br />The excitement we felt in reading the first three books is long gone.  First AFFC dampened it tremendously, but that could have been dismissed as a mistep.  No longer.  It pains me as ASOIAF was one of my favorite fantasy series... but now I fear it has become poor fan-fiction.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I went ahead and downloaded this app, eventhough others were having issues. I'm glad I did.. It works perfectly on my Incredible 2. I love Jamie Oliver recipes, and this app is beautiful, and very informative.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I can't help but laugh inside when I read the reviews of people who insist on going with a knock off brand or complain about spending the 150 or so bucks for this item.... when they own a very expensive 7D camera body and/or an assortment of costly lenses to begin with.  Sure, we all want to save a little money, but I'm of the school that you get what you pay for, and this grip certainly is no exception to that rule.  First of all, I don't have to worry about the unit not being completely compatible, features that do not work, damaged electronics in my camera, or having to turn my camera off every single time as to not burn up my batteries....  it's a Canon brand grip, and was made by the manufacturer for THEIR camera... and that alone is worth the extra money to me.  The quality of the grip is outstanding and has same materials as the 7D, and upon first installing it, I noticed that it completely changed the feel of holding the 7D.  That being said, I understand everyone has different sized hands, but this grip fits my hand like a glove, and it makes holding my camera in both horizontal and portrait aspect a complete joy.  The buttons are well positioned, and the shutter button on my grip feels and operates very similar to the one on my 7D.  Yes, the grip adds a little weight to the camera, but the gain you get in comfort, vertical shooting, and battery life more than justifies this purchase.  I highly recommend this grip.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie....well deserved.  Excellent and realistic story.  Scenery was beautiful.  It's not an action movie but there are lots of interesting surprises to keep you glued.  It is one of the best movies I have seen in my life.  I plan to purchase the Blu Ray format as soon as the price decrease.

B00003G1GO|5.0|\\"Open Up and Say Ah\\" is the second studio album released by Poison and one of their best. CC DeVille is one of the best, most underrated guitar players out there. He absolutely shreds the guitar and plays some amazing riffs on the songs. Led by front man Bret Michaels, Poison is the epitome of what a party band should be: They're genuinely fun, and enjoy what they do in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get way. The album was Poison's best selling at over 8 million records, and features four singles: \\"Nothing But A Good Time,\\" \\"Your Mamma Don't Dance,\\" \\"Fallen Angel,\\" and \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\\" Every song on this album rocks and is filled with energy. If you're a fan of this genre of music, you'll love it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I tried to do P90X but the workouts are just so long that I get bored in the middle of the program. So I tried this - get fit by working out only 20 minutes per day? Sold! And it truly WORKS! Ater the first pace (10 days) I had lost 2kg and 2cm from my waist! (and I'm not overweight so it's even harder for me to get rid of). The workout gets harder in each stage and you truly get results in only 20 minutes - anyone has time for that!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app covers pretty much every aspect of creating all of the meals. It is definitely one of the best recipe apps available.
B004XANKVO|3.0|I find the backpack heavy on the shoulders and back, which end up sore after a few hours. This I find to be a huge draw back.  What it needs is straps at the waistline (with zippered pockets and straps that can be tucked away), so most of the weight would fall on the hips.  There's an exterior pouch which needs the side material to come to the top, because my newspapers/magazines keep falling out. Finally, an attached waterproof cover is a necessity. Otherwise, it's a well designed bag.

B004TTZHBK|4.0|I too get the FC as others after getting the 'unlicensed' error message. Shame since otherwise seems like a nice collection of recipes.<br /><br />The app will run without the extra video but that requires saying 'later' each time you open it since the dialog to download the extra data shows every time.<br /><br />I've increased my rating now that the downloading issues are resolved. Its a well thought out interface with plenty of pictures for each recipe. Rotating the phone between portrait and landscape switches between text only or pictures of the steps. Designed to be viewed primarily in portrait with a shift to landscape to view videos and pictures. Nice idea and executed well enough. Trouble is that concept doesn't transfer well to tablet devices. Its a bit of a pain with a 7\\" tablet and pretty much unusable with a 10\\" one.<br /><br />I'm also not sure it really is possible to make these in 20 minutes. Quite a few of them have overlapping steps as in while frying this also cut up that. Perhaps if you've made it a few times before and are familiar with all the steps but I cannot see that happening on a new recipe.
1596912855|1.0|Poorly written at a basic level and no magic in thought, insight, or language.    Example:  \\"Argh,\\" Jane arghed.

B0018QOIXU|3.0|I purchased the 2nd Adele album first (21) and liked it so much I wanted her  earlier work.  It's ok, but the second one is so much better.  The production value  on 19 is very inferior compared to the second album.  It very clearly shows what   happens when someone hits it big after their freshman effort.....money flows and   they take out all the stops.  That being said, the songs on 19 are ok, with the big  single being the best.  Wish I had saved my money and just bought the one song.  But Adele is a phenomenon...what a voice on her!

B004LWZW4C|5.0|From reviews I expected a pretty decent movie.  Surprisingly, it was even better than I expected.  I liked all 3 original movies, btw, and I really have to say this was a much better quality movie still.  Good casting and acting.  Good story.  Great introduction to characters and tie-ins to the comic book universe.  Also didn't do anything to upset the time line with the  original movies, which I appreciated.  It was also neat to see actors I didn't even know would be in this movie, plus a ton of good actors who are somewhat recognizable but not enough that I could tell you who they were.  Some things in the story didn't fit 100% with the comics, but just pretty insignificant things, and  I really didn't mind at all.  For instance, it would appear that Scott Summers' brother Alex was older than him?  Aah, that's alright, Havoc was never that big a deal anyway.  And I have to say I liked Banshee in the movie much more than I ever did in the comic.  Not that he really had any lines, it was just really fun seeing him fly and do his scream thing...it always seemed a little lame in the comics.<br />UPDATE: Just wanted to add that it's been almost a year since this was released and it's now continually playing on cable and I find myself getting stuck watching it every time I flip by it.  I really don't think this movie, the story, the casting and acting, all of it, could have been done any better.

B0036T31YY|4.0|A much better film then I thought it would be... very much so! Pretty good acting job from Ms George as well. But you must watch it all-the-way-through. Don't give up on it after 10 minutes. Get your popcorn...  mute your cell phone...  sit down, relax... just enjoy a good movie.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Everything works without any issues on my htc thunderbolt. The only issues is that Vids and picture just dont show on my nook color but Everything Else still works.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Most child actors make their big break starring in children's movies.  Chloe Moretz has done the exact opposite; though she has a string of children's movies on her resume already, she has made her name among the American movie-going public by starring in a bloody horror flick and a vulgar, bloody action flick; both of which are rated R.  And to her credit, both of these movies are probably among the best releases of 2010.  This one, a remake of a Swedish film of a similar name and plot, has Chloe portraying a 12-year old female vampire who develops a relationship with a bullied boy in a small town somewhere in America during the dead of winter.  Her acting is quite impressive, with scenes of romance, action, suspense and drama mixed together.  Her acting is accompanied by good acting by the rest of the cast, most of which, like her, are relative unknowns in Hollywood.  The movie itself is scary and entertaining to watch.  Overall, one of the better films of 2010.  One final comment about her breakout role; she is following a successful path; Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore and Christian Bale made their names by starring in rated-R movies as children.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This thing is like a tank. I go up to New England regularly and this knife is with me every trip. It's short enough to fit in a waist pack which I like. The blade is thick and heavy and you can really beat on it to get through a branch if you need to for campfires or to clear a path. The handle is a composite so it won't rust or split so that's not even a concern. It's one piece of steel so the back is good for pounding as well. I highly recommend this knife if you're a serious adventure or sportsman. On a final note, it isn't pretty, it's practical so you don't have to worry about egravings or anything getting scratched or rusted. Just use it for anything!  p.s. It's made in the USA
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I heard a song on the radio... on a \\"pop station\\" my daughter listens to... I turned it up and thought how 50's or 60-ish the music sounded. It was old R&B type music and vocals with modern recording and production techniques.  That is Adele. I'm amazed that such a talent based in soul, rhythm & blues has achieved a chart topping single! There's hope for real music and artistry after all.  Adele is not the youth pop icon set out in front with manipulative marketing, but an \\"old soul\\" in a young persons body. Her songs aren't bought and paid for but an expression of her true self and her originality. Recorded and produced as they should be, not spit shined to slick for the masses. She is absolutely beautiful, unique and a breath of fresh air in today's music. Hopefully her success will grow and open doors for other such talented but \\"out of the mainstream\\" artists.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I downloaded this with some hesitation, given the several bad reviews for force-closing. I haven't had any issues at all!

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I don't write many reviews but I believe this one should get some praise. I bought this app a few months back for the word and excel editing. It does take a little getting use to the editor features and there is some features not available like in MS Office but that's expected. I use Office 2010 and it renders those documents quite well along with Office 2007.   The only complaint I have is that it does not like SwiftKey X keyboard when editing. When using SwiftKey and trying to edit a word document the letter displayed are not what I typed or it does not type at all. So reverting back to the OEM keyboard is a little frustrating.   Well worth it for free today!
0385340540|4.0|The novel is a little change of pace for the author.  It is not exactly satire, not extactly thriller, and just a little mystery.  The beginning of the novel remind me a little of Senator Al Franken's satire on the Franken presidency.  We have a less then outstanding president in his last days of office making use of his lame duck powers to issue pardons, his chief of staff trying to figure out how to obtain some financial gain, and the CIA wanting in spring an unpopular former wheeler and dealer scumball from prison to use him for bait to pull in some other countries' assassins.  The former wheeler and dealer is quite happy to be out of prison living on the government's dime to make up for some lost time, but he quickly figures out the situation.  He did not get to the top in his former life without having some abilities, and he is willing to give people a run for their money.  He is also not without resources, and quickly learns spycraft.  He trusts almost nobody, but obtains some interesting allies.<br /><br />The reviews of the novel are surprising.  You usually obtain a bell shaped curve with review ratings, but in this case they flatline with an almost even number of one star, two star, three star, four star, adn five star.  I have reviewed hundreds of novels and have developed a few standards.  The novel is well written and, by stanards of a somewhat satirical novel, is definitely well above a one star rating.  It is not an award winning novel, and I would not give it five stars, but it is an interesting plot with a little spy vs. spy.  So, I give it four stars, and some people might give it three.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Rather large with the 80 mb added files. Does what it says. I like what I see so far. No issues whatsoever.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|Once the additional 80 Mb downloads completed, the initial force close issues vanished. However, on my Motorola Xoom, whenever I went to a recipe, the screen was always rotated the wrong way, rendering it almost entirely useless. I suppose when the tablet is flat, you can trick the device, but that's not a reasonable solution. Could be a good or even great app when bugs are fixed.
0470932139|4.0|I am writing a recipe book and this book helped me to understand better how to photograph a plate of food.  The information in this book was organized in such a way as to help me to appreciate the different artistic style choices available and some understanding of the technical aspects necessary to improve my photographs.  It helped me in several situations where, otherwise, I might have felt a bit lost in considering a professional-looking approach to each dish.  Good job.
0553801473|5.0|This book delivers! Maybe not what some people wanted (twists, turns and shocks at every corner, though there are about as many of these in here as in AGOT and ACOK, and more than in AFFC), but a well developed, beautifully written middle game of the best Fantasy saga I've ever read.  There are nitpicks, of course, but they mostly amount to: \\"I wanted it to be longer!\\" If that's the worst I can say of a novel, I can't help but give it five stars.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I think that this was one of the best musicals done by Gene Kelly and the other actors of that time and I watch it at least once a week because I enjoy it that much. I am sure you will too.
0425220931|2.0|I read about half the book and had to stop. I just pictured this guy drunk, talking to himself in the mirror giving himself his own advice and wisdom. I appreciate some of the core information which is why I give it a 2 instead of a 1, but the mystery man aspect was not believable.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Works well on my HTC Sensation 4g. Like the optional download of video. Steps are clear and concise. Makes a great reference for the kitchen. Love the techniques instructions.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Even the cover art gives you no clue to the depth, beauty and humor in this wonderful movie.  The visuals, done by Industrial Light and Magic, are nothing less than breathtaking - each scene is more stunning than the last.  The score is terrific (featuring the peerless trumpet playing of Arturo Sandoval[[ASIN:B00020IO0G Very Best of]]; the cast is marvelous - in case you can't tell, I love this movie!  Even they way this movie was made is a wonderful tale - be sure to watch the \\"making of\\" extras to see how the cast \\"acted out\\" their parts together, rather than reciting them alone in a cold studio booth.  I hope enough people buy this movie to justify a sequel; it is my favorite movie in spite of the fact that my 3.5 year old son has watched it at least twice a day since we got it last week!  Buy this!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love the prediction with this keyboard. It has significantly increased my typing speed and accuracy. When I'm typing in a message field, the \\"return\\" key is primarily a smiley-face emoticon, with a long press bringing up additional emoticons in addition to the return key. Since I rarely use emoticons I wish I could toggle that key to be primarily return, and long-press for emoticons. Not annoying enough to stop using it, but I'd love to see the option to choose the behavior included in an update.
0553582038|2.0|If I hadn't loved the first three books in A Song of Ice and Fire so much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed by this installment.  I expected to have trouble putting it down like I have with the others.  Instead I had trouble picking it up.  Finishing it was a chore.  The book felt about twice as long as it needed to be and introduced a lot of point-of-view characters you only see once and just don't care about.  There are a few interesting plot developments and I'm curious to see where they lead to, but I hope A Dance With Dragons picks up the pace again or else I might be giving up on the series.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I also had the force close upon downloading the file. So I opened settings and pressed download there and it worked fine.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I waited so long for this book.  There are so many good stoies to be told and I feel GRRM  just purposely toyed with his loyal readers!
1592332803|5.0|I bought this book because I have developed a milk allergy and I thought vegan might offer a better option than traditional allergy cookbooks because I am not a fan of eggs either. I have got to say that this book is the best cookbook I have ever owned. The recipes are divine and have completely converted my extremely skeptical husband. The lemon bars are one of the most exquisitely delicious things I have ever tasted. This is in no way a health cookbook but for someone with a child with allergies who would like them to have the normal stuff kids eat or a keen vegan missing their sugar hit, this one is a corker.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I never submit reviews, but this app really deserves it.  I downloaded it, ran in to the force close issue, kept trying and realized it was crashing when it asked to download the extra data (the videos, I assume).  So, I told the app I'd do it later instead if now.  immediately it started up fine, I looked around and then chose to download the extra media.  DONE!  There's something with the pop up download so just do it manually.<br /><br />With that being said, I checked out a bunch of recipes and I'm really excited.  I already told my wife and we're making one tonight for dinner.  everything looks good and, being a fan if Jamie, I know there's great stuff to come.  Don't let the goofy FC put you off, you'll miss out!!!
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|I admit, sometimes people get very confused when I tell them I am a real life (albeit American) version of Becky Bloomwood.  I have a shopping problem.  For example, books are one of my habits instead of scarves.  I have received letter after letter, even calls, from my bank telling me that I owe them money.  I am, for lack of a better word, broke.<br /><br />I first read Confessions of a Shopaholic a few years ago and recently picked it back up.  This might be my favorite light hearted book ever, especially since I find myself leaning towards literary books more than chick lit these days.  This is definitely a fluff book, but seeing as how much I identified with Becky and her troubles, I fell in love with this.  That's really rare for me, considering that I am by nature a pessimist.  I really shouldn't admit that, that's not really a good thing to say.  With her budgets and bills and receipts, I saw flashes of myself on each page, especially the parts about lying about language ability to get a job.  Luckily I deleted that part before I submitted the resume!<br /><br />This book is probably not for everyone. I could see how people might consider her extremely unlikable.  Becky is shallow, somewhat dumb, naïve, and doesn't really care about others in pursuit of fashion and shopping.  She's a girl who is unhappy with her job, unhappy with a lot of things in general, but obsessed with clothes, and by the end of the book, we are able to see how she has changed, mostly for the better.  It's a cute story and a fun read.  It isn't supposed to make you think, and that's why I loved Becky's story and eventually went on to read the rest of the series, which did deteriorate in quality but not enough to turn me off.<br /><br />I've suggested this book to everyone I know.  Some have loved it, some not, but it's a cute, fun pick me up that I wholeheartedly love.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Fantastic \\"swing\\" beat to \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\", first cut. Thank god for the web lyricists who figured out what Bob was saying/singing, even though most of it didn't make sense anyway (ie. \\"I got the pork chop, she got the pie\\"). Super rythum and dance tune! The rest of the album is good, too!
1439152780|5.0|Edie has never been very close to her mother, nor has she thought her mother to be an interesting sort. They just never had anything in common. But when a mysterious letter arrives for Mum, Edie is sucked into a vortex from which there is no escape. The Distant Hours is a wonderful mystery centered around an enchanted castle, a missing lover, the famous Mud Man novel, and three elderly sisters with a BIG secret. The storyline is riveting. I loved every page.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was great. The characters were interesting, it was a very fast and easy read. I have never read a book from a dogs perspective, but after reading this book I would not mind reading more like this. Being a dog lover after reading this book it made me more conscious about my own pets and I find myself talking to them more. The end of the book had a great and small twist. I would highly recommend this book, for what it was, it was GREAT!! Happy page turning, my fellow bookworms! :)
076115678X|5.0|This book has everything you need to know to care for curly hair.  We adopted a little girl with cork screw curls and were thoroughly clueless as to what to do with it.  This book helped me not only to figure out my daughters hair, but I figured out what I was doing wrong with my wavy hair.  We were able to identify the curl type and how best to care for the individual type of curls.  It has recipes for homemade deep conditioners and is chalked full of know how and ideas.  If you need to know how to care for curly hair this book is the best.
B0000256VK|5.0|Avalon is simply one of the best albums ever made.  I have been transported whever I listen to it - it is my go to choice when I most need to take a mind trip to another time.

B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I purchased this app since it was on sale for $5, and I was in need of an office program.  But this one is just horribly done and buggy.  The UI is ugly and difficult to navigate.  The only cloud it integrates with is Google Docs (which I like, but I also use Sugarsync).  But the biggest issue is that it is horribly laggy.  Not opening a program laggy, but laggy while I typed.    I use a bluetooth keyboard connected to my Wifi Xoom, and the onscreen text would lag between 1 and 4 seconds behind what I was actually typing.  Very annoying and made it hard to write.  I tested the keyboard (which had never had an issue) on gmail and note everything and it worked fine.  Tab back to OSP and it was laggy again.  I could work around most issues, but not that one.  That was my final deal killer.    I only tried it for word documents (that was all I needed it for right now), but it failed horribly at that.  And I only tried it on my 3.1 Honeycomb Xoom.  I did not attempt on my Evo (I only wanted it on my Xoom, though), so I don't know if it would work better there.  For all I know it just isn't optimized for tablets.  Keep that in mind.    It did technically \\"work\\" so I can't give it one star, but it was atrocious to use...so 2 stars max.    K--
B00005ATQM|2.0|I put off buying this for awhile - but finally gave in.  At least on my system, it sounds like the bass guitar is hardly in the mix.  I can hear the bass from the bass drum just fine - but comparing it to my regular CD (and the excellent DVD Video Cunning Stunts) the bass guitar is way down in the mix.  This really takes a lot out of the music and makes it sound thin.  I don't think I will play this very often.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This movie is engaging and immersive for its scenery, action, plot and drama.  Loyalty, betrayal, revenge and romance are well represented.  I would have given it five stars except for the girl-power and multi-culti political correctness elements.  Overall, a positive experience that I will watch again and recommend.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Miller, Roderiguez and Tarantino combined their talents to create an amazing film. I clapped and said, \\"Bravo\\" after it was over. Kinda scary since I watched it by myself!! But I sincerely thought it was that good.     It's a comic book vividly brought to life. The special effects are outrageous and over-the-top, just as they should be. It's fun to be drawn into a fantasy world that's full of action, suspense and death-defying feats.     The use of color was both brilliant and stunning. Among other things, it purposefully spares you the gory images of brutally violent actions - just enough to remind you that it is a fictional world. But there's plenty of graphic violence and gore (among other things) ... so this most definitely isn't one for the kids!    The cast includes dozens of actors from diverse backgrounds. Like most films Tarantino is involved in, you'll see unexpected performances from people you probably never have imagined in that role. They're given an opportunity to demonstrate their diversity and they always shine. I'm not giving Tarantino all the credit in choosing the cast, I'm just saying that I expected it when I saw his name - and I was not let down.    I loved it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a story of survival and of an individual who was forced to have three life times without a choice.  Her first life time was from birth up to the age 11 where her biggest worries are her stepfather's criticisms.  In that life time, her worries created a scar and you will see by the way she expresses herself about him.  Her second lifetime began when she was kidnapped at the age of 11 by some strangers who forced her to become an adult overnight by making her do things that no child should be exposed too.  You can see how innocent she is by the way she expresses her thoughts when asked to do such things.  As you keep reading about her second lifetime, you can see how that becomes the norm to her and adjusts to it so quickly.  To the point where she feels \\"the backyard\\" is the only safe place to be.  Her worries then become a question of what would she ever do without the kidnappers...she knew no other way.  Her third lifetime is now...a life time that was also given to her overnight.  She is slowly integrating herself to life, the real way of life.  Learning what a real family is like, learning how to drive, socialize, etc.      Her life had two major life changes that should not ever had happened...everyone else only gets one, from birth till death.  What happens in our life is solely based on the choices we make and they are continuous events that have little to no effect on us (especially compared to Jacycee's life changes).  This has been written in the way she viewed each event and I applaud her for it.  Not everyone has the courage to write and be forced to re-live those moments...I know I wouldn't be able too.      A must read...if she had the courage to write about it, you can have the courage to read it.  It's a story that definitely gives you hope.
B000255LIY|2.0|I was excited to receive this DVD as the main characters were portrayed by two of my favorite award-winning actors: Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart. They delivered strong performances which lived up to their billing, unfortunately, the supporting cast, the directing, the set and costumes were less impressive. At the end of the experience, I fell asleeep while watching the DVD and regretted making the purchase.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|I downloaded the app, with the extra 80 MB from the prompt, this morning onto my Droid X.  No problems with FC at all.    The recipes look amazing, and I really like the hi-res pics and vids included.  The shopping list is a good feature as well.  I also like how Jaime specifies organic/free range ingredients whenever it is practical.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had never seen this production or these actors before, and purchased the DVD based on strong customer reviews and an interest in this period of British history after reading \\"God is an Englishman\\" by Danderfield.  This production was perfect in tone, directing, acting and visually beautiful.  It had a more contemporary and fluid feel than the usual \\"costume drama\\" and this contributed to the pleasure of this viewer. The quality of the production and story-telling was similar to that of a major motion picture.  I recommend this DVD enthusiastically for lovers of historical fiction, BBC type dramas, costume dramas and those interested in the industrial revolution era in Britain.
B0040YFR1Y|2.0|Adrien Brody as an action hero is like casting Wally Cox as Superman! And that sorry Clint Eastwood impression? This miscasting ruined what could have been a decent action adventure film. Sorry, but that merits a loss of 3 stars alone... Topher Grace played it just creepy enough to pull off a psychotic murderer, but it wasn't much of a surprise, when after all, all the others were supposed to be some major bad-ass merc... so a doctor, very out of place and predictable! So very sad because they could have focused on the new kind of predator that Fishburn's character spoke of... by the way, when he showed up one hour into the film, I said to myself, finally an actor that makes me believe he's a bad-ass... the rest just made me feel I was watching a bunch of pre-adolescents pretending in the back yard!!! Ugh!
B004TTZHBK|4.0|This is for everyone who is having issues with the force close.  When you download and start up the app for the first time and it asks you to download the 80mb of data just select no.  That should allow you to enter the app and check it out.  When you are ready just go into the settings and select to download the media.  For some reason there is a glitch with the app if you try to do it first thing.  Hope this helps!  I really like the app otherwise and it would be 5 stars if this wasn't and issue.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Awesome game. if you like guns and glory or even if you don't you'll probably enjoy this game.I got it for free but I would buy it. too bad there isn't a free ad version.

B004TTZHBK|1.0|Something very wrong with download on VZW Droidx.  Even with wireless it aborts the app.  Might be nice if it worked.
B004MNAGBO|5.0|I just watched the DVD version of this film purchased as an import from Amazon.uk. This is an absolutely fantastic film in the tradition of the great Brit war films made during the 1950s and '60s before political correctness ruined the genre. No moralizing here. None of this \\"the real enemy is us\\" crap. It is based on the true story of one of the first commando raids into Norway to capture secret German radar detection equipment. The actual team was formed by British spy novelist Ian Flemming (of James Bond fame). The action is taught and not overly gorey (in 1960s tradition). The suspense is thrilling and the storyline authentic. Sean bean leads a group cast which carries of the film wonderfully. They actually trained with British Royal marine commandoes to make the show authentic. Weaponry is also authentic, German lugars, MP40s and British tommy guns (Commandos did use those) and Lee Enfields (including a sniper version). Uniforms are also accurate (including not only the Brits but also German SS and Mountain troops). The only CGI I could see is of a night shot of a Halifax bomber delivering the team to Norway. I won't reveal the plot any more in order to not ruin the film. Bottom line - if you like war films, particularly world war 2 themes, and especially if you are a fan of special forces or British Ealing Studios films of the 1950s, buy this......NOW!!!!
0316098329|5.0|very captivating.  I was disoriented for a time after reading it and it really caused me to look at my own environment in a completely different way.
B00004R997|5.0|The price was exelent,     i am happy that i could buy a classic Disney movier for  a dollar or two
B004EPYZSK|5.0|A man awakens in the desert to complete memory loss. The only clue to his past is a picture of a young woman and a metal contraption locked around his forearm. When he arrives in a nearby town of Absolution, trouble isn't far behind. But when strange lights from the sky arrive and begin shooting up the town and abducting its residents, the survivors decide to risk all to hunt the kidnappers and find their loved ones.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays the amnesiac who comes to be known as Jake Lonergan. Craig is a stoic, hard man with a soft heart. When his past is revealed it's a bit of a shock, since it seemed to be against his nature. Harrison Ford also stars as Woodrow Dolarhyde, a tough war veteran, now rich and feared by the town and his employees. Sam Rockwell is Doc, a saloon owner who tries to toughen up to save his wife from abduction. And Olivia Wilde is the mysterious and beautiful Ella who seems to know something about Jake. The acting is solid and believable. Each character stands out and made the film worth watching.<br /><br />The characters and their stories are really what made the film. While the men had rough and tough exteriors, there was still plenty of heart. The feel was definitely a Western meets Alien, with plenty of violence and intense suspense and action. Clever one-liners throughout gave the film some much-needed laughs and light-hearted moments. Fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat excitement from beginning to end, Cowboys & Aliens certainly lives up to the hype.<br /><br />The story is only roughly based on the original graphic novel. This is a different story, yet still has riveting characters, a mystery, and non-stop adventure. This was the film I was looking forward to most this summer. And I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. The Old West setting was charming yet gritty. And the aliens are brutal and extremely powerful, but underestimate humans, so it's not a completely hopeless situation, nor silly. Both genres are treated with respect. Flawlessly blending Western action and gun-slinging with a high-tech alien invasion, this summer blockbuster is completely unique and altogether fantastic.stern action and gun-slinging with a high-tech alien invasion, this summer blockbuster is completely unique and altogether fantastic.

B00012BSHG|5.0|I bought this pool for me to lounge in since I live in a hot area. This pool is a good size and the padded bottom is a great addition which makes it so comfy to sit in. I have the pool sitting on a tarp on the grass. I'm 5'6 and me and my boyfriend can fit in this pool with plenty of room for a third adult person. Three of us fit just fine without even touching & spralled out. The walls are so strong you can put your full weight (I'm almost 200 lbs) against it and kick back with your arms on the sides resting. It's a very comfortable pool. It only takes 10 min. to blow up  and to drain it is super easy. I have the orange, yellow, green striped pool and the drain is towards the lower side of the pool. I let alittle air out then put my foot on the side to drain the rest on the grass & lift it up & turn it over. I dont deflate the whole pool as it's easy to dump the water after this so I store it in my shed still part way blown up for next time, just add alittle more air. Since we are adults we dont jump around in it, just cool off with a beer so I cannot tell you how it stands up with kids playing in it. It still shocks me how big it is & it's pretty too but yet compact enough to put it on a patio if need be, just use a tarp under it. Enjoy!
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Judge Patrick Naugle, DVD Verdict-- Now comes Paul, which isn't as good as either of their previous efforts but still gets more right than it gets wrong. Pegg and Frost collaborated on the screenplay while Greg Mottola (who helmed the amusing Superbad) took over the directing reigns from Wright. The finished product is a goofy, silly slacker alien comedy that never takes itself too seriously. It's hard not to have an endearing love for a movie that features a lot of jokes about an alien's 'junk'.<br /><br />Paul's best laughs come from its smaller moments, especially between Pegg and Frost. At this point it feels as if the two actors are (to steal a Kevin Smith phrase) \\"heterosexual life mates,\\" and their banter is often side splitting and touching at the same time. It's rare that a movie can take two actors and make you believe they are best friends; since Pegg and Frost are buddies in real life, it's an easy transition that works in the movie's favor. Seth Rogan as the title character is funny, although it's sometimes hard to look past Rogan's very dense and familiar persona and see a character behind Paul's eyes. It's to Rogan's credit that after a while I was able to get into Paul's groove and actually care about his eventual outcome.<br /><br />Another reason for Paul's success is that it features a talented supporting cast. Saturday Night Live seems to have its paws all over this film, with Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader taking on supporting roles (both are funny, though Wiig's character grates after a while). Jason Bateman is at his deadpan best as an agent trying to find Paul; Bateman is quickly becoming the go-to guy in blockbuster comedies lately, and for good reason--he's funny. Amusingly, there are two very funny cameos in the film that will tickle movie buffs, neither of which I will spoil in this review except to say that their connection to this film makes a lot of sense once you see and hear them.<br /><br />Paul's only real misstep is that it sometimes revels too heavily and lengthily in slacker humor, almost at times to the breaking point. Pot jokes abound (note to filmmakers and Seth Rogan: we get it, you like to smoke weed...now let's move on) and the profanity in the film, while never offensive, wears thin especially with Kristen Wiig's character. The screenplay sometimes oversteps its bounds by allowing jokes to pop up one too many times (characters fainting after seeing an alien is funny once; four times, not so much) and taking too many malicious jabs at religion (again, amusing at first but that wears thin fast). Yet, these are mostly nitpicks; what the movie does, it usually does very well.<br /><br />I readily enjoyed Paul; it's a movie that doesn't try too hard to be likable and, while it's not a classic, it's still a lot of fun with good effects work (the character of Paul is believable even when you know he's just an onscreen computer graphic) and enough sci-fi geekiness to placate fanboys and regular viewers. Here's hoping Pegg and Frost keep making movies; they're a couple of true diamonds in the rough.<br /><br />Paul is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen in 1080p resolution. Universal's work on this hi-def picture is excellent and pleasing to the eye. The movie isn't overly flashy (even though it has its fair share of special effects work), but even without all the razzmatazz (finally I got to use the word \\"razzmatazz\\" in a sentence!) this is an excellent looking picture. There's nary a speck of dust, dirt or any other imperfection in the image. Whatever you may think of this movie, the fact remains that Paul sparkles on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The soundtrack is presented in a fun, rollicking DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix that features heavy use of the side, rear and front speakers. There are many moments during Paul where the action dictates a lot of surround sound effects that are both exciting and comedic (especially the music score by David Arnold, who also coincidentally composed the score for Independence Day). Dialogue, effect and music are all evenly recorded and well mixed. Overall both the video and audio presentations are top notch. Also included on this disc are soundtracks in DTS 5.1 in French and Spanish, as well as English, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />There are a fair amount of extra features included on this edition of Paul, including an amusing commentary track by director Greg Mottola, producer Nira Park and actors Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Bill Hader; a rather extensive 'making of' featurette titled \\"Between the Lightening Strikes: The Making of Paul\\" (which included cast and crew interviews and behind the scenes footage); eight behind-the-scenes featurettes (\\"RV Doorway: The Cast of Paul On-Location,\\" \\"Runway Santa Fe: An Interview with Nancy Steiner,\\" \\"Smithereens,\\" \\"5th Date Level Direction: The Cast on Greg Mottola,\\" \\"Mexico Zero: The Locations of Paul,\\" \\"The Many Pauls,\\" \\"Paul the Musical\\" and \\"The Traveler Beagle) that highlight everything from locations to CGI effects to the casting of the film; a 15 minute featurette on the visual effect of the film (\\"The Evolution of Paul\\"); a very short featurette on the Jeffrey Tambor character Adam Shadowchild (\\"Who The Hell is Adam Shadowchild\\"),\; a blooper reel; \\"Simon's Silly Faces\\" (exactly what it sounds like);six galleries of photos and behind-the-scenes snapshots; some trailers and TV spots; BD Live features and a bonus digital copy/DVD of the film.<br /><br />Note: two versions of the film are included, a 104 minutes theatrical cut and a 110 minutes \\"Director's Cut.\\"<br />-Full review at dvdverdict,comvenly recorded and well mixed.

The pictures are gorgeous, the recipes are wonderful (as most are from JO) and it is so easy to use!! I love it!! The video tips included with each recipe are just the frosting on this Jamie Oliver cake. I did have some force close problems like others are reporting, but it's few and far between. I love that when you rotate the phone and double tap, there are beautiful photos to help you along the way. GREAT APP JO!

B004EPYZOY|4.0|What is Drive Angry?  Well its not \\"Faster\\", it's not \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\", and it sure isn't anything I've seen before.    First of all, don't see this film for Nic Cage freakout moments, that's what youtube is for.  He gets a little angry...and yes, he drives a car...but the star of this movie is without a doubt, William Fitchner.  Every second of him on screen puts a smile on your face.  It's one of those films where you can absolutely tell the actors were having fun making it.  Is it worth $15-$20...nope...but on a hot summer night when you and your friends don't know what to do, order a pizza (or $5 Pzones), grab a bunch of beer, kick back, and just have some fun....that's all this movie really is.    People who give this film 1 star don't really know what they're talking about I think...what did they expect?  Ask yourself what you expect after reading this:    \\"A sweet, sassy country gal meets a man who has come back from hell in order to stop a cult leader from murdering his granddaughter...along the way, the devil's right-hand man, The Accountant, forces him to play a game of cat and mouse while we figure out what side The Accountant is really on\\"...oh, also, there's a gun called The God Killer...and it kicks ass.    ya...really...if you rent this film, know what you're getting yourself into...this is pure mindless fun....now who's got a cold one for me?
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app does everything it promises and does it well. I&apos;ve enjoyed tracking my bike rides with the Cycle feature.

B004TTZHBK|3.0|The app is gorgeous. The best looking one I've seen in a long time (maybe ever!). However, I won't be downloading the extra recipes because it is 80MB!!!
B004XQO90E|4.0|The movie opens with gorgeous shots of Chicago.  It's a beautiful day and the regular train heading into the city is passing by houses, fields, forests...and then the main character wakes up.  A gorgeous woman is mid-conversation with him and yet he has no idea who she is, or what she's talking about....a few minutes later, the train explodes and he dies.    Then he wakes up...he's in a SIM and being asked to go back and redo everything we just saw...a woman then calls him \\"Captain\\", and says he will have ten mins just like before.    Opening the film is also some of the best Hitchcock-themed music I've ever heard.  It really sets the stage for what will be a thriller with a small budget.  There are essentially 3 sets...a train, a SIM unit, and a command center...that's it...no wild foot chases through the streets of Chicago, no machine guns, planes shooting missiles, etc....its a simply story, where the viewer discovers things at the same time as the central character.  This means one thing...we get to guess what is about to happen...this ads the \\"fun\\" aspect, something much needed in a film where we watch a man being repeatedly murdered.    It is definitely a science fiction film, having time-travel...or something like it...thrown in to the typical terrorist yarn.  Of all the films mentioned I agree with everyone who says this is Quantum Leap meets Groundhog day...maybe with a little Deja-Vu peppered in.    Don't expect Transformers 3, Bad Boys, Iron Man, The Town, etc...this isn't a 100 million dollar summer blockbuster...its a small science fiction story that every person needs to see at least once.  As for me, I saw it in theaters twice...something I rarely ever do (Inception, Dark Knight, Iron Man, Catch Me If You Can, and Chicago are the only films that come to mind).    Finally, the ending is jaw dropping, makes zero sense, and requires another viewing or two...talk about it with friends, that's what good films are supposed to make you do anyway.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Yeah, I read the one-star and two-star reviews.  And I know critics hated this movie, as reflected on the Rotten Tomatoes site.  But I thought it was thrilling and provocative.  Now.  Did I completely understand it?  Not even hardly.  And all I can say in favor of its originality is that it \\"appropriated\\" from interesting sources (especially anime, videogames and music videos) and made good use of them.  But it so excels in three specific features that I'm willing to forgive a lot, because these are features that matter a lot to me (if they don't matter to you, you might hate it):    1) It is visually stunning.  That alone will never make me like a movie, but it sure can make up for some uneven performances and thin plotting--which \\"Sucker Punch\\" also contains.  But the look of the thing paved over enough other weaknesses that I could appreciate...    2) ...an awesome soundtrack.  The action and eye-popping settings were well-wed to some wonderfully creative takes on classic songs from Queen, The Eurhythmics, Jefferson Airplane, and Bjork, among others.  It even closes, after some of the credits, with a fascinating little duet version of Roxy Music's \\"Love is the Drug.\\" But what I've described so far only marks \\"Sucker Punch\\" as perhaps an appealing extended music video, on par perhaps with something like [[ASIN:B004LV3VQE Heavy Metal [Blu-ray]]]. What, for me, distinguishes \\"Sucker Punch\\" is its...    3) ...surreal and complex storyline.  Did the ending undercut the entire meaning of the film?  I think it did.  But did it?  I don't know.  Was the story uplifting or nihilistic, or worse yet, messianic?  Again, not entirely sure.  And I love that.  It hasn't let me go yet.  I might end up realizing that I've been ruminating on nothing--that there is \\"no there, there.\\"  But from where I sit right now, and trusting the director of the substantial [[ASIN:B001QTXM5Y Watchmen: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] as I do, I am willing to give it the benefit ofthe doubt and assume that it's worth some thought.  And to me that is the ultimate compliment that I can pay any film--that I don't immediately forget it the moment it's over.    Those who hate \\"Sucker Punch,\\" I get it.  It would be at least as easy to hate as it is to love, like a cheese with a strong, unusual flavor, or some exotic candy.  But if visuals, score, and apparent complexity are among your criteria for a worthwhile movie-watching experience, don't let the naysayers dissuade you. \\"Sucker Punch\\" is unique, and might just be a masterpiece--at least a cult masterpiece.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Get an editor! Finish the story! Is that really so hard? Review the first 3 books and make the next one like those!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I felt strangely lacking at the end of this book.  Don't get me wrong, it was brilliantly written like her other two books, but I was so upset with most of it.  I was frustrated with the relationship between Katniss and Gage? (I can't remember her friend's name now, oops) and most of all with the relationship between her and Peeta.  I felt that their relationship most of all needed more closer or something, I don't know.  I just didn't think that most of the things that happened to Katniss, needed to happen.  I think she had experienced enough loss and pain that enough was enough, and the ending was just a little overboard.  I'm just not sure I liked this book, I know it was my least favorite of the 3 books.  I'm thinking I'll read the trilogy over again and maybe add to the review if my opinion changes.  Read for yourself and see what you think...
140053271X|5.0|I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it.  My mom owns a Kindle, one sister a Nook Color, another sister a 1st Edition Nook...so I've seen my fair share of e-readers.  I did the research before I bought.  I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father's Day.  But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me.  I have problems with my hands and their abilities, so after a full day of commuting, typing, and writing, they've reached their peak.  It was the right choice for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had a hard time with beginning this book.  When I first started the book, I was so unnerved and upset by the content, that I almost put the book down.  However, the author was very creative in the way that she wrote it and she manages to draw me into the characters and emotionally invest me in their lives and before I knew it, I was done with the book and continuing onto the second one.  If someone had told me what the book was about, I would not have read it.  However, in hindsight, I enjoyed the book and I would read it again.  Great job and drawing me in , Suzanne...brilliantly done!
1401301010|5.0|One of the best reads I've read. Anthony let's you in and puts you in his world from him using, to the natal day of The Red Hots. This book will take you on the most psychedelic love rollercoster you have been on. It opens up your brain map; drives down every road and highway and really makes you ponder.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was my favorite one out of the trilogy.  It was infuriating, and I found myself wanting to throw the book a few times, but I'm glad I stuck with it and finished reading it.  All in all, it was a great read.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I am really pleased of this product.   Was a little sceptical at first, but I do really hate the original controllers for PS3.   They are just too small for my hands, and I've grown quite fond of the Xbox 360's controller.   And this is just that,a Xbox controller for PS3.    The controller feels more acurate then the original one,  and everything works like a charm (six-axis and rumble).   The battary lasts longer than the PS3 original too.    The only negative that I found yet is the rubber texture on the grips.   It's not that comfy,but you'll get used to it.   And the light is red and bright from the \\"home\\" button,but u can turn that off.
0553801473|5.0|I really don't get it why average vote is just 2.9 for this book. I give it 5 stars because for me it is as good as the first 3 ones.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I am always careful to read some reviews before downloading the apps I am interested in. This one seemed all over the map...so I gave it a try. Easy installation, no force closes, smooth video, great instruction and great tips, recipes, information! I am really going to llove cooking some of these recipes..and I can hope that maybe more would be added as time goes on? hint, hint!
B001LXIDVS|2.0|This is the point where the dam breaks for the BTTF trilogy. Without the innocent, loose grasp of reality present in the first film, nor the amusing, campy glimpses of the future seen in the second, there's really not all that much to look forward to as this bad western lolls its way toward the finish line. Marty McFly and Doc Brown still make for strong core characters, ones we desperately want to see come out ahead, but they've got their arms full here with a stale set of recurring gags, a base premise that's thin at best and a hammy love story that doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the table. Where the original was able to effortlessly skirt the holes that speckled its plot, the saga's grand finale bowls straight through them with no regard for the repercussions, leaving audiences skeptical. A needless leap across both genre and era, at least it has the dignity to close the door behind it when the credits queue.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|First rate series.  Mild sex, lotsa action, cute robots, fast moving and references to \\"the American Empire\\".  Production values are top-notch.  Charactrs are believable, Political system dreadful (but realistic) - Japan in 30 - 40 years??<br />Maybe.  Whatever, a bit mystical but a first rate series.
1400079144|2.0|The Lost Symbol was exciting and enlightening until close to the end when the bad guy gets caught. Then for some reason the author becomes philosophical and theological. This is when speed reading helps. I did learn a lot from the book as I usually do with one on Dan Brown's works; however, he really messed up the last chapters. I would recommend it and stopping when you feel he is lost. Not his best work. He must have been rushing to get it out.
0307887960|1.0|This is nothing but a new twist on the Atkins low-carb protocol. Save your money and buy the original Atkins diet. I also didn't care for how the Dukan diet recommends aspartame and splenda, while ignoring an all natural product - stevia. If you want to stick with Dukan, fine, but purchase Dr. Atkin's 'Vita-Nutrient Solution' - a great book discussing nutritional deficiencies, toxins in the Standard American Diet, and their link to obesity.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|best game ever!! I am so addicted it is not even funny. I have like 120 or so elements so far!! :)
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I've got a Droid Charge, and downloaded this app with no problems.  I decided to save space and not download the videos - I like to cook, but I wanted some new recipes.  These look wonderful, and the step-by-step instructions really make the videos completely unnecessary.  No force closes, no failures, no nothing other than yummy looking recipes!  I can't say as I would have paid $7.99 for it, as I have cookbooks at home, but for free it's a can't miss! :)
B004TTZHBK|5.0|No problems for my Cyanogen 7 Nook Color. Lovin' the interface and straight-forward writing. Good for a guy who isn't a chef but can at least stir fry some meat &amp; veggies. I followed the advice to download the videos later, and I don't have auto-orientation enabled on my tablet.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I already owned the earlier version of this DVD set, but I purchased it mainly for the bonus Beatle interviews.  One advantage to this new version: you can play The Beatles' performances by themselves, if you don't want to watch the other acts (which are very entertaining).
B004LV32VS|5.0|Honestamente debo manifestar que la espera de un nuevo album me estaba desesperando y por fin lleg&oacute; a mi mano este espectacular album. Confieso que la portada es increiblemente genial, a&ntilde;os que no veia algo tan original e interesante, son 10 temas espectaculares, creo que despu&eacute;s de Witchcraft, Graveyard lleva el nombre del Hard Rock sueco muy alto.<br />La primera entrega fue mas que devastadora y monumental, por ende este no pod&iacute;a quedarse atr&aacute;s, si bien es cierto que mantienen el sonido y la frescura de tocar con alma y sangre pero da la impresi&oacute;n que estuvieran en una sala de ensayo.<br />Desde el d&iacute;a que sali&oacute; el primer disco me volv&iacute; un fan&aacute;tico y este album llena mis espectativas.<br />S&oacute;lo quiero concluir diciendo que esta banda NO ES stoner rock.<br />GRAN ALBUM Uno de los mejores del 2011.
B001C46P2K|5.0|How did I miss this when it originally came out?  After watching it, I went off in search of the back-story; spent hours reading Wikipedia and other sites and ordered Weintraub's bio of Prince Albert (which I just finished).  Found the movie to be mostly faithful to the \\"big picture\\" truths of history, and found that \\"the rest of the story\\" (to quote Paul Harvey) even more amazing than the movie.  Just goes to show that real life is a whole lot more interesting than what people can make up.  Fabulous music, too!  (And this Blu-ray is amazingly clear!)
0545123267|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was romantic, and sad, and scary, and everything else you want in a good book!    Grace was attacked by wolves when she was young, but was saved by a yellow eyed wolf. After that she had a connection with him that lasted through the years. Every winter her wolf came back, and they shared that connection from afar. When Grace turned 17, a local boy was killed by the wolves, which made some of the locals decide to shoot the wolves in Mercy Falls. Grace couldn't let anything happen to her wolf, so she ran into the woods to try to protect him, and that's when the story really begins. I won't say more because some people may live under a rock and don't know the story, but suffice it to say that Grace and Sam, the wolf, get closer together.    This was a beautiful love story. It was very well written, and everything that happened moved the story along, so well, in fact, that I could hardly put it down. I read it in one day, and I will say that I absolutely loved the ending! I have no idea where they are going to go in the second book of the series, Linger, but I can't wait to find out!    In summary, excellent story, great romance, awesome writing!! I highly recommend it to anybody who has not read it yet :)
B001JRB16U|5.0|Loved this movie when I was younger and still do.  I gave a \\"Mary Poppins\\" party for some students at my school and we all watched & sang together.  A classic musical for all ages!!
B00275EHJG|4.0|My kids like all 3 Toy Story movies, however they liked [[ASIN:B0030IIYYS Toy Story 2]] the best, followed by [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]] and then this one.    If you already have the other two, then definitely get this one. If you don't have them, perhaps get one of the other 2 first. You probably should start out in sequence and go with the first one.    Overall I give this 4 stars. I'm grading this against the other two. The other two set the bar really high!
1416550550|4.0|I found the book engrossing, if maybe a bit long. Very twisty and turny as you try to discover the truth...much better than 'The House at Riverton'.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|Rango was definitely not as good as I had expected. The plot had a lot of potential, but things moved much *much* too slowly. Aside from this, I was surprised by the amount of not-so-family-friendly content. This ranged from suggestive material to bad language. After watching Rango with some friends, we all agreed that we would not be interested in seeing it again, nor would we recommend it to anyone.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Seems beautifully done, snappy and with his trademark charm. Dl'd fine on 3g but should advise to dl media over wifi so as to prevent fc issues.
B003Y3GTOG|5.0|I love these shoes! I love them so much I bought one in every color AND recommended them to all my friends. Luckily I bought these at the store first so I knew my size. Sometimes with Crocs, sizing can be off. I'm between a 5-6. Tennis shoes I'm a 6, stilettos I'm a 5. These are a perfect 5 for me. It's really a must have pair of shoes in my opinion!
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Love Jamie and his recipes. This app is fantastic! I am not able to download the extra media, though. Force close every time. Looking forward to the recipes and love the style of presenting the steps.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Works fine on G2. Looks great and has interesting recipes with pictures and videos if you need them. Well worth it especially for free.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I love the shopping list feature, I love the educational videos, and I'm loving the quality of the user interface. This app is not only full of great recipes and information from Jamie Oliver, it's fun to use!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|it is a great app. there are some hiccups but as long as you get it working its pretty good.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|Decent app, but force closes like crazy. I'm currently stuck at installing the 80mb update, which it has downloaded, but can't install. Its stuck in the force close loop.
B002S0OBMS|3.0|I have not seen this show, but I have listened to the music a number of times. I will say I am in the crowd who believes the crown jewel in Mr. Webber's portfolio \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" should not have had a sequel; its mysterious ending was perfect for the show that it was.<br /><br />What I noticed most about this show is how similar it sounds to his past shows. While similarities in themes and melodies are not uncommon when a composer produces a new work, they seemed to be abundant here. Most notably were themes from The Woman in White, The Beautiful Game, Aspects of Love, Sunset Boulevard, even a little Evita thrown in. The first time I listened to this recording there were songs I was hearing for the first time, yet humming along to them because I already knew the melody.<br /><br />While recurring themes are somewhat acceptable for a composser (even from previous shows), I was shocked at the reuse of almost an entire song. The title song of the show, \\"Love Never Dies\\" is the exact same melody as the \\"Finale\\" of The Beautiful Game (\\"We have to love. Try to forgive more. No child was ever born to hate.\\" and \\"Love never fades. Love never alters. Hearts may get broken. Love endures.\\").<br /><br />There were two songs that stood out for me as original and refreshing, \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" and \\"Look With Your Heart.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this show was OK for me. I liked a couple of the new songs, but the story was predicable and the music way too familiar.
0553801473|3.0|See the review by Kate Morris \\"These dragons don't dance, they stumble\\" from July 14, 2011 for a comprehensive take. But I'll add my two cents to say that the content of this book could have been communicated in 100 pages.<br /><br />Martin needed an editor to just say \\"no\\".<br /><br />One day, just for kicks, when the entire set is published, somebody is going to go and edit them down to a decent trilogy (maybe 4 books) and the result of that effort will be awesome (maybe - depending on how he actually ends the books).<br /><br />in the mean time, this book simply did not need to exist.
B004R2HGMC|5.0|The music has been remastered and I compared this recording to ABBA's Greatest Hits album.  The sound quality is much better.<br /><br />The booklet describing how Super Trouper was created is very interesting.  Here you can learn what a \\"Super Trouper\\" really is,  and the double entendre that Bjorn makes out of the device.  There are interesting anecdotes about Benny and Bjorn going to warmer climes to try and knock out some songs,  and meeting Michael Paelin from Monty Python fame.<br /><br />Fans have known for a while that Winner Takes it All is not about the break-up of Agnetha and Bjorn,  but this gives a few more reasons why that is so,  and describes a bit more how the song came to be.<br /><br />Overall,  I'm happy.  This album adds value to my enjoyment of ABBA's music.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Amazon's choice to support Kindle app for Android 1.6+ has left many users out in the cold.  Sure, I can read my kindle books with the Kindle for PC app, but not being able to take them with me and use with my android tablet running android 1.5 is very disappointing.  If they would offer a program that would allow the books to be converted to epub or PDF, even if still DRMed, I would probably have given this a better review.    Once again, Amazon has let me down.
B001DF68MA|5.0|After a horrible experience with the [[ASIN:B000H4E7EO iBert Safe-T Front Mounted Child Bicycle Seat]], I went with the WeeRide Kangaroo.  My 2 year old fit better in this seat, and it felt 100% stable and safe.  Being able to keep an eye on and protect your little one is such a great feeling, and you know they will enjoy the ride much more by getting a front seat at the action!    Plusses over the iBert:  Much more secure  Will fit a larger child  Child does not turn with the handlebars  Should fit more bike styles  Padded area for them to hold on to so they don't touch the brakes/shifters    Wish I found out about the WeeRide seat from the start!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|An addictive tower defense game that is both great in concept and execution. This however does not make up for the poor graphics and load times. Android users deserve some quality apps to. Don't trash this market. I paid $3 for this game just like the ipad users.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Will not allow you to view any recipes, it simply force closes whenever you try to do anything.  Running honeycomb on Galaxy 10.1
B004TTZHBK|4.0|The app by itself runs fine and is very slick! The recipes are very detailed and are easy to follow. Everything you need to start is already included in the app; the additional 80mb of data are for pictures to the already easy steps and the tip videos.   I didnt give it 5 stars because I also kept foreclosing when I attempted the 80mb download. Well that didn't stop me from enjoying the app though! I really recommend this app even without the bonus things. Galaxy S 4G
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Installed a while ago and since the last update through amazon app store it won't even shoe up on my phone at all!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|And I'm impressed. this Jamie fellow really seems to know what he is doing. he gives you a list of fine recipes ( easy also! ) and walks you through them in a clear, concise, manner. i thought it might be a bit gimmicky, but the pictures and videos are thorough, the advice frank, and the recipes legitimate without brands (from what I've seen). i recommend it. Im still trying to figure out what a pat of butter means, and I had to get around downloading the 80 MB of stuff on another screen instead of the front page ( kept force closing), but I recommend it. extremely valuable for beginning and seasoned cooks. He really teaches you.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  So much wishful thinking while reading<br />this book, that the world really could become a more peaceful<br />and understanding place.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This turns out to be a pretty nice case. Since it has a back, it's a bit thicker than some of the other \\"bumper\\" style cases for iphones, but it's of a sufficiently durable material, has an interesting pattern on the back which 'emanates' from your phone's apple logo, and even includes a screen protector.    The cutouts fit the buttons so perfectly on my at&t iPhone, that I wonder how it works with the verizon one, where some of the these buttons have supposedly changed location. But they say it works for both, so I'll leave it to other on vzw to figure that one out.      I think this has saved the glass back on my iPhone a few times (who makes the BACK of a phone out of glass?)    In any case, a great value for under $10. Thanks Amazon!
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is another book I found simply because it was recommended to people who also liked reading Austin Nights (by herocious). I'm very glad I read this book. I'm usually not into non-fiction. And while I don't think I have what it takes to self-publish (I'm still young and wanting to live for the sheer joy of it), I will read this book again when I get around to self-publishing because I fully intend on doing someday. I mean, why not? Thank you David for taking the time to put this little book together.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|I really like the format of this cooking app, but attempting to download the pictures and videos causes a force close every time on my Thunderbolt.  Would be 5 stars if I could actually use all the features.
0765322889|4.0|I was having a hard time with this book at first. I picked it up and put it down three times while I finished up what was left of the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. Well then I was left with nothing to read so I picked up this book for a fourth time. By the end I was breath taken! Besides the vivid imagery created, what I liked was that it had and ending. Not a forever cliff hanger. I like that each book ends yet leaves you wanting more. A skill a lot of series writers don't have. Oh but can Erikson describe a fight! Just brush up on your vocabulary with these.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Works just fine. Evo3d I see this being quite useful.  Works just fine works just fine  Bjhg hfgg hfdfb hgg
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Watched Crossroads tonight having seen it upon its release 25 years ago but remembering very little about it.  Fortunately Crossroads has held up pretty well and is still very entertaining. Ralph Macchio plays Eugene, a classical guitar student whose true passion is the blues.  Upon discovering forgotten aging blues harmonica legend Willie Brown in a NY criminal nursing facility, Eugene breaks him out and the two head for Mississippi.  Eugene is lured by Willie's promise to reveal to him a long lost song by real-life blues guitarist Robert Johnson, while Willie himself is on a mission to undo a deal he made with the devil as a much younger man.  Along the way the two partner with Frances (Jami Gertz), a runaway teenager heading to LA to make her way there.<br />The movie plays out in part as a road-trip movie, in part as a music movie, and in part as a mythical battle between good and evil.  It's an odd mix but it's pulled off very skillfully.  The biggest criticism would be the just slightly unconvincing performances by Macchio and especially Gertz.  Eugene has a lot of attitude and moxie but never truly convinces us that he has really learned the blues.  And Gertz is simply too fresh-faced and green to pull off the hardened streetwise runaway role.  But neither performance is bad and they certainly don't derail the intriguing storyline or diminish the superb musical scenes.  And what wonderful music we get in Crossroads!  Much of the soundtrack work is done by the magnificent guitarist Ry Cooder and rock legend Steve Vai has a role in the climactic duel between Eugene and the devil's minion musician.  It is also worth noting that even though Macchio doesn't play the guitar passages it looks an awful lot like he does.  Props to those involved in filming and staging his guitar scenes, they are very well done!<br />Overall Crossroads is a very enjoyable movie.  The story is creative and intriguing, the direction and artistic work is superb (the black & white flashback scenes in particular are wonderful), and the music is top notch.  Don't write this one off just because it's a product of the 80s or because it stars the Karate Kid himself - if you do you'll be missing out on a real gem.in particular are wonderful), and the music is top notch.

0143145088|1.0|Not really anything new here. Maslow nailed it years before with the five needs hieracrchy. Mcgregor's Theory X and Y is essentially the same thing as X and I. F. Herzberg's Motivator/Hygiene Dual Structure Theory parrots the same concepts.
B002T44ZYW|5.0|I thought that this was a good book for a short summer read. I liked the ending and I thought that this gives regular people a look on how celebs feel about getting famous and how it feels to start out. Great job LC!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app looks great and it has a lot of potential. I can easily imagine this as one of the apps I would pull up to impress people - it looks that good and it has real world usefulness. Of course, that comes at a cost and this app is extremely large for a relatively small amount of recipes.    Like others here, I'm finding it impossible to run without constant force closes on my Transformer and Nook Color. I'm giving it 5 stars but this is based on the assumption that the FC issues get resolved soon. I'll live with a few issues for now.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Installed on my lg optimus and works brilliantly! It is so well presented and easy to use. While the initial app has a small footprint, it does require an additional 80mb download for the rest of the media.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|I don't think I will be buying anything from this group again And I would like to know what kind of quality control this group has because my dvd has a cut in it and the dvd skips through out the entire movie and I understand I bought this movie used but I also paid for one day shipping the dvd did get here fast but whats the point of owning a dvd that does this I plan on making a call tomorrow
B004TTZHBK|5.0|People please don't rate this app as a 1-2 STARS because it doesn't work on your phone - unfair! I have EVO 3d and this program ROCKS! It is very intuitive, clear and easy to follow direction, great pictures and videos! Most comprehensive cooking program by far! Thanks Amazon!
B004TTZHBK|2.0|get error when I try to download extra content.  myTouch 4G.  please fix. looks like a good app.  I love the smell of gunpowder in the morning.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a beautiful app! It runs smooth and has great recipes! Definitely a must have for people who love being in the kitchen!  Thanks for this FAOTD!
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I had no issues with this app. Very easy to use and the videos/pics arehelpful for those that don't cook much. I can see why this app normally costs money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne  Collins' book The Hunger Games, book one of the Hunger Games Trilogy,  is a story of high adventure, violence, suspense, and terror, set in a post-apocalyptic world where children are the pawns in a televised game of Survivor. And it literally is \\"survivor\\" because the only way to eliminate a competitor is to kill him or her.<br />Katniss and her teammate Peeta are selected by lottery to represent their home area. Katniss' little sister is actually chosen but Katniss arranges to compete in her place. This is the first indication we have of her altruism that carries her through the entire story.<br />The action is fierce, the violence is brutal. This book doesn't have romance or sex. There is a forced romance to attract the television audience, but with little more than chaste kisses. These are children who are warriors and ferocious rivals. Katniss knows how to shoot a rabbit through the eye with a bow and arrow, gut it and eat it raw, but has qualms about killing another child until she has to do so to survive. There is a twist about three fourths of the way through the book that changes the rules but not necessarily the outcome.<br />This book is listed YA but it is not for the young teenager. Older teens and adults will enjoy this book and the series. Note that it will not be sufficient to read only the first book as it is volume 1 of a trilogy and does not stand alone in the sense that the reader knows how the story actually ends. I highly recommend The Hunger Games.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|Although others had reported force closing issues I had none. My installation process went smoothly as well as the extra download on first start up. The recipes seem to be fine though I haven't had a chance to actually do any of them yet, so can't comment on that. The stand alone videos came down fine -- do be aware that even with the additional 80mb download, not all the videos come down. You will still download \\"on demand\\" even after that.  I do have some issues -- namely dealing with screen rotation. Individual videos I have no problem viewing and they come up fine. However, the app will not rotate for me. When I go in the recipes only display in portrait mode and even if I switch the tablet to landscape, the screen will not move. This issue is very annoying when you go into steps which has a little animation that says to rotate the phone/tablet to get pictures and videos of the steps. But mine won't rotate. I tried even setting my launcher to rotate the home screen (which I normally lock to portrait mode) but the app still  initializes in portrait. (I'm running CM7 2.3 latest version of Gingerbread).     Another odd thing (display issue mostly) is that while I can switch from say 2 people to 4 and on the recipe section, all the quantities change, on the steps section the heading stays locked at 2 people. It did appear that the individual quantities are changing in the steps -- so it's just the header doing that.     All in all, a solid product for me. Would like to get the screen rotation issue fixed -- am not sure what is causing that.
B00535RUV4|4.0|I can understand why somebody would give this one or two stars. Paul was trying a lot of different stuff sonically. Not all of it succeeds, but for me, it's all fun to listen to. The stuff that does work sounds really fresh and ahead of its time. There's probably a fine line between gutsy and self-indulgent, and Paul walks the line on this album. The weird sounds and weird songs (like Temporary Secretary, All You Horse Riders, and Check My Machine - which is brilliant, IMO) are what gets talked about with McCartney II, but there are also some flat-out classic Paul songs here, too, like Coming Up, Summer's Day Song, and One of These Days. I can't quite give this five stars, but I do recommend it. Maybe just listen to some samples first so you know what you're getting in to.
0553381695|4.0|I read a lot of fantasy fiction, and rated the first in this series, Game of Thrones, a 5-star book in the genre because of the excellent prose, wonderful character development, unbeatable intrigue and imaginative plot developments. I enjoyed this one as well, but did not like it as well as the first. The prose and character development are still masterful, but the graphic violence, and particular the casual mentions of rape that seem to occur every 2-3 pages, turned me off a bit. This is partly just the nature of the story at this point in the series - all the royal planning and plotting to take the throne of the first book has now evolved into full-scale war and pillaging. So to be fair, the violence is part and parcel of the storyline, and seems true to the characters. But it is just not my cup of tea, and at times became overbearing.<br /><br />This book also suffers the common malady of many books in the middle of a series - the plot advances, but not that much overall, and mostly just delivers setback after setback to the main characters (in this case the Stark family) that we have grown attached to. The assumption is that there will be come grand comeback or twist that will make all this hopelessness worth it, but for now, there's not much joy involved.<br /><br />One thing I was glad to see is that the supernatural aspects of the storyline are developing, and look to be slowly building towards something grand. I think it's these aspects of the story - the direwolves, the dragons, the magi, and the mysteries of the north 'beyond the wall' - that will add a new layer to the story in the remaining books. At least I hope so, because another book of war, rape and pillaging will not keep me going.<br /><br />So all in all, this is worth reading if you liked the first book, and personally I will keep going with the third, but be warned that there is more violence, and not a lot of immediate payoff at this point.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee is a true inspiration, not just because of her situation described in this book, but her amazing outlook on life in general. This book made me rethink my attitude towards life.
B004Y1USWQ|5.0|The more I listen to this release, the better it sounds. It is not the crazy experimental YES of RELAYER or TOPOGRAPHIC, but it is not 1973-1974 either. It is YES 2011. Comparisons to the band's heyday are a waste of time. This CD lives up to the legacy, it is carrying on the 'perpetual change' that has been YES's one consistent feature over their long existence. Is Jon Anderson missed? Of course, if you expected him in the first place. However, since it is hardly NEW news that he is not in the band, those that would make that the focal point for their objections to this CD having the YES name on it have weak argument.   THE MUSIC and production are well executed, although I personally wish that the transitions between the segments of FFH were a bit louder, and more in keeping with the idea of a complete unit. On the other hand if the intent was a suite of songs with a collective theme, as I suspect, and as opposed to a muti-sectioned epic like CTTE, then my complaint becomes moot. My favorites are INTO THE STORM, and of course the suite, but I really love Madman...BENOIT DAVID has taken a lot of heat, many people more obsessed with his having been in a tribute band than actually being IN YES. They overlook or ignore the fact that he has been the lead vocalist of MYSTERY, a premier CANADIAN progressive rock band for their last 2 CDs and already has completed recording his 3rd with them. All I will say on that is that being in a tribute band does not mean you have no talent, it also does not mean you are a wanna-be. He did not seek YES out, they came to him, and with good reason. He acquits himself greatly on FLY FROM HERE, TREVOR HORN ( producer ) has a way of bringing out the best, and according to DAVID, when he asked Horn if they should perhaps try to do the vocals a bit more YES-tradition, Horn told him to 'be himself'. The result is astounding. of course, ALAN WHITE, STEVE HOWE, and CHRIS SQUIRE bring the signature YES sound into the fray, and old/new keyboardist GEOFf DOWNS returns to the band here, and is one of the main songwriters. The CD is deceptive, in that superficially it seems less challenging musically than a lot of the favorites that they are known for, but there is a subtle complexity to the music, an infectious amount of hooks, and if you are open-minded enough, it will draw you in, the more you listen, as all the really great YES albums have done for decades.
1400049628|4.0|The book is logical and easy to read. Perfect for when you're traveling and need a light read.    Interesting part is the recorded attacks which has many real historical references, and provides a direction for interested readers to research into it and widen their general knowledge.    Great book overall, though i don't suggest reading it non-stop, or you'll be done with the book in a day or two at most.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|This is a great app. I'm impressed that it has vegetarian options. The design is great and easy to use. I haven't installed the extra photos and videos yet, since I heard they make the app force close. Even without the extras I give it 5 stars. When it's updated I'll add them. Droid X.    EDIT: After using this app several times I've become very disappointed. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't think any of these would only take 20 minutes. Some of the ingredients are hard to find in stores and aren't things I have on hand. I have a 5 month old baby, so I can't just run to the store when I don't have something I need. The only reason I haven't uninstalled is because I love the grocery list, though that could be better too. The grocery list would be perfect if I could put different items in different categories. I always end up running all around the store. Also, when I cross an item off the list, it frequently uncrosses it and if I don't notice it I end up with two.  :/
B0033AX1YG|5.0|Just got mine today. Very excited. I've only takin' a sampling so far. But it is truly an awesome collection with Gary playing many of his very best songs. The CD runs 68 min. with songs from '90, '95, '97, '99, and 2001. The real meat of the set are the two DVDs. DVD 1 runs 2hrs and DVD 2 runs close to 2 1/2hrs. Another thing that is nice is no songs are repeated on the DVDs. Very, very cool. It is a great collection. I wish there had been songs from 2007's \\"Close As You Get\\" and 2008's \\"Bad For you Baby\\", but that would've meant another DVD. If you're still on the fence, hop off and pick this up. It is well worth the money.
0670022411|2.0|I loved the idea of this book, and my obsession with witches and vampires made me pick it up and start reading it right away. I was drawn in at first, Harkness has a way with pretty words and descriptions, but nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. There was no action or spectacular magic and the writing became increasingly cheesy. I do not think it was an awful book but I could not waste my time on another 300 pages after reading the first 200. I skimmed through the last chapters to arrive at a flat and boring conclusion to the first book of the trilogy. If you are looking for an exciting fantasy read this is not it.

B004R6CGXM|5.0|Anybody who bought the CD ( perhaps their first full recorded CD) of Kitty, Daisy and Lewis in 2008/2009 ,will not be disappointed at all buying this one!<br /><br />This musical family is doing very well. Please note that the previous CD was full of covered songs in 1950's style and even with a wink to the 30's with a couple of own songs. All their recording was done by themselves on the previous CD on 1950's tube (valve) technology and in my opinion this is also the case of this new CD\\" Smoking in Heaven\\". It sounds that direction on my own mono-block tube amplifiers.<br /><br />The difference on this CD with the previous one is that all songs on \\"Smoking in Heaven\\" are written by all the family members. Great stuff indeed. A bit 1950's  rockabilly, R& B and a flavour of Latin, the family band is \\"smoking\\"  and never mind that Lewis doesn't have the greatest voice in the world or the two sisters sound \\"nasal\\". No man, this is the original stuff, straight from the heart ,no nonsense real music. Any music lover should buy this as it is such a entertaining CD, all my friends love it!<br />Kitty , Daisy and Lewis know what they are doing without being manipulated by a big recording company.What is in their heart is what is in their music.<br /><br />Hope that Kitty, Daisy and Lewis continue with what they are doing now. I promise you that they will be well recognized in the coming few years as a very original band with great success coming up. They are still young with enormouos writing skills in development!<br />Hope the band will come up with many more CD's in the near future with more songs of their own! They can only go to the top from here.<br />Man, don't wait, go to the shop or buy it on-line now!

0143119788|4.0|I've had this novel on my shelf for a while but - when I found out a new movie was coming out - I decided to read it.  It's only the second LeCarré novel I've read.  As far as the plot goes: George Smiley is recruited to identify a Russian agent (he coined the term \\"mole\\") working in British Intelligence.    It's a good novel, and I correctly guessed the mole, but it is not an EASY read.  Part of the problem with spy novels or mystery stories (this is both) is that there is SO MUCH plot and SO MANY characters, it is very easy to get lost.  It would've been nice if - Agatha Christie style - the book had been published with a list of characters in order to keep everyone straight.  Added to which, much of the story is told in flashback.    This is not a beach read - it demands your full attention.

B004Q8FTE4|5.0|I recently purchased this import box set, even though I have all the Roger Water's stuff in single disc form, and it didn't disappoint me. The set is totally awesome!! The CDs come in impressive mini LP sleeves and they are packed in a sturdy box. The CDs themselves appear to be remastered because I have heard things on the CDs that I didn't hear on the original releases, especially The Pros & Cons Of Hitchhiking and Radio K.A.O.S. The DVD is great, it's good to see Roger perform songs from all his releases, plus alot of Pink Floyd material. The picture quality and the audio for the DVD is outstanding! The DVD is all region NTSC, even though this set is an import. There is also a booklet that came with the set that gives you all the information on the recording and production of each CD, I really think they should have included the lyrics in the book, but they're not included. I highly recommend this box set to all Roger Waters fans whether you have the CDs or not....it is well worth the low price of $38.00. So go ahead and order it, you won't be disappointed.

0553801473|1.0|Martin insists that he's got everything under control, that plot isn't the be-all and end-all, that he is equally concerned with \\"character development\\" and \\"world-building\\", that his epic is \\"resting\\", as with Tolkien in The Two Towers.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />In The Two Towers, Tolkien (the genuine article, not the \\"American\\" counterfeit) manages to develop plot, character, and build his world (including several races and languages) simultaneously, and while he's \\"resting\\", he chronicles a major battle at Helm's Deep, the destruction of Isengard and the overthrow of Saruman, and Frodo's fight with Shelob and subsequent capture by the Orcs. And all in 400 pages.<br /><br />This is \\"resting\\"?<br /><br />Martin is not the \\"American Tolkien\\" nor any other kind of Tolkien. He is, if anything, the prose equivalent of Yanni, perpetual middle and no end. Those who love this kind of work -- stylistically similar to The Osbournes, The Kardashians, New Jersey Housewives, even The Sopranos (particularly if Tony had been killed during the first season) -- will likely love this, and will continue to do so as the characters, plots, venues and volumes multiply.<br /><br />Martin had a promising first act, but the literary world is replete with promises that quickly fizzle. Perhaps the publishers could give the series a title more fitting to lowered expectations: Westeros Housewives.

0545259088|3.0|Oh, dear Sam and Grace. One of the best couples to ever grace YA literature. Shiver was an incredible book. We were so lucky to have front row seats as poignant, passionate, pure love developed between Sam and Grace. For me,  that intensity was lost a bit in Linger because of the introduction of Cole and Isabel's POVs, but it was still there. Sadly, I feel that Sam and Grace's emotions were muted and hard to find in Forever. Granted, Grace was a wolf for most of the book, but this means their scenes together should have been more electric, yet I did not feel that spark. While I recognized the intense yearning and concern they felt for each other, that original passion was missing for me. I understand they were under great stress as the stakes were quite high. This intense environment may have been what sucked the life out of them and that is understandable. It's hard to focus on love and relationships when you have crazy men trying to gun down your pack. However, the passion was just not at the level I would have expected for the final book.<br /><br />With all my thoughts on Cole and Isabel's intrusion on Sam and Grace in Linger, I felt like they shined more intensely in Forever. I was way more interested in their damaged relationship this time around, watching as their flaws drew them together, like moths to a flame. As sad as it is to say, I became more interested in their relationship, finding myself missing their story when I was in Sam or Grace's head. Plus, they brought snark and humor, which livened up the pages of this otherwise depressing story.<br /><br />The first 100+ pages felt like filler and it was very unfulfilling to a beloved fan who was so excited to find out how it all ends. It wasn't until a scene involving a sink hole and a terrified wolf, about 120 pages in, that I felt connected at all to the story. That was a very intense scene where emotions finally came alive. I thank this scene greatly, as I was very close to discontinuing the book.<br /><br />The action in the book was terrifying, yet I never quite felt that from the characters. Yes, they knew the dangers and knew they had to act, but I never really felt like they were freaking out, which they should have been! The action was good and sad, then came the ending, almost immediately. The ending was disappointing and inconclusive. I don't mind a story that leaves you to devise your own ending, but not when it is a major romantic story such as this. In my opinion, this story needed a solid closure.<br /><br />As Parajunkee stated, this book should have been epic, but it was a let-down. While I wasn't fulfilled with the ending of this timeless love story, there are many who were. Regardless of my opinions on Forever, I still find the author's writing to be quite magical. She is a gifted writer who really makes emotions, character and scenes come to life. Her prose is whimsical, lyrical and emotional. I will no doubt read her future novels.book was terrifying, yet I never quite felt that from the characters.

B004ZZS4CC|2.0|[[ASIN:B004ZZS4CC A Stolen Life]]  Boring, and repetitive book. Sad life and a strong girl I wish her the best. The book however is difficult to read. At first difficult because its so horrific what happened to her. Then difficult to read because I wanted to put it down and never finish it. The journal entries gave me a headache and couldn't wait for them to end. I don't regret buying the book but I learned more from Sawyer than the book.

1449536689|5.0|The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins was quite possibly one of my first exposures to the world of mystery novels. I can't remember if I read Sherlock Holmes series first of this, but, I distinctly remember being absolutely blown away by The Moonstone upon my first read. And let me tell you - I've read it several times since, and it never fails to amaze me, still!<br /><br />The beauty of the Moonstone lies not only in its ingenious plot, but in its characterization. The author has mapped out the characters so well in this book that you feel akin to them, you feel as if you've known them all your life. Their temperaments, their actions make sense and they are not just used simply to move the plot forward, but to create the illusion that the reader is literally part of the character's world. There are a lot of characters, and it may seem that some characters are in the novel merely to add to its shroud of mystery, however, as the story unfolds you will see that every character in this novel was warranted and needed for the plot to be as interesting as it is.<br /><br />You, as the reader, will make various guesses as to who you think is the \\"culprit\\", however, do not be surprised if you find yourself guessing wrong, only to guess again and be proved wrong yet again. The Moonstone is a novel that keeps you guessing till the very end - but leads to an extremely satisfying and sublime ending, tying romance, mystery and drama all together in a nice, neat and pleasant package.

B001AQO446|5.0|First, I just want to make clear that I think Blues Brothers is a classic, as evidenced by the five stars. However, except for the few extra bits of great music you get, the so-called extended cut of Blues Brothers is not that good, IMO. It kills the flow of the movie by explaining too much, I think. Who cares how the Bluesmobile gets its powers, or what Elwood's job is like? The genius of John Landis' comedies was that not everything would be laid out for the audience. They're random, messy, chaotic, and sometimes you didn't get a detailed explanation. To me, that's what made them so great! For proof, just compare the first Blues Brothers film with Blues Brothers 2000, which is full of backstory and character motivations and blah-blah-blah. The theatrical cut is a classic, and whenever I've heard someone extol the virtues of the extended cut (which has been the version available longest on DVD), I just shake my head and rewatch the original.    As to the quality of the Blu Ray itself, I think Universal has done a pretty nice job for a comedy that's over 30 years old. I've owned the original DVD release and the 25th Anniversary Edition, and this Blu-Ray beats both of them (as should be expected). I don't know whether the sound has been remastered, but it seems to have a little more oomph to it. My favorite musical sequence in the movie--the church sequence with James Brown--got so loud that my neighbor knocked on the door!    Upgrading to Blu-Ray isn't always a necessity in the case of older catalog releases, but I'd have to recommend picking up \\"The Blues Brothers\\" Blu-Ray. Just make sure you watch the theatrical version first, and then go from there!
B004LWZW4C|1.0|Save your money!!! I saw this in the theater and it was terrible. They messed up the story line not only from the comics, but also within the X-Men movies.

There is a handy hole for the wheel of the iPod which I can use while I run if I choose to change the song. This product is great for outdoor running and even indoor workouts because you do not have to hold on to your iPod and say try to lift weights at the same time. The materials seem to be durable, so I expect to keep my arm-band/case for a long time.

1451629184|5.0|Wow I do not know where to start.I was impressed by Jaycee from the tv show but she only mentioned parts of her ordeal that tv would let her. Jaycee tells it all and it is deplorable and unthinkable what those two morons did to this child . I was TRULY impressed how this child could retain her sainty year after year and forced to have two children by this perverted maniac.  I had a very hard time setting this book down. Jaycee had me hooked. If you truly enjoy reading true storys about people who are put in unthinkable situations but are able to keep their sainty and find a way out and then tell us just how it really happened then this is a must read.      I applaude and really respect Jaycee Dugard for her very unique way of being able to not hate those two animals that held her hostage all that time. Jaycee is a very special woman who we all should look up to and say    JAYCEE YOU DID GOOD AND YOUR STILL DOING EVEN BETTER DAY . I hope your two very special children will one day read your book or learn from you just what happened so they both will know their mom is one of the best moms around.        Dennis B.

0553386816|5.0|Having spent three decades as a sole-practitioner lawyer myself, I've had a love-hate thing for Grisham's legal thrillers.  At first I loved them with a passion -- it was always the little-guy lawyer who took on the bad guys and came out a winner, not to mention alive. That felt good.  But then, midstream, the stories became too political for me. Sure, Grisham can preach whatever left-wing chronicles he darn well chooses, but it's up to me to decide if I wanted to read them.  I stopped buying the books entirely and read them only if they came my way by borrowing.     That said, Grisham's non-legal writing is just about the best I've ever come across.  You just don't get any better than \\"A Painted House\\". If ever a book was a masterpiece, that was it -- the plot, the memorable characters, the pithy writing, all flawless.    Even so, when I saw \\"Ford County\\" I hesitated. I like thick books -- have been known to choose a book based on weight.  Short stories aren't my thing -- I like to dig in and stay there awhile.  Still, the library offered \\"Ford County\\", so I had nothing to lose.  Good deal.    \\"Ford County\\" is wonderful. Yes, the characters are slobs, most of them, working on the wrong side of the law -- and being fairly disgusting while they went about it. But the amazing thing is, Grisham makes you care about them. You find yourself feeling sad for the brothers who bring Raymond home, for the fools who make such a mess of things in Blood Drive. Sad tale -- but still, you can't stop reading.    But it was really \\"Fish Files\\" that made me leap off my chair, clapping.  Grisham hasn't practiced law for a lot of years, not really. But he managed to capture every little lawyers dream -- and that of a lot of \\"big\\" lawyers, too, I'd guess. There it was: the perfect caper. Gives us all something to hope for, that one perfect case -- although one has to wonder about that swimming away, a perfect echo of Jan Schlichtman's escape in the finest non-fiction trial book ever written, Jonathan Harr's \\"A Civil Action.\\"     Good stuff, \\"Ford County\\".  Almost made me a believer in Grisham again.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|This headset is incredible. The 7.1 really makes it so much easier to hear footsteps or gunshots, than a traditional stereo headset. It made me so much better.     Keep in mind that if you want to chat, it is not completely wireless. You have to plug the cable into the xbox 360 controller. Also, there is a little bit of static noise because of the wireless, but you won't even notice it once you start playing.     One bad thing about the headset is that it has a relatively short battery life. Turtle Beach claims that it uses \\"all of the battery\\". This is a complete lie. The headset will work for probably about 10 hours on two batteries. Then it will just shut off on its own. An uneducated person on this might think that the batteries are dead. However, if you just press the button again, it has another hour left in it, but it will keep shutting off on its own occasionally. You know the batteries are dead once you press the button and the headset only stays on for a few seconds. Another minor problem is how the transmitter can sometimes interfere with your Xbox Live Connection when you are not using the headset, signing you off every once in a while. What you have to do is have the transmitter turned off whenever you are not using the headset, because this lack of connection is what causes the Live problems.    However, the increase in skill during games far outweighed the negatives listed above, which made me give the headset a 4 star.

0307477479|1.0|Not a novel, it's a series of poinless, loosly connected short stories. The characters lacked dimension and there was no real plot. The last few chapters were hard to get through because I was so ready for the book to be over.
0553801473|3.0|I started reading the books last summer, and was quickly hooked.  Im glad I didn't have to wait six years for this one like some people did. Now that I read it, I understand why many were disappointed.  Its rather a bloated book. For one thing there is way too much description of family shields, clothing worn, and Westeros history - descriptions that if you read the previous four books, you already know for the most part. Way too much time was spent describing the various difficulties in traveling; yes, we get it, people get seasick a lot. Is it necessary to describe it each time it happens? The sections that take place off Westeros included way too many characters to keep track of. I found myself bored often and skimmed most of these sections (tho the part where Dany finally gets to fly was breathtaking). I also had trouble with the timeline - just how much time has passed here, and just how old are some of these leaders? Are Dany and Jon really only 15 or so? No wonder things are so screwed up.  I did enjoy reading about Bran and Arya, but then they were sort of dropped and never heard of again. I loved that Cersei finally gets whats been coming to her for a long time, and loved Tyrion, as always. But he sorely needed an editor in this book, more so than any of his other books in the series. If it had been tighter narrative, this easily could have been a 4 star.<br /><br />That all being said - this was another page turner.  I was hooked from the beginning, and while there were some sections I skimmed through, the story certainly kept my attention.  As usual, he is a genius in characer development, and in showing the different facets of each character.  I also appreciated  of the new maps, but I wished he had made a character list in abc order, instead of by families, for easy reference.  Hoping the next book happens soon, with tying up

It will not work on any Canon camera with a grip(built in or added) with this lens. Other then that the plate attaches firmly and I don't worry about the camera shake attributed to mounting plates. I have used it on my 70-200 lens and everything works well.

0553801473|5.0|[Pre-Review Rant: One thing is certain when it comes to a truly good epic fantasy series like this one. The longer the series goes, the more the author does NOT repeat himself, the more complex and intricate the plot becomes, the less each book stands alone, the more thought provoking each installment, the more popular, the louder the most critical fans will proclaim their discontent.]<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons feels more like the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire's second major arc than a sequel to A Storm of Swords. The first arc, depicting the War of the Five Kings, took up the first three books while A Feast for Crows is both an epilogue to the first arc and a stepping stone into the second arc. Dance builds off the world Martin created up to this point and takes it in a whole new direction while still staying true to all that has come before.<br /><br />This is my favorite book in the series so far. Well worth the 6 year wait, but then again, I've always felt authors should take their time rather than rush, but maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Dance is, in turns, funny (I laughed out loud more times during this book than any of the previous ones combined), heartbreaking (should I be too much of a man to admit I cried, cried like a baby?), awe inspiring (there were multiple scenes that left me breathless), frustrating (in a good way), frightening (okay, I'll stop with the parentheticals now), epic, adventurous, mysterious, and every other thing that an epic fantasy novel should be. The plot is steeped in history and political intrigue, the characters pop off the page, and the settings leave you almost breathless in their beauty.<br /><br />And, of course, Martin does what he has always done best. He keeps you guessing. Just when you think you know what's going to happen... Psych! I'm not going to put any spoilers in this review. He takes characters we know and love and then plays boggle with our heads. People we despised before suddenly become sympathetic, while people we once loved supremely get on our nerves. He also brings into the forefront new characters who are every bit as entertaining as the ones we've lost.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have when it comes to A Dance With Dragons is the pacing early on. I got over that quickly enough, though, when I thought of it as the companion novel to A Feast for Crows. While I read, I always tried to keep in mind what was happening in Feast at the same time. I hope someday GRRM comes out and releases A Feast for Dragons or A Dance with Crows and puts all the chapters together into one volume as they were originally meant to be.ic, while people we once loved supremely get on our nerves.

1609419693|4.0|I've always enjoyed memoirs, and when I heard about Bossypants back in April, I knew that only the audio book would do for me - after all, it's read by the author herself, and with Tina's terrific sense of humor, I suspected I would be pleased.  My first intro to Tina Fey was during the last presidential campaign when her humor landed her major accolades as a Sarah Palin impersonator. I thought she was awesome in this role, and I have been a fan of hers ever since.<br /><br />In her memoir, she begins by telling us how she was a \\"change of life baby\\", and the fact that she grew up in Philadelphia. She shocks us by saying that she was slashed in an alley by a stranger as a young child, but chooses not to elaborate on what happened!  She then goes on to share stories about growing up, a memorable story about her father and his Greek heritage and his quirks. There are also stories about her mother, brother, school, a honeymoon cruise nightmare, jobs she held and the difficulties faced by women in her field. Well,  you get the picture.<br /><br />One thing  that shines through again and again is Fey's sarcastic sense of humor. At times I found myself laughing out loud as I was driving in my car.  I'm sure people who saw me at traffic lights must have thought I was smoking something.  Because I was listening to the book rather than reading it, I do not recall all of essay titles, except her intro essay, \\"Origin\\" - how Tina Fey came about as a \\"change of life baby\\".<br /><br />Although I did enjoy this audio book, at times I felt the essays just seemed too scattered, not following in particular order, and sometimes like a stand-up comedy act where random thoughts might come to mind.  Despite this, I would still recommend this audio book to anyone who needs a good laugh. Fans of David Sedaris, will likely enjoy this book. - Recommended
0553801473|5.0|I dont understand all the bad reviews of this book. I have read and enjoyed all of the series, and even though AFFC was the runt of the litter, it was still worthwhile. This is world building of the highest order, and I am in awe of Martin's talent.I think some of the fanboys become so involved in the world, that they start having tantrums when everwhere the story goes doesn't please them. Don't listen to them. This is as good as any in the series, as well as the darkest.I sure hope I don't have to wait as long for the sequel, but if that is what it takes for this quality.. so be it. Amazing achievement.

0061134007|5.0|Thwe first of many good reads by Nesbo. You don't have to be familiar with the city or the country to get involved in the story. Now for the others in his library.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Teeth clenching thriller!!! Very good. Excellent till about 30 minutes before the end, where `he' figures out what's really going on. From that point on, it's just `ok'. In my opinion, in then turns from an excellent thriller, to a `good old Hollywood action' movie. Even to the point of the `hero' walking away with his girl in his hands. Still good, but not as excellent as up to that moment where he figures out what's what.<br /><br />Great acting by all the actors. The main characters, as well as the smaller roles. From the doctor, and nurse in the hospital, taxi drivers and others, everyone running around, even the extra's, to Liam Neeson himself. Perhaps the actor/role I liked the most, was the role of actor Bruno Ganz. Wish he had a bigger part in the movie.
1416955070|4.0|City of Bones has a lot of twists and turns. Clare creates a fully realized alternate world that exists in New York, right alongside the everyday world. This world of vampires, werewolves, demons, Shadowhunters, and more is complex and well thought out.<br /><br />The story starts with Clary and her friend Simon at a nightclub. Clary realizes she can see things that Simon can't. Being the kind of person who steps in to help, she does just that, only to find herself involved in things she shouldn't be able to see. Once she steps into this world, taking Simon with her, the story revs up the action and revelations.<br /><br />The book, and I'm assuming the entire series, is aimed at young teen girls who enjoy paranormal worlds and adventures, and fans of the Twilight series. Even if you're not a teen, you'll enjoy discovering this new world along with Clary. I give City of Bones by Cassandra Clare a rating of Hel-of-a-Story for teenage girls.
B000ASATYO|5.0|This fantastic horror comedy somehow escaped my attention during its theatrical run, but I later saw it on VHS and immediately bought a copy.  Several years later, this Director's Cut appeared, and I was eager to get \\"the full experience\\", as envisioned by Peter Jackson.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the theatrical cut.<br /><br />The problem with so many \\"Director's Cut\\" DVD releases is that new or extended scenes rarely improve upon the original cut. No matter how good those scenes might be on their own, there's usually a good reason they were deleted or shortened, and it almost always has to do with pacing or consistency of tone.<br /><br />While I still enjoy the director's cut of The Frighteners, I find that the extra footage causes it to lose momentum in a few places, and it starts to feel a little too long.  I recently caught the original version on TV and found it to be more enjoyable.  It retained its liveliness throughout.<br /><br />That being said, the extras on the Director's Cut DVD are great.  If only it included the theatrical cut on the flip side of the disc, the package would be perfect.

I highly recommend it!
0553801473|1.0|I am trying to be fair, and I will not deny that this book had for me some elements of interest.  I read all 5 volumes in quick succession, and I still feel semi-invested.  But I am honestly not sure this volume (or even the series as a whole) deserves even the 2 stars I am tempted to give it.  GRRM has sucked me in, but he also makes me feel like a sucker.  And having read it, I would now give 10:1 odds that the series will never be completed.<br /><br />This latest volume alone contains 959 hardback pages; over 400,000 words; close to matching in length all 3 volumes of Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS.  How could a book this long contain so little in the way of plot progression?  Is the author stalling on purpose, or is this the only way he can cope with some weird kind of writer's block?<br /><br />Part of the problem was that George RR Martin, whatever his talent for piquing the readers interest and keeping him turning pages, was never that efficient a writer.  He often uses 10 words to say would could be better said in 5.  Even the early volumes could, in my opinion, be trimmed down significantly and be the better for it (in particular, I could have without the voyeuristic sex stuff, constant whore references, etc.).  But the level of inefficiency and bloat has increased with each volume, reaching new heights with the last two.<br /><br />The other part of the problem is the proliferation of characters and points of view (\\"POVs\\"):<br /><br />1. Game of Thrones:  9 povs<br />2. Clash of Kings:  10 povs<br />3. Storm of Swords:  12 povs<br />4. Feast for Crows:  13 povs<br />5. Dance with Dragons: 18 povs<br />4/5. Feast/Dance combined:  25 povs<br /><br />If you consider that FEAST and DANCE are supposed to be \\"the same book\\" divided by POV, then you can see that the number of POVs suddenly doubled after STORM.  No wonder the story suddenly became unmanageable for the author.  If one divides ones story between twice as many different characters in twice as many different locations, then the story can only progress half as fast.  And if your chapters contain twice as much bloat (as seems to have happened), the your story can only progress one quarter as fast.<br /><br />And then the author starts repeating himself, perhaps because he fears you have not seen So-and-So in so long that you have forgotten what happened last time.  More bloat.<br /><br />A third aspect of the problem is this:  In the first volume, not only were there only 9 povs, but they were mostly gathered in the same place and time and able to help a single storyline forward.  GAME OF THRONES started most of the main POVs together, such that there were initially 2 main threads, which then divided into 3 main threads.  Only at the end of the volume were the 7 surviving POVs completely scattered to the winds.  Then did the author require 2 more (larger) volumes to complete the same level of plot progression that the first volume had.  And yet many fans remained patient and even enthusiastic.  Then it got worse ...<br /><br />By the end of DANCE, we still have about 20 surviving POVs, and they are all still all scattered.  One would think that the author would recognize this problem created by this vast scope, and adjust his writing style accordingly.  But no.  He thinks he has the time to describe how it feels for a character to urinate, and then describe a conversation he has with another character about how good he is is at urinating.  Will his urinations skills have future plot relevance?  He thinks he has the time to spend an entire paragraph describing a humble boat whose sole plot function is to transport a minor character from point A to point B (and leave him there), and then the author wastes another paragraph on how this minor character could have arrived on a nicer boat had things been different.  George, you could have saved half a page, there.  There are COUNTLESS such examples.  Each chapter needs to have its length cut in half AT LEAST.<br /><br />So where are we now?  How close is he to finished.<br /><br />THRONES was originally sold as the first of a \\"trilogy\\" (though the author admits he already knew better at publicaton).  But his \\"trilogy\\" plan had originally been as follows:<br /><br />Part 1:  Game of Thrones:  Covering War of 5 Kings.<br />Part 2:  Dance of Dragons:  Dany invades Westeros<br />Part 3:  Winds of Winter<br /><br />Well, he ended up needing a full 3 volumes to complete part 1.  Part 2 was supposed to resume the story 5 years later, but for whatever reason, the author decided to scrap this plan and write an interim volume called \\"FEAST FOR CROWS\\".  Let's call this Part 1.5.  Well, as you recall, FEAST ended up becoming so bloated that it had to be split in two volumes, the second half being what is now being released as \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\"<br /><br />But the bad news is, this unplanned Part 1.5 is not even finished.  All the threads that were set up in FEAST and DANCE to converge on Meereen have not reached there yet, as this latest closes.  Hey, remember that guy Victarion with the dragon horn who set off for Meereen at the beginning of FEAST FOR CROWS.  Well, he is still at sea.  BUT HE'S GETTING CLOSE!!!  When will Dany finally land in Westeros?  At this rate, it won't be until volume 7, because she will need all of Volume 6 to resolve the impending climax in Meereen.<br /><br />So here is a release schedule, with my estimated projections into the future, giving George 5 years to complete each future volume:<br /><br />Part I, Vol 1 (A Game of Thrones):  1996<br />Part I, Vol 2 (A Clash of Kings):  1998<br />Part I, Vol 3 (A Storm of Swords): 2000<br /><br />Part 1.5, Vol 1 (A Feast for Crows):  2005<br />Part 1.5, Vol 2 (A Dance with Dragons):  2011<br />Part 1.5, Vol 3 ...  2016 (Climax in Meereen)<br /><br />Part 2, Vol 1 .... 2021  Dany reaches Westeros)<br />Part 2, Vol 2 .... 2026<br />Part 2, Vol 3 .... 2031<br /><br />Part 3, Vol 1 .... 2036<br />Part 3, Vol 2 .... 2041<br />Part 3, Vol 3 .... 2046<br /><br />GRRM still says he hopes to finish the series in seven volumes.  But if that were so, those who believed that promise had a right to expect better story progress in this volume.  He should just be honest and say that he hopes to complete the series in 12 volumes and that he also hopes to live to be 120 in excellent health (don't we all).  That way, potential readers could make an informed decision as to whether they should invest time and money in this story.<br /><br />But I cannot see it at his current rate.  This story will not be resolved, and readers who hope for a resolution are wasting their time with it.  That's how I am calling it.  George, you are welcome to prove me wrong.o where are we now?

0062060554|3.0|Before I start, I have to mention my bias: when I first started this book, I kept comparing it to the movie Memento from 2000, which has pretty much the same premise. It has more tension and kept me guessing more than Before I Go To Sleep. This clouded my judgment as the idea wasn't new to me, so if I hadn't seen that I probably would have rated this a star higher.    As for the book, I definitely liked the premise but the story didn't really start completely grabbing my attention until the last 25% or so - that was when I couldn't put it down. At that point, the plot finally came alive and revelations came at a quick pace. Before that, the story didn't really move along at a quickly enough for me and started feeling a bit repetitive as Christine had to make the same discoveries daily (though, I guess that was the point).    Overall, I liked the writing and definitely enjoyed the last section but just wish it could've moved a bit quicker throughout.

B005DD7H50|1.0|So disappointed--seemed like so many people gave this high marks. Bradley Cooper does a great job acting, but the rest is just some tiresome, and rather humdrum, absolutely non-mind-bending stuff. The part about him now being able to access 100% of his brain is actually a very small part of the movie--he gets smart, can do cool things, and things are looking up, and then....nothing. That's it. A little action, no twist, no nothing. The movie ends incredibly boringly and makes you feel like you went through all the rambling storytelling to get absolutely nowhere.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've read all of Sanderson's books- and I have to agree with the reviewer who stated that this is Sanderson's best work yet.  I really enjoyed this book.  I also read a few reviews claiming that the novel was too long- well, it is long- but I enjoyed the length.   I think sometimes people look for quick reads- and then want to criticize authors who write longer novels- claiming that it contains extra \\"fluff\\" that need not be there.  I did not find that to be the case.  I look forward to the next book.

That is why Darwin himself explained it as a Theory. Where would our world be without faith? The faith that we have when we start dating someone and hope for the best, the faith in ourselves, or when we decide to have children and use our faith that things will work out for them one day. Atheists always argue that if there is a God, then why would he create such a world and put us in it? Yet, these same atheists will have children and bring them into the same world. The bible does not say that the world is supposed to be a perfect place. It is the free will that is given to us that we practice, that creates the collective world around us for better or worse. Do we deny the existance of our parents and their goodwill because they brough us into a non-perfect world?

0061784788|4.0|A familiar cast of characters returns for this latest novel involving Sigma, the secret US government organization of spies, warriors, and scientists, set in the United States.  James Rollins is a master at combining intriguing historical mysteries with cutting edge science.  In this novel he explores questions involving the relationship between the Founding Fathers and Native Americans, Mormons, the lost tribe of Israel, the Anasazi, super volcanoes, and nanotechnology.<br /><br />Sigma again finds itself opposed by the Guild, a shadowy but powerful organization with a hidden subversive agenda.  Without giving too much away, Sigma discovers more about the Guild in this book, perhaps setting up a showdown in the next Sigma novel.<br /><br />In this novel Painter Crowe, the director of Sigma, is out in the field again investigating and dealing with threats in the western United States.  He is joined by the irrepressible Kowalski, who provides the comic relief in these Sigma novels, and a few new characters.  Gray Pierce, the other main character and Sigma's top operative, chases leads in the eastern United States (and Iceland).  His good friend, Monk , joins him, along with the beautiful rogue assassin, Seichan, who formerly did the bidding of the Guild, but is now working with Sigma.  Gray's on-again-off-relationship with Italian detective, Rachel, is off for this novel.  While there is some romantic tension between Seichan and Gray, it is not a major part of the story.<br /><br />Rollins' novels are always fast-paced with plenty of action and suspense.  Sometimes it is a little formulaic.  Sigma is always outmanned and outgunned by the Guild's teams of mercenaries.  Certain chapters are always devoted to conversations to relay to the reader the necessary historical and scientific explanations for the novel.  Rollins generally works these in pretty seamlessly, more so in this novel than in some others recently.  His characters are not particularly deep or complex, but they are likeable and adequate for this type of story.  The author throws in a few surprises at the end of the story that should make the next one particularly interesting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel.and adequate for this type of story.

This time it was able to download the 80 megs of additional data without crashing.<br /><br />Alas, as soon as I tried to view a recipe, the app force closed.  It still has a problem with switching between portrait and landscape.<br /><br />I really REALLY wanted to like this app, but come on developers, give me something to work with!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />There's so much wrong with this app, where should I even begin?<br /><br />80 Megs of additional data to download?  It's for images and video.  I want the images, but I could not care less about the videos.  Why can't I download just the images and stream the video later if I really want it?  I mean, how many times do I need to see a video about making risotto?  But then again, the app never actually managed to download this additional data.  Every time it asked if I wanted to, the app either did nothing at all or crashed.<br /><br />It only runs in portrait mode, except for pictures and videos, which run in landscape.  In the recipe instructions, it says I can rotate to view steps with photos.  Except this doesn't actually work, it stays in portrait.  Oh wait, it finally rotated after sitting untouched for about 5 minutes.  But still no photos.  And now I can't go back to the menu.<br /><br />Even on my large screen Xoom tablet the fonts are ultra tiny.  According to my font ruler, some of the text (such as ingredients) is in 4 point type!  Some of the text runs off the edges of the text boxes.<br /><br />The app force closes at random.  As I was typing this, it just crashed again.<br /><br />The ingredients list and steps are on separate pages.<br /><br />And now I've got a picture of a bowl of soup on the screen and I can't get rid of it.  I've even tried killing the app with Watchdog and restarting it and it still just shows a delicious bowl of soup, but no ingredients or directions how to make it.  Oh wait, now the app just force closed.  Now I can get back into the recipes.<br /><br />In the time it took to write this review, the app has crashed EIGHT TIMES!

B002QGUFWE|5.0|This is literally one of the best things I've ever heard, and I don't say that lightly, considering I own hundreds of cd's and they span all the way from 60's and 70's music to present day.  Wow!!! This album blew my mind!  I already owned the first album, which was good but suffered a bit from overexposure and too much airplay.  But this album surpasses it by a mile, worth five stars by the merit of just Alejandro, Dance in the Dark, and especially Monster and So Happy I Could Die. That's not even mentioning Bad Romance and Telephone which were the hits released from the album. It's simply breath-taking, gothic, dramatic electronic and techno music; I'm not sure she or anyone could really top it.  Buy this CD.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|This film is by far the worst film of the year. It has no plot, sloppy storytelling, lousy editing (they edit and alter the story too mantain a PG-13 rating even making the nazis have no blood), the soundtrack is like being raped (it's basicly Britney Spears covers of all theses beloved rock songs). This film gose nowere fast, it's just random inconsequential action sequences. Their is never any real peril since it's all make beleive, and they're extremley repetitive. This film relies on mindless explosions and hot chicks to get people to see it, which will satisfy most people but if your looking for an actual story this is not for you. This is basicaly Twilight for guys. The film feels like a 100 minute video game trailer, and it's unbearabley boring. With an ending that's beyond predictable.    I can't stress enough it's mindless. The special effects are great, but as Matt Stone and Trey Parker said, (special effects are not story)    You also never see what actually happend sicne 99% of the film is a make beleive pretend world. Which leaves a lot open to interpretation.    Also the subplot with her evil father never gets resolved.     Their is also the logical flaw, Since it requred Carla Gugino's signature to give a labotomy, how could labotomy's be going on in front of her that she did not sign for and she not catch on until numerous ones had bean performed. Think about it if you had to sign for them and one was being doen right in front of you would you not realise hey Ididn't sign for that?

It's hard to believe the author studied this for years but missed the most important contributors to \\"good luck\\" that are parentage, height and beauty! There have been several shows on TV that demonstrated how beautiful people get breaks that others don't but the author must have never seen them.  He talks a lot about how some people claim to be lucky for finding their ideal mate but never seemed to notice that most women are looking for someone \\"tall, dark and handsome\\".  You never see women looking for someone short, pasty and average looking so it's going to be easier for someone tall and handsome to meet women. He also talks about how important it is to develope connections but didn't take it far enough and never mentions how important it is for success to have rich parents with a lot of important connections! You can bet that Donald Trump's kids have a lot of important connections that bring them \\"good luck\\" in everything they do but the kids of an hourly worker aren't going to have any at all and their luck is going to be a lot worse in comparison.<br />Also he completely missed the influence of celebrity and favoritism! He must have noticed that celebrities get criminal charges dismissed with just a slap on the wrist while anyone else gets years in prison and that celebrities get lots of expensive stuff given to them free that anyone else would have to pay for, if they could afford it at all. Or that straight A students in school from the rich part of town always get straight A's no matter what kind of work they do in class while other studends get B's and C's even when they submit the same level of work.<br />I don't know how Wiseman could have missed all this, he must be a moron!  He seems to think that a persons \\"good luck\\" is caused mostly by their attitude, that if they think they will be lucky they are more likely to be lucky. That's nonsense since a lot of things that contribute to a person's \\"good luck\\" aren't even influenced by the person much less have anything to do with their attitude. The author says that a person's luck has a lot to do with his attitude but if you think about it that's ridiculous because it would mean the person has to have supernatural powers to influence his luck. He would have to be psychic, clairvoyant or have some other super power to be able to influence things around him just by using the power of his mind but there are no people like that except in the movies.  I think the author should go back and do his study all over again but consider the real reasons for luck this time not just what he sees in the movies!<br />Another thing is a study was just released that found that children born during the first part of the year in January and February do better in life than those born later in September, October, etc.  It turns out that children born sooner in the year who start school are more mature than those born later so they are more developed than the other students in their classes. In turn they get better grades and they get more attention from the teachers because they are doing better, etc. Later on they tend to be the class presidents, head cheerleaders, be more popular and have more dates and so on and end up doing better later in life because they got a better start. It's becoming such a big problem that some parents are actually holding their children back a year before they start school so they will appear to be more advanced than the other students. Of course the author couldn't have know about this either since the study was just released but that's another reason he should scrap his old study that is terribley flawed and start over to try and get it right this time.ly to be lucky.

1594484805|5.0|\\"DRIVE\\" is a book that has been needed for a long time. It's about what motivates all of us and in particular, the misconceptions some people have, notably business leaders, about the subject.  As author Daniel H. Pink points out in the introduction \\"I will show that much of what we believe about the subject just isn't so\\".<br /><br />Pink does a great job of reviewing the literature and history of motivation in a way that is practical and easy to read.  Above all, he explains things in a way that also makes it relevant for practising managers to implement.  Pink pulls all of this together in what he describes as \\"Type I\\" behaviour - the things that really motivate us.<br /><br />The book is in three parts.  Part one explores the deficiencies of the reward/punishment dichotomy (after reading this, one wonders why so many organisations continue to pursue such fruitless processes as \\"pay for performance\\").  Part two introduces the three elements of \\"Type I\\" behaviour - autonomy, mastery and purpose.  Part three provides some guidelines for implementing \\"Type I\\".<br /><br />I really liked this book.  As a keen student of motivation and one who has both managed others and trained many managers, it fits well with the philosophy I first picked up in the writings of Frederick Herzberg who popularised the \\"motivator/satisfier\\" model of motivation.<br /><br />I've read some of the other reviews that suggest this book may be \\"basic\\" and \\"shallow\\".  Basic it may be, and perhaps there is also some unnecessary padding.  However, take it from one who has managed as few as two people to as many as 40 in three different organisations in both line and functional roles, these ideas do work in practise.  And isn't that the real test?<br /><br />People who will be inclined to read this book, are not the ones that should - they are most likely already converts to Pink's crusade or academics pushing their own barrow or particular theories.  My suggestion is to read and then pass on this book to someone who can make a real difference in the way people are managed.  These messages need to be spread far and wide otherwise people like Pink will still be writing about \\"motivation\\" in 50 years time without anything having changed in the interim.<br /><br />Bob Selden, author [[ASIN:1432709593 What To Do When You Become The Boss: How new managers become successful managers]]fference in the way people are managed.

B003Y5H59W|5.0|Tastefully jingoistic, \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" works on many levels. It's the only production I can recall where the movie improved upon the book (in this case, the comics). Among the betterments are giving Cap and Red Skull the same scientific parentage, reflecting the greater reality of the Industrial Revolution. Another is separating Red Skull from Nazi Germany. This accomplishes two things - 1) Gives a contemporary twist by showing the emerging power of small groups of terrorists and the declining threats from nation states. To smuggle this post 9/11 fact into a World War II-period movie is quite a feat of intellectual logistics and 2) Makes all but the most deluded American militarist realize that Nazi Germany was never an existential threat to the United States. Actually, no country has posed a takeover threat to the U.S. since the War of 1812 (but that's a subject for another day).   Steve Rogers/Captain America (played deftly by Chris Evans) gives us a wonderful window into the appeal of the military and how it draws idealistic young people into its milieu. No, it's not a desire for violence. Its power is rooted in the good impulse of wanting to do one's share as the conversation between Steve and Bucky Barnes reveals. Ed Brubaker, the ingenious writer who has been piloting Captain America comics for the past several years, summarized it well - Director Joe Johnston (with Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee playing The Watcher as executive producer) made changes that advance the spirit of Captain America.    The producers also reached back to Jim Steranko's excellent late `60s comics series \\"Death of Captain America\\" in bringing elements of espionage to the movie. Steranko's series featured the organization Hydra. Brilliant stroke by Johnston et al in marrying Red Skull to Hydra.   Tommy Lee Jones is at his gruff silver screen best. He gets to drive the big car and deliver the movie's best line.  Steve's interactions with Peggy Carter and Bucky are genuine and compelling and make the end of the movie sad on a heroic note - unusual for this genre.   It appears Cap is going to be lumped with his Tales of Suspense comics partner Iron Man and others in \\"The Avengers\\" next summer. My impulse is to call this a mistake (although if \\"The Avengers\\" has the same creative team as \\"Captain America,\\" I'll probably be proved wrong). The Man Out of Time canvas (which was painted on in Cap comics in the 1990s by Mark Waid) will be cluttered if the Star Spangled Banger becomes part of a team of superheroes. Let Cap be Cap. There are plenty of vines left hanging with Bucky (several Winter Soldier comic hints dropped in Cap the movie) and Peggy for Steve to swing on. Bring in Nick Fury to play off Cap (a la Jones' Colonel Phillips). By the way, was that eye-patch wearing Samuel L. Jackson entering at film's end supposed to be Fury or perhaps The Falcon?   Cap needs to work out his new reality in the spotlight alone. For humorous effect Anthony Weiner could explain to fellow Brooklynite Steve Rogers what Twitter is. Dr. Erskine chose Steve for his courage and compassion. The next chapter of the story should be about whether or not those attributes stand the test of time.

B004H0N4PC|5.0|Elbow == stunning songwriters; accomplished musicians; entertaining performers.    Not _quite_ up to the truly remarkable level of The Seldom Seen Kid, \\"build a rocket boys!\\" is still a masterpiece. If you want more from your music than 'just' a hum-able tune, this record will give you plenty of listening, thinking and reflection for months.  Then again, that is just like all their other albums - they just keep delivering.    For those that don't know Elbow, the combination of their musical ability, sentimentality and earthy realism is truly remarkable. I don't want to compare them too closely, but think of combining many of the best bits of Peter Gabriel+Joy Division+Coldplay+The Smiths, and you might get something close.    And for those that care - their music is Manchester in a can.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|I don't usually write review but I decide to write one today for the possibility of a fantastic app getting ruined by the irresponsible hit-and-run customers.  I have been with &quot;App of the Day&quot; for awhile and also seen a lot of apps, both good and bad. There is this problem with the customers who are getting the benefit out of this policy: because they don't have to pay for it, they act very irresponsibly. They hit and run. A potentially good app could be ruined by their impatience. Everyone in the right mind knows that because of the fragmentation of Android devices, it's very difficult to make it compatible with all devices all the same time. And also, there are thousand of bugs could occur during installation or using, even though it is compatible. But people are greedy and their greed clouds their mind.  As a good app as this one, I believe it deserve much more than the current ratings. The interface is extremely good and in harmony. It makes me just want to run in kitchen and get my hand down cooking something!  Back to where I was with the acting on impulse customers, I think Amazon should contact the author and delete the comment that are about incompability after the bugs have been fixed. There's no point in keeping them when they certainly don't reflect the true quality of this excellent app.  Send from my Droid X. And it works perfectly fine on my Droid X.

The money that you received from your income must be handled with a plan and a discipline.  It may sound simple but powerful. You got to read the book to digest the surprising details.    The facts in this book may also surprise you why an ordinary fireman end up having more  wealth than a high income lawyer.

1594202842|5.0|Loved this book. You have to read it and make your own opinion, the bad reviews are from angry parents who perhaps fall into the \\"western parent\\" category she describes here and therefore take it very personal, Chua points out all that she sees wrong in Western society's parenting versus HER OWN.  Not everybody is willing to talk about their children and their rebellions as well as she does, but also praised their successes.  There is nothing wrong with raising your kids to go to an Ivy league school and if there's a formula to do so is just the way she describes it like she did with her children.  We must remember these are her memoirs, we all see things differently and if you are to read this book do it with an open mind to other people and cultures.

B000JLQSWE|4.0|The all music guide gave this two stars and it is seen by some as the first bad album that the APP put out.  But that's hogwash.  It's a good album, plain and simple.  It's not great, in the category of some of the earlier work of teh band, but it is good.      It's less progressive and more poppy, with the APP dropping the orchestrations for this one, so you just get the tunes without the frills.  The production is still top notch though.  Standouts are \\"Days are Numbers\\" and I actually think the title track is catchy, in a funky way.    It ain't their best.. but it's definitely more than a two star album - three and a half stars from me.
0785151303|5.0|I am not an aficionado of \\"Art of ...\\" books as The Art of Thor is only the fourth one I have purchased in 40 years. I was, however, a big fan of Marvel's long-haired hammer thrower back in the Jack Kirby days and getting this book was really a no-brainer for me. I was curious as to the evolutionary process by which director Kenneth Branagh transferred Kirby's artwork perfection onto the silver screen.    Like the movie, this book does not disappoint. It features many concept drawings that show how Kirby's Thor costume and helmet designs went from the 2-D comic book page to the 3-D world of cinema. As most of us know, just because it looks great on paper does not mean that it will look equally great on a live actor. Thor's helmet is an example. On paper, Thor shouldn't be without it, but in the movie one realizes just how much of Thor's face it hides (as a battle helmet should). Wisely, the movie establishes that Thor does indeed wear the helmet, then promptly drops it so we can see the actor act. It is also interesting to see actor Chris Hemsworth posing in various rough-design costumes (everyone knew that the placement of the six discs was critical to audiences accepting the costume) and realize how much he bulked up for the role. The text describing Thor's cape is very informative as capes are notoriously difficult to manage in the real world. Of course very few Marvel superheroes need worry about them, but just ask Superman or Batman!     Of particular interest is the design of Mjolnir, Thor's hammer. Branagh did not feel bound to use Kirby's design and had the art department generate about 200 versions, 27 of which are shown in the book. Then, Branagh went back to basics and used Kirby's original design (which is nowhere near what is depicted in ancient Norse texts) with some small embellishments.    Of course the other characters (along with their costumes and weapons) get similar treatment, but at a lower page count. I would have liked to see more about the Gort-like Destroyer, including a shot of the life-size version. The section about Laufey and the Cask of Ancient Winters are just perfect.    There are many drawing and shots of the sets and other props too. All the pictures are high quality, with good contrast and sharpness. The book paper is obviously glossy and also high quality.    But the book is not perfect. The most annoying feature is the page numbering. One can flip through many pages and not find a page number, then they appear and disappear. The art being depicted determines if a page number is present. Some art is so good that a page number would distract from its beauty. Still, it is annoying to not know where one is in the book.    The other gripe is that Wen's wonderful rendition of Thor battling Loki on the bifrost bridge appears only on the cover. It should have been included as a large foldout.    Bottom line: If you liked the movie, this book is a \\"must.\\"

Many of the key players are Jewish.  the average age of these quantum detectives is just, 24.<br /><br />I found the Timeline at kindle location 6318, to be very helpful. The timeline is an important guide to the rest of the book. The story starts at  the birth of Max Planck. on April 23 1858. Referring back and forth to the timeline. The timeline gives us a brief summary of the people, the events and the discoveries.  After reading the timeline I then read in detail the rest of the book.  I enjoyed reading about  how Max Planck was involved in both the science and the politics of Hitler's Germany.<br /><br />One gem, Max Planck at the age of 75, on May 16th 1933 attempted to convince Hitler that some Jewish people or scientists would be very useful to the Germany economy, however Hitler rejected the plea.<br /><br />Before the two World Wars, Europe's top physicists were friends and colleagues. Then war split them into three groups one working for Germany, or working for the Allies and those who remained neutral. The book details  how discovery after discovery snow balled the knowledge so much so that this is describe as the Golden age of physics. The discovery of the atom's nucleus and it's empty space by Rutherford and co at Manchester University, UK, with their gold foil experiment is my favourite.  The American fission bomb came about as a result of Einstein lobbying the American president.<br /><br />The letter Einstein sent to president Roosevelt about the new bomb had unintended consequences for Japan and the post war world. The dangerous  knowledge about E=Mc2 and the huge amounts of energy that is locked up inside atoms, still storks mankind to this day.  But if Einstein hadn't  sent the letter,  Hitler may have obtained nuclear weapons  first. This is a fantastic story about the rapidly emerging dangers of scientific progress and unintended  consequences, The book reminds us that scientist are often the slaves of tyrants and not saints. The book documents and pulls together information from a verity of sources into one place then debates it.  The message, war and science are linked and that reality often forces us to choose between the lesser of two evils.<br /><br />Hitler stopped the export of Uranium from mines in areas under his control, well before the start of the second world war. This indicated that Hitler knew about the new bomb. The book highlights that Hitler and Max Planck had some worrying links.  Hitler was told  about the destructive power of nuclear weapons before the second world war. I wonder who explained the fission bomb to Hitler? and I wonder if he really understood what he was told?<br /><br />Einstein was odd, with that hair and the trousers that were too short, yet he was one of the most remarkable men to have ever lived. This book is full of little details about his life.  Einstein could have been accepted into the army, (he failed the medical) If he had been accepted, that would have changed world history. Franz Ferdinand's driver got lost in the back streets of Sarajevo, one wrong turn by his driver led to Ferdinand's death and that triggered World War one. You keep asking yourself as you read more and more, what is reality ? Quantum reality can at times be surreal like Schr&ouml;dinger's cat, being both  alive and dead, smeared over two states in a superposition of reality . Or like Salvador Dali's persistent reoccurring memory. (The painting with the melting clock).<br /><br />Manjit writes in a clear and easy to understand way. I am interested in  quantum entanglement, where two particles no matter how far they are apart from each other, are able to communicate information from A to B, faster than light speed. The fact that everything we see around us was at one point in time all inside one particle. And very entangled, then bang, all this that we know and see 13.5 billion years later was once inside that one small entangled super particle.<br /><br />This book must be read in conjunction with other books. My other interest is in quantum computers.  I love the book because it shows how the universe is hiding something from us ?  We follow the bread crumbs and build machines like CERN then we find that there is more hidden, then even more.<br /><br />My view after reading the book :<br /><br />The greatest  discovery will be the invention of a quantum computer, and quantum entanglement will be the way the QC computer will input and output data. It's the only way to side step the measurement problem.<br /><br />A Quantum computer will be able to emulate a human mind. This will lead to \\"mind uploading\\". That means digital  immortality. We are obviously living inside a giant quantum 3D computer construct now. To quote Dr David Deutsch  \\"The universe is a giant information processing system\\". And we live inside it and it is inside another universe, Everett's many worlds theory, like those Russian dolls one stacked inside the other. I believe CERN, will decide (one day) that there is a Planck particle at the centre of all hadrons.<br /><br />I believe that there is a tiny 5D black hole,  A  Planck particle at the centre of every hadron, it's obvious.  It is the gravity particle. It grabs energy in proton to proton collisions, this has been observed at CERN and at Fermi Lab. Some energy disappears in all P to P collisions. Where does it go ? It  transfers into another dimension or a new time and a new space, via the 5D, and it's singularity.<br /><br />The proof that we live in a programmed world or inside a quantum computer universe is self-evident, in my view, look at anti matter and matter. The outer shell of the anti proton \\"knows\\" when it encounters a matter proton. It's surface is smart. Look at the energy needed to rip protons apart, atoms can be compressed with billions of tons per square mm and can withstand temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees C and still remain integral. Yet the soft and gentle encounter with the anti particle and it rips the quarks apart. Why ? What is so powerful that it can un-zip the force that holds the quarks together ? What is the possible mechanism ?  How do particles know what they are ? How do protons \\"know\\" that  they have been observed ?  It's a computer programme obviously. That's why Gold and Mercury being chemically only one proton different, have vastly different chemical properties, it's a programme. My opinion from reading this and other books.<br /><br />Quantum physics makes no sense, if a man leaps over a 50 footwall in Grand theft auto we say it's a video game, it's impossible in the real world. What is the real world ? when an atom can be in two or more places at the same time ? The idea that if a particle act as we would expect, in a logical way, then it's reality is a fallacy. If reality has  nothing to do with human logic. then the book's message is clear our logic is flawed. CERN is not looking with reality in it's eye. There is no graviton and no higgs particle.<br /><br />What we see in the book is not logical, like Schr&ouml;dinger's cat, (TE) we are programmed to look for false logic. This mental prejudice, that an atom must be in only one place, is common sense.  Science discovered that this common sense  works well for hunter gathers.  Reality, must logically be independent of observation, energy could not have evolved into all that we see today if it were otherwise. The first ever event had no observer.  An ultimate truth otherwise you would have a quantum chicken and egg problem ?  Everything must have evolved from a first event.<br /><br />In summary, consider when you place a powerful Trans cranial magnet behind your head your consciousness will fade away, move the magnet away from your head and your consciousness will return. what does that tell you ? Show me in the DNA code where, consciousness is coded?  The soul is an electromagnetic ghost. It resides in a quantum computer made of atoms, called the brain, it's the most complex thing in the universe that we know of.  Put the atoms in the brain in a blender after death, they can't support the soul or thought in their raw state, why not ?  When the data ghost has gone,  the soul has gone you cant just call it back. The universe is still hiding a lot from us.<br /><br />I love the men and woman in this book who keep asking why? I ask myself  : The body after death is no lighter, it weighs the same. Is  death just a data event ? Flat bed F-MRI machines will be soon be able to scan the soul, the electromagnet ghost that is us, and upload it into a quantum computer for full emulation.  If the universe is a quantum computer one of Everett's many worlds, and Dr David Deutch is right, souls will be recorded in TIME, in the universes reproductive software and that means souls can be resurrected.  Can we find where the universe hides her data ?  My bet, it is hidden in \\"other dimensions\\" or other parallel universes, or \\"Server farming in Everett's multiverse\\". A great title for Manjit's next book.<br /><br />\\"What is reality\\"?<br /><br />This was a review of the kindle edition, the book is highly recommended  and would be a great gift for a young person thinking of a career in quantum computers.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|There are a lot of 5 star ratings for this film, even when you don't count the bot-critics and family/friends of the production crew.<br />There are also a lot of reviews up and down the star-ratings that make nasty comments toward parents that are offended by Rango's content. Fair enough. However...<br /><br />1 It was marketed toward children and is even a featured trailer on other animated kid-flicks coming out on home video.<br />2 It was created by a Viacom division that once used the tagline - \\"Finally, kids have a channel of their own.\\"<br />3 It IS an animated film that is based on and pays homage to numerous \\"R\\" rated films, not the least of which is the iconic \\"Chinatown,\\" but was never to my knowledge presented as such to the public.<br />4 Amazon's own flagship review warns that the movie is too much for children under the age of 10.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Rango\\" received a \\"PG\\" rating, but considering the content, it presses its nose up against the window of \\"PG-13\\" fairly frequently. The parents expressing concern have a valid reason for warning other parents and don't need, to quote at least one other review,to \\"get over it.\\" I too am a parent, but my 6 \\"kids\\" are all over 18. I bought this film for my wife and I because we are both huge fans of animation as art and \\"Rango\\" looked different than anything else I'd seen outside of Pixar.<br /><br />But, even though I \\"got\\" the \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" moment, the \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"Hang 'Em High\\" Eastwood homages as well as numerous others, that doesn't mean I felt they were story-appropriate or well executed. Many of the nudge-and-wink references so common in modern films are placed to provide a smile to the cinephiles in the audience. This was even true in adult fare such as in the \\"Scream\\" films. None of the ones in \\"Rango\\" will mean a thing to the target demographic. Part of Pixar's immense success is because they have mastered the art of making films children love, but have enough intelligent references to ensure that viewers of all ages will find something to enjoy.  But as so often happens in Hollywood, the filmmakers here have stolen the style of Pixar (and at least visually, in some ways improved upon it) but none of the substance.<br /><br />There are reasons this film deserves only 2 stars for me:<br /><br />1. Numerous people have mentioned the usage of minor cursing in the film. To me that isn't a big deal when compared to the copious amount of sexual references in the film. Calling them \\"huevos\\" or \\"mangos\\" instead of testes and breasts doesn't mean the terms won't be understood, nor is it coy and cute.<br /><br />2. It's extremely racist to resurrect an old latina prostitute and pimp joke even if you subtly change the phrasing to \\"you want to kiss my seester?\\" from the standard (and unprintable) punchline.<br /><br />3. Our society (translate that to the children that will BECOME society) is constantly bombarded with sex and violence. As a result, by the time the average child is 10 years old he or she will have witnessed over 50 thousand violent deaths, and that's just from television. I'm no puritan, but such fare is fun for adults that know the difference between reality and fantasy, not pre-adolescent children. Our kids get desensitized to sexuality and violence by films exactly like \\"Rango.\\"<br /><br />4. A rattlesnake with a gatling gun for a tail and bullet belts in lieu of half its scales? That's not creativity, it's laziness.<br /><br />5. There are so many slow spots in the film that the pacing of the movie more closely resembles a slow crawl than a \\"pace.\\"<br /><br />6. If I wanted a largely humorless and grim cartoon I would have thrown in my copy of Akira or any of the assorted other anime films I own or have seen.<br /><br />I elevated this rating to 2 stars because it incorporates several recent developments in digital animation and the overall look of the \\"cinematography\\" is simply amazing to see. But the reasons I listed above, as well as the fact that asking Gore Verbinski to direct a children's film is like asking Dr. Seuss to rewrite the script for a \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" remake are valid. Finally, the so-called \\"never before seen ending\\" and many of the deleted scenes change very little from the released version of the film - in some cases only a single word or two variance. I would only recommend this film to insomniacs with no elementary school-age children. It's has a brilliant vision, but fails utterly in delivery and execution. I also caution potential customers with small kids. The complaints that myself and others have mentioned regarding how boring and/or inapropriate this movie is for the target crowd are not the mere ravings of a bunch of conservative zealots. The concerns have a far more solid foundation in many ways than the movie itself was built upon.te the script for a \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" remake are valid.

0060254920|5.0|loved this book as a child.  I just purchased it for my 2 year old.  It brings back memories!  Arrived in excellent condition, on time.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Fixed problem...works great now!***         Can't download media on Evo 3d. If fixed  this app looks great. Can't wait to try the recipes and techniques!
B004TTZHBK|3.0|i also am getting a force close on my incredible when i try to download videos. looks like it is a pretty cool app if they get this figured out. sent a message to the developer.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|No download issues. Installed fine and even followed a previous reviewers steps of downloading the media from the menu after clicking download later.  Great pictures and directions.  NO FORCE CLOSE ISSUES.<br /><br />Try reporting the problems and a reboot before 1* reviews.<br /><br />GREAT APP.  THANKS AMAZON!
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Definitely not your typical YA novel and I did appreciate how much more true to typical college life the book was (including the drinking and the sex). The book was well written and engrossing initially, but soon became painful. The relationship of the two main characters, Abby and Travis, soon unravels into what could easily be an episode of MTV's the Jersey Shore... think Sam and that Ronnie character. By the end I was so sick of both of them that I didn't really care where they ended up. Not a healthy relationship kids and please, please remember that tattoos are permanent while not all relationships are.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Comprehensive, great tips. movies are fast, informative. Oliver I'd passionate about fresh food. Gives a pantry list of essentials and a list to go shopping with. Already learned 4 new things today in less than 20 minutes. Thanks Amazon and thanks Jamie  Oliver. Will digest this to anyone who asks. Won't mention I got it for free;)
0307454541|5.0|I am quick to jump on plot lapses, unlikelyhoods, errors, and unwarranted foolishness by smart characters. This was a smart book with a fully realized world and rich details. It takes off after a few dry chapters when we meet The Girl With...<br />Just wanted to add my 5 star rating and add the cliche that I did not want it to end and loved the lovingly detailed epilog.<br />This is no DaVinci Code.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Same old problems with Amazon apps. When you try to download the extra content, it says that you are running unlicensed copy, that's when the app isn't force closing every 20 seconds. Buying apps from Amazon is risky. Many of the apps do not recognize your purchase as valid and will not run.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|no issues during initial download, however, I get an error when choose the 80mb download. Please fix for HTC thunderbolt. Thanks.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they leave out portions of the original.  Some songs are left out due to Eponine not being seen as a child, so later songs are left out as well.
030746363X|5.0|The author has a light, entertaining writing style and he describes a simple but effective method for changing your body and life. I started following the recommended diet in January along with the kettle bell exercises. I am writing this in July and have lost 42 pounds, lowered my blood pressure to 95/65, and am stronger and healthier than I have been since the 1980's. My wife has lost over 15 pounds and also feels healthier. I have recommended the book to several friends who also have similar results IF they have the discipline to stick with the program. I highly recommend this book.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I love this app. Install like others have suggested and you won't have any problems installing this. For those of us who aren't good at cooking this app will &quot;hold your hand&quot; all through the process.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I was also a little hesitant to download this app after seeing some of the bad reviews.  I downloaded it anyway and am glad I did.  Works great on the Droid X2.  I did get an error when I tried to download the 80mb additional content on 3G but when I switched to wireless everything went smoothly.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I love Jamie Oliver and this is one well made app! There's over 80MB of content. This app is deep! Tons of pics to accompany the step by step instructions and even videos too! Very well organized and pleasing to the eye. I don't enjoy cooking but this app already has me a little bit excited about cooking. I love the Amazon app store because where else cam you get a quality $8 app for free? And legally!
0307341569|5.0|Enough prose to delight but easy enough reading that you can breeze through it in a few days...

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|I am a huge Pixar fan, i have loved almost all it's movies and liked a couple, i own all of them on Bluray with the exception of \\"Finding Nemo\\" (loved it, not available on Bluray yet). In my personal Pixar ranking \\"Cars\\" is only second to the Toy Story trilogy despite critics ranking it at the bottom, it's such a heartwarming story with excellent caracter development and beautifull ending. The formula in Pixar has been always the same, they create memorable and appealing caracters and give them excellent stories that are enjoyable for both kids and grownups. That is exactly what made Pixar so special and different to other studios that heavily relay on eyecatching visual effects and place story writing in second or third place. Ask any kid what are the names for the creatures in \\"Monsters vs Aliens\\" or the alien kid in \\"Planet 51\\" and they will stare at you with no answer, then ask that same kid the name of the evil emperor in \\"Toy Story\\" or Lightning McQueens carrier truck in \\"Cars\\" and almost for shure they will tell you they're names. Unfortunately \\"Cars 2\\" seems to be created to exploit some of Pixar's most beloved caracters more than continuing what they achieved in the first film and created a vast number of new caracters to exploit them with merchandising (just take a look at Wal Mart). Success was already secured in the US, but all that thing about that silly international race was -i think- to appeal to the foreign box office. The movie is full of cliches and silly situations immposible to be believed (in the context) even by a kid. I am so disappointed with this movie that i wish \\"Cars 2\\" could be remaid and retake the story where it left in \\"Cars\\", sadly this movie gave a \\"no return\\" turn to the original story and a \\"Cars 3\\" movie will not be able to undue the dammage.  Now i have to decide if i am going to purchase the \\"Cars 2\\" Bluray only to keep my Pixar collection complete or skip as a way to protest and put a superteeny pressure on Pixar to return tothey're roots and do what they do best, and that is giving a real story not just visuals.

B005D9MUWY|2.0|If I were using a phone with no hardware keyboard I would give this 5 stars.  On my OG Droid, however, using swiftkey in combination with the hardware keyboard causes problems with spacebar input recognition. I use my hardware keyboard probably 70% of the time, so this quickly caused me to switch back to the stock keyboard (the original swiftkey had its own problems with the hardware keyboard). The problem generally ends up simply having spacebar input one character off. thus texts look like &quot;hey,w herea re you?&quot; I would love to see this problem fixed.
B000001FT2|4.0|Nightclubbing is definitely Grace's best studio album. There are so many classic tracks here to tickle your ears. Pull Up To The Bumper trucks along with car horns and a scratchy hook. Feel Up, consisting of upbeat African rhythms is one of the best here. Walking In The Rain has Grace speaking in deep intonation \\"Feeling like a woman, looking like a man.\\" And then there's the showstopper Nightclubbing.<br /><br />The cover is definitely very strong.There is no middle ground. My friends' reactions were polarized. They were either scared by it or loved the avant garde look!<br /><br />Long before the accessible Lady Gaga and audience friendly Pink, Grace Jones was doing her trademark snarl and strutting around with her outrageous image. So if you want the true original, go for Grace!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|its a very nice app but as everybody already noticed it forces to close as soon as you try to download the media. it also has some kind of license issue and doesnt recognize that it has been installed as a free app. ps i am using nexus one.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have read many of the following comments and I agree with many of them. I found the first 500 pages of the book to be mostly repetitive fluff that needed editing. I am sure the people at the publishing house were not eager to delay the printing further by asking GRRM to cut things out. There is a saying that the journey is more important that the ending. I often agree. However, in ADWD, Martin gives us too much travel. I don't want to read about boat rides. I want to know how the plot progresses. That is the biggest problem with this book. Nothing much happens. Sure it is fun to read about my favorite characters but in the end I had 1000+ pages of no movement. I am also sick of the killing of characters for no apparent reason. When Character A is told time and time again that maybe things are dangerous, you would think that character would listen and not just ignore it.<br /><br />My final problem isn't with the book itself. In a recent Entertainment Weekly there is an article about Martin. Near the end the author of the article mentions that GRRM will be getting back to the series... in January. JANUARY?! 5 months with no writing on the next book? If that isn't a clear indication that Martin has no intention of ever finishing this series, I don't know what is.

1594484805|4.0|This next book of Daniel Pink (following \\"A whole new mind\\") is published in 2010 and is even more impressive. Daniel provides more examples and handles to implement his valuable insights into our lives and businesses. Those who are able to grasp the big picture in combination with the the transformation of the workplace, the impact of social media and new right-brain leadership will have significantly higher chances for success in their activities. Pink outlines it along the three laws of mastery: autonomy, mastery and purpose. If you are serious about creating a new drive in your life, work and team, this is a must read. For me the best read of the year so far.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|Name of the Wind is a top 10 fantasy book as far as I'm concerned.  But this book was so boring that I skipped whole sections of it.  Seriously.  I skipped at least 250 pages of this book - it sufferred from endless, pointless description, much like Book 2 of the Eragon series...<br /><br />I think what's really wrong is that the author spent too much time trying to be Kvothe, trying to make him so clever and descriptive, instead of letting the Kvothe he introduced us to in the first book be Kvothe.  Fortunately, my brother warned me that this book was not as good so I got it from the library and saved myself some loot.<br /><br />Please mister rothfuss, get out of your own way and let kvothe tell the story - don't turn this series, which could have been a top ten fantasy series of all time, into a tired, endless drawl that satisfies your own cravings to describe and tell and be clever but does so at the expense of the story.
1936719118|3.0|This book is a joy to read. The 77 pages make it perfect for reading during the vacation, but nevertheless contain very valuable lessons. Derek describes his experience with his hobby \\"CD Baby\\" which grew into a multi-million business. His examples how he exceeds his customers wildest expectations are hilarious. Derek concludes explaining the picture on the cover and says he wishes you to feel the same joy and anticipation as the little boy, because that's what it feels like to pursue the things you want. My favorite quote of the book: \\"You have to just do whatever you love the most, or you'll lose interest in the whole thing.\\"
1594481717|3.0|A must read. As we are exiting the Industrial Age, Pink says, we are entering the Conceptual Age. High Concept and High Touch are the keywords, describing this from six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, meaning. Highly inspiring with practical exercises. In short: \\"People who rely on logic and philosophy and rational explanations let the best part of their mind languish\\" (William Butler Yeats).
B00005NB0H|5.0|Leeds is , for me,  indeed one of  the top 5 live rock albums ever. There are plenty Leed reviews, so let me tell you there is other Who live album that comes close to Leeds energy and performance-wise.<br /><br />Yes... The who site shows that 'the group put together a double CD called A VIEW FROM A BACKSTAGE PASS, containing 26 rare or previously unreleased recordings of the band playing live at their legendary, iconic best, in the 'Keith Moon' era, available free to all subscribers to their official website'.<br /><br />Well, this selection offers really interesting material for Who fans,maybe not for newcomers.  The audio is not perfect, some tracks have errors, but the feel, conviction and energy of the golden years is quite present.  A great companion for live at Leeds.<br /><br />The recent Who greatest hits includes about a dozen songs from View from backstage pass, but without the stage banter, the spoken intros, etc, which are great.

I noticed the curries recipes rely on pastes that you may not have in your local store.  It would be useful to know the content of those pastes so you could attempt those recipes out here in the midwest.  However, I can see where those pastes enable you to pull off the meal in 20 minutes.

Even though I haven't always been crazy about those changes, I've never felt any of their albums have been \\"bad\\".  \\"Bad\\" is always hard to define, music being so subjective as it is.<br /><br />But this one... well, I've been listening to it for weeks now and I almost feel I have to attach a stupid, objective label \\"bad\\" to it.<br /><br />Normally I think I could get on board with the stylistic changes, but, seriously... it feels a little bit like some sad, middle-aged men (keep in mind that I am myself \\"middle-aged\\", but not sad) realized they missed some techno/industrial-metal bandwagon they actually wanted to be on a decade ago, so are now trying to re-invent themselves by going back in time, pretending like what they're doing actually has some new-found relevance.<br /><br />My dislike comes from the combination of feeling like this is misplaced in time and, perhaps more importantly, poorly executed.  Even some of the songs I like I actually think pretty much suck.  I mean, the ones I \\"like\\" are catchy, but in one case, it's this monotonous pounding, non-stop techno-thud beat for like 6 full minutes, and it just gets old.  And the songs that reflect a more Covenant (or maybe Domination) feel are just... I dunno... stupid.  Honestly, in many cases, I actually think that Pete Sandoval's absence may have not actually been due to his back trouble, but b/c he also thought the whole thing was stupid.<br /><br />I tried... it just didn't work for me.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|We rented Sucker Punch on standard DVD from Redbox today and it was quite an experience.  It was a visual orgy that mixes my AP English Composition teacher's sadism with music videos, Alice in Wonderland, and a JapAnime-Loving teen's wet dream all together into what is basically a 45 minute film, story-wise, that stretches out to almost 2 hours as a result of a handful of metaphorical sequences that have little to do with the story but create opportunities for the Zack Snyder Film Team to show what cutting edge technology and visionaries with keen eyes and healthy imaginations can do for movies.  It was visually striking on my big TV so in Digital 3D on a big theater screen I bet it was breath taking.  While the visuals were fun, the movie DOES actually have more than meets the eye (as far as I can tell since I just finished watching it and have not yet read anything beyond those opening week reviews).<br /><br />There are 4 levels to this movie:<br /><br />1. Reality in a Asylum (1940-1955 era when lobotomies were being performed)<br />2. Drugged reality in the Brothel<br />3. Music-fueled, dancing imagination-wars<br />4. Metaphysical super-reality that includes and transcends 1, 2 & 3<br /><br />In the first level (the 45 minute story part) the movie is about 2 young women.  One experiences a family tragedy which cascades her into the asylum and kicks off the drugged, 2nd level of the movie.  The other woman was already at the asylum and is the key to the development of the metaphysical level of the movie.  It is the intersection of these two women that provides the structure to everything and I think much of the initial poor critical reception that I saw during the first week was probably due to people missing this.<br /><br />The second level kicks off shortly after the arrival at the asylum once the mind-numbing drugs are introduced.  The perceived reality shifts to that of a brothel populated by unwillingly held women and the handful of low-life males who control them. It is in this world that all the relationships are forged and the plans are drawn for escape.  A key component to executing each portion of the plan is the distraction dances that the lead girl does while her accomplices carry out the escape plans behind the backs of the gawking men.<br /><br />The third level, the dancing imagination-wars, is what we are presented with when the distraction dances are done. Rather than watch an actual dance number, the viewer is transported to a visual interpretation of the dancer's emotional and psychological state. The dancing imagination-wars have Lord of the Rings-style castle sieges (complete with orks and dragons), Samurai Giants in Feudal Japan, WWI steam-punk trench warfare, and future-scape iRobot terrorists on floating bullet trains... and the heroines dive into all the battles using modern automatic rifles, swords, knives, and some other small arms that look like they were plucked out of various points in history.  If you have ever dreamed of modern paratroopers dropping in to reinforce Aragorn and Frodo, this is your chance to see just such a lop-sided battle... with the bonus of the cleavage-heavy reinforcements skull stomping while wearing cute mini-skirts.  All this takes place with some pretty decent modern rock music fueling the artistry of it all.  Bjork was one of the featured, which left me scratching my head, but aside from her infamous vocals it worked well enough.<br /><br />The fourth level runs concurrently with everything else that is seen. Taken by itself it is only a few minutes long and everything else in the movie is simply its supporting argument. The Wise Man/Commander/Angel (Scott Glenn) (with the help of the narrator) takes care of telling this portion, laying out the thesis statement in the opening scenes and the closing statement at the end while also physically appearing throughout, tying the whole mess together.<br /><br />I liked this movie for 2 reasons: It was sci-fi, fantasy, gunblasting action with respectably good acting from the hotties AND it fed my brain something to think about on the level of the fun stuff we were agonizing over and writing about back in AP English.  If you hated writing English papers you might not \\"get\\" this movie enough to appreciate it... or if you hate noisy action flicks, you probably won't get past the gratuitous eye candy and overwhelming audio in order to study the brain food. While it isn't as deep as Watchmen, it is cut from a similar cloth, so I'd wager that Watchmen lovers will enjoy this.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it is a PG-13 movie that deals with very dark themes that are obviously hard-core R. I'm not complaining about the lack of gore or nudity (they wouldn't have improved the movie), but there is no way I'd let my kids see this when they hit 13.  I would have been upset if I had unknowingly taken a young teen to this at a theater.<br /><br />It isn't getting 5 stars because it has low re-watch-ability. It is amazing, beautiful, well executed and thought provoking, but it is a bit like Pan's Labyrinth or Watchmen in that, at its core, it is NOT fun and its darkness does not beckon for a second viewing.  I'll stick to \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", \\"The Princess Bride\\" and \\"Ella Enchanted\\" for multiple viewing movies.<br /><br />4/5 or 8.5/10t fed my brain something to think about on the level of the fun stuff we were agonizing over and writing about back in AP English.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|Love Mr. Groban's voice - always have, always will. That said, the songwriting should have been left to the professionals. Far too many of the lyrics on this album are illogical, amateurish, and, sad to say, laughable. The songs might have been utterly beautiful if sung in Italian, a language I enjoy listening to but have no ability to translate, and would have been blissfully unaware of the absurdity. And doesn't everything sound better sung in Italian, especially by Josh Groban. Sorry to say, but I only play this CD in the car when I want some comic relief and a good laugh. Doesn't make me love Groban any less. As the cliche goes, he could sing the telephone book and I'd probably enjoy it. I just don't like laughing when I listen to a Groban album - and with Illuminations, I cannot help it.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|At first, the video downloads weren't downloading, but that seems to be fixed because the queued videos are downloading now.  Having said that, I've watched the Knife Skills, Preparing Garlic, and other vids and I'm impressed!  Jaime is talking and teaching to ' me' , which is not too quick and slow enough for me to pick it all up.  I've already learned soo much!<br /><br />This app is very good!
B002ZG98UA|3.0|Afterlife is probably my least favorite in the Resident Evil movie series, but that's mainly because after the first 20 minutes of nonstop generic shooting action, you're unfortunately forced to persevere 40 straight minutes of melodramatic storytelling that features absolutely *no* action whatsoever. Alright, occasionally a tentacle-faced zombie will make an appearance resulting in the main characters cleaning their clock with their always-ready and handy weapons, but that's about all the excitement that occurs during this 40-minute timeframe.     After that, the action picks up when this monster called the Executioner comes into the picture, and this one scene in particular where he tosses his axe around the room and tries to smack Jill and Claire with it is definitely my favorite part of the movie. Besides that, well the head-splitting dobermans are awesome but that's not until the very end. I was honestly hoping the Executioner was Nemesis in disguise, but no such luck.     I have to be totally honest though- the lack of suspense and horror elements is disappointing. I realize by this point we're supposed to be used to the fact that the movie series doesn't deliver the same kind of horror as the Resident Evil video games, but I fail to accept a lack of horror elements in the case of Afterlife thanks to several boring moments that did nothing to entice the viewers.  With no action, suspense or horror to speak of, how were viewers supposed to get something satisfying out of about half of Afterlife?
B00000JLWW|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition of my DVD. I bought it as a gift and it ran perfectly :D

1416562605|5.0|Balram Halwai considers himself a \\"Social Entrepreneur,\\" of great import. In a series of darkly humorous letters to a visiting dignitary from China, he traces his journey from an impoverished village in India to the great city of Delhi and his rise from tea boy, to taxi driver, to murderer. This book took me captive from its first page. The narrator, now an extremely successful businessman, assumes that he holds the key to India's entrepreneurial success. The resulting novel throbs with life as Adiga takes us into the world of the Indian Rooster Coop, his marvelous metaphor for India's centuries old caste culture that entraps the poor by inculcating a mentality of servitude and debasement.

B004TACMZ8|5.0|This has allot of feature built into the digital read-out. It is user friendly and has the hole that I would of never thought of. Not only can you hang it up on the nail on the wall it is useful to use the pencil to jot down where is the center point for the wall where the electric line or stud is going to be and where hole should be drilled. or even to start a starting drill mark with a power drill. This for all those reasons, is best product of its class.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|to start off,clapton is my favorite guitarist of all time.that being said my complaint isn't choice of songs or the overall sound of the recording but the dearth of licks from clapton himself.if clapton couldn't play would be one thing,but hearing live recordings of recent concerts show that isn't the case.there are some great blues covers on the disc that are dominated by the likes of kim wilson,doyle bramhall,wynton marsalis etc.the problem isn't the above names but the fact that this is a clapton solo album and i would prefer to hear the master himself solo than his numerous guest.the album is fine but i expect more from the greats.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|This app is worth exactly what I paid for it. $0!!!!  Intro has no audio and it freezes up before the intro ends.  I was never able to get past the intro, and I had to reboot my tablet every time I tried to run it.

006097625X|5.0|the title may fool you to think this is a book about comics.  actually this book is about presentation and communication technology.<br />in today's powerpoint centric world, this book provides great insight and the much needed tools to tell a story better.  i find this book very useful for business application especially in sales and marketing presentation.
B001KYP55A|5.0|This is a Target Exclusive CD/DVD Combo. Its the standard CD & a bonus DVD: 1. Watch the Recording Session of \\"Change\\"\\" / 2. In the Studio with Taylor Swift and Colbie Caillat Recording \\"Breathe\\". it's Great! Recommended!
1452101248|5.0|FAbulous... I love everything about this cookbook.  Creative flavours, some very Turkish recipes.  I'm having fun with this one.  Thank you!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|after watching the initial video it wanted to download 20 mb more video, then I got the force close button .
0425241505|5.0|I loved this book. I'm not going to take it apart and analyze it to death. I loved the characters, the premise, the world building. And can't wait for the second one which is due out very soon. If you like paranormal romance this is a keeper. Dragos reminded me so much of Wrath in my favorite series by J.R. Ward which really made the book enjoyable for me, similar yet different. Dragos is at the top of his food chain as Wrath is his.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|Gorgeous app with great content.  I decided to download knowing from reviews that it would probably FC and choke... Which it did.  But I figured I'd get it free today and hope an update will fix the problems soon.  (I'd probably pay about $5 for this application and rate it 5 stars if it worked smoothly.)
B000003C4K|5.0|Bonded by Blood is my all-time favorite thrash album.  It's not super-technical, and the vocals are an acquired taste to some, but you just can't go any better for Bay Area thrash than this jewel right here.  The H-Team (Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt) construct a satanic mortuary full of riffs and solos that draw blood.  The vocals of Paul Baloff are classic--to me there was no better thrash vocalist.  Drums and bass are executed perfectly--the rhythm section thrashes like there is no tomorrow.  It is impossible to pick a favorite track on this release--they all kick ass.  Recommended purchase.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|I am very glad that Jessie J got this album published.<br />She had great talent in both her writing, and her vocalizing.<br />That's something that seems to be lost on so many of today's performers.<br />When you have to feed your voice through synthesizers, you have no talent.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|On  Asus Transformer all it does is download for every selection you make.   Very slow and keeps rotating back and forth between landscape and portrait for pictures vs text. Very tedious on a tablet.  Amazon needs uninstall option so apps I have removed don't show as installed.
1416572287|4.0|The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the author's imaginary conversations with his dog do get a little too cute at times. But having said that, this is a really good \\"Quantum Physics for Dummies\\" type of book. I was hoping for--and got--a decent layman's understanding of the basic concepts of quantum physics from this book (I think having been a dog lover for all of my life and a dog owner for most of it helped me). The concept of explaining physics by using analogies of dogs chasing rabbits may seem too cute by half, and, okay, as I wrote in my opening statement, at times it is. But if you want a physics book that is a). readable without putting you to sleep or making you feel like your brain will explode, and b). actually teaches you something, I recommend this book. If you also read Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, as I did after reading this, you will know even more (just remember the old saying: if you think you understand quantum theory, you REALLY don't understand quantum theory!).
B004GCK6XY|5.0|I like the movie very much. It is one of my favorite movies. However, I didn't see that much noticeable difference from the DVD version I have than with this Blu-Ray version. On repeated viewings I began to notice improvements in the picture quality and clarity in the Blu-Ray but still the DVD was very close to the Blu-Ray. Another person I know who is really into the technical aspects of Blu-Ray picture quality was not very impressed. When I first got the DVD though (before I got the Blu-Ray) I remarked 'This isn't Blu-Ray. It's a really great picture). Even though the quality to me is similar between the Blu-Ray and the DVD, I am still happy I got the Blu-Ray version though I could have done without the British Accent insert into the setup of the movie before you got to the movie menus.
B002YOKVU4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite movie of all time.  One of the movies I can watch over and over and it never gets old.  Its great now to have it on Blu Ray.  But I had bought it used from a seller, and it came not in the regular Blu-Ray case, but in an old style dvd rental case.  It just doesnt look nice and doesnt go with the rest of my Blu Ray collection.  Disappointed about that.  But the movie itself is a perfect 10.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Great app from a great chef!<br /><br />Force closes when trying to download the 80mb of extras needed to view everything. Htc inspire 4g
B002G1YPH0|2.0|I ordered this item about a month ago. However, on arrival, one of the parts (back part) was missing. I have gone to the official site and while they \\"approved\\" my complaint and say that the part will be shipped within 3-5 days once the manufacturer gives the part to them, they still have not received it and thus I still have not gotten it.    EDIT: part finally came in the mail today; after one month.
0374531269|5.0|I found this book in my stack for the summer and thought it might be interesting.  Well, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  I read it in about 2-3 nights and that is good for me since I have three kids.  It makes you realize that others have it a lot worse than you and forces (if you so need that) you to realize how grateful we all should be to God for the graces he provides.  What a great book.  I would love for the author to speak in our school district.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This movie is very smart and has a profound message, so young children and some adults ain't gonna get it.  The animation is flawless and the best yet, the actors behind the voices are some of the best around, and the music is the best western music I have ever heard in a movie.  Going beyond that, the plot based around Rango is both deeply philosophical and rooted in political morality.  If you enjoy being astounded by true genius, then you will love Rango, and Johnny Depp is absolutely brilliant as the main character.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it in one sitting and became involved with the characters. Would recommend to other YA fans.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this for my Baby Trend jogging stroller, which came with the worst cupholders ever.  This caddy is great because it holds my HUGE water bottle perfectly and has a nice zippered compartment for keys, cash, etc, as well as another large compartment for my daughter's snacks and sippy cup.  Great addition to my stroller.  I love the light metal rim, too, because it keeps the shape very well, yet doesn't affect how the stroller folds up.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Works great on my EVO 3D. It's a tower defense game where the baddies move through the map with random start and end points. The places where you can build turrets and such are fixed (i.e. cannot just build them anywhere). The graphics are nice and the game is very playable. The bad guys actually start to attack and destroy turrets after a few levels which was a shock at first but adds another welcome level of complexity.    I like it
B0045JEPXU|5.0|Prior to this CD, I wasn't too big of a fan of Pitbull's. He made a few songs I liked but that was pretty much it. I heard \\"Give Me Everything\\" on the radio and I was hooked! I bought the CD and haven't regretted it at all. This is a more fun, dance album than I've known him to record. It's amazing! In the beginning, I had a few favorite tracks but now I love them all! So give the album a try. This was my first Pitbull album but at this rate, it won't be my last.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Works great on the EVO 3D. Awesome recipe app with step by step instructions and pictures at every step. Very cool for a free app of the day.

Turisas have matured into a Well oiled Fighting Machine  With a Fantastic Album of varied song subjects including Vikings,War,Pirates and other well reasearched stories...  Well played and a tightness that is rarely seen out side of the biggest bands around...  This is Music you can march into Battle to or just plain sit and enjoy in the comfort of your own home...  This Album gets Better and Better with each listening and will remain in your head for ever!!!  Excellent,Wonderful Album worthy of a 9/10 any day of the week...  Only reason it doesnt get 10/10 is Amon Amarths last album was a 10 but this is very very close!!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be impressed with this app at first, but it didn&apos;t take long for that to change. This app has great recipes, great cooking tips, and great videos and pictures to help you along. You can create shopping lists based on the recipes that you are cooking. I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find a better cooking app out there. $7.99 is a little steep, but it is the best I&apos;ve found.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Suspense movie starring Anthony Hopkins as billionaire Charles Morse married to a beautiful super model played by Elle McPherson as they go to Alaska for a swimsuit shoot.  Alec Baldwin plays the photographer Robert Green, who plans to kill Hopkins in the wild to ensure that he not only gets his wife but collects the guy's huge fortune.  They fly out to the middle of nowhere to find a man that Green thinks would make a perfect piece for the photoshoot but instead, their boatplane runs into a flock of geese that damage the plane and forces it to crash.  Charles begins to piece two and two together and figures out that Green is planning to kill him someway.  As this plays out, they unknowingly are being stalked by a giant kodiak bear played by the late Bart the bear, lol.  The action picks up as they try to survive and kill the bear and find their way back to civilization.  Great movie and the cast is superb especially with Hopkins as the VERY intelligent billionaire.  You'll love it!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|it's a good app probably equivalent to several (many) episodes of food channel. great and easy reference and videos. autorotate isn't working right on my gtablet, but that doesn't impede the usefulness.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|First off, works great on my D2 running froyo liberty, none of the force close issues that others are having.  The app itself seems interesting. The step by step instructions are clear and the pictures of each step are helpful. My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that to see the pictures with the recipe you need to have your phone horizontal, but then to go back to the menu it needs to be verticle. It would be nice to be able to do everything without having to keep rotating the phone.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|Installed and ran the app. Once I added the optional 80 mb it force closed multiple times. I'll try on my Droid X next. Looks like it has great potential.
B001DJLD1M|3.0|How come mine came with 4 discs? It says on the cover that the 4 film favorites dvd only comes with 2-double sided discs. Did I received pirated or copied DVDs?
B004TTZHBK|3.0|I gave this 3 stars only because of the how-to videos. There aren&apos;t enough recipes in this app to justify a $7.99 price tag. Unless you&apos;re a die hard naked chief fan, skip this one till the price comes way down.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a well thought out, well implemented app. Works great if you follow advice to click &quot;Later&quot; for additional content and install from within the app. Galaxy Tab, Droid X
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Just sat through it, and, although it is truly an effects fan's wet dream,the film did nothing for me.<br /><br />I understood it perfectly fine, so let's not drag out that old chestnut \\"He doesn't like it, so he obviously is misinterpreting the film.\\" The problem is, the story is simply as boring as all hell. I was so bored halfway through, that I stopped the disc for awhile so that I could wake up. I liked it very much during the first twenty minutes or so, and then all the flash began to unravel into a big pile of nothing.....at least, nothing remotely interesting. It's flash for flash's sake, story be damned, from that point on.<br /><br />I suppose some of the video-game addicted youth would love this type of thing, though. Until a new Guitar Hero game comes out, anyway. Then this \\"film\\" will be forgotten....and rightfully so.

B0055CJ8T2|5.0|This is by far Kelly Rowland's best effort, and I know there will be many more to come.      I'm Dat Chick-5/5: Great Opener; great beat; so much sass and confidence.    Work It Man-5/5: Excellent R&B Track. Vocally it's great and Lil Playy raps two very nice verses.    Motivation-5/5: This song has spoken for itself.  I knew it would be a hit on first listen.    Lay It On Me-4.5/5: Nice Summer Record.    Feeling Me Right Now 5/5: This is definitely single worthy. One of the album's stand-out tracks.    Turn It Up-4.5/5: I love the concept of this song.  Kelly gives great vocals here.    All of The Night-5/5: Very radio-friendly song. Could definitely work well as a single.    Keep It Between Us-5/5: My personal favorite.  This track is flawless. Hands down!    Commander 5/5: Loved Commander since Kelly premiered it at the 2010 Winter Music Conference.    Down For Whatever-4/5: This song has great potential to be another Kelly Rowland Dance hit, but I prefer R&B Kelly any day.    Heaven & Earth 5/5: I love this record.  It describes Kelly to a T. It's a soul-searching, tear-jerking ballad.    Each Other 5/5: Each Other is a nice party jam, and I love Kelly's vocals on this.    Motivation (Rebel Rock Remix)-4.5/5: I like it, but nothing compares to the original!    Commander Urban Remix 4/5: Nice slow jam, but the original overshadows this as well!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This book could lose at least one hundred pages just by decent editing.  You know nothing, Jon Snow ... The Lannisters always pay their debts ... Words are wind.  The first few times these phrases were used they meant something.  Now they are just silly.<br /><br />Horse meat is always charred on the outside and red in the middle.

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee did an excellent job with this book.  Coming from someone who came a week shy of finising the fifth grade, she comes off as Intelligent, Introspective, even Phillisophical.  Mostly she comes off as kindhearted, warm, generous and loving.      All of this inspite of the awful things that were done to her.  Her book and her Sawyer interview, coupled with her Foundation and her genuine spirit, are going to do many things for many people. already have, in fact.     I can personally say that she has helped me come to terms with the demons in my own life.  I thank her personally for that.     The skies the limit Jaycee.  reach for the stars.....or the moon that you and your mom love so much.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Like many of you guys, I had the force close issue when trying to download the data.  There were two ways I was able to work around this: 1) You can download the individual tips videos with no issue.  2) If you go to the settings and Download Media from there, the force close issue doesn't pop up.    Not sure if this was just me, your results may vary.  I'm using a Droid 3.    As for the actual app, I'm HIGHLY impressed.  It's polished with nice pictures, good videos and what look like great recipes.  Obviously, I haven't cooked any of them yet, but I'm sure they are good.  I know my girlfriend will love it for the tips videos (i.e. How to slice and chop an onion).      At $8, the app may not be worth it, unless you planned on trying all the recipes, but for FREE?  Absolutely amazing app.    (PS- Props to the free appstore reminder app I found in the android marketplace...Probably would have missed this one today otherwise)
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Workaround? None needed. I enabled WiFi, answered yes to the introductory download, and it is doing its thing. Like most apps with large downloads, it doesn&apos;t want to do out over 3g. They should fix the fc, though, and replace it with a message about wifi so that users will understand what is happening. This app is pretty awesome.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Since my first read of Ender's game I have yet to find a book where I connect with the main character as well I did with Ender.  Until, The Hunger Games.  From beginning to end Suzanne Collins keeps you entirely enthralled by her heroin Katniss.  If you are wondering if this book is worth the money to purchase let me assure you it is.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  It is a quick but enjoyable read that you will find yourself in an entirely different world fighting for your life!  Engaging and entertaining.  Entirely worthy all five stars.

1451629184|5.0|Though heartbreaking, this book provides an interesting and in-depth view of the kidnapping of Jaycee Duggard. I commend her for the courage that it must've taken to write this book, and wanted to support her by buying it.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|A couple idiots wrote a review on this and gave it a low rating and it had nothing to do with the music.  This album is spectacular, and by far the best that Trivium has ever come out with.  The guitars are spectacular, the vocals are the best ever heard on a Trivium album and the drums will blow your mind.    It mixes the sound they experimented with on their previous release with the complicated, more progressive song structures of their earlier works.  In other words, it's the best of both worlds.
0670022411|5.0|So.....where to begin? First, this is going in the \\"my favorite books\\" category and definitely the best book I've read all year. A Discovery of Witches made me laugh, cry, frustrated, scream and many other emotions. This book is intelligent, fun and a beautiful love story!    I won't go on and on into the details of A Discovery of Witches due to many others doing a better job than I can. However, I'll add a couple of notes and why I LOVED this book.     1) This is a long book. Even though the length is long there isn't a bunch of filler. There is character building without excess. Now I'm not positive of this next comment, but I have a strong feeling I'm right (I'll have to wait for the next two books). I believe there are A LOT of clues about what will be coming in the next book, so in my opinion there is a reason for every scene, every detail. No waste of words in this book and I'm rereading it right now trying to come up with possible hypotheses on the future of the series.   2) Food and wine are supporting characters. Not literally but my love of both made both a delicious add to the book.  3) Both main characters, Diana and Matthew, do yoga on a regular basis (Me too).  4) Nothing is as it seems.  5) Poetry and books within the book.  6) The history is AMAZING and Deborah Harkness is one smart cookie!  7) I love, love, love paranormal books and the romance is a super-de-duper added bonus. Witches, vampires and Daemons are all primary characters. A quick note to those who like their PR with sex......this book doesn't involve sex. Some vague descriptions of \\"making out\\" are about it. However, with or without sex, there is flirting, attraction and some confusion and tension regarding the flirtation and attraction. It's good stuff!  8) I just found this out, but apparently these books are going to be made into movies (no surprise). I normally don't like this, but I'm looking forward to these movies like I looked forward to the Harry Potter movies.    I cannot waitfor the second book to come out, which is supposed to be sometime in 2012. I hope people will read this book and love it as much as I did! Namaste!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|love this puzzle game. very challenging and entertaining.  upgrades are avail. some combos are hard some too easy. works well on tablet.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|You never know what to expect from Johnny Depp.  The Mad Hatter,  Willy Wonka.  Jack Sparrow.  Ed Wood.  Barnabas Collins.  Tonto.  Sweeney Todd.  Has any other contemporary actor been as diverse or risk-taking as Depp?  Maybe Meryl Streep.<br />Add RANGO the wisecracking talking chameleon to his growing list.  RANGO is immensely enjoyable and it's not a Pixar, Dreamworks or Disney!  It's really aimed at adult audiences but kids will enjoy the bizarre and eccentric characters and will most likely scream in terror at one of animation's vilest villains--Jake the Rattlesnake.<br />RANGO;s director, Gore Verbanski (sp) expertly pays homage to both traditional and spaghetti westerns and the production team paints a marvelous landscape in the town of Dirt.  Hans Zimmer composed a great score to punctuate the movie and the owl storytellers a brilliant addition.<br />While the movie belongs to Depp, the other voice actors are very good:  Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy, Ray Winstone, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina and Timothy Olyphant.<br />RANGO is great entertainment and will deservedly get an Oscar nomination.  A sequel?  Hmmm...
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is a lovely story about two people who for 30 years, after a chance meeting in their 20's, decide to meet at the same hotel at the same time every year.  Although it begins as a sexual tryst, it's really more about a poignant connection between two people and the changes that take place in their lives in the span of a year.  The movie is little dated and may not appeal to the younger generation but the story itself is profound and timeless.
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|Great album, #7 Lighters is the only weak spot, Bruno Mars does not belong on any Shady album. Eminem is at his best and Royce is a great complement to his style.
0553801473|4.0|This was a good book. Not a perfect book.  Not nearly as good as the first three, but better than the fourth BUT ALSO made the fourth a more worthwhile read.  I look forward to the next.  Hopefully will still remember all the plot lines by then!  Yes, Martin is repetitive ... but he also makes you want to know what happens to everyone.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This is an extremely good movie and shows you not use a Facebook-like thing too much, which is good because I do not use it. More importantly this movie is a great example of Japanese anime, with the technology and the family coming together to save the world. It is also a sad movie at some times.
B0052KJ5TK|4.0|I have had the cd for a week, as of today I'm going to give my first impressions and thoughts on each song.  I have the [[ASIN:B0052KJ5TK Time of My Life]] deluxe disc so I will review all 16 songs  First up to the plate, is the title song, \\"Time of my Life\\".  First impression was, what's up with the effects? and eh it's ok,  After listening to it a few times it is a cool effect.  Fast, hard, rockin', song, worthy of album title. 10/10 times of my life    Next we have \\"When we're Young\\". First thoughts, this was a single a while back. best I can remember was, eh, decent teen angst song but not really for me. Now, Its a cool mid paced number with great guitar riffs. 7/10 they can't remembers.    Third in line, we have \\"Round and Round\\".  Nope not a Ratt, remake but \\"that's a cool guitar line\\" was my first thought. Very cool lyrics that try to hit everyone with their meanings but still cool none the less 9/10 rounds    Number 4, Heaven, nope not Warrant and what's with all this lying to himself?  Now, OMG this number rocks especially for a slower number. It's probably my second favorite song on the cd. I didn't have to die to go to heaven I just had to listen to this song.  10/10 heavens    Fifth, \\"Race for the Sun\\".  Really, another song about the sun?  \\"At least it's not the cd title\\" was my first thought. Now, it's a very good fast paced, upbeat song especially for walking or running.  It's kind of, gets lost in the sea of mediocre songs for me.  Others may love it, I give it 6/10 suns    The first real ballad, I think, clocks in at number 6, \\"Back to me\\".  First thought was cool lyrics,  Now I can relate to those lyrics and the music fits.  It's a pale comparison break up song to the other ballad on this cd. \\"Tears they forget that's more than I can do\\", is probably a line that hits home for me cause when your breaking up its hard to forget usually about the other person.  8/10 of tears    \\"Every Time You Go\\" is 7th on the list of songs. It was a single as well, don't remember my first thoughts were it's a decent song at first listen.  Now I relate to the lyrics well and the music fits nicely.  It's a mid-tempo rocker that is a great song and a good representation of the cd. 9/10 parts of me    8th is \\"What's left\\", the second ballad of the cd. First thought, another break up, song didn't I just hear this? Now, my hat is off to Brad and the guys.  This is my favorite song of the cd. I usually listen to it 2 or 3 times every time it comes on before I go to the next song.  While some may shoot me for this comparison, its up there with \\"Every Rose has its Thorn\\" in a lot of ways.  It, too, could be a country song 10/10 what's left of me  \\"On the Run\\". \\"Duck and run\\" was my first thought because they sound so similar. It's a good number mid/fast paced song that is a good walking/running song or just a song to pump you up. 8/10 run downs    10th, \\"She is love\\", At first listen cool analogy, but long in the tooth.  Now it's a good song but the last 30 seconds should have been cut. most of the time I do that myself with fast forward.  Not a bad song but just to repetitive 6/10 love for this song    Yet another fast number is \\"My Way\\".  Lyrics of another relationship going bad.  It kind of gets lost in the mix for me unless the lyrics relate to how I'm feeling at the time. 5/10 his ways now    12th, \\"Believer\\",  A rocker but not at first. Now that I have had time to soak it in, is very cool lyrically.  7/10 believers    13 is where the bonus tracks start. \\"When we we're Young\\" acoustic, to me this is an unneeded version.  It doesn't add anything to the cd. 6/10 we don't want to remember when's    \\"Every Time You Go\\" acoustic, comes in at 14. An acoustic version and really befitting of the song. A nice addition for the `Fans'.   Acoustic version adds to the flavor of the song.   9/10 acoustic guitars.    The only original song of bonus songs is \\"The Silence Remains\\" clocks in at 15.  Honestly,  I wanted to get back to the other songs.  After further listens, it's a really good guitar line and lyrics go well.  9/10 Silences remain    The final number is a demo of a song from the last cd.  First thought wow this is heavy, but unpolished. I liked the original yet even unpolished this is just another welcomed version of it. 8/10 trains    All in all I give it a 8/10 ratings despite a few down songs which almost every cd has.    Some thought they sold out after the first cd. I think they changed because they matured as musicians.  I think they learned how to please a wider variety of people while still enjoying creative process. As always with change not everyone agrees with it and it alienates some fans. If they don't change enough people still complain. You can't please everyone, and they are doing what they love.
0425241505|5.0|I could not put this book down for the life of me! Each and every character jumped out of the book at me. Thea did an amazing job and I look forward to the next books in the series as well as any of her future writings.
B005EPFA8I|5.0|These caves were discovered in 1994 and only a handful of people have ever been allowed inside to see the awe inspiring paintings. Thankfully the French government allowed Werner Herzog to film them and the result is a film like no other.  Herzog's unique approach to film making combined with this fascinating subject result in a spectacular film that is not to be missed.
0553577123|5.0|Make sure you order the 1995 [[ASIN:0553577123 The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition]], which contains all of the censored and deleted material not in the previous editions. This includes important information about interrelationships and interactions with others in the annex, and also, most intriguingly, Anne's burgeoning sexual curiosity and awakening. These were all, perhaps understandably, removed by Anne's father from the original publication, and this is the first edition to restore them. They add immeasurably to the book, and it wouldn't be half as good without them, in my opinion.<br /><br />Anyway, let me review the actual writing and author and say that this book is exciting, appealing, absorbing, and very adult. Anne is precocious and timeless, and her writing is alive and breathing. Her world, environment, surroundings, cicumstances, and inner life spring to life in a way impossible to foresee for someone who thinks of the book as merely being a young girl's diary. I think this is the biggest surprise about the book for someone (like me) who reads the book as an adult and who had never read it in school (in fact, I mistakenly believed the book to only be relevant to schoolchildren).<br /><br />It's also important to realize that even if you've seen a movie of the story, movies cannot possibly even begin to recreate the actual book itself, which needs to be enjoyed and savored on its own. In fact, it's quite different from every movie about Anne or the Franks that I've ever seen. The book is an absolute treasure, a literary accomplishment that rivals the best.<br /><br />Another erroneous idea is that the book is going to be depressing or sad or a downer. Nothing could be further from the truth. Anne's marvelous joy and sparkle kindle a responding joy and curiosity in the reader, so that the writing and material are never depressing, but moreover uplifting and fascinating. We are treated to a story which has so many layers and threads -- from the odd circumstances, to the war itself, to the various and changing details of outside assistance, to the interplay of the characters, to Anne's own super-rich inner life (which is arguably the star of the work), that the reader never lacks for comfort and inspiration and joy in this brilliant work.the odd circumstances, to the war itself, to the various and changing details of outside assistance, to the interplay of the characters, to Anne's own super-rich inner life (which is arguably the star of the work), that the reader never lacks for comfort and inspiration and joy in this brilliant work.

0756405890|3.0|So, since this book has over 1000+ reviews already, I'm just going to take the opportunity to blather on pointlessly about my feelings about the book without worrying too much whether this will actually be useful to anyone who actually wants to read it, hence the title \\"blah blah blah, trilogy blah.\\"<br /><br />The reason I chose to read this book in the first place is I REALLY REALLY WANTED TO GO BACK TO HOGWARTS! I loved Harry Potter and A LOT of reviewers were calling this a \\"Harry Potter ripoff\\" because the main character, a teenage boy goes to magic school and I was like \\"Oh, great a teenage boy going to magic school! This is exactly what I want!!!\\"<br /><br />BUT COME ON GUYS, just because a magic school and a teenager is involved doesn't make a book a Harry Potter ripoff (which is what I WANTED to read) instead I get a book that IS NOTHING LIKE HARRY POTTER AT ALL WHATSOEVER. So yeah, I'm annoyed at those reviewers. I know it's ironic that a reader complains that a book ISN'T a Harry Potter ripoff but here you go, (it's true that if you look hard enough on the internet you can find anything, even a review like this!)<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that there is this innkeeper named Kote/Kvothe in some random little town in some medieval just-like-earth-but-not-earth place where magic is commonplace. He's just hanging around living his life when his little assistant Bast hires this Chronicler character to come interview Kote about his life story. As it turns out Kote is actually this legendary magician hero named Kvothe but he is in hiding and Bast hopes that telling the Chronicler his story will make Kote feel good about himself again.<br /><br />Alright, good so far... What I find HILARIOUS though is that when the Chronicler approaches Kote, Kote suddenly becomes this RAGING DIVA QUEEN making all sorts of demands. 'You must write every thing I say down word for word, you must stay for three days, you must this, you must that!' GURL PLEASE!! CALM YOURSELF DOWN, YOU ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT! What's even more wacky is how this Bast character just seems like he has a huge gay crush on Kote and I am 100% sure the author did not intend for it to come off that way but it just does, especially whenever Bast calls him 'Reshi.'<br /><br />The other thing I'm a bit dubious about as far as author intent is concerned is Kvothe's story. I can't decide whether it is the product of a skilled author who is able to accurately portray an annoying teenager who thinks he's waaaay smarter and cooler than he actually is (if so, B+) or if it's the product of a novice who actually believes that the teenage character Kvothe REALLY IS that awesome and cool (if so C-.)<br /><br />All in all it's not horrible. had the author tightened it up and trimmed about 100 pages (at least) it probably would have gotten 4 stars from me. the main problems is that both Kvothe and the author seem to think that we need to know EVERY STUPID THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO KVOTHE EVERRRRR! We do not!!! It seems like a really cheap way to force a story worth ONE GOOD BOOK into one mediocre trilogy.T IMPORTANT!

0553801473|1.0|It is no wonder it took Martin so long to finish this book. He seems to have lost track of his vision. It sprawls outward and not forward, and not in a great-secondary-plot-threads kind of way. Westeros is almost an afterthought while we hang around in other parts of the world doing virtually nothing. To the man who wrote the first three books in this series, this should be an embarrassment, but I don't think it is. I think here he is reveling in his admittedly elegant prose, and apparently there was no editor saying, \\"Uh, George, this book isn't very good.\\" Maybe there was, actually, and the editor finally gave up realizing that this is the best he or she was going to get. This book is not important. It is at best a stopgap, at worst an absolute failure. And when at the end yet another of the few characters left with any honor inexplicably goes down under a hail of steel, I threw the book in the trash. Never again will I be so ignorant as to think that just because an artist has done great things before that he will continue to do so. I have been guilty of it many times, but this book taught me the lesson sure. It's my fault for buying it sight unseen, but his fault for writing it. I have no idea what HBO will do when they run out of books and he hasn't finished the next one yet. The series is now going to be seven books. Can we shoot for $nine? Please no. Neither he nor I are likely to live that long. \\"The tale grows in the telling?\\" In this book, the tale is slain by the teller with soporific writing. I don't care how the whole thing turns out if I have to go wading like that again. I hate to say it, but the dream may be over, folks.<br /><br />Martin gave us three great books in a row. That's all we can ask really. It's an amazing accomplishment. Very few writers have done it. It's the nature of great art. It has proven almost impossible to sustain.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly. It's crazy, confusing, and has lots of special effects. Was the acting perfect? No, probably not. Was it still entertaining in spite of that? Absolutely, and plenty of movies are. I've stopped listening to critics, they've poisoned potential for good movies for too long. (Not that they aren't right sometimes). This movie is just good fun, don't worry about being politically correct or what the critics say, just enjoy the madness of this movie like I did =).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Using this to type this review. Works great! I used to constantly curse at my stock android keyboard, but I don&apos;t anymore. Prediction is way better and if you have a stock one you know what I mean when I say I would constantly have these moments where I&apos;d say, &quot;where on earth did that word come from?? &quot;. That happens rarely if at all. I agree with another reviewer, wish it would automatically cap the first letter after a period. But that&apos;s all I can say bad about it. It was an app of the day... I lucked out!

B000HEWEE4|4.0|I am usually a fan of Sandra Bullock, despite some real duds. I have watched this film many times because the musical score is superb and the wistful longing of the two lovers are well conveyed.    The plot of the film has two people communicating through a mailbox that allows letters to bridge a gap of two years in time. A romance springs up between two people that can only connect throuh their correspondence. Okay, I accept the premise and will play along to enjoy the film.    Still, I keep running into nagging areas that drag the viewer back from suspension of disbelief.  How is it that Alex Wyler (Reeves) is too dense to wait for a safe opportunity to cross the street to finally meet his love in Daley Plaza? Instead, he is fatally struck by a city bus and his intended is unable to save him from his injuries. Further, Kate Forster (Bullock) fails to remember the face and name of the man she tries so hard to save.    Kate mentions in her first letter that the mysterious box in the attic was there when she moved into the lake house. Well, this box contains all of Kate's letters to Alex. The magic mailbox has sent them 2 years into the past. How is it that Kate never opens the box and reads her letters to her love? That would be the logical result of this plot detail.    Then there is the matter of the attic. There are a lot of exterior shots of the lake house, and there is no extra room for an attic under the glass ceiling of the house.    Alex mentions to brother Henry that the lake house has no access to the lake. Several exterior shots clearly show a landing platform and ladder down from the main level of the house. The lake house DOES have access to the lake.    Alex and Kate meet at Kate's birthday party. Alex has mentioned to Brother Henry that he has purchased the lake house, not renting it. Alex mentions to Kate that she will rent his lake house when he moves out. Well, Kate would probably know who she was sending her monthly checks to, even if she somehowdidn't meet Alex when she rented the house.    The worst flaw is the Jane Austin book \\"Persuasion\\" that Alex has retrieved for Kate. Instead of returning it through the magic mailbox, he enters the construction site of Kate's future apartment building and secretes the book under a loose floorboard. He has to know which apartment she will move into so that she will eventually notice the loose floorboard and find the book. Of course, none of this is actually in the film. I made up a little scenario that would allow the book to be under the floor when the plot requires Kate to find it.  Really, that grotesque plot device almost ruined the whole effort!    Reeves and Bullock do an excellent job with a script that really needed a rewrite to fill all the continuity gaps.

Her voice on the CD is so calming and her words so wonderful to listen to.  I highly recommend this book to those who want to feel more empowered about their life
B000EPR7NE|5.0|What great music, to me this is really masterful. Not every song, but several of the songs on this CD, well lets just say I turn the volume way up for many of them. I really enjoy the music on this CD.
B001AQO446|4.0|The video is very good, but doesn't rate 5 stars. It is definitely an upgrade over the DVD though.  Audio is quite good as well.     I bought two copies at a retail electronics store (blue shirt) on sale. The first copy had MAJOR pixelation and freezing issue around the 1+ hour mark (Howard Johnson's parking lot phone booth scene).  On the first copy, it froze, and I couldn't move past it. I had to turn the player off, back on, and go to chapter selection to move forward.  Returned it and the 2nd copy didn't freeze, but it had pixelation at the exact same point in the movie.  So just beware.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I have an older Hero\/Eris and many games run a bit slow. This game runs quick and smooth despite the killer graphics. I do find myself straining my eyes but on any modern Druid you will love the graphics I am sure.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This was a very well done biography.  It showed how people with diabilities can be sucessful and even excell in society.  It showed the struggles she went through, how she handled other people's prejudices, and how she over came many obsticles.  Very inspirational.  There was a scene that was very graphic, however.  Not appropriate for children.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|This a simple movie - all flash and no substance - just like the cartoon. If you're one of those pre-teens who embraced the animated version in the 80s, you'll probably enjoy this thing, because it shovels out the same formula: beefcakes, big guns, explosions, dumb dialogue, cheesy jingoism, massive property damage, and militarism without consequence. If that's not your thing, run away. Hollywood is cashing in on an old, ugly pop icon.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|This album is AMAZING from top to bottom!! If you are going through a break-up especially, you NEED this album... But it's beautiful no matter what.
B004J4WLPU|1.0|I read a number of great reviews on this book. I wanted to love it. Started out strong. Then it went nowhere for a long time. The ending was terrible. I would have to say don't waste your time. One of the most disappointing books I have read as of late.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|I&apos;m having trouble installing this app on my 3g touch slide Froyo 2.2.1, so I emailed amazon about it. It&apos;s annoying to read one star reviews when the person probably never bothered to contact the dev\/customer support.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler offers an amazing value for it's price!  I have my i5-2500k at 4.4GHZ and my max load temps don't exceed 65c.  Very glad I purchased this product.    It is very tall, however, so make sure it will fit inside your case before you purchase.  It just barely fits in my NZXT M59.
B003XTKMBC|5.0|First like to thank Amazon for fast and great shipping. Kotobukiya out did itself with this one. Took me no time to put this statue together. Every piece fits perfect. The detail is just incredible. If I had one complaint about this statue, it would be the light saber part. It is little bit loose and when putting it together you can break it.  Other than that, this is an awesome piece to have for your star wars collection.
B003Y5H59W|5.0|i was so excited to see this movie, i wished i would of seen the midnight showing. this movie was everything i expected it to be. the origin was excatly like the comic, the actors were awesome. hugo weaving did an excellent red skull and chris evans was fantastic as captain america. this movie was awesome. and the battle between red skull and captain america was outstanding. the only problem i have with this movie is that i wished they wouldof stuck with the original costume but other than that this is my number one superhero movie of the year. marvel you guys did great on coming out with good superhero movies for this year. i do hope that marvel will put out the original captain america movie on dvd soon. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004UID2LC|2.0|There are too many steps required if you want to filter a search or perform a specific search. Also, most the time I try to download it just says searching and never gets past that. Tubemate is better, though not perfect either.
B005AUWY2W|5.0|cars 2 is awesome, this movie is more about your favorite character matter. i don't know why everybody is giving this movie crap. this movie is awesome. disney does not disapoint. there is no such thing as a bad disney movie. this movie rules.<br />if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0553801473|1.0|Better than A Feast for Crows, but not by much. The plot is bogged down by numerous POVs, but the format idea is not necessarily the problem because the 1st (AGOT) and the 3rd (ASOS) books maintained a brisk pace with multiple POVs.<br /><br />If AFFC was half a book and ADWD was meant to complete it, I still don't see evidence of a story among the 2000 pages of these two books. Other reviewers have already covered the problems regarding descriptions, repetitions, sluggishness and liberal use of cliffhangers. But what amazes me is that a week after reading the book, I can't recall any truly remarkable scenes from the book apart from one or two sets of dialogues.<br /><br />The drop in quality in the 4th and 5th books is quite alarming and does not bode well for the next volumes. And it doesn't seem likely that this series will end in 7 books. With the pace set by AFFC and ADWD, I doubt it will end in 10 books.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|this is a great album, lady gaga does it again. she has really came up into the world. her music is entertaing and has good beats. the best songs on this cd are<br /><br />track list<br /><br />2. born this way<br />3. government hooker<br />5. americano<br />7. scheibe<br />8. bloody mary<br />12. eletric chaple<br /><br />if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do

B004EPYZOO|5.0|this is an awesome movie it is action packed from begining to end, nicholas cage, amber heard, bill burke and william fischner are great in this movie. the action, special effects and the story is awesome. this is a movie for action and nicholas cage fans. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0547366205|5.0|My 17 month old son loves this book and has been asking for it on a daily basis for a month. (He calls the book \\"Baby\\" and loves to pat the babies in the story.) Happily it is not a book that I tire of reading to him. This is a book with a strong rhythm,reptition and rhyming, which is why my son loves this book so much, but is not interested in many of the other books that we own. In addition to the wonderful text, the pictures by Helen Oxenbury are both beautiful and interesting to look at. We have the board book version which is good for my son as he likes to help turn the pages and also pat the babies.
6305907145|1.0|What a horrific thing to do to Austen's novel!  I don't know how she sleeps at night without worrying that the spirit of Jane Austen (or a Jane Austen literary club) will steal into her room and demand that she account for what she has done.  If you want to make a movie about the horrors of slavery, do so.  That movie is not \\"Mansfield Park.\\"  If you want to make a movie about a spirited tomboy standing up for her own rights and then inexplicably marrying her cousin, do so.  That movie is not \\"Mansfield Park.\\"  Some points, I suppose, should be awarded for the playing of Henry and Mary Crawford and Mrs. Norris and Mr. Rushworth, who are largely unchanged, and Maria is well done and unchanged in essentials.  I don't know where the rest of the characters came from, and can only assume they issue directly from the imagination of the screenwriter for they are certainly not found in Austen's book. I'm still waiting for the makers of this film to come forth with a public apology to Ms. Austen and all her loyal fans for this awful distortion of her wonderful novel.  I don't expect it, but I can wish for it, can't I?
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I just saw this in the movies and i would start off by saying that this film is well worth watching it starts off with jake lonerman a man who knows nothing about his past. the film quickly picks up after the first 15-20 minutes of the films start and does not stop. If i were to compare this film with any universal film it would be the mummy part 2 and 3 the way the action was in those films were very much like the way they filmed this movie. the end were the cowboys and the indians come together (yes there is a battle scene were the aliens and the humans fight. a big but well done battle scene) was like id4 in my mind were people came together and fought the aliens. I really really encourage people to watch this movie it is worth checking out! I think it is really sad when people have to bash a film just because it mixes two different ideas. People just give it a chance it is a great idea and a great movie but like i said before this movie is done in somewhat the same manner that the mummy 2 and 3 where done. not a great story but not a bad one story. lots of action but not to much action. trust me it is a great film.
B0019OP0GU|3.0|Okay, so I might be biased, as this was one of my favorite books as a child, but I have to say that the changes they made in the transition between pages and screen are disappointing to say the least.  The girls are all much too old for about half the movie, but that was the least of my concerns.  Poor Winifred is turned into some child monster, which she never was in the book.  She was a sympathetic character with bum luck who would never have screamed and thrown a fit in the stairwell of a theatre.  More surprising was the way they made Posy into such a brat.  She was never, in the book, so vicious.  Sure, she was a dancing mimic and a bit of a clown, but she was never obnoxious and mean.  This is all minor, in my opinion, compared with what they did to poor Theo.  I guess the feeling was that this movie was not interesting to adults (although I'm sure my mother, another rabid Streatfeild fan, would disagree), so they killed off Mr. Simpson's wife, gave him a dead son, and set Theo and Garnie to fighting over him.  This is tragic.  What kind of an example is Theo to young girls, drinking in her basement room, and bemoaning her lost days as a Bouncing Babe?  Why was this necessary?  All in all, it was an okay movie but a horrid adaptation of a beloved children's story.  Sad.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|This tower defense game is very good and easy to play. Great graphics on Droid X, no slow downs and easy controls.
B00004VXF2|1.0|Lou Reed has admitted that he wanted out of a contract, owed another record under his contract, and, in a fit of defiance, plugged in the guitar and let the feedback go for a double album's worth. There is no artistry here, there was no intention to create anything, anything of interest that you here is purely coincidental and there is no logical reason to partonize this product.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read Pillars of the Earth and immediately started World Without End (although you would not be lost if you read WWE first). Excellent historical fiction without stressing the historical part. The characters are believable and the plot is gripping through all 1000 plus pages.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love all of Karen's novels and I must say this novel made the top of the list!!! In her books, i completely loose myself in them and I cannot surface until I am finished.The images she projects are just wonderful! I love how at the end, she gave it some finalization but also promised more from her. I cant wait until the next!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Ok before you go bashing me, I do like comics. I do know quite a bit about them(although I'm no expert). I know that this movie was not overly faithful to the original story or even completely aligned with the movie trilogy. I do not care. This was one hell of a good movie. The story and acting proves that that's really all you need to make a good movie. After watching the last super-movie of the year(Cap), which was okay...I had to give this underhyped gem a fiver, cuz it deserves it! A first day buy for me.
B004SVM7BW|2.0|The main reason why I got this app is to read work documents. These documents, like many technical PDFs, are formatted in 2 columns. Unfortunately, this app cannot convert the columns correctly into the 'page flip' view. Instead, the document becomes a mess of sentences out of order because the columns get merged.
1439102813|3.0|While this novel is easy to read and an informative treatment of the various stages of Alzheimer's disease, I felt that it was rather superficial. Genova evidently has the appropriate credentials to write a book on this topic, and I found it interesting and sincere, but I wished she would have dug deeper into the ethical quandaries associated with this disease, such as euthanasia/suicide, genetic testing, and embryonic screening. Genova did not ignore these issues, but her treatments were cursory at best, which perhaps is worse than not mentioning them at all, as it made the book seem rather glib.<br /><br />I also wished that she had gone more into depth regarding the financial setbacks associated with an early onset diagnosis. Presumably the couple in Genova's novel were well off and tenured, but even so, you would think that they would at some point be grappling with the inevitable loss of income and the costs of home care along with the blow to Alice's prestigious career, as well as the sacrifices her husband was forced to make in pursuit of his own ambitions. Again, Genova did touch on these briefly, but the references seemed shallow and rushed.<br /><br />While Genova's characters are likable and sympathetic, I also found them limited in scope and personality.<br /><br />Altogether, I think Genova is a fluent writer and could have productively written a nonfiction book on this disease that would have been just as interesting to read as this novel. Framing her book as a fictional narrative seemed only to highlight her limitations rather than strengths as a writer. I think if she had  devoted more substance to this novel, it would have been a more provocative treatment of this important subject.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game for LG Ally. Runs really smooth. I also like how you can skip the levels, and the requirements. Also more addictive than Angry Birds! Needs more levels and needs to be more challenging.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  I wanted to see it so badly, I went to see it alone when it came out.  The soundtracks(yes, there are 2) are great also.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The game idea is actually really good.   Unfortunately, the games just aren&apos;t fun,  and the controls are even worse.   \n\nFor all I know,  there could be some fantastic mini games in here somewhere.   The game,  however,  makes you play to unlock anything beyond the first ten.
0470901071|5.0|I spent months going over brain dumps and other study guides and the end result was FAIL.  I couldn't pass...After several attempts with no luck I happen to come across this book, the CCNA Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, (640-802), by TODD LAMMLE.  This book IS A MUST TO PASS THE CCNA!!!  After reading through the book, completing the labs and extras, I rescheduled my exam and scored a nearly perfect score!!!  Forget the brain dumps folks, get this guide and I PROMISE you, you'll pass!!!  VERY well written and EASY to read.  If you want your CCNA and want to go into your 640-802 exam with poise and confidence and leave CCNA CERTIFIED...GRAB A COPY!  Absolutely AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0051MKNV8|4.0|It'd be cool to have a pill like that, which makes you super smart in every way there is and have such a clear view of the world.. but it does have it's side-effect like every drug out there. Brad Cooper plays a down-on-his-luck book writer who through chance meets his ex-wife's brother who gives him a pill that makes him more so.. and poof, all this great stuff happens... and then the bad stuff happens and he has to find a way to stay on the pills and not die and fix everything and everybody around him. It was a fun film with good visuals.. like the sex scene and everything that he sees.. pure limitless enjoyment..
B0006HXXBA|1.0|I took a big chance buying this album. It was rated so well that I felt there was no way it could be bad. Kreator have a very long history behind them and many fans too. They have however never been able to get away from being Slayer clones. Or Testament or Exodus clones either. This is my third time over Kreator's history of trying to find an album that was truly ORIGINAL and GOOD. Song after song on this album can be directly linked to so many Slayer songs it is sickening. Pick a band, any good, long lifed thrash band and Kreator seem to be the biggest fans of them all. So much so that it comes out in the songs that they write. The songs that are not blatant rip offs are so lifeless and lackluster that they sound like filler material. I am very aware that there a ton of Kreator fans that find what I am saying complete blasphemy. I really don't care. When I start singing a Slayer song while listening to someone else's material because it is such a rip off, I can't let it slide. After all, I have had this experience 2 times before over the past 20 years. And that is why Kreator will never get out from Slayer's shadow. I am suprised Andy Sneap, as a producer with massive skills and stout, would have gone along with this album. I guess money talks. The last thing I will say is one of the main things about Metal is to piss people off. In this instance I am proud to do it. This album sucks, plain and simple.
0307279189|5.0|I picked up this book at the recommend of my yoga instructor.  Everyone I had ever talked to about running I would say it hurts the first two miles and then you can just keep going.  After just a few pages in I was googling everything I could find and decided to change up my striking point on my foot, no pain.  I was running and smiling.  What this book really did for me though was allowed me to reflect and realize that not every champion started that way, they did what they loved and eventually was great at it.  It helped me stand back in a matter of speaking and take my time and just enjoy the run.  Its actually really hard for me to articulate what I gained from reading this book, but what I do know is I am a better person (not just runner) for reading it.

B001AW156U|1.0|These things are unnecessary.  I was looking for a way to improve my game since I'm not the biggest fan of the Dualshock, but this isn't it.  They pop right off when you need them the most.
B00466HM28|5.0|I'm not an expert keyboardist, but I wanted to have something to get ideas into my computer.  I was thinking of going with Korg NanoKey, but I heard that version 1 of that was pretty awful.  The keyboard on this is pretty decent.  It's not weighted or anything, but the keys are velocity sensitive.  If you don't hit them very hard, they barely register at all.  Which can be annoying.  But you get used to it.  It also turns out that you can hold a note or two and shift the octave while those notes are sustaining.  You have to play around those held notes, but how cool is that?    The built-in arpeggiator is way fun.  Lots of different modes and such.  And it turns out that if you touch a key lightly, it will still register it as a note, but it will be nearly silent (remember the poor sensitivity?), so you can create a \\"hole\\" in your arpeggio that way.  Especially combined with the \\"order\\" mode for the arpeggiator, this can create some really fun grooves.  Maybe even some cool drum rhythms... need to try that soon.      Things are easily configurable using the software -- but the cool thing is that the software loads everything into hardware, and all the settings are kept there.   So you can load it up with some presets, then connect it to a computer without the software, and everything will play nice.  You can edit the arpeggiator settings by holding down the arp on/off button and pushing the labeled keys on the keyboard.  Can also change between 4 sets of programmed settings inside the keyboard.    The midi control knobs work pretty well, and the pads are capable of sending midi control signals, as well.  The drum pads are stiff.  Stiff enough that if someone came up with a physical modification to make them more sensitive, I probably would do it.  But if you get used to hitting with two or three fingers instead of one, it's not too bad.  And you can still pound out some good stuff.    Overall, I think this is some of the best money I've spent in a long time on musicequipment.  There's more versatility and utility per pound than most other things I own ... plus you can throw it in a laptop bag without any problem.  And yes, there are some gripes about the pad and keyboard velocity stuff, but you get so much for your money that you really can't complain.  As portable and fun and versatile as this is, it's great.      So, that being said...  Akai, please spend a few hours and $0.25 per unit reworking the pads for version 2.0 and give us the option to remap the key velocities, so that they're a little more sensitive -- and this little box will be unstoppable!  ... Actually, I just did a little research, and if you're the adventurous type, go to YouTube, and search for \\"modifying mpd32\\".  The same technique would probably fix the MPK Mini.  I haven't tried this yet, but I'm guessing it's worth a shot -- and worth invalidating the warranty.  I'd probably use gaffer's tape for the mod, because electrical and duct tape get goopy after a while.  I also just found a site called MPCstuff (dot) com, and they have these things called MPC Pad Corx, which stick on the underside of the rubber pads, where the tape would go.  They're different thicknesses for different Korg models, but a quick e-mail to their support folks would probably get you the right set.  I guess I've got a new project...
B003YL4LYI|3.0|My title speaks to one of the major flaws in, I think, the last two books in this series. Either there were no editors or that they simply didn't care is painfully obvious in both the plot progression and the overall amount of grammar and spelling errors. Also, am I the first one to say that I am beyond bored of hearing anything related to &#34;mummers&#34; or how Jon Snow knows nothing?<br /><br />Other reviewers have stated that Martin is &#34;the American Tolkien&#34; or deserves &#34;a universe full of stars&#34; for his fantasy writing. My response is, &#34;Eh&#34;. Get on with it. I was impressed by the author's attention to medieval detail in the first book, but in some cases whole sections are completely dedicated to food menues and clothing, but then the actual plot goes in circles. Martin better produce the final addition soon or I will not care enough to spend the money to find out what happens.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|These blocks are awesome. They're heavy duty wood, perfectly cut, and a perfect mix of shapes and sizes of blocks. I was a little worried that some of the pieces were going to be the people and trees pictured on the box, but it was just the great building blocks.  I got it for my 2 year old's birthday. He likes to knock over what I build. My 4 year old has enjoyed building with them.  Highly recommend these.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|This accessory was on my wish list for my iPad 2 right from the start. Yes it is over priced considering its just an adapter and you still have buy or use it the an additional hdmi cable. But it does offer so much functionality to your iPad 2. It allows you to mirro everything that you do on your iPad 2 to your hdtv. I mainly bought for gaming. This way I can use it almost like an xbox or other gaming console. The mirroring is not 1080p. I'm pretty sure the mirroring is caped at 720p and doesn't fill the whole screen. I usually have to stretch the picture on my tv's settings for it fit most of the picture on the screen. Games, video, photos, safari browser, you tube and many other apps look great on a much bigger screen. Mind you at the price of this adapter many say its better to just add a little more money and get an apple tv and then you can just use air play wirelessly with it. Which is a good argument. The apple tv does cost more though its $100 and the adapter is $40 so its more than double the price. Also with the apple tv you cant do the gaming or mirroring right now. iOS 5 is going to support air play mirroring to apple tv so that will be possible, but its going to be a while until it comes out officially and not all the apps will support it right away. I also dont know if this means you will be to mirror games to the apple tv through air play when iOS 5 comes out. Again if it possible the games will have to be update first. Overall I am happy with the adapter I got an extra long 12 foot hdmi cable for cheap to go with it for gaming and other apps. If you use the adapter it will also use less battery than just streaming to an apple tv via air play and you can also charge the iPad 2 with the adapter since there is another connection but you will have to use your own charger. I do wish the adapter was a little longer and was able to bend more easily there have been times when the adapter has gotten loose because of the weight and how short it is. The most this adapter should sell for is $25. But that's how apple is they over charge you for everything something that should have been included in iPad 2 on its own without the need for an adapter.
0553801473|2.0|same as what everybody else said.  this story would have made a great 5-book series, but at this point he's just stringing us along for no good reason.  there's an art to writing an epic series like this, and part of that is making each book feel both self-contained and part of a whole at the same time.  this one feels more like a place-holder.  it's a shame that there are so many plot lines here, and that, rather than move any particular character one foot forward, he instead moves a dozen different characters forward an inch.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I read this book because a friend recommended it. The story line was predictable, and as a history teacher I found the author made cheap use of history to create her society and compose her story. I am not impressed and will not be recommending this book to anyone I know. People that did like this book are obviously not familar with real history which is much better than this story.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Revealing the identity of a CIA agent is a federal crime.<br /><br />* Scooter Libby - indicted, convicted, and pardoned by then President Bush<br />* Dick Cheney - never indicted<br />* Karl Rove - never indicted<br /><br />Meanwhile Valerie Plame - lost her CIA career through no fault of her own.<br /><br />If that situation still tends to make you angry as it does me, you will greatly enjoy this film. The directing is tight, the action moves right along, and the pace is just about perfect.<br /><br />I think it is a movie that anybody who likes a good thriller would enjoy.<br /><br />By the way... the ending sucks, as you are aware.<br /><br />NOTE: the principals do a voice over that's pretty instructive into what they went through during the period of time the movie takes place. Save this for after you've watched it the first time.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|can&apos;t use at all. download immediately, later, or on demand - all results in crashes. saw the intro video and that&apos;s it. doesn&apos;t seem worth the recipes without any video. never saw a recipe - that must come after the video I can&apos;t load. very disappointed.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2009 'BLU RAY' REISSUE ***<br /><br />Like many people who have probably seen Richard Curtis' \\"Love Actually\\" one-to-many times, the idea of buying it yet again on another fangled format is enough to make you yawn and turn away.<br />But have you actually seen it on BLU RAY? Because if you haven't, you need to...<br /><br />Having reviewed so many 'oldies' transferred to Blu Ray and been elevated fifty-per-cent of the time/disappointed the other half - it's a real delight to report that here is a genuine upgrade from every previous version. Suddenly, the film feels all grown up - the print is incredibly clear - and it adds so much to your enjoyment of the movie. There isn't a part of this rather lovely little gem that 'doesn't' seem improved to me.<br /><br />The extras are the same as the 2003 DVD - Deleted Scenes and Music Of (with introductions from Richard Curtis), Kelly Clarkson and Billy Mack Videos (Billy Mack is Bill Nighy's character), a Feature Length Commentary with Director and Writer Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster (Neeson's son in the movie). The picture quality for these clips is old actually and hardly high-def, but they are informative and hugely entertaining (especially when the galaxy of stars are talking - Liam Neeson and Laura Linney so enjoying themselves).<br /><br />Apart from being wonderful to look at, you also forget what a great film it is - a huge upbeat pick-me-up of a thing - and hopeful in a way that seems to elude Hollywood stories so much these days. And it's so funny too - Martin Freeman and Joanna Page lying naked on top of each other as the rehearse making out for a skin flick (\\"Judy this is a real pleasure. It's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to...\\"), Bill Nighy on the Ant & Dec show \\"...kids, here's an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I haven't even finished the book, but I love it!  It's so hard to put down.  I love the tension between Abby and Travis in the first half.  It reminds me of Come Together by Emlyn Rees.  Reading this book is such a guilty pleasure - as a 36 year old mother of a 4-year old!
0553801473|3.0|I was looking forward so much to this. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed. Even the author, in his afterword, mentioned it was a triple bitch to complete. It sounds very much like he has other projects he's more interested in doing, and isn't dwelling too much on these past ones, maybe even just doing it to keep everybody happy. Unfortunately, too many things left undone from the fourth book, and not much was resolved in this one. And there's WAY too many fans who want to see what happens next. On the plus side, we got to know Tyrion and Danys much better, and a few pieces were put into place and set up for the next book. If there is one...
0811875040|3.0|I really love how the book looks but the recipes really need to be double checked. I know an errata has been released for some recipes. I have baked a lot from this book because I love Miette shop in San Francisco. I am really happy for the buttercream correction. I thought if I pointed out some recipes I've already tried and had trouble with it might help with recipe checking.  The yield of the Graham crackers - I could barely get 15 out of it but the recipe says 24 (3.5 inch cookies)  The hot milk cake - did not really fill out 2 6-inch pans.  The lady finger recipe - yielded 3x more than stated.  The strawberry mousse - method was not clear. Also might require more cream?  Chocolate Ganache - I had trouble with the pourability and the yield.    I have also tried the pecan tart, chocolate chiffon, double chocolate cake,  pate sucree, chocolate mousse, pastry cream. The chocolate mousse and pastry cream I love very much.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I was so excited to see this app. As a Jamie Oliver fan from his Naked Chef days, it&apos;s great to have his recipes at my fingertips, especially this user friendly! \n\nThat being said, I had similar issues with the download and the additional 80mb media files - force close, not able to load the app. I reported the issue. I uninstalled, reinstalled, and patiently did not do anything else on my Droid X while waiting for the app to open. I chose &quot;later&quot; when prompted to download the media files and then selected to download through the app menu.  I then patiently waited again during the file download, and got slightly frustrated when I got yet another force close message but went back in and followed my previous steps and restarted the download. \n\nVoila! App works! And it&apos;s actually a fun app to use. I also got the iCookbook app and the search and recipe formats are similar, HOWEVER the big bonuses are the ability to quickly create and Swype through a shopping list, and the how-to videos. If you want to hone your knife skills and spice up your sauces, Jamie gives you quick and easy visuals to guide you through. As a busy working mom, I definitely appreciate quick &amp; easy, and I&apos;m always looking for ways to break the basic &quot;meat, veg, starch&quot; trio on our plates. This is a great cookbook app.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I had  the three latest CDs by interpol.   I had no idea this one was so good when I just picked up the cd.  As a whole this one might be better than Antics and Our Love to Admire.    Get it, and enjoy!
B004LWZW42|5.0|I actually love this movie the whole scenario, the intensity of the movie was great. The actors were superb they did an amazing job (My favorite is Magneto) The movie has alot of drama which is cool and does not make you want to sleep. Personally I did not like the Last stand and wolverine wasnt that great. This movie has alot of characters and this is what x-men is all about. Also hats of to the magnificent soundtrack, is so passionate and just gives that special touch to an incredible movie, credits to Henry Jackman.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I have a old droid and this app works great.. it did try to force close when asking about videos but than I took others advice and just did them later and i had no more problems love the app love the videos and can&apos;t wait to try some recipes! so glad that it was free today!
B004TTZHBK|3.0|Thank you Amazon for having free app of the day. I&apos;d have been really upset if I&apos;d paid $8 for this app. This app only has 60 recipes and I&apos;m confident they take more than 20 minutes to prepare &amp; cook. There are other recipe apps that easily have twice as many recipes and for free! The recipes aren&apos;t what I&apos;d call kid friendly. I haven&apos;t had any technical issues such as it force closing. It does seem to use a lot of memory. The videos are a nice concept &amp; are around each 4 minutes long. The shopping list is a helpful tool. There are just around 1 or 2 recipes I&apos;d make, so I&apos;m probably going to uninstall this app &amp; use the memory for an app I&apos;ll actually use.
0312600844|1.0|Alright, let's see how well I can condense what I feel about this book. Lets recall my reading experience.<br /><br />Page 100, nothing has happened.<br /><br />Page 200, again, nothing has happened.<br /><br />Page 282. I'm halfway through the book. Again, nothing has happened.<br /><br />Page 350, nothing has happened.<br /><br />Page 400.  NOTHING. HAS HAPPENED.<br /><br />Page 420, OK, I GIVE UP, NOTHNG IS GOING TO HAPPEN.<br /><br />Page 422, oh wait, SOMETHING IS HAPPENING! Finally something will happen after 422 pages of pure pain!<br /><br />Oh wait, Page 426, it's been resolved already.<br /><br />I was going to excuse this book on the notion that this was the author's first book, but imagine my shock and awe when I found out Franzen had written 4 books already. Bad writing, boring zero level plot, shallow 1D characters. Avoid.
0553801473|5.0|Three star average review?  For one of the best-selling fantasy books of all time? At the end of the day, it's important to the casual reader of these reviews to realize what's really going on here.<br /><br />This series is extraordinarily important in the fantasy cannon, it breaks new ground, and is well written and very entertaining.  It is also somewhat protracted, and to be fair books 4 & 5 stall a bit.  The fan base is incredibly invested in this series, and many feel betrayed by the slow pace of book releases, leading to a backlash of sorts by a vocal minority (nevertheless this minority all buy the books).  People love these books, they live for these books, and if they're even slightly disappointed in any aspect of a book, they feel betrayed.<br /><br />The comparisons of George RR Martin and Robert Jordan, and his shameless protraction of the Wheel of Time books is grossly unfair, Jordan's books were a rambling mess, Martin's books are detailed, but well designed and coherent.  Could the series have been finished in 3-4 volumes instead of the planned 7 - probably, but the protraction never feels wanton or obvious.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the success of these books in regard to the sales numbers speak for themselves.  This is one of the best \\"Epic Fantasy\\" series of all time, and will be ranked along with Tolkien, Donaldson, and McCaffrey.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I&apos;ve been watching for this application since it came out! The user interface is easy, the recipes easy to understand, and I am looking forward to using this application on a regular basis.
0553801473|4.0|I find I mostly agree with the three and two star reviews.  That said, I'm going with four because despite the extremely bloated story lines I actually still very much enjoyed the book and the writing.  Really, compared to anything else in the genre this is still a five star book.  It has lost its way compared to the first three though, and perhaps even the fourth.<br /><br />The problem, as others have pointed out is that certain story lines and perspectives are beaten to death with endless chapters that never go anywhere.  All of the various Mereen chapters got to be excruciating.  That part became torture really, I would actually set the book (well Kindle really) down and do something else - never happened before with the rest of the series (even AFFC).<br /><br />I'm not done with the series, as I said the quality is still incredibly high compared to other series.  Many of the plot lines were engaging, but as other reviewers pointed out they are drowning in a sea of chapters dedicated to over developed plot arcs that have become boring and frustrating in their excruciatingly slow development.  Yes, it is nice to savor a tasty meal but if you chew too long the flavor is lost.  Mereen is stale gum that should have been spit out long ago.  The North was even getting to that point, but perhaps it can be saved in the next.
B00003CXRM|5.0|What can I say for this movie that hasn't already been said? Not a great deal, I'm sure, but I love this movie so much I'll risk being a \\"me too!\\"  George Clooney showed me, for the first time, that he can actually act. I should admit that I had seen the dreadful \\"Batman and Robin\\" shortly before this film, so I was prepared to hate his performance, but he was splendid in this. All of the supporting cast were spot-on for their roles, as well.   The story ranged from kinda loony (\\"Cows! I hate cows!\\") to downright surreal at times, and never disappointed or reached a point where one is tempted to 'fast forward through this bit...'  This is one of those films that has made it into my permanent collection, i.e., I will get it again in every format du jour to watch on TV, computer, my toaster, whatever.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I was able to download the media content from within the app.  It all runs very smoothly and looks terrific on the Incredible.  I can&apos;t wait to try out some of the recipes.  The tip videos look terrific.
1416583432|1.0|To many tedious explanations of the obvious. The type of writer that thinks using lots of words is a good thing.  She makes outlandish statements, backing them up with nothing.   The whole book is a vague ramble about various things that never gets very deep into what the titles implies the book is about.
0670022411|2.0|I fell for this book because Amazon felt it needed to be shoved in my face everytime I logged on.The book started interesting with books that show themselves to those who are worthy,but it quickly disintegrates into one more, mortal loves vampire and he loves her for eternity, romance crap.Although not as bad as the Twit-light Saga I found myself planning the demise of the main charracter in very creative ways.You see I am cursed with this disease that makes me finish what I start....no matter what.Be it crappy Teen novel with a whinny Vamp or a silly witch who does not want to be a witch!<br />ugh.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|You don&apos;t usually see this caliber of work in apps. Very impressed.   I really like the grocery list function and ability to swipe off items.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|I purchased 2 of these. One for my car to convert the power to work with my iPhone 4, and one for my clock radio that needed an extension to fit over my Otterbox Defender case. It works well in both applications, but it gets extremely hot while in use.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|this is going to go down as a cult classic for sure. i don't understand why the extra scene was cut at all. it makes the movie make more sense. still not a fan of the dvd/bluray combo packs, but thats another complaint for another place. just don't go in expecting a killer story, its an action movie.
0307477479|2.0|I got most of the music references, enjoyed the settings (especially being a lifetime New Yorker and a 90s kid), and most of the characters are intriguing. But I failed to see a big enough connection that ties all the characters together to make a novel.     The book jumps around different times of a characters history, which would normally make for an interesting read, except each jump is a different character, and all the successive jumps have little reference to the previous ones except for trite passing references.     Whatever connections the author is trying to make between everyone else, they are quite weak and boring. I would read all about a great safari trip, at one point, a suspenseful romantic tension pops up, excellent opportunity to take the story further, but it never resolves, because room has to be made for the stories of 10 other characters I'll soon forget about.   Another chapter takes you through almost a coming of age for an adolescent punk band, then it ends abruptly (we found out later that one of them becomes a record executive, divorces, though his affair and the aftermath of his wife's discovery never plays out).      There are really interesting characters and stories that NEVER DEVELOP and that's what annoyed me the most. I wanted to see the journey between A and B, but all I got were short glimpses of A and B for a bunch of people I don't care about (because I never got a chance to get to know them), and that was disappointing.
0553801473|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book.  I read it and liked it okay.  Unfortunately it reminded me of how third rate movie sequels end---nothing completed or wrapped up.  This book ended in a way to give an excuse to write another book.  I would have much rather seen a lot of story lines completed.  The book just drags on and on.  I will buy Martin's next book in the series and hope it is much better than this one.
0307272702|2.0|The book was well written, and a lot of it made sense, but I found myself still skimming much of the material because the author is too technical for the average layperson, he's a scientist.  Something that needs to be stressed about this way of eating; not everyone can tolerate this diet.  Constipation is a very serious side-effect from eating like Taubes recommends- extremely high protien.  I found the weight falling off quickly and I thought, \\"awesome!\\" but I fought chronic constipation and finally had to go back to eating a regular diet or end up in the hospital.  User BEWARE and stock up on enemas and laxitives - you'll need them.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Hopefully this will get fixed. Force close on droid x gingerbread. I hope they send an update son to fix the issue.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After reading four of the books, and they were great while I was reading them, I began to wonder if the reason GRRM has a difficult time writing these last books in the series is because he doesn't have an end plan in mind. I don't really like the fact that after following my heros for four books he decides to kill them off. The many minor characters he creates are interesting, but they won't keep me reading to the end of the series. I want my heros back!!!

B002EWD0I6|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and I to watch.  We love to watch Masterpiece classics and we wanted to see more period films.  We absolutely love the show Lark Rise to Candleford.  I only ordered the first season to see if it would hold our interest.  It will make you laugh, and want to feel for the people of both hamlets.  I hope to order the next season so that we can enjoy it when we are not watching Masterpiece Theater.    If your thinking of purchasing it is well worth the money.  Very entertaining. Hope to write another review about season two later.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|Let me start by saying that I've been a Yes fan ever since I heard \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" on my portable radio one sunny afternoon in my backyard in the summer of 1971. It was love at first listen. Who in the world was playing that guitar? Listen to those harmonies, they almost sounded like The Beach Boys, and that rhythm section...WOW! Fast forward to the spring of 2008. Yes is about to start their 40th anniversary tour with Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman's son Oliver on keyboards. Suddenly the tour is cancelled. Jon Anderson, who has been suffering asthma attacks on and off since the early 2000's is laid low by a near fatal attack and is hospitalized in critical condition. The doctors tell him his performance days are on hold for an indefinite period of time. The rest of the band are left spinning in space, already set to hit the road. After a couple of failed attempts to tour as the men from Yes, Chris Squire discovers a vocalist on U-Tube who is fronting a Yes cover band called \\"Close to the Edge\\". His name is Benoit David and Chris invites him to join the band with the now working name of \\"In The Present\\". They tour small venues and try him out. He's not bad, he's been singing Yes songs for years now with the cover band, and although he is not Jon Anderson, he has a working knowledge of Yes music and the legions of starved Yes fans who come to the concerts are enthusiastic enough for the rest of the band to keep him on. Can you imagine how he feels? Time passes and it's now obvious that Jon Anderson will not be re-joining the band any time soon as he nurses himself and his voice back to normal. The band is getting itchy, they want to continue to make Yes music for an audience in desperate need of something other than Beyonce, weak indie rock and hip hop. The decision is made to make David the official lead vocalist of an official Yes.     Being a hard core Jon Anderson fan I'm horrified by the prospect of a Yes without Jon. Yes triedthis once back in 1980 with Buggles alumni Trevor Horn replacing Anderson and Jeff Downes replacing Rick Wakeman. The resulting album \\"Drama\\"wasn't a bad album but after a tour to support it, the band fell apart. After Yes officially announced that they would record a new album with David as lead vocalist I had could not believe that a viable Yes could come out of it. Boy was I wrong! In a brilliant move Chris Squire again enlisted the services of Trevor Horn, this time as producer and Jeff Downes as keyboardist to replace Wakeman. The resulting disc \\"Fly From Here\\" is better than I ever dreamed possible. Benoit David to his credit has a wonderful voice, in fact he has a couple of different voices and does not try to be a Jon Anderson imitator. It's an updated different vocal sound but fits right in with the tradition of the Yes vocal style. Downes is a better synth arranger than virtuoso keyboardist like Rick Wakeman and in this case his contributions were the right way to go adding atmosphere and mood. The multi-part \\"Fly from Here\\" a 20 minute plus suite resurrected from the \\"Drama\\" days is the album opener and a powerful declaration that progressive rock is not dead and is alive and well, much to the consternation of those who run The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\", \\"Life On A Film Set, and \\"Hour Of Need\\" contain sounds that I've yet to hear from Yes, they are modern and wonderful and still Yes. \\"Solitaire\\" is a Steve Howe acoustic guitar interlude that sets the stage for \\"Into The Storm\\" a group tour-de-force already on it's way to becoming a classic. After carefull consideration I give \\"Fly From Here\\" 5 stars, and if Jon ever rejoins the band it is my hope that Benoit David be kept on as a co-vocalist, boy what a sound that would be!
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I purchased this game for my eleven year old. He absolutely loves it. He and my other boys will crowd around the computer to \\"ride\\" the latest coaster they built. I like this game because it promotes creativity (building something) and doesn't involve violence.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have a number of different watches - quartz, solar, kinectic - and I wanted to try an automatic watch without paying a fortune for a Swiss watch.<br /><br />I was not aware that Seiko still made an automatic watch until I came across it on Amazon at less than $100.<br /><br />The watch has been running well for a month. I did change the band as the green band was scratchy.<br /><br />The power reserve is 27 to 30 hours. I get 30 if I put it on the winder over night. Even if it stops, resetting is easy -the same as other Seiko day/ date watches.<br /><br />This watch has become my every day casual time piece.<br /><br />I like it.
B000002JOH|3.0|Pantera literally exploded into an arrogant, explosive, motherf*** after making this album.  Yet when one looks back on the Pantera discography, it seems to my eyes wholly evident that this is the weakest Pantera offering post-Cowboys era.  (Not counting their flaccid reunion Reinventing The Steel of course)  They were trapped in limbo between the groove thrash on Cowboys From Hell, and the elegant extreme groove metal masterpiece Far Beyond Driven.  Somehow in the process, this transition album has become the high water mark for this band.  No doubt \\"Walk\\" has something to do with this, the bands simplest groove, and biggest single.  However beyond that song, there is little to sink your teeth into.  The semi-ballad closer \\"Hollow\\" is a great track, that is until the solos, and clean guitar ends, then it drones into a semi boring repetitive riff.  \\"Hostile\\" is often touted is some sort of masterpiece, but its really a second rate thrash knockoff, with horrible lyrics.  Perhaps the worst song on the record, \\"This Love\\" combines the most boring riff on the album with redundantly unexciting echo-y clean guitar verses.  \\"By Demons Be Driven\\" is the true highlight off this album.  It is a combination of a simple stop start riff, and harmonic driven verses, with perfect lyrics written by Anselmo to match.  \\"Mouth For War\\" has a pretty solid and entertaining riff courtesy of the departed Dimebag.  I wonder why this album is always to chosen to represent the band when it is sandwiched in between two far superior masterpieces.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|I own all of Gosh Groban's albums but this album was very disappointing.  Absolutely none of these songs stand on their own (they will probably never be heard on the radio).  The words are rushed as they try to tell a small part of a bigger story you are unaware of.  They sound as if they were collected from different plays - plays you have not seen.  Before you buy this album listen to it.

0307887960|4.0|*Disclaimer* I haven't read the whole book.  I got the premise of the book from a magazine article ABOUT the diet.  It gave me the steps and why to do them, but not the whole shebang.      But what I can say is that I'm doing the all-protein diet this week.  My goal is to lose 30 pounds... and 4 days in I've lost 8 of them.  Eight pounds.  In four days.    There is no way I could do this for months on end.  I don't think it's healthy- I'm missing nutrients that are found in vegetables and fruits.  In the long-term, this would be a diet that could potentially give a body some serious deficiencies.      BUT, it is giving me a great jump-start on my weight loss, and I'm a believer. The great thing is that I am not HUNGRY.  Mentally, I still want chocolate.  Physically, I have no cravings- and that is HUGE for this former carb addict.  I've done the vegan diet (always hungry, and zero energy), and I've done the low-fat/low-calorie diet (didn't lose a thing), and I've done other low carb plans (slow-going at best and always had cravings). So this?  I can handle this.  And what I am craving now is VEGETABLES!  ME WANT ZUCCHINI!!!  And hey, has that every happened before?  No way!  It used to be cake I craved.      I have insulin resistance- I gave it to myself from 32 years of being a sugar addict.  That's why this plan works for me.  It won't necessarily work for someone whose body makeup is different- that's how these things work.     Whether I can see it through remains to be seen.  But so far, I'm grateful for this boost and rapid weight loss, and I am looking forward to (slowly, I hope) getting down to my goal weight.  But man, I can't wait to eat some veggies.  :)
B0042RJWTC|1.0|I buy this Series because I love this kind of stories.  The series is excellent but I did not have a chance of seeing it when I buy it, big mistake.  I begin to see it during this summer and to my surprise I was not able to see some of the chapter I though is was my dvd so I buy a new one, and still have the same problem.  Then I decided to move forward because it was too late to return it.  The other chaptes, almost 3 to 4 were imposible to see because they look like when is raining and your are trying to see your cable or dish programs.  So if you buy them be sure to see them before your returning time expires.

B004EF6632|5.0|This is one of the best period dramas I've seen to date - and period dramas are my favorite type. The casting is excellent, the chemistry is perfect. The characters are three-dimensional, even the unhappier ones, and where that occurs, it is a serious plus. This one educates as well (the Industrial Revolution/the haves and the have nots) but does so in an engaging way. The love story is there and well-done; however, there are many subplots running through this story and all are given equal care. Recommendations for others of this caliber would be appreciated. Thank you.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|I Love this game. But when is the next update? I thought it would be available by now, but still don&apos;t see anything....
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Big help. Check it out. Thanks amazon. I will surely use this app. Nice graphics. Not sure about 7.99 but it seems like it can be good.
0811875040|2.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if I had written this review a few weeks ago. The book is really special-looking with the scalloped pages and great photographs, and the recipes look great. I have spent the last 3 weeks searching for and buying all of the specialty pans that are required (in unusual sizes) to make the recipes- a very costly undertaking. Yesterday, I received the error sheet by e-mail. Since I am planning on actually using the book, as opposed to it sitting on the coffee table, I had to cross out the 18 mistakes and write in all the corrections, which really bothered me since it's a brand new book. I think the publisher should send everyone who bought this a new book once it's corrected.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I was skeptical. But this app makes me want. the to cook! That is high praise indeed. Very polished, too.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|This is a very well done application and would be very useful. However, on my Samsung Droid Charge, it killed the battery in about two hours and then prevented the battery from charging. I used a task killer to stop the application from running in the background, but it restarted itself. I would love to see the issues addressed, but for now, this application has been uninstalled.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|To see Katniss and Peeta fight through the Capital's murderous Hunger Games is something I would love to see on screen. The Hunger Games trilogy is a awesome series of books. I am reading the Mockingjay now (last of the trilogy). It has been enthralling from the first to the last. If it is played out close to the book plot it would be a big hit on the big screen. Undoubtedly a call for the trilogy would ring out.    Last start a push for the movie release.    [[ASIN:0545265355 Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset]]

B000002J2F|4.0|[4.5 stars]    'Duke' captures Genesis in transition from their progressive roots to the more pop-rock style they would persue throughout the 1980's. In the wake of 'Follow You Follow Me', there is a far-from-subtle nudge towards the mainstream here; shorter, leaner, tighter songs, a much more subdued production, and a couple of quite blatant grabs for pop glory. However, there is still plenty for old-school Genesis fans to love here, in the form of the extended central storyline and a number of longer artistic pieces. 'Duke' is truly a \\"crossover\\" album, and marks the point where many prog fans start dropping off and mainstream fans begin jumping on board.     The centrepiece of 'Duke' is the six-song story made up of 'Behind The Lines'/'Duchess'/'Guide Vocal'/'Turn It On Again'/'Dukes Travels'/'Dukes End'. As has been noted many times, the band broke the six songs into indiviudal components and scattered them throughout the record because they didn't want comparisons to 'Suppers Ready'. But in my opinion, it would have been better to keep the sequence intact and hang the comparisons, because splitting them up like this makes the album feel disjointed. After opening with the fantastic one-two punch of 'Behind The Lines' and 'Duchess', 'Duke' wanders through a wide variety of musical styles and lyrical themes, sometimes returning to the thread of the central story, sometimes going away again. This breaks up the flow of the album; the ambitious 'Cul De Sac' is very oddly placed between two of Genesis' most straightforward poppy numbers, likewise 'Please Don't Ask' feels jarringly out of place between 'Cul De Sac' and 'Dukes Travels'. The end result is an album that is made up of individual songs, ranging from pretty good to flat-out brilliant, that sound great on their own but don't necessarily fit together all that well as a whole.    Still, the individual moments are pretty good, in particular the six central songs. The funky 'Behind The Lines' and powerful 'Duchess', the ambitious 'Dukes Travels' and the hard-rocking 'Turn It On Again' are the four key songs on the album, and fortunately they're four of the best songs here. Prog fans will enjoy 'Dukes Travels' in particular, as well as the two very different sounding Tony Banks compositions `Heathaze' and `Cul-de-Sac'. Of the poppier tracks, Misunderstanding' is a good enough song (if a bit out of place on `Duke'), `Alone Tonight' is okay, and `Please Don't Ask' is basically a Phil Collins solo song that should have been placed on `Face Value' instead of here.     In the end, like most \\"transitional\\" albums, `Duke' sometimes falls victim to the band attempting too many things at once, and trying too hard to please everybody.  This may disappoint some long-time fans who are used to Genesis albums having an over-riding central theme and a lyrical and musical consistency. But it also means that fans of all stages of the band's career will find something to love on `Duke', from prog epics to pop ballads. `Duke' is arguably the only Genesis album to truly appeal to both prog and pop fans, making it a key album in the Genesis catalogue and an essential purchase for all fans of the band, even if the album isn't as coherent or focussed as it could be.

9562916464|5.0|What better way is there to celebrate the 50th anniversary of \\"The Little Book\\" ([[ASIN:0205632645 The Elements of Style: 50th Anniversary Edition]]) than by reading the original source-text?<br /><br />And what a celebration it is!<br /><br />The first thing noticed is how familiar the original text is. The same outline format, the same structure, the same sage (and somewhat whimsical) advice that is in the current (4th) edition is there in the first--in all its unvarnished glory.<br /><br />That is a glowing testament both to Mr. Strunk's genius and enduring power. Dr. Boyd K. Packer noted, \\"Refined substance combined with brevity are very difficult indeed to achieve.\\" And Strunk was up to the task. Consider other style- and writing- guides, their quiddities and quillets, their hair-splitting and niggling, with the resulting volume. Then flip through this 1st edition, which maxes out at 52 pages. You see why this book is so popular.<br /><br />And why it is so useful.<br /><br />Even so, there are noticeable differences between the 1st and 4th editions. The first is the accruals to the text. The 3rd edition included an index by Lawrence W. Mazzeno; the fourth had glossary by Robert DiYanni. Both of these are welcome helps.<br /><br />But some of the other accruals are not so helpful. White's introduction is helpful in explaining the whys and wherefores of \\"The Little Book,\\" and about the man William Strunk, Jr. Roger Angell's foreword, thought interesting, is more for a book on motivating writers, such as \\"[[ASIN:1877741094 Zen in the Art of Writing: Essays on Creativity]]\\" by Ray Bradbury. And Charles Osgood's afterword (really a testimonial) does not add anything to the text. Again, it does have a place *somewhere*, but not necessarily in this book.<br /><br />As to White's revision of Strunk's text, almost all of the changes are needed. The spelling and exercise sections were excised and have not been missed.\\"An Approach to Style,\\" White's biggest inclusion, is helpful to floundering wordsmiths. And his philosophical discussion of what exactly is good writing spurs thought and discussion.<br /><br />Yet, there is one exception. One section should have been left intact, \\"Section II: Elementary Principles of Composition.\\" White kept most of Strunk's ideas, but excised the sections on outlining, and the paragraphs that were diagrammed. This is a pity, since the outline is a writer's crucial tool.<br /><br />Ayn Rand (\\"[[ASIN:0452011876 Atlas Shrugged]]\\") celebrated outlining. She asserts, \\"No beginner should write without an outline. If I could enforce this as an absolute, I would. ... One reason for the dreadful articles in our media is that they are written without outlines, and thus fall apart structurally\\" (\\"[[ASIN:0452282314 The Art of Nonfiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers]],\\" Ch. 5).<br /><br />So it is worth the price and than bother to track this edition down just for Strunk's comments on outlining.

White--and even Strunk himself--used 100 years ago at Cornell. Other editions have reset type and text, and are easier on the eye. I prefer the reprint editions. The text tastes of authentic history.<br /><br />And, of course, the current edition, either hardback ([[ASIN:0205313426 The Elements of Style (4th Edition)]]) or softback ([[ASIN:020530902X The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition]]).l discussion of what exactly is good writing spurs thought and discussion.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|I love Jamie Oliver, and I love how he shows basic techniques too.  many of his dishes are simple but tasty, I would recommend always using fresh ingredients when making his dishes to showcase his flavor combinations.
0553801473|5.0|I understand why there are so many negative reviews, and it is because people are impatient and are afraid that the series may not ever end.  However, this book is still a great, entertaining read.  Not quite as good as the first three, but would still give it 4.5 stars (rounding up).  The only reason it is not truly five stars for me is that the Daenerys thread should have been told in half as many chapters (same problem Feast had with the Cersei and Brienne chapters).<br /><br />If the series was already finished and someone were to read this book knowing that the last two books were waiting for them (hopefully it is still only two more), then I firmly believe that many of the people complaining about this book would have loved it for its complexity and plot building.<br /><br />I agree that it is frustrating that there was little resolution in the book, but it is a great journey and is laying the framework for the destination that will be provided in the last two books.  A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons are the middle part of the story, which often suffers due to the lack of a beginning and an end.  But once the series is complete, it will be realized that the quality was fantastic all along.<br /><br />Most of the threads in this book were on par with the entire series: Jon, Theon, Asha, Bran, Davos, Barristan, Victarion, Griff.  A lot of people complain about Tyrion's journey, but I think the first half really showed the lost Valyrian world (reminiscent of Tolkien), and the second half allowed Tyrion to regain some of his lost humanity.  Once again, my only real complaint is that there were two many chapters of Daenerys sitting around in Meereen.<br /><br />Now I just really hope that Winds of Winter does not take five years.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder offers a lot more in each book than comparable D&D texts, which is fantastic. Between the Core and Bestiary books you have everything you need to play, unlike DnD's 3 book requirement. Some have criticized it for being too Rules-Lawyery and I cant say that I find that to be true. The two books contain rules for everything you could really need for a Campaign, and more, making a lot of the rules optional, and it's always nice to have access to those kinds of rules. The Core books contains distilled information from the DM and Player rulebooks of typical D&D, saving you a good $40. On top of that a lot of 3.X is compatible with Pathfinder needing only minor adjustments (Creatures get -1 CR and the such). The removal of dead levels makes playing any class more enjoyable and keeps the party moving toward greater things.<br /><br />Due to compatibility with 3.X one can bring in various classes that aren't yet available in Pathfinder, as well as races and monsters. And since the Bestiary offers even more races for play, the whole system is a godsend for new players who want more options, as well as DMs for expanding the world.<br /><br />One of my primary issues with the system is that they have yet to produce an Epic Level Handbook equivalent for the game, but since multi-classing is easier this is mitigated.<br /><br />I highly suggest that anyone who doesn't like 4th ed and wants an improved 3.5 experience try out Pathfinder.

1559211407|5.0|I love, love, love this charming book that reaches out and touches the bibliophile in me! Only one who has a life-long love affair with books will truly appreciate this story of the decades' long correspondence between Helene Hanff, a script reader/ writer living in New York, and Frank Doel, the manager of an antiquarian British bookshop, Marks & Co. The correspondence starts in the year 1949 and ends in 1968.<br /><br />These letters reveal two people who shared a similar sense of humor and a passion for old books. Ms. Hanff had a particular fondness for antiquarian books filled with wisdom - the works of John Donne, Samuel Pepys, Newman, Leigh Hunt, Walter Savage Landor, and many others. Despite making little money, Hanff develops such a fondness for the people running the bookshop that she sends them food parcels when she discovers England is being subjected to food rationing in the post-war period.<br /><br />My love for this story is not only because it is about a love of books, but also because it harkens back to a time when people actually took pains to correspond with each other (not that they had a choice), an art that is slowly dying out (I try my best to keep it alive by penning long letters to my parents who live on a different continent and who are blissfully oblivious to the wonders of e-mailing and social networking).<br /><br />84, Charing Cross Road resonates with me on so many levels, and is the perfect read on days when I'd like to just slow down and savor the pleasure of curling up with a light read. The movie adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Sir Anthony Hopkins is another delight that perfectly captures the essence of the book. Also recommended:<br />Q's Legacy

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Read my title of this review (as if you already didn't know).  Our food system is broken, there is no oversight, and food as we now know it isn't really food at all.  It's as if we are eating a \\"notion\\" of food and not the actual original God given morsel.  It's really really depressing watching this video.  This earth makes more than enough food to feed everyone organically well on this planet, yet, the large corporations are running our food system from seed to the supermarket and therefore control quality (or lack thereof) and pricing.  Wish we could all share what God intended for us to eat on this earth; his natural food in it's natural state.  Greed is the reason behind altering corn seeds/plants, implementing HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) in just about every product, steroids and hormones in meat, and other non-necessary chemical additives.      I'm no vegetarian (although I'm thinking of becoming one) but just doesn't make sense to me why these huge corps pump chemicals into our food!  It makes me want to scream. Worse yet, taste an organic piece of fruit and then taste a pesticide sprayed chemically altered one and see which one tastes better.  The organic strawberry would win hands down.  Organic food isn't just good for you, it tastes better!    Oh well, I'll step off of my ranting soap box, but, we must all make a change when buying food.  If we each bought one organic item everytime we shopped, maybe these corporations would have no choice but to compete for having the best organic food and produce.  Until then, read every label and watch what goes into your mouth.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The long wait is over, and for the most part George R.R. Martin has delivered a great book.  While I do think he spends too much time on events outside of Westeros, and I don't like the several cliffhangers at the end of the book, overall this was a great read.  I read it over a week, most of that on one day when I actually had time to read, and I could not stop.  Those expecting something to surpass the first three books of the series may be disappointed, but when compared to the vast amount of other fantasy out there this book shines.
1586487981|5.0|I'm gonna keep this short. This book is great. You'd think it might be hard to follow, since they explicitly eschew grand theories. Yet, it's not only readable, it's a page turner. I was fascinated with the detail of research, and the clarity of the arguments. I want to work for their organization.   I also liked how by the end of the book, you realize that the concepts go far beyond simply poverty, it extends to how political systems work in many, if not all countries.

0307272702|4.0|There is a reason why \\"and what to do about it\\" is in such small print on the cover.  It seems like an afterthought.  I was practically done with the book before I realized I was reading the \\"what to do about it\\" chapter.  Here's the short version:  he recommends a low carb diet.  If you're looking for a plan or ideas on what to eat, there really isn't any of that in here.    However, if you want to read a very well-thought-out, reasoned analysis of historical and recent research, this is a great book for that.  And he does a great job of calling out the \\"authorities\\" on weight loss as to the huge lack of support for the calories in, calories out and low-fat theories that are touted as truths now.  He says in the intro that you should give this book to your doctor after you've finished, in order to get them thinking critically about this.  That would be a great idea.
B003YBNREI|5.0|I've been a huge Doobie Brothers fan since the early 70's.  I loved them pre, with, and post Michael McDonald.  This new album with their old producer, Ted Templeman, sounds very much like vintage Doobies, and the songs/sound quality is excellent.  The Tom Johnston rockers are there, a nice Caribbean flavored tune, and a couple smooth Patrick Simmons ballads.  The ballad with Michael McDonald on harmony vocals is a great listen, but the other one with Willie Nelson could have been skipped.  It just highlights how old and worn out Willie really is now.  Other than that, the album stands right up there with the other Doobie classics like The Captain and Me, and Takin' It To The Streets.  If you are a Doobies fan,  buy it; you will enjoy it.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|\\"Mary Poppins\\" will always be memorable to me if for no other reason, (but there are others I assure you!), that this is the first film I ever got to see without an adult accompanying me.  I was all of ten and a half years old in February 1965 and had been anxiously waiting for the movie to come to our local theatre for months, it finally had!  I remember badgering my mother to let the friend from school who was sleeping over (another first) and I go see the movie alone.  Certainly I didn't want to appear a baby in front of my pal, who was already going to movies without adult supervision, or so he told me.  My mother reluctantly agreed, even letting us buy our own tickets at the booth, after ascertaining what time the film let out, and told us sternly to wait right under the theatre marquee if she wasn't right there when the movie let out until she arrived.  Different times, anyway my buddy and I both loved it, and there was another momentous stepping-stone on the path to being a \\"grown-up\\" for me.<br /><br />That piece of nostalgia aside, \\"Mary Poppins\\" is besides \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and the other classic Disney Films, one of the most delightful fantasy films that can be enjoyed by both children and adults.  The character of Mary Poppins was introduced and developed by P.L. Travers in a quartet of children's books.  In adapting them to the screen the writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, skillfully choose several chapters out of the first two books and added their own inspired ideas.  The story is fairly simple, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) responds to an advertisement by youngsters Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) for \\"The Perfect Nanny\\" for themselves.  Although the Banks children live a very comfortable existence on Cherry Tree Lane in the heart of London, they are starved for some affectionate attention.  Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson) is too preoccupied with his role as a bank manager whereas Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) is a suffragette, fighting to get the vote for women.  Mary Poppins serenely sails in from the skies, and with her good friend the jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) they take the children on all sorts of wondrous adventures and nourish them with tenderness and love.  By the film's end the Banks are truly a happy family, thanks to Mary Poppins.<br /><br /> It's magical, in all senses of the word, and transcends the generations.  I recall that very first time my friend and I laughing in delight and looking at one another in awe as one illusion after another unfolded on the screen, how'd they do that anyway?  I felt I'd come full circle the first time I watched it with my son when he was three seeing the wonder reflected in his face and hearing him merrily chortle as Mary Poppins cast her spell yet again.<br /><br />\\"Practically perfect in every way\\" is how Mary Poppins is described, and I will borrow that phrase to characterize Julie Andrews' performance as Mary Poppins.  From her tip-tilted nose down to her feet spread out to form a \\"v\\" shape, she is the prettiest, most beguiling nanny you'll ever come across, sings gloriously and enchantingly makes the role her own.  Considered to be her consolation prize when she wasn't chosen to repeat her Broadway role in the film version of \\"My Fair Lady\\", she would have the last laugh come award time when she scooped not only the Golden Globe but Academy Award as Best Actress.  As Bert, Dick Van Dyke, lanky and rubber limbed is her ideal partner, they are simply wonderful together particularly in the \\"Jolly Holiday\\" sequence.  My wife and I thought when \\"Victor/Victoria\\" came to Broadway, Van Dyke should have played the late Robert Preston's role as Toddy to Julie Andrews' Victoria, it would have been a perfect reunion.  He also gets to show off his prowess as a dancer in the zany, athletic \\"Step in Time\\" number.  Child actors can be annoyingly arch and cutesy, but Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as Jane and Michael Banks are refreshingly natural and winning without any irritating mannerisms.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding and should take a collective bow, starting with Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson as the Banks, Ed Wynn as the effervescent Uncle Albert, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Reginald Owen, Elsa Lanchester, and Arthur Treacher down to Jane Darwell's tender Bird Woman.<br /><br />Other reasons to see this film, first, for their time extraordinary special effects that are all the more impressive since they were developed pre computer, deservedly rewarded with an Oscar.  To give you a sample, Mary Poppins, Bert and the children popping into a chalk pavement drawing into a magical animated world, a tea party on the ceiling, and the four walking up a black staircase composed of smoke straight up to the nighttime sky.  Next a bright, tuneful score, the best ever done by the Sherman Brothers, including the Oscar winning Best Song \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\", \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\"  \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\", and \\"Feed the Birds\\".  This last was allegedly one of Walt Disney's favorite songs, and again this original score also took away an Academy Award.  The evocative sets of 1910 Edwardian London are perfectly executed particularly the Cherry Tree Lane set, and Tony Walton, the then husband of Julie Andrews designed costumes that a treat to the eye.  Again Oscar nominations for both, actually \\"Mary Poppins\\" received a record 13 Oscar nominations that also included Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Stevenson. One final tip of the hat to husband and wife choreographers, Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood for their exuberant dances particularly in the \\"Step in Time\\" number.<br /><br />The special features are a treasure trove of riches.  Here are the highlights: a fascinating commentary by Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, The Sherman Brothers and Karen Dotrice, \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins\\" -very well done indeed, a musical reunion with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman, the gala world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater, lots of fun to see the Hollywood A list circa 1964, a bonus animated short narrated by Julie Andrews called \\"The Cat that Looked at a King\\", and finally a song that was cut called \\"Chimpanzoo\\" performed by Richard Sherman.<br /><br />Last words, this restored print has state of the art picture and sound, with vivid, glowing colors and a clear, crisp soundtrack and score. I could go on and on, sufficient to say this was Walt Disney's live action film masterpiece, if you're never seen it before you're in for a joyous celebration, and if you have take the time to renew your acquaintance with this timeless classic.ural and winning without any irritating mannerisms.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding and should take a collective bow, starting with Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson as the Banks, Ed Wynn as the effervescent Uncle Albert, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Reginald Owen, Elsa Lanchester, and Arthur Treacher down to Jane Darwell's tender Bird Woman.<br /><br />Other reasons to see this film, first, for their time extraordinary special effects that are all the more impressive since they were developed pre computer, deservedly rewarded with an Oscar.  To give you a sample, Mary Poppins, Bert and the children popping into a chalk pavement drawing into a magical animated world, a tea party on the ceiling, and the four walking up a black staircase composed of smoke straight up to the nighttime sky.  Next a bright, tuneful score, the best ever done by the Sherman Brothers, including the Oscar winning Best Song \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\", \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\"  \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\", and \\"Feed the Birds\\".  This last was allegedly one of Walt Disney's favorite songs, and again this original score also took away an Academy Award.  The evocative sets of 1910 Edwardian London are perfectly executed particularly the Cherry Tree Lane set, and Tony Walton, the then husband of Julie Andrews designed costumes that a treat to the eye.  Again Oscar nominations for both, actually \\"Mary Poppins\\" received a record 13 Oscar nominations that also included Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Stevenson. One final tip of the hat to husband and wife choreographers, Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood for their exuberant dances particularly in the \\"Step in Time\\" number.<br /><br />The special features are a treasure trove of riches.

B001I189MQ|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" disappointed me at first.  I had been looking for another movie with the feel of \\"Batman Begins,\\" and it is quite different in terms of the look (sunlight Chicago streets, not the dark Gotham of the previous Nolan movie) and the general feel of things.  The multiple images of shattering glass were annoying; the opening scene was ridiculous from the standpoint of how the Joker could get helpers, if he treated them that way; and it just didn't seem focused on a theme, the way \\"Batman Begins\\" was.<br /><br />However, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is indeed intensely focused on a theme: chaos.  I can't imagine how that could be shown in another genre, but the comic book source is perfect for that.  The Joker brings chaos to Gotham, but his antics are incredibly carefully planned, the way only a real madman could plan them.  Batman is most successful when he introduces chaos into the Joker's plans (the fights in the Pruitt Building, for instance), and Commissioner Gordon wins a coup by using the element of surprise.  The stunts are superb.  The music is perfect.<br /><br />You can sit back and just let disbelief shatter with the glass while the other visuals and music carry you away, but there are a lot of intellectual games going on to keep your mind busy, too.  Many people have commented on how Nolan used game theory in the rigged ferries scene, but it's also apparent in the opening scene.  I only noticed this recently, but it's really hard to keep track of all the clowns at the bank, because we're never shown all of them together, and one is thrown into the mix at the last moment.  That grabs your attention after the movie when you try to figure out if the Joker really did take all that money for himself.  You see it happen right before your eyes, and you're still not sure.<br /><br />And the movie has you hooked, once you get inside its deeper levels this way.<br /><br />It's worth 5 stars, but it's not perfect: The reference to the Palisades came out of nowhere and was jarring to this American, though I suppose someone from another country would think of all cities here as the same; we heard the Italian's leg bones snap when he was dropped, and it was distracting to see him walking around very soon afterwards with just a cane; and I missed Katie Holmes.  That's about it, though.  Watch \\"The Dark Knight\\" again, if you weren't too impressed with it the first time around.  You might be surprised.
1451629184|5.0|I pre-purchased this book with the sole intention of supporting Jaycee.  Yes, the writing was very juvenile, but come on, her education stopped at the fifth grade!  Some of the negative reviews I read were pathetically insulting, as if she was supposed to be authoring the next Iliad.  We all knew going in that her education stopped at 11.  Parts of the book were definitely hard to read, and the entire time, all I wanted to do was give her a big hug and tell her thank you for that kind of courage.  I don't get how someone would stay a prisoner when there were opportunities to escape, but then I am an adult with life experience - she wasn't.  Jaycee, keep growing.  I'm so proud of you.

0981951244|5.0|This book was recommended for a business challenge I am involved in and it has really opened my eyes to new ideas and confirmed others that I am already doing. I not only recommend this for businesses of any kind, but for anyone just looking to better their life. It has almost been like a \\"duh\\" moment while reading most of the book. It's simple easy to understand and the work book portions at the end of the chapter really help you nail down where you need to work on in whatever area you are weak most in. I haven't met a single person yet who has read this book that didn't like it in some way shape or form. It's also short, sweet, and to the point. I plan on rereading it to solidify many of the practices that Mr. Hardy asks us to try!

0470901071|4.0|This is the second book I've read by Lammle, and I'm just as happy with this book as I was with his Network+ course book.  His style of writing not only explains the subject well, but does it in such a way as to not make the book overly dry or boring.  I've read technical/instructional books from other authors, and too often many of these books are difficult to make it through not because of the subject matter, but because of the way the author writes.<br /><br />I wish this book had come with Cisco's Packet Tracer software, because practicing for an exam which requires full knowledge of commands is really necessary.  This leaves you to find your own way to practice by either buying Packet Tracer or an actual router separately.  If you do get Packet Tracer, some of the commands used in the book don't work even in the latest IOS code inside of Packet Tracer--they will only work in IOS installed on an actual device.<br /><br />This book isn't without its faults, however.  More than the previous book I read by Lammle, I've found quite a few typos or editing errors inside.  Sometimes subnets or routes are calculated incorrectly.  There are sentences or paragraphs obviously left over unedited from a previous version which can be confusing to the reader by directly countering something added-in for this version, and diagrams sometimes don't match the text describing them.  Don't let these scare you away from this book however.  If you're paying attention to the text, doing the exercises as you go along, and hopefully have a way to practice use of IOS, I think you'll catch these errors--and it may even be helpful in an unintended way.<br /><br />I'll update this review once I've taken my CCNA exams, but based on use of his previous book and its relationship to this one, I'm sure this book has done a great job of readying me to get my CCNA.  I highly recommend to anyone interested in networking--although the author does suggest reading his Network+ book first, and having done so, it has no doubt made this book far easier to understand.  Take advantage of the practice exams, flash cards, and other included materials, and I have no doubt this book will leave you excellently prepared to master the CCNA exam.<br /><br />Edit April 12, 2013--After reading through this book I took and passed the 640-802 exam last summer on my first go.  I still feel that this book was excellent preparation for the course, partnered with a way to get hands-on experience with the IOS software.  Now preparing for my CCNP.

B004IFYN2Y|5.0|These peoples lives we all but destroyed buy the Bush administration and conservatives refuse to accept the truth. Valerie Plame Wilson was a CIA operative and she was exposed. Her contacts lives were immediately endangered from that moment on and her marriage suffered a serious blow. Yet there are so many who think she's the one who's \\"unpatriotic\\"! Really?<br /><br />In the end she and her husband were right all along! There was no \\"yellow-cake\\" shipped to Iraq and this was so expertly demostrated in the movie. And there's STILL no WMD found there 8 years later. It only costs us 4000+ dead soldiers and 10's of thousands of seriously wounded. By that I mean missing legs and arms and worst of all brain injuries. So who's unpatriotic in this story? Oh - and that lame exuse saying \\"Saddam was a bad guy and he had to be removed from power\\", is the dumbest load of camel dung I have ever heard! There are alot of bad guys who deserve to die, a thousand times over, and no one is even trying to remove them from power! Go figure.<br /><br />This movie is a window into the slow decay of Joe and Valeries former life at that point in time. It also offers a small glimps into things they had to endure on a daily basis.<br /><br />I cant wait to watch it again and listen to the Commentary of the real Wlison's themselves. That should be interesting!...
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have amassed many apps, specifically games, and this app has made it easier to organize all of them. \n\nBefore this, I used folders to organize games into genres since looking in the app drawer can be tedious. For whatever reason, whenever I added a new app to a folder, it&apos;s added at the end and the folder&apos;s not alphabetical anymore. I would have to put the apps in trash and re-add them every time I got a new app so that the folder&apos;s alphabetically organized.\n\nNow, this app has saved me from all the hassle of tedious organization. Whenever you download a new app, this app will alert you to put the new app in a default category or your own customizable category, using a checklist.

0307716511|4.0|In Sister by Rosamund Lupton, during a celebratory dinner in New York City, Beatrice receives a frantic call from her mother that her younger sister, Tess, is missing. Beatrice catches the next flight to London, all the time thinking of the scolding she will give Tess for not letting people know her whereabouts.  But, shortly thereafter Tess's body is found and based on the evidence her death is ruled a suicide. Beatrice refuses to believe this verdict and embarks on a journey to uncover the truth.     This was an accomplished debut novel that grabbed me from the first page to the unexpected finish.  The story unfolds in a series of letters Beatrice writes to Tess and Beatrice's statement of events to a lawyer.  In the author's capable hands, this technique is seamless and works to the reader's advantage, as we are allowed to see the intimate relationships not only between the sisters, but with the other characters as well. Many times I felt I was intruding into the intimate life of Beatrice as she bares her soul with the grief of losing her sister.      While the story read like a detective novel, it definitely has a feminine feel as it concentrates on the bond between the sisters, and the other female characters. Readers who are expecting a traditional mystery or thriller may not enjoy the pace of this story, as the author breaks from traditional pacing for the thriller genre pacing. The secondary characters and storylines are introduced in a manner so the reader is not overwhelmed. But, with Beatrice as the only narrator, I often wondered how reliable her interpretations of the facts were, but this is on purpose and worked well for me. I enjoyed how the suspense was built around the characters and builds one fact at a time, but there are a number of unexpected twists, some the reader will anticipate, but others that will surprise, which is another delight of the book. The author's skills as a screenwriter show as she vividly paints each scene understanding well how this plays into the overall scheme of the story.     Lupton masterfully blends suspense, intrigue, family secrets and the epistolary format to produce a chilling, heart-breaking story that despite the warning builds to an unexpected twist at the end.    I recommend this book to readers who enjoy a mystery thriller with an emphasis on the emotional themes.    This book was provided by the publisher for review purposes.

0307887960|4.0|I did not read this book, but wanted to comment on some of the comments of other people who did not read the book.  I researched Dr. Dukan's web site and read about these methods in magazines.  Following a high protein diet for 10 days helps your resistance to insulin, which is the precursor to type 2 diabetes.  I would suggest to some of my clients that decreasing carbohydrates drastically would slow down the extra secretion of insulin that would improve resistance as well as slow down the insulin turning on the fat storage mood.      Weight loss is possible with this diet.  The only caution is to very slowly integrate carbohydrates back or the pancreas will again dump out the insulin and you'll revert back to your gaining.  As a diabetes educator, I know it's tough to know what to believe.      Decreased Carb intake + increased protein intake = decreased insulin production = decreased insulin resistance = weight loss = decreased diabetes type 2 risk = improved insulin resistance.  Good luck with your body makeover.

B004EPYZU8|2.0|People were/are up in arms about the movie being sexist. The news went as far as to say it's women empowering, like the director said. That is wrong though, it is sexist. Funny thing is it's sexist in ways that people aren't explaining properly. This movie deals with drugged, sexually abused mind control victims, and the movie never really deals with that being a bad thing, only very briefly, like it had to be added before the end. What people don't understand is the scenes in the brothel aren't real either, so they are being abused during all of that. Also when baby doll is dancing, it's safe to assume she is actually being forced to have sex, and is detaching herself from that horrible reality into the fantasy world of the fighting, whereas the whole experience is traumatic enough that she needs to create the burlesque dancer world just to cope with the day to day, then the dancing to cope with the sexual abuse, see? it's not like we haven't seen movies or shows with women action characters shooting guns scantily clad, that's not new. What's new is the coldness that runs through the whole movie with no moral checkpoint through it to show that it's wrong, so it makes jewish director zack snyder look like he enjoys the blurring of sex and violence.

B0001I55NS|1.0|I only sat through this because my wife wanted to see it. Neither of us have read the book, she saw the trailer for the movie a few years back, liked the trailer, and so she wanted to see the movie.    What a mess. It's an interesting story/concept, but one that is so poorly executed. It has a \\"made in the 1980's\\" feel to it--its production values are far below those typically found in movies from its time (2003). Stereotypical action flick characters, dramatic orchestral music for less-than-dramatic scenes (involving just a few dozen soldiers, rather than hundreds or thousands), cheesy dialogue. It feels like it was slapped together in a hurry.    In the end...she still kind of liked it, I guess because of the romantic angle. I couldn't wait for it to end.

0439023513|5.0|This was Collin's story and it ended how she thought that it should end.  There are a lot of people who hate this book and are disappointed in the direction that it took, but I trusted the author to tell the \\"real\\" story, even if I didn't like every second of the journey... and I think that she delivered. In order to avoid spoilers, I'll try to be vague.    If you've read the first two books and are trying to decide whether or not to read Mockingjay, do yourself a favor and read it... and let the story affect you how it will, without the influence of other readers' distaste for it.  You probably won't like everything that happens... you might be disappointed about who dies, who lives, and how the characters change throughout the book. But that's life... things don't always turn out how we want them to, and I think the ending of Mockingjay speaks to that. The ending felt real to me... after being through as much as the characters go through, they are going to be changed. Their nightmares will never completely go away. Their lives will never be the same... and that may not leave a warm and fuzzy feeling inside of you at the end of the book, but you'll know that the author was being honest with you.     This book is a perfect conclusion to the story we haven't been able to stop thinking about, real or not real... I'd say real.
B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison hit the ground running after the Beatles broke up and he released the double album \\"All Things Must Pass\\" in 1970.  This is full of fabulous hits you are no doubt familiar with such as the title track, the extremely catchy \\"If Not For You\\" (written by Bob Dylan), \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\".  Really that is only the beginning.  Also included is the Harrison/Dylan composition \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\", a number of additional tracks not included in the original release and an updated remix of \\"My Sweet Lord\\".  The packaging is also excellent and includes four different colour versions of the original cover art.  George's notes reflecting on the album also help bring insight to this wonderful musical creation.  One theme that is repeated on this album is spirituality.  Songs such as \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"I Live For You\\", \\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Art of Dying\\", \\"Awaiting On You All\\" and \\"Hear Me Lord\\", pioneered the use of rock music as a vehicle to express one's belief in God.  That is not to say that no one had done so before, but no one did it so much and with such energy before.  George showed that religious expression was a legitimate subject in rock music and that certainly led to the Christian music industry we have today.  It started with this album.  It is an essential work; you should get it now.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Yes, this album is unbelieveable. Unbelieveably bad that is. Who would've expected this load of c*** to come from such death metal masters?<br />It's more electro-goth than death metal on this album. Threw it out straight away.

The performance is magnificent and features great artists in their prime. The  costumes, sets, orchestral playing,and direction are all as you might expect from a Covent Garden production.

B000MZHW40|3.0|But you could do worse also.    \\"Blood Diamond\\" is a good movie but on the whole rather mediocre in every aspect. The cast is quite fine and one normally would expect more from Leo and Jennifer, but they are severely handicapped by poor screenplay here. The dialogue is highly unremarkable and forgettable. The most poignant scenes wonderfully avoid sentimentality but, as a kind of side effect, miss the real pathos too.    A great deal of the movie consists of violence under the form of shooting people as if they were made for target practice. I understand this is an important part of modern Africa which must be told in all its brutality, and in this respect the movie serves its purpose very well, but I think less bloodshed and more substance would have been a better solution.    In short, entertaining stuff to kill two lazy hours. But nothing really deep, meaningful or memorable.

B00005JLK1|5.0|I remember I first watched this movie one evening when I was very tired but had to stay awake until midnight. So I thought I'd see some really scary movie that will keep me from falling asleep. As it turned out, it did this very efficiently, though not for the scary reasons expected.    Make no mistake, this movie is typical escapist entertainment, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this. And it is pretty good when you come to think of it. The screenplay is well conceived and skilfully executed, with few rather nice surprises and, oh, what a twist in the end. The direction is imaginative and the cast is more than adequate. Visually the movie is quite impressive, with many gorgeous shots of the ghost ship and very decent special effects, particularly the ones in the very end. Apart from one gruesome scene in the beginning, there is nothing really gory, nor scary for that matter, though overall there is a fine tension and suspense during the whole movie.    As for the famed similarities with the earlier \\"Event Horizon\\", they are there but are often unduly emphasised. True, occasionally the later movie does look like a sea ship (as opposed to space ship) variant of earlier one. In both cases an outsider goes with the crew and turns to be more than just a guest; the scene with the collision of the two ships is virtually absolutely the same. Yet both movies have essentially different premises, and the one in \\"Ghost Ship\\" is the better one, less fanciful and more coherent.    If you want to kill two hours but are too tired to watch anything serious, give a try to \\"Ghost Ship\\". You might be surprised how gripping and entertaining it really is.

0307913090|1.0|This is a review of the audio book only.  The books themselves are just wonderful.  I am an avid audio book listener as they have pleasantly filled my long rides to work and home for over 10 years.  Therefore, I have listened to a couple hundred of them.  I was so excited about this book coming out in the audio format, couldn't wait to get it.  Well, I give it only one star because it wouldn't let me rate it with minus stars.  This may be one of the worst audio presentations I have ever listened to.  I think they completely erred in their selection of the audio performer.  So many of the characters in the book are young, or close to it, and the performer is an elderly man that makes every character sound like he is at least 110 years old.  Add to that the unforgivably annoying habit of whistling on every \\"S\\" and it is just too painful to even listen to this.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????????  I made it to the 4th CD and just couldn't take it any more.  It is a shame that they had to totally destroy what should have ended up being one of the all time great audio books.  I am so upset at having spent money on this.  I will stick to the books.

B004TTZHBK|4.0|First off, really, this a decent app, (a great app if you got it as the free app of the day) so just give it a little time and play with it.  Second, I recommend downloading both the app and the extra content using a wireless connection, which should not be an issue for most phones.  I have a Droid X2 and originally downloaded it over the mobile network.  The extra content did not go so smoothly and would actually force close the app whenever I tried.  Downloading the videos was spotty and taking too long. I removed the app completely and started over from scratch using my wireless network.  Of course, the program itself downloaded much faster, the 80mbs of extras downloaded without any issues, and the videos went much smoother as well (this should not be surprising).    The app can be buggy sometimes if you work it too quickly, especially the videos, but everything else is fine.  The trick I found with the videos is sometimes they will auto-play once you click it and sometimes they will not.  Originally I thought they were buggy because some of them just loaded a black screen.  If you wait just a second and tap the screen, the progress bar and controls pop up, then just press play and it runs fine.  The recipes look good.  The pictures may help at times, but most of that extra content you can probably live without if you can even stumble blind drunk around a kitchen.  One of the pictures for a step in a dish was just an empty plate.  I may not be an Iron Chef, but I do know what a plate looks like, thank you.  The videos actually do seem helpful, especially if you are a kitchen disaster like myself (here I offer a recently sliced up finger as proof). Being able to add the ingredients directly from the recipe to the built-in shopping cart is kind of handy.  The cart can divide the list up either by individual recipe or by the aisle, which is a very nice touch if you're doing more than one recipe.    Bottom line:  It's a good app for $8 bucks, but it's a great app for free.  If I had bought it, I am sure I would have been more frustrated starting out, but just be patient with it and you may find the biggest issue you will have is Oliver's hair (just looks a bit goofy, but the man can cook).  Sure, having to use the wireless and taking your time with the app is a bit of a modern inconvenience but keep in mind, if you're buying this app for a smart phone, then you likely have easy access to fresh clean water and indoor plumbing so things could be worse.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|This product has yet to be released, but I anxiously await it. The show was phenomenal, and if the filming, mixing and editing was even semi-professional, this DVD should be first rate. The band was at the top of their game, and the crowd was on fire.

B004GYY714|5.0|I love the Tune-In Radio app.  I was limited to mainly my drive home from work (less than 30 min) for listening to any talk radio.  Sometimes I could turn on the radio at work during the day.  Now however, I can find all my favorite Conservative talk radio hosts on Tune-In and listen at almost any time of day or night.  I say almost because you are limited to when things are streaming online, and all radio stations play the shows at different times.  I believe the pay version allows you to record the shows so you can truly listen any time.

0439023521|5.0|I loved this book.  If I didn't have kids I would not have put this book down.  My favorite thing about this book is how the author did not give any pauses in the story line.  You know in some novels when the author will build the suspense and then something major happens and the next chapter has the main character safe leaving you guessing for awhile.  I just loved how it flowed and can't wait to read the next book and the book after that.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I was ecstatic to recieve this in the mail as I am a big fan and wanted to share it with my Father. It was new and plays really well.
0002247402|3.0|I won't lie, this book kept me reading it, often for longer than I should have. I should have been working, I should have been at the gym, I should have been sleeping, or whatever, but instead I was reading this book. It was a real page-turner, because it gave me that great feeling of a new discovery, a new piece of the puzzle, just around the corner. In the next page, the next chapter, pieces would all start falling into place.<br /><br />Well, after about a thousand pages of wildling dick jokes, the word \\"leal,\\" lots of feasts (although everyone is also starving to death), and a few new story arcs that didn't seem to have much point to them, I'm still waiting for the pieces -- any of them, really -- to start falling. In fact, some of the pieces seem to be floating gently away in some random direction... I refer specifically to a queen with two or three armies, one of the greatest knights around, several kingdoms and heroes, and 3 f**king DRAGONS at her beck and call regressing to the emotional complexity of a tween, and for much of the book just sitting around and mooning about various penises she's enjoyed.<br /><br />Oh, there is a death or two near the end of the book, but they don't really seem like turning points of the story in any meaningful way, at least not in this book or any time in the near future. They seem more like Mr. Martin got to around a thousand pages, then thought: \\"Oh wait, I killed major characters in the first few books. People liked that, didn't they?\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of these books and Mr. Martin, and I'm going to pony up for the next one just as quickly as I did for the first five. This book is just way less focused than I hoped it would be. I hope the 'master plan' will start coming out in the next book, but who knows... hope springs eternal, I suppose.<br /><br />The author's note at the end of the book seemed bitter, angry, and frustrated, which is understandable in many ways; however, in much the same way he's having less fun writing these books, it's kind of becoming less fun to read them. I often felt as if Mr. Jordan would have done his fans and himself a favor had he worked with a ghost writer to finish his story, and while I'll wait on the next book in this series before losing hope, I feel like Mr. Martin might want to take a look at that option, especially given the tone of his author's note.<br /><br />Things *happened* in the first four (yes, I would argue \\"Feast\\" even had a good amount of story progression) books, but I'm looking at the landscape post- and pre- \\"Dance,\\" and it doesn't really look to have changed all that much... certainly less than I would have expected over the course of this many pages.he's having less fun writing these books, it's kind of becoming less fun to read them.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|I'm just going to keep my impression of this book as succinct as possible, since anyone reading this will have no doubt heard many a complaint about this book, already.<br /><br />Let me just say that yes, the book is a bit slow going, especially at first when the reader is introduced to entirely new points of view that were not in the first three novels.  Depending on what sort of reader you are, this can either be perfectly acceptable or it can be a hair-pulling nightmare.  As for me, I learned patience in reading at the knee of the great C.J. Cherryh, so what may seem like a tediously slow story to some people can still be fascinating to me--as this was.  Some people just seem to need constant action.  They want every chapter to have a decapitation or a sex scene, it seems to me, and gives the impression that they don't even care about the characters or story as much as they do about visceral descriptions.<br /><br />And there is that disappointed lot who wanted to read more about their pet characters, and they hated not getting to follow them in this book.  I sympathize; however, those characters we all love (Jon, Tyrion, Daenerys) will be in the next book, and in the meantime you should try and be open minded about new characters, or about characters that you didn't like as much in the other books.<br /><br />For instance, Sansa was never a favorite of mine, especially since she unwittingly caused so much carnage in the first book, but by the end of Feast for Crows I actually had a growing respect for her, and found myself looking forward to her chapters.  The same goes for Jaime.  Starting with with the third book, his character had begun to develop in a convincing manner, and by the end of A Feast for Crows he had become one of my favorite characters in the entire series.<br /><br />Even Cersei is fun to hate in her chapters, which actually creates an interesting and enjoyable dynamic.  Brienne I don't love, but she is the token honorable character in the book, and Arya's story drags a little bit to be honest.<br /><br />But the book is really an intermission between larger story revolutions.  So much happened in the first three books that the fallout had to be dealt with patiently and systematically in the way that George R. R. Martin had attempted to do in A Feast for Crows, and what he will do in A Dance With Dragons (which logically must be as similarly paced as A Feast for Crows, despite what some action-junkies are praying for)<br /><br />It boils down to this:  If you can enjoy books that don't have epic sequences and gut-wrenching twists at the end of every chapter, and if you are a reader who can adapt to new characters with ease, and if you just flat out like George R. R. Martin's writing, then you should enjoy A Feast for Crows as much as I did.

B0018QQQK8|2.0|That's really all I can say about it, meh. Like others have said, it's predictable and cliche to the point of being unbelievable. It's the first book by this guy I've read and I broke a years-long Nicholas Sparks boycott to do it (based on the awful experience of watching The Notebook). Anyhoo, I gave it a shot because it sounded like an interesting story. It was, I guess, or rather it could have been. But it seemed like he glossed over the potentially interesting parts to focus on lame details that made the story seem superficial.    I gave it two stars instead of one because it did keep me reading. I wanted to know where it was going. I wasn't impressed once I got there, but I was engaged enough to want to keep reading.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|As a history buff, I've always been interested in North Korea and the people who live there. I've seen documentary after documentary on North Korea, it's leaders, and their thoughts on America and how other countries live life. So when hearing that this book was written by someone who interviewed real North Korean defectors - I had to read it.     I bought the book from the Kindle store on a Sunday afternoon. I was done reading the book by early Tuesday morning (3am, mind you because I work during the day); I just couldn't put the book down. From reading about the characters who leave loved ones in search of a new life to viewing the satellite photo of North Korea at night, compared to South Korea and China (North Korea is completely black at night, since they are not allowed to have electricity at night), this book brought out new facts from the citizens that are horrendous (starvation, forced labor, and family members who are left to die for the sake of their government leaders).     Definitely worth the read - just make sure that you have the time to spare!

0792839749|2.0|This full screen version ruins the entire movie. 2.20:1 was the intended aspect ratio and it has been cut short by 2/3 - so you're in essence loosing 66.6% of the movie!    This, amongst other reasons, is why the UK made Widescreen standard in 1999 - and since all television shows produced in the UK were produced in Widescreen 16:9. Due to the switch to Widescreen all DVD's were released in their intended aspect ratio, in this case 2.20:1. Sure there was black bars on the top and bottom but that was because the 2.20:1 was too large to fit on a 16:9 display - and for Americans with their 4:3 displays letter boxing became an issue because most didn't like seeing the bars and would rather loose information rather than see the whole picture.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After waiting many years for the return of some of my favorite characters and a huge build up from HBO and the publishing company I was sorely disappointed.  What was supposed to be an epic fantasy for the ages became a mediocre fiction read to which I had to force myself to pay attention.  Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the book, some parts.  However, overall I found it a chore to get through and down right boring through many parts.  Bottom line I am a disappointed fan that expected much more after such a long prep time and a publishing cancellation a few years back.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I've been a fan of Satriani's for quite some time (beginning with the release of \\"Not of this Earth\\", his first and one of his best) and have heard most of his other work at one point or another. This can be both an advantage and disadvantage when listening to an artist's new material (it's difficult to resist the temptation to compare a new release with previous material and not experience it by how it stands on its own). I can tell you, that this release measures up by either criteria. The songwriting is excellent and diverse and the playing top notch. I would count this as one of Joe's best releases to date (some have been better than others). If you're a fan of instrumental rock guitar, and Joe in particular, this would make a good addition to your collection.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Another 'must have' would have to be his 33 1/3 album. Another collection of terrific songs. Plus the tone of the album is more upbeat than ATMP. I always get the feeling people don't know about it for some reason.
1416550534|4.0|My second favorite Kate Morton novel. The characters in this novel are portrayed so vividly, you will really dislike some of them. It really gives a facinating look at the whole  upstairs/ downstairs relationships between the staff and employers, as well as the social morays of the day.  It covers a rapidily changing time in history.  Morton writes in such descriptive detail you can imagine all the surroundings. I loved it.

B004Q8FTE4|4.0|Overall, this is a pretty good box set.  It comes in a very sturdy box, and it includes his most worthwhile material.  Yes, there is no \\"Music From The Body\\" or \\"The Wall in Berlin\\", or even the \\"Leaving Beirut/To Kill the Child\\" EP or the \\"Flickering Flame\\" compilation, so it's not complete in any respect.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it has been remastered or not, although the \\"Pros and Cons\\" and \\"KAOS\\" discs do look different.  And I agree with one of the other reviewers about hearing some things I didn't hear before, so there is a good possibility that these two discs were remastered.<br /><br />I'd give this box set 5 stars if it just had a couple more things.  First, it has no lyrics whatsoever.  Roger Waters is a great lyricist.  His lyrics cover the box set, yet they didn't want to print them in the booklet?  Why?  I don't think a few more pages in the booklet to include lyrics would have been a lot of trouble.<br /><br />Next, the CD's are designed like mini-LP's, but don't include any inserts at all.  Basically, it is just a disc inside a cardboard jacket.  It seems as though it will get scratched very easily.  Check out \\"Oh By The Way\\" for a good example of how to do \\"mini LP's\\" properly.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM! It's damn good! Eminem continues to prove his dominance in the rap game, while Royce finally gets the recognition he deserves. There's no doubt about it that these two MC's were made to rap together. 50 Cent could only dream of having this much magic with Eminem. This album is fire, give it a honest listen! I'm still hearing new things or piecing together in-depth metaphors I didn't get the first few times through, and I love it.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br />Welcome to hell<br />Fast Lane<br />Above the Law<br />I'm on Everything<br />A Kiss<br />Take From Me<br /><br />Shady = GOAT<br />Word.

0307279189|5.0|Born to Run by Christopher McDougall is fun, energetic and will certainly make you question almost everything you thought you knew about running. The frame of the story is based around a hidden Mexican tribe living in the Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyons) in the southwestern Mexican state of Chihuahua. The tribe is extremely isolationist and also one of the few remaining indigenous peoples who happen to be exceptional athletic runners. This is apparently due to their earthly living habits and hunting needs. Per the title, the book makes the case for why the skill of running might be a part of our human genetic makeup, and it's a convincing argument.<br /><br />Born to Run is also a lengthy primer on the sport of ultra-running, which is running distances longer than a marathon. Sometimes it's competitive and often the total mileage is between fifty and a hundred miles. I've never heard of this kind of running, and I still can't imagine anyone running that far.<br /><br />If you enjoy running at any level, then this book is for you. It's a love letter to an activity that many approach as a kind of spiritual communion with being alive.

0199560358|3.0|Since it is a classic adventure story, Treasure Island was on my \\"must read\\" list. I don't regret reading it, but I know it will be a long time before I read it again.  While the story was good, the writing was uneven. In the beginning there is a lot of detail (almost too much at times) but yet by the end the story feels rushed. The amount of detail early on made it drag at times, but the lack of detail towards the end made the ending feel abrupt. It felt as if Stevenson had spent so much time on the beginning, that by the time he got to the end he just wanted to be finished with it.  That said, I still think it is a book people should read once. Like with most classics there are lessons to be learned from this book.  Prioritize it on your reading list accordingly.
0553801473|2.0|I started reading this series several years ago and really enjoyed it; I spend most of my time reading Non-fiction but occasionally take a break and read a fantasy series, helps to keep me sane. I looked forward to reading Dance with Dragons because I really like Martin's style, I like that no one is safe, there are many times I wished Frodo would have went the way of some of the characters in A Game of Thrones.  I have to tell you I think Martin missed the boat on a Dance with Dragons. I stopped caring for many of the characters and quite frankly the entire story line. It seems Martin may believe all of the lavish praise that is being heaped upon him by fans and reviewers, Danna Jennings in her NYT review states \\"but that doesn't make Mr. Martin the American Tolkien, as some would have it. He's much better than that.\\" With this type of praise why wouldn't Martin turn out as must material as he can. Why? There big money to be made. Just look at what the Tolkien franchise brought in, peanuts compared to what Martin may make.<br />So here is a suggestion to Mr. Martin, please re-read the first 4 books in A Song of Ice and Fire, maybe it will help rekindle the fire in your belly, because after reading Dance with Dragons, I had the impression its now all about the money. Will I read the next book. Sure will, remember it helps to keep me sane.

0470901071|4.0|To begin, before beginning to study for the CCNA I did not have any exposure to Cisco routers or switches. My studying consisted of Odom's 2 (very large) books, this one, a book of labs, and CBT Nuggets videos. I failed the first time I took the exam and passed the second.<br /><br />My method of study the first time around was to watch the videos at a relaxed pace (usually while doing something else) and mainly focused on the books for the key information. I read through the official Cisco books first then Lammle's. I felt that the Cisco books were overly descriptive and focused much more on the theory rather than the practical issues that a CCNA would have to work with. I was delighted to read through Lammle's book and felt that it helped summarize a lot of what Odom's books were saying in a much more concise way. At the same time, I reinforced what I learned by doing labs from the book that I purchased that pertained to the topics of the chapters that I was reading. I found that the practice questions and labs that Lammle included not to be challenging enough. Also, the included practice exam on the CD was completely worthless as preparation for the real CCNA exam. The exam included in Odom's book was much more similar to the actual exam.<br /><br />After failing the first time, I re-read Odom's book and completely avoided Lammle's. I noticed that the second time around I appreciated his overly descriptive nature a lot more as I had more to relate it to. Although Lammle's book is probably a great refresher for someone looking to re-certify, I would not recommend *solely* relying on it for first time CCNAers. I am writing this for anyone in my situation that is trying to decide between these two highly recommended books. Perhaps in retrospect it would have been a better idea to read Lammle's book first to get a nice overview (although not an exhaustive one) of what is required for the CCNA exam and then read through Odom's. This way you would gain a better appreciation for his expansiveness and understand the matter much more thoroughly. I would also recommend spending a lot of time going through the Boson exams that are in the official guide to get used to the format on the actual exam.pansiveness and understand the matter much more thoroughly. I would also recommend spending a lot of time going through the Boson exams that are in the official guide to get used to the format on the actual exam.
6304696515|5.0|This highly-acclaimed Oscar winning film is set in pre-revolutionary France with its costumes, manners, and mind-set of the time, especially the way the French thought about male and female sexuality. A man, they felt, is an aggressor and predator, unable to settle down with a single woman. He enjoys having sex, especially if he can seduce a reluctant woman into submitting to him. Women, they were convinced, are passive, easily seduced, unable to enjoy having sex but enjoying giving it.<br /><br /> A man and a woman, mischievously played by John Malkovich and Glenn Close, enjoy sex with each other but want to enjoy seeing two women seduced. There is a sexual feeling in this, but also a feeling of control and taking revenge. Both women are beautiful. One is a young virgin who is engaged to a count. Wouldn't it be fun to see the face of the count when he discovers that his virgin is not so! Also, think about the revenge we will inflict upon her mother! The other is a more mature wife of a currently absent husband, a very religious woman. Wouldn't it be fun to seduce a religious woman away from her husband and her religion, all that she holds dear!<br /><br /> Many viewers will enjoy seeing the somewhat unusual way that the conniving pair go about the seductions. There is lots of humor in their acts and in the reactions of the two seduces. However, it must be recalled that the events could not happen in today's culture as they do in the film.

I don't understand the reviews that say the book is creepy or that it scared them as a child because my brother and I found this book very fun to listen to as kids and as grown-ups, we are still very touched by it.

031603441X|5.0|Pages and pages of fun. I was not a big Rolling Stones fan in the day--too harsh, too nihilistic--and I would not have expected to like Keith Richards, probably the baddest of the bad boys.     But you can't help liking him, this in spite of all those dissolute years, the unimaginable amounts of money flowing everywhere, the tax evasion, all those homes, all those women, all those hard drugs! The risks taken, the children subjected to so much craziness. He threw a knife at someone for making a disparaging remark about the band; he claims to have used a gun during tetchy drug transactions. But, Keith turns out to be funny and smart and loyal, and he can write like an angel. Inside the bad boy is a kind heart--sort of--someone who sees the sweetness in other people, even other rock stars.    It shouldn't come as a surprise that he can write, since he is a song writer. The descriptions of his collaboration with Mick Jagger are reason enough to read the book; and he also collaborates with many other musicians famous and not. You come to see the songwriting as a kind of magic, although of course it's about the relationship that's greater than the sum of its parts. Keith sometimes refers to songs as writing themselves, or performances as just magically coming together, and you can feel it as  you read.    Open to any page. Here is Keith on page 277:   \\"What is it that makes you want to write songs? In a way you want to stretch yourself into other people's hearts. You want to plant yourself there, or at least get a resonance, where other people become a bigger instrument than the one you're playing. It becomes almost an obsession to touch other people. To write a song that is remembered and taken to heart is a connection, a touching of bases. Sometimes I think songwriting is about tightening the heartstrings as much as possible without bringing on a heart attack.\\"    The book chronicles the decades of the Rolling Stones' history, and along the way Keith runs into--collaborates with--everybody: Muddy Waters, Roy Orbison, John Lennon, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, on and on. It's been said that the book answers every question you could think to ask about the Stones, but it's even better than that: it's nonstop adventure written in the liveliest prose imaginable, mostly very funny, sometimes touchingly sad. Given the volume of hard drugs and alcohol Keith Richards consumed over his life, he's indestructible; and we're the luckier for it.

B004TTZHBK|4.0|So far works great on EVO 3D was skeptical after reading reviews but so far so good. Glad I tried it going to cook some salmon this weekend. Thanks Jamie probably would have given it 5stars except for the additional 80mb download.

0553801473|4.0|Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  This is not a bad book.  This is not a book where nothing happens.  While there is alot of character movement in the story, that character movement is married with character development.<br /><br />Minor possible spoilers in following paragraph.<br /><br />Tell me Tyrion didn't develop throughout his journey.  He could not make it to his destination in his state of mind from the end of the third book and be of any use to anyone.  He's gotten to see the world from many different perspectives because of the journey he took in this book, and that's significant.  Tell me Bran's story in this book didn't go somewhere.  He spent a book+ just travelling and finally in DWD he's reached a goal.  Not everyone may like what the goal actually was, but it's showed us quite a bit about the mythology. Varys considering he's practically not even mentioned in the book is significantly fleshed out in DWD.  Finally he is starting to make sense as a character.  Jorah, Tyrion, Jon, Barristan, Theon, Dany... all went through some journey of self discovery that strengthens their character. Their actions later on will be more meaningful because we witnessed the events of this book rather than them flashing back to these events.  We lived it with them, which ultimately makes us feel closer to these characters.<br /><br />End minor spoilers.<br /><br />The negative reviews can be summed up in this way.  People care deeply about the story.  People want to make sure that story is finished in their life time.  People get frustrated when it takes 5/6 years for the next installment to come out, and that installment is primarily focused on character development instead of giving closure to plot lines.  If GRRM released a book a year I doubt you'd see some of these negative reviews.  It's the waiting that frustrates people.<br /><br />It is a book that slows down to live in it's fiction for a while, and that's not a bad thing IMO.  I gave it 4 starsbecause it is a \\"middle\\" book, but it's a very necessary part of a really amazing story.  I never felt that reading this book was a waste of time.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|The app is very polished, well thought out, and extremely easy to use.

0307595862|3.0|I am absolutely hooked on Jo Nesbo and his Harry Hole. Read The Redbreast, Nemesis and Devil's Star then skipped to the audio version of The Snowman. It was a bloody good, gripping thriller up to the Big Finish (in which The Snowman's evil-doing is a direct affront to Harry). Think about it. Could it be possible? If so, how did the killer create the set-up? Too many holes here (that are not Harry). But worth reading anyway.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|Despite what I thought about the movie itself, one thing Tron: Legacy definitely had going for it was the soundtrack. Every review for the movie praised the soundtrack by Daft Punk, and once I finally watched it, I was in the same boat. Chances are, if you're on this page reading through reviews, you either already know how good it is, or are curious about the hype. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack has a lot more music on it than I expected, doesn't cost much, and is one of those soundtracks I know I'll be listening to for months, maybe even years, to come. There are only two minor complaints I have with it, one of which is covered in a spotlight review extensively, and that's the fact that this isn't the whole soundtrack. If you want everything, you'll either have to import the two cd set, or get this version from Amazon and hunt for the additional tracks.    What is there to be said about this soundtrack that hasn't been said already? Daft Punk did an incredible job making modern electronic music that has a heavy 80s sound without being outdated, as well as making some nice semi-classical pieces. A few tracks on here reminded me of music from the first Terminator movie, and that was a pleasant surprise. The two standout tracks here are Derezzed and End of Line (that's the one that actually made me want the soundtrack once I heard it in the movie), but my other personal favorites are:    -The Son of Flynn  -Rinzler  -The Game Has Changed  -Fall  -Solar Sailer  -Flynn Lives  -TRON Legacy (End Titles)    As for my other complaint, it's that a good number of tracks on here borrow from eachother a little too much. Fall is reused in C.L.U., and the main theme is used quite a few times, to the point where I had to look at my iPod to make sure I hadn't accidentally set anything to repeat or random. Luckily, the music that's reused isn't bad, so I can deal with it, but others might not feel the same.    If you haven't heard the music in the movie yet, go give a few of the tracksmentioned a listen and see if you like it. If you have seen the movie and are still on the fence, what are you waiting for?
0425241505|5.0|5 Star Review    The Plot:    In general, most people who value their lives don't steal from a dragon as old as our Solar System but Pia Giovanni is not most people. Blackmailed by her scumbag ex-boyfriend and aided by powerful tracking magic, Pia locates the hoard of wyrkinds' feared leader, Dragos Cuelebre, and steals from him a mere penny that nevertheless ignites the wrath of the most powerful of all Elder Races. On the run from the now very angry Dragos, Pia doesn't get far before she's captured and enthralled by the most sensually dangerous creature on the planet.    As a being who can either command with his voice or apply the force of his might to grant his every wish, Dragos has found little inspiration over the last several revolving centuries. But when he catches the enigmatic scent of his thief, he becomes engulfed by emotions ranging from rage to desperation. With an overwhelming need to possess leading his charge, Dragos tracks his prey and finds the most beautiful of creatures that baffles his all encompassing knowledge of wyrkind. A half-breed, Pia's strange but scintillating scent calls to every one of his protection instincts along with the dominating urge to possess her with a reverberating mantra of mine. Managing to keep her true wyr identity a secret behind a network of powerfully strong protection spells, Dragos is intrigued by both her courage and her vulnerability. From the moment he touches his beautiful Pia, every one of his decisions hence forth revolves around her with a driving compulsion that she manages to both inflame and enrage.    Seized by an emotional turmoil where stark fear wages war with combustible desire, Pia constantly shifts between the instinct to fight or flee. Confused by Dragos and his gruff alien responses that are completely counter to his gentle handling, Pia hungers desperately for the tantalizing safety his strong arms promise while simultaneously repulsed by his overwhelming dominance. But Pia has little time toreconcile her feelings before both she and Dragos are captured by Goblins and the Dark Fae King who would love nothing more than to see Dragos killed. Plagued by inconvenient sexual thoughts where her luscious dragon is concerned, Pia unveils her guarded secrets when the all too often life or death situation arises. But nothing is more frightening than her burgeoning feelings for a dragon who by his own proclamation doesn't know what love is. Will Pia become a mere trinket in Dragos's hoard, something to be kept in a gilded cage, or does he have the emotional capacity to let her soar the vast skies along side him?    The Heroine:    Pia Giovanni has long known that her survival relies solely on her ability to maintain her complete anonymity. Taught since birth how to guard her true self, how to run and disappear, Pia has known nothing except a driving need for secrecy but loneliness can turn even the strongest weak. Unveiling some of her secrets to her ex-boyfriend, Pia is soon paying harshly for the love her misguided heart once felt for a man who's parting gift was betrayal. Now on the run for her life, Pia utilizes all the survival tricks in her arsenal but her skills are rusty after first being suppressed by loneliness and then lured into relaxation by love.    Incredibly strong amidst the most deadly and dire of situations, Pia's emotional crumbling manifests during moments when she's allowed to process the sheer enormity of the life altering changes that have taken place in a relatively small amount of time. Dragos is such an overwhelming presence that Pia is often left scrambling for purchase and trying to assimilate herself with the life her thievery has wrought her. Yet despite her fear and confusion, Pia finds herself gravitating instinctively towards Dragos's strong embrace and his genuine but often misguided approaches to comforting her offer a thrilling peace. While awakening within her a powerfully sensual woman, freedom is still relative for Pia as she continues to fight against her desire to entrust Dragos with all her secrets. She'll not be able to give her heart totally until all the boundaries have been tested and the dragon that demands her soul reciprocates with his own.    The Hero:    An ancient being who's amber eyes reflect the hefty burden of unimaginable time, Dragos Cuelebre is a surly enigma to a select few and a dangerous enemy to all others. Enraged to the killing edge by the first thief to ever succeed in stealing from his hoard, no one is more surprised than Dragos when he finds himself willingly captivated by the mysterious female half-breed wyr that his thief ultimately proves to be.    Faced with Pia's fear of being trapped, Dragos learns with no small amount of mistakes, how to protect Pia without smothering her. This is a new found concept for a dragon who hoards his treasures with the constricting might of his powerful grip. And while Pia is slow to reveal her secrets, Dragos will never stop fighting to win her heart or her trust for there is one thing Dragos is certain of, Pia Giovanni is his to keep and keep her he shall.    My Final Thoughts:    Undoutedly catapulting its heretofore unknown author into the superstar strasophere, DRAGON BOUND is stunningly bold, sharply witty and a blazing hot action packed thrill ride that never forgets its central core of romance. Ultra alpha and ultra hot, Dragos is every bit the hero that romance readers are clamoring to get their grips on. Paired with a fiesty and intelligent heroine, Harrison treats readers with the fully three dimensional characters we deserve.     DRAGON BOUND, dear readers, is why we profess our love for paranormal romance. Enjoy!
1451629184|4.0|There's no doubt that writing this book was cathartic for Jaycee.  Part of the reason I bought it was because she deserves the profits from it--a small enough payback.  It's an amazing story of resilience and horrors that no one should have to endure.  It's truly remarkable that she came through the 18 years at all after reading her story.  That said, the book is poorly written.  It's unorganized and rambling.  After I started it, I paused to check to see who the publisher was and was shocked to see Simon and Schuster.  Someone surely let the editing slide through on this book, it feels like a journal written by an 11 year old.  Nevertheless the story speaks for itself and is a testament to her strength.  Her mother did an incredible job at instilling values and strength in Jaycee in the short 11 years that she raised her before she was kidnapped.  Reading this book will give anyone an uplifting feeling at the indomitable spirit of the human condition.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I bought and read this book last night in a couple of hours. I have read most of the book marketing titles on the market today and I can say Locke's approach is solid and offers a fresh angle. I found his advice on blogging and twitter very helpful, especially his take on blogging. This really clicked with me because it makes a lot of sense. For example, you've probably heard that you should blog at least twice or once a week. Well, Locke's says you shouldn't blog more than once a month (he explains why) and he also explains in detail how to make your blog posts successful and reach your target audience. His writing style is engaging and there's a lot of positive energy and enthusiasm in his prose, as well as common sense and practicality. This book has prompted me to check out his novels. If you're an author wanting to increase your book sales (and who isn't?), I advice you to pick up a copy of this book PRONTO!
B000067FP8|4.0|I enjoy this creepy comdedy, but it doesn't live up to the first one. Gizmo looks different, the storyline cheesy, and the villains silly rather than the suspensefully scary Stripe from Gremlins. However, I loved watching the VHS of Gremlins II as a child, and I have been searching for this movie for years. For that, I'm happy I was able to find it on Amazon and complete my collection of Gremlins. I enjoy watching it, even if only for the nostalgia.

0763644765|5.0|I looked at about 7 kids books in the book store about learning to go on the potty. I got this one (and only this one actually) because it's really simple and straightforward as well as being cute and light-hearted. I love that it shows how the cat and dog go potty because we have pets and that has really resonated with my toddler. The page with the parents being so joyful and all the different undies is really funny. I think this book is probably best for younger toddlers- 30 months and under.
0440241901|1.0|There were two things that attracted me to reading this novel. First, I had become a fan of Sophie Kinsella due her Shopaholic novels (although I wasn't particularly keen on the Shopaholic ties the Knot). And second, I was very curious to see how the author would deliver another novel without a Becky Bloomwood heroine. Would this new protagonist `Emma Corrigan' become just as endearing as Becky?<br />Unfortunately, no, she does not. Emma turns ut to be very annoying and absolutely pathetic compared to Becky. She has no charisma, no wit, and I certainly was not laughing at her antics. Rather, I felt dismay at the character's lack of common sense and self-confidence! I did not care for her at all! How could I? Here's a girl who continually allows herself to be bullied by everyone - her boss, her older cousin, her cousin-in-law, and her parents! And by the end of the story, instead of finally standing up for herself, her boss `Jack' (the CEO who knows all her secrets) is the one who ends up defending her and making everyone feel sorry for what they have done to Emma! Uh, obviously he will command attention since he is portrayed to be a very wealthy and powerful man. His act of a `knight and shining armor' is not at all charming.<br />Obviously, I do not like Jack's character. I cannot possibly think of a girl that can be swooned by him. He is weak and uninteresting compared to Luke Brandon (the lead male in Shopaholics). It is very difficult to like, much less respect Jack when he ends up blabbing all of Emma's secrets on national television. WHAT???!!! A CEO that does that? A self-made multi-millionaire gossips away in a serious business program?!!!?? Just when I was hoping the author would give me a shocker or twist to make this story interesting, like answers to how Jack could possible excuse himself out of this one and win Emma back, Ms. Kinsella disappoints me with Jack telling Emma that the reason he blabbed all her secrets on the Telly was because she was always on his mind. WHAT?!!! Is that even a reason? What kind of hogwash is that? The most horrible thing is that Emma bought it! Stock and Barrel, she bought it and took him back!  OH MY GOSH! I wanted to stop reading right there! I really did, but there was a chapter left, so I had a flicker of hope that perhaps the final pages would turn this book around!<br />I was wrong. It was boring, predictable, and a total waste of time til the end. So far I'll limit my admiration of Ms. Kinsella's works to her Shopaholic novels and do her a huge favor by keeping this novel a secret from everyone! No one will want to know about it!mind. WHAT?!!!

B000P0J0A6|5.0|Gremlins is a classic! Gizmo, his songs, and the quirky \\"how to keep a mogwai from becoming an evil terror\\" rules have been nostalgic memories and the brunt of many satires for as long as I can remember. This movie keeps the suspense while sprinkling comic relief of the mischievous mythical Gremlins throughout. I especially enjoy the use of puppetry rather than the CG dominated images today.

1416955070|5.0|The City of Bones, the first book, begins with  various explanations of what a Shadowhunter, Downworlders (Vampires, Werewolves, Warlocks, and Faeries), Demons, and Mundanes are. It explains the background of the protagonist, Clary Fray, as well as the other lead characters of the story. Pretty much half of the book is spent on setting the series' foundation. By the time this is established, the action scenes get as intense as the love triangle that occurs between the Clary, her best friend Simon, and Shadow Hunter Jace.<br /><br />It's quite interesting to note that the author shifts the narration between the characters. In the early chapters you will hear from Clary's perspective. Then she will switch to Jace's, and then Simon's. Though this may appear inconsistent, I did not see this as a problem in her writing style. I do appreciate that once in awhile I can see the story from another character's impression. Towards the end the author delivers the inevitable shocker that gave clues throughout the book - Clary and Jace are long-lost siblings. The reader will either be torn or hope that Simon has a chance at a love he's invested in for almost a decade. And things begin to be a lot more interesting that one cannot wait to read Book Two.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. I primarily ordered this book because I wanted to better understand her story and what factors causing her kidnapping to remain a well kept secret for 18 years prisoner for 18 years. The book does that and more, throughout the whole book, I wanted her to be free, I kept on waiting for something to happen, someone to save her even though I knew the outcome. Its powerful stuff. the ending of the book is uplifting, she is quite remarkable.

0547258305|5.0|The moment I started reading Graceling it was very difficult to stop. Kristin Cashore immediately captures the reader's attention with an action scene of Katsa's rescue of a Lienid prince. Interesting, in the same chapter she meets Prince Po, a mysterious, yet alluring, stranger to Katsa, whom she immediately feels a certain magnetism. From then on each page was filled with action sequences that describe Katsa's Grace, which I found rather fascinating and unique.<br /><br />Whereas one can assume a person born with Grace is highly regarded, this is not the case with environment of Katsa's upbringing. Among the seven kingdoms, only one considered the Graced with respect and admiration. The others look down upon it as a minion for the Kings to command. Because of this perception among the Gracelings, the author reveals moments in Katsa's actions and thoughts how this protagonist developed a character of fear, scorn, insecurity, and mistrust over anyone she meets, except for her cousin, her hand maiden, and the King's chief of security. The novel is centered on a story of  Katsa's struggle to overcome all these inner demons, accept her gift without admonition, and gain ultimate freedom  to decide in her own terms how to use her Grace.<br /><br />However, there are shortcomings in the story, particularly towards the final chapters, that can leave a reader feeling rather baffled. The antagonist King Leck lacks further characterization and narration. His introduction in middle of the story is intriguing and captivates the audience with success. What a perfect enemy whom even Katsa and Prince Po fears. However, the author falls short of explaining King Leck's history and the reason for his treachery. Is the legend of his past true? Where did he come from? Why does he torture children and animals? Why does it appear Bitterblue, his only child can block his evil Grace, when she is in fact not a Graceling? There are so many questions surrounding this character that were left unanswered. However, I read in Ms. Cashore's website that the novels, Fire, and Bitterblue (prequel and sequel to Graceling) will answer the mystery surrounding King Leck.<br /><br />With regards to the tragedy that happened to Prince Po, one might wonder if this was necessary. I have mixed feelings about this as well, however, I do understand that his doleful fate could be the character's catharsis, wherein Prince Po also begins to accept and fully utilize the power of his Grace. Furthermore, this is a showing of a true unconditional love between the prince and the heroine.<br /><br />For those who love young adult fantasy I am positive you will like Graceling.

1416972250|5.0|I slowed down my reading with the City of Glass. I knew its 500+ pages would end the series I had grown to love. It is fascinating how Cassandra Clare would create subtle hints from the first book and then tie loose ends by explaining what they mean this final book. For example, in the City of Bones, Clary draws a mysterious dark-haired Prince riding a horse, and she is baffled why she does so when she has never met this person before. And clearly this Prince is neither Jace nor Simon. Then in the City of Glass, Clary immediately recognizes Sebastian as the subject of her previous artwork, thereby bringing the reader to recollect this particular detail from the first book.<br /><br />Clearly the City of Glass is the culmination of all the best qualities of the first two books as the author bring more action, adventure, sadness, and even terror. The protagonists are hurt immensely, and not just physically but emotionally as well. And in the end, you'll hold your breath to see what finally happens to Clary, Jace, Simon, and Sebastian, and hopefully smile that it went the way that you wanted it to be. It did for me, but it was a happy ever after that was not easy to acquire nor will it be forgotten with the pain, suffering, and loss that all the characters faced.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|After Sixth Sense M. Night Shyamalan became known for making movies that were unintentional comedies.  Face-plant after face-plant he went down, floor by floor, and finally persevered, picking himself up off the floor pushing a button to bring him back up to the penthouse where a new script awaits.<br /><br />The plot and setting is incredibly simple: An elevator with five passengers gets stuck between floors.  One of the passengers is the devil.  Guess who it is.<br /><br />The execution of this movie is nearly flawless.  When lights flicker, danger is present.  Death will almost certainly ensure.  Figuring out who is responsible for the deaths is what makes the movie interesting.  With each guess the viewer must contradict preconceived notions and attempts to rationalize why someone is or is not the killer.  Anyone who says they watched this movie and figured it all out without the red herrings and strawmen causing doubt is lying.  A detective is introduced to help expedite the investigation.  Aimless at first, he begins to piece together details about each of the elevator's occupants.  His journey serves as both enlightenment during dark and distraction during light.  The fear from each of the passengers relates to the basic claustrophobia we all have, but, more importantly, intermittently takes away two of the passengers' senses (sight & speech).  With each minute they are stuck, the passengers' terror get increasingly more palpable until they're tighter than a snare drum.  Squeezing coal into diamonds.<br /><br />Through director John Dowdle's deft touch, Devil takes viewers on a thrilling and twisting mental discovery.  A journey in which first and second thoughts are questioned.  A classic who'dunit where perception distorts reality like funhouse mirrors.  Aside from an anticlimactic ending (an trademark of M. Night's writing), this is how psychological thrillers are supposed to be done.

044024238X|1.0|I like the title `The Undomestic Goddess'. It's pretty witty and charming. I also thought some of the antics and expressions of the heroine, Samantha Sweeting, is rather funny.<br />But moving on to the story, the essence of the novel, the....okay, okay, I do believe I'm stalling. Fine. I'll go ahead and say it.<br />I didn't like the book. It was horrible. I barely choked finishing it.<br />Oh no! What is happening to one of my favorite Chick Lit authors? Should Ms. Kinsella really just stick to Shopaholic and her Becky Bloomwood? From my assessment of this novel, I should think so!<br />The problem with this novel is that the story was not well developed. We start of with a good character who is a young and successful workaholic lawyer. She makes the gravest mistake of her career and is fired from her job (this part of the novel was going good so far. The reader does wonder, \\"Okay, so what will happen to her now?\\"). But then she flees into the country and becomes a domestic. WHAT????!!! Yes, that's right. She becomes a maid to a very rich English couple who can't really tell that their new maid cannot really cook, clean, or do any house chores. Okay....so why should the reader continue reading this book? It's obviously going to be a waste of time.<br />Sadly, I testify that it does.<br />The predictable ending: Samantha Sweeting finally learns how to enjoy and live life to the fullest.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Nic Cage \\"stars\\" alongside his hair - bronze medal for most ridiculous movie hair behind David Spade as Joe Dirt and...Nic Cage in Con Air - Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore in a movie that was better the first time when it was called D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and the third time when it was called Source Code.  Essentially it's another Groundhog Day paradox movie, but in the future, where someone alters the current timeline through some sort of time travel mumbo jumbo.  That sci-fi vehicle is driven by the FBI's desperate hope to stop random European terrorists from detonating a nuke in LA.  As if anyone would notice.  Agent Ferris (Moore) leads the effort by pursuing Frank Cadillac (Cage), a cheesy Las Vegas magician who just happens to have the ability to see two minutes into the future.<br /><br />The filming has some really slick scenes, and the manner in which the filmmakers utilize Cadillac's talent is truly creative.  Nothing worse than a lack of imagination.  Right, Green Lantern?  Adding in Jessica Biel surely doesn't hurt.<br /><br />Fairly unoriginal, but aside from inconsistencies that are inherent in all sci-fi movies like this one, everything is done very well.

Just when you thought it was a use of the bridal expressiong 'something borrowed, something blue...', what it stands for is an introduction of Darcy's story as a soon-to-be single parent!) is narrated by Darcy, and therefore you get to see her perspective on what happened with the Rachel-Dex-Darcy-Marcus saga.<br /><br />Just when I had cast Darcy Rhone as the completely narcisstic and manipulating friend to have (a judgement I based on the first book), I find out that she, in fact, is a victim of her environment and her upbringing. She is born beautiful and she is treated 'special' all throughout her life. She has thus morphed into a completely jaded person, whose sole basis for happiness are all things material. Her statement summarizes this, \\"...I understoond that at a tender age of three that with beauty comes with perks and power.\\"<br /><br />But even if Darcy does relish the advantages that comes with her looks, she also can't help but feel insecure next to her bestfriend Rachel, the brainy girl with the average looks. This is dangerous because both friends would then nurture a  hidden competition with each other, which would eventually would culminate in the deterioration, and then eventual loss of the friendship.The readers are then challenged...how can you forgive betrayal?<br /><br />Darcy couldn't have put it any better when she said, \\"It suddenly occurred to me that no matter when his affair with Rachel had begun, she hadn't been the cause of our breakup. Dex and I had split because we weren't right for each other, and because of that fact, he had been able to fall in love with her. Had we been on solid ground, Dex wouldn't have cheated on me. The realization was somehow freeing, and it enabled me to let go of another sliver of resentment toward both of them.\\" That ephiphany on Darcy's part says a lot.<br /><br />Darcy, by the end of the novel, becomes a heroine. She realized her mistakes, she owned up to them, and she courageously changed for the better. In other words, she took the readers in an engaging ride to maturity and ended up to be someone a person can truly admire.freeing, and it enabled me to let go of another sliver of resentment toward both of them.\\" That ephiphany on Darcy's part says a lot.

0553801473|3.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book, and I did. Most of the enjoyment I got from it was waiting in anticipation as I read it. Ie \\"Whats going to happen when character x finally gets to character y?\\" Or \\"How is this going to playout when character 1 finally does what has been hinted at for the last 3000pages of the previous books??\\"<br /><br />Well without trying to spoil anything let me just say that,,,,, everything all the readers are hoping and wishing for the characters does NOT  happen.<br /><br />Yes there are a few surprizing moments but I dont feel that makes up for the lack of forward progress on the plot.
0440244870|5.0|I love it!<br />I heard of this book years ago, but I was never that curious enough to read it, until now. I always wondered how the author would narrate a story that has all the qualities I like in a `chic lit' - witty, humorous, and very modern, and yet it will try to distinguish itself from the successful writing of another English author of the Bridget Jones' Diary series. Well, Sophie Kinsella delivered all that in a very funny narration of Becky Bloomwood's (aka Ms. Shopaholic) life as an un-interested financial journalist who takes the `art of shopping' to a whole new and dangerous level!<br />Truth be told, I'm also a shopaholic (but not to the full extent of Becky's problem), and I can relate to to Becky not being able to resist the temptations of sales and to succumb with absolutely ridiculous reasons, such as \\"Buying more stuff equals Credit Card Points equals Free Gift!, make sense, right?\\" I must have shared the same Buying Conscience as Ms. Bloomwood, but thankfully, I haven't gone too far as to get into such a huge debt! So you see, there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this story!<br />What I also enjoyed from the book, and that I find quite original, are the letters from the bank appearing in front of every other chapter. It's a creative way of keeping the reader in the `know' on the severity of Becky's financial standing with her creditors. Becky's response to this `harrassment', or, to use her own words, `stalking' of her creditors balloons to more trouble and more hilarious antics! But as the story progresses, we share in the triumph of Becky finding her strength and facing her problem with not only a dream job, but the dream guy! Lovely! Lovely! Lovely! I am now a fan of Ms. Kinsdale's writing. I guarantee to continue reading the Shopaholic series as I find Becky Bloomwood's character absolutely entertaining!<br />Favorite book phrase: \\"I think they should list shopping as a cardiovascular activity. My heart never beats as fast as it does when I see a 'reduced by 50%' sign.\\"reduced by 50%' sign.\\"

1595141979|5.0|When I first read the first three books of the Vampire Academy series approximately two and a half years ago I did not feel book withdrawals. Instead I experienced a disappointing anxiety that I would have to wait for the fourth book to find out what happens to Rose and Dmitri. When the fourth book came out, I had the pleasure of experiencing my first author event signing when Richelle Mead had a book tour in California and Books, Inc. in Palo Alto was one of her stops. It was incredible! I purchased two books for her to sign and I brought my previous three which she also gladly autographed! I could have succumb to my eagerness to  read the fourth book, but I did not want the same anxious feeling to come back.  I decided to wait for the fifth and final books to come out, and only then will I come back to the world of St. Vladimir's.<br /><br />Unfortunately it did take a couple of years. The friends I have introduced this series to were ahead of me, and bless them for not mentioning their impressions or stating any spoilers. On my part, it also took a lot of control to avoid Richelle Mead's website in case I might get a hint of what happens next. Even the books I preordered would immediately find its way in the corner shelf of my library where I kept my other favorite Young Adult novels. I hesitated to even glance at the covers or read the synopsis. But finally at the end of the year 2010, the sixth and final book of the Vampire Academy series was released on December 7.<br /><br />Because of the lapse in time, it was only fitting to begin the story again. I had to reacquaint myself with the characters, the surroundings, the plot, and build the momentum. Doing this did not disappoint.

1416972242|5.0|I distinctly remember reading the City of Ashes with intensity and concentration as if I was in a marathon. I was racing through pages during the action sequences and slowing down to catch my breath as Jace and Clary battle within themselves to refute a persistent love that emotionally tears their being. And while Simon is now the 'boyfriend', the feeling of an unrequited love also brings him sadness.<br /><br />It is also refreshing to see how the Downworlders' take a more active role in the story as Vampires, Warlocks, and Faeries help battle evil, thereby proving that even if they have the Demon's blood, the humanity in them reigns. Thus, good wins in the end.

He is transparent in telling tales on himself and his staff - what they did right and wrong.  The book is a refreshing and inspiring tale.

0061544493|5.0|Victoria Adams, fondly known as POSH, was my favorite among the Spice Girls. She appeared polished, cool and so stylish. When she married David Beckham, she immediately became a household name. The paparazzi adored and followed them everywhere! Late last year, when the media chronicled their assimilation to the USA. I watched `Victoria Beckham Coming to America'. I found her to be completely hilarious and self-deprecating that it was easy to be instantly enamored by her wit and engaging personality!<br /><br />Her book, \\"That Extra Half An Inch\\" deserves the same praise. Victoria writes the tips, tricks, and advice she knows in the area of fashion, accessories, make-up, parties, special events (i.e. Weddings), maternity attire, and pretty much every `beautification' process a girl goes through. Victoria first addresses her audience - IF they are not into these kinds of things, then the book is NOT for them. And rightly so, the book is made for an audience who does not take fashion all too seriously.<br /><br />Albeit lacking a fashion design background, Victoria knows fashion. She tells the reader her  interest stems from her Mum who taught her how to sew.  Her chapter on pants and jeans is very interesting. I pretty much agree with all the advice that she has given on how to wear this type of clothing.<br />A warning, however, Victoria wrote this book back in London (where it became a bestseller!), so a lot of the tips and sources are from that area. When Victoria talks about `High Street', it's a place in London where a lot of interesting fashion shops abound. It would be comparable to Los Angeles' Melrose and San Francisco's Haight, where  locales house a combination of fast forward trendy boutiques, vintage shops, and loads of bargain markets. Some of the stores Victoria mentions, fortunately, can be found in the US, like H&M and Zara. She also talks about loving the deals in Topshop so I am very anxious when this popular shopping haven will finally branch out here in the U.S.!

B001U0HAYS|1.0|Great movie but for $122.00 ???   I don't think so.  If it's out of print they shouldn't even list it when it's priced this high.  No one in their right mind would pay more than $20.00 for this film on any format!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I received this in the mail and was exited to get to use it to hold my android phone on top of my video camera as a teleprompter. but the top finger that is suppose to hold the phone was broken (not spring loaded) so it would not hold the phone tight. and it would just fall out. so I contacted the seller through amazon. they wrote me back asking for photo's of the product which I supplied to them. after going through all this they told me to contact amazon since it was fulfilled by them. (why did you waste my time if you wasnt going to help me) of course amazon says they cant replace it because it is sold by a third party. so here I am with a broken item and no one wants to take responsibility. VERY UNHAPPY with this seller and amazon.com. I have purchased hundreds of dollars worth of stuff this month alone, never a problem till now. makes me wonder about continuing any ordering on amazon. this is only a 12 buck item. what if it were a 140 buck tripod (hope I didnt just jinx the one im waiting on from amazon). just dont trust this seller or amazon anymore.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|I purchased this along with some helmet speakers at the advice of several amazon reviewers. They didn't help AT ALL. Thinking it was just the new earphones or maybe the rushing wind, I tried them in a quiet room with every pair of earphones in my house (four). I could only tell a difference with one of them (my highest quality headset) but it wasn't \\"louder\\", it was \\"slightly more static-y\\" sounding...    It LOOKS nice, it's easy to use, the price seemed reasonable, it's a much needed product (I think), but it just doesn't work!

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The conclusion to the Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\", is absolutely fabulous! This last act ties the first two books together so incredibly well with such an astounding ending. This is just an electrifying, explosive excursion taken through Lisbeth Salander's life. I will truly miss this character.<br /><br />In this last installment, Lisbeth will have to confront her horrific past; destroy the most notorious Soviet intelligence defector (her father); uncover the most heinous Swedish government crime syndicate; and just survive the overall tragic events that led us to the finale of this amazing story with, of course, the sustenance  and backing of Blomkvist.<br /><br />Spellbinding, exhilarating, captivating, enthralling, mesmerizing and gripping read...need I say more! Loved it! Brilliant story! Highly recommend!

0545259088|4.0|When my friend first suggested the Wolves of Mercy Falls series I thought, \\"oh god, not another cheesy werewolf story!\\" But after the first few chapters of Shiver, I was hooked and found the stories pleasurably different than any werewolf story I've read. After Shiver, I went on to reading Linger, and now, Forever.    plot: Time is ticking, as the Mercy Fall's wolf pack is being threatened yet again by Tom Culpepper.  Many old conflicts are solved, such as Sam and Grace's parents who aren't getting along, the discoveries yet to be found about the 'cure', and Beck and Sam's past.  Also, there are relationship struggles with both couples (Sam and Grace, and Cole and Isabel).  What will Sam as a human, and Grace as a wolf, do to stay together?  Will Cole and Isabel be able to see past their differences?  And the biggest question of all: What will happen in the future?     Maggie Stiefvater has a way of describing that takes you to a beautifully painted world. Stiefvater alternates between different characters' points of view, and portrays the characters personalities so well that you feel as if you've known them all.  My favorite descriptive segment from the story was when Sam says, \\"Overhead, the stars were wheeling and infinite, a complicated mobile made by giants.  They pulled me amongst them, into space and memories. Lying on my back reminded me of being attacked by the wolves, long ago, when I'd been someone else.  One moment i was alone, my morning and life strecthed out in front of me like frames in a film, each second only slightly different from the last.  A miracle of seamless, unnoticed metamorphosis.  And the next moment, there were the wolves.\\"  Stiefvator has the powerful writing of a seasoned author, when this is only her debut series.     The ending of Forever leaves you sighing in relief and slight frustration as it has a half-resolved ending.  What i really liked about the conclusion though, was its unpredictability.  The only reason I didn't give this story the five star rating was the fact that the book sort of just ends.  Not with a cliffhanger or happy ending. Despite this, it was an overall fantastic book and thrilling series.

I didn't find out about until 4 days after the return expiration date. He told me that when he received it the DVD set was not wrapped in 'shrink wrap' as a new DVD set should have been. To me this reflects on the reliabilty of Amazon. It's unfortunate and I'm not happy about it.[[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of Brothers]]
0316098337|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I won't go into a lot of detail-- over 1000 reviews and i don't think I have too much new to add. I will say that I disagree with many of the one star reviews but i can see how someone wouldn't buy jack as a narrator. But, I was more interested in his views of the world and trying to see him adjust to new situations as they arose.    And absolutely, the book gets points for being unique and not just the story of a guy and a girl. It's anything but mundane!
6302824613|2.0|I'm amazed that so many reviewers think this film is great.  I didn't even make it half-way through the film before I lost interest and turned it off.  This is the type of film one watches when one has nothing better to do.  When I am able, I will try to watch the entire film and try to give it a higher rating.
B002A4Q652|5.0|Being a firm and loyal Within Temptation fan, I was ecstatic to find the Martijn had founded his own band after having to leave WT to due illness. Lucidity was everything I had hoped it would be. April Rain is even better. There are absolutely no filler tracks, each song could stand alone as a single. Delain is in my top five symphonic metal bands, and that is saying something seeing as they've only released two albums. Charlotte's mezzo-soprano voice is beautiful and rich, and Marco Heitala (Nightwish) complements her perfectly. I only hope he is a permanent guest vocalist for future albums.<br /><br />Stand-out tracks (all of them really, but in particular): \\"April Rain,\\" \\"Stay Forever,\\" \\"Control the Storm,\\" \\"Go Away,\\" \\"Start Swimming,\\" \\"Lost,\\" \\"I'll Reach You,\\" \\"Nothing Left,\\" \\"Come Closer\\" (like I said, basically the entire album).

B004V7EXO2|4.0|I've found that most of Paul Simon's newer albums take their time wrapping their melodies around me. After several listens, the songs settle into place and feel at home. I'm still in the early stages with this newest album. There are some fun tracks and elegantly written lyrics, which are all staples of Paul Simon. I'm not sure this is his best work, but it certainly feels like Paul Simon.
B001TAJGO6|1.0|It's been few years since I've seen this movie and I'm still blown away to see such glowing reviews about it. I don't know if I'm just slow, retarded, or maybe I have an attention deficit disorder, but I was completely bored through the entire 1 hour and 49 minutes. I'm not going to go into utter detail about this movie, but basically this movie shows you the consequences of erasing a former loved one that you may of had a bad breakup with. It sure does sound intriguing enough on paper, but visually it isn't stimulating at all. This is something you'd want to read in a book (which maybe too long as well), but not sit through in the theater. There are movies that should be seen in a theater such as Titanic, Transformers, Avatar, X-Men, Matrix, and so on. Then there are movies that should have been left alone in a book and this one should have just been made into a book.<br /><br />I'm sorry if you are deeply offended that I could say such things, but I believe I justify my statement that there are things that are meant to be watched and then there are those that are meant to be read. I could have been more entertained mowing the lawn or raking leaves for those 1 hour and 49 minutes than watching this long and dragged out movie. This could have been easily been put in a 1 page article in a teen magazine stating how it is important to not cherish the good moments of your life, but also take in the bad. Basically what doesn't kill you makes you stronger or defines the person you are now. So to sit through that explanation for over an hour and a half is mind-numbingly boring.<br /><br />So if you are the type of person who states, \\"That movie was so deep to the core and real.\\" then perhaps this artsy fartsy movie is for you. I don't like seeing deeply involved movies. That doesn't mean I don't like smart movies such as Double Jeopardy or Thank You For Smoking as examples, but this has no entertainment value. If you thought this was entertaining then you must be one boring person. (Yeah, I said it.)<br /><br />[UPDATE]: I forgot to mention one thing in my review and that is look at the synopsis: \\"Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet lead an all-star cast in this COMICAL, romantic and poignant look at breakups, breakdowns and breakthroughs.\\" Also if you've purchased this as a blu-ray it states this on the box: \\"A smart, sexy and seriously funny comedy!\\" Serious!? That is why I went to see the movie because of what Jim Carrey was known for. Even when I read reviews on it Yahoo back then it stated COMEDY. You go into a movie theater expecting laughs, but instead you get depression.<br /><br />Lastly for all those glowing reviews and telling me how I don't know what I'm talking about then let's look at the numbers for gross earnings in the U.S. The movie's budget was 20 Million and it grossed 34 Million, that right there tells you it wasn't that great of a movie! X-men spent 75 million and made 157 million. What do these numbers mean? Let's see: 3.4 million people went to see Eternal Sunshine based on $10 per movie ticket. 15.7 million saw X-men. That's over 4 TIMES the people who went to see X-men then this crap. That means the people who went to see X-men came out and told their friends, \\"Hey you should see this movie!\\"<br /><br />So bash my review as much as you like and state how ignorant I am and I just don't get the movie. Oh I get the movie just fine and if it stated it was some dark depressing drama then I wouldn't have seen it in the first place, but unfortunately it marketed itself as some funny ha ha movie. Those dollars I've reported for this movie would have been significantly lower if the movie was marketed correctly because like those who hated this movie were probably expecting some humor and got this crap.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Lady GaGa continues her torrid domination of the music industry with her new album, Born This Way. Her trademark style and uniqueness shines through, with hits like \\"Born This Way,\\" \\"The Edge of Glory,\\" and \\"Government Hooker.\\" Although the album songs are solid and catchy, there seems to be a dropoff, not having that oomph and risk-taking that was present in her previous albums.<br /><br />Still a wonderful album, great for the car, working out, and just listening any time.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|When I say that I was disappointed in this product, I don't mean that I was disappointed with Amazon's delivery of the product-although they did fib about the look and contents of the package. At first glance I noticed that it was a movie that possibly printed in another country (possibly France) because the front and back covers were printed in French and English.  But luckily, the movie was in English. But the disappointing aspect of this review was the movie itself. A large part of this movie was storyline which I appreciated but as far as special effects and how it was filmed was my least favorite of the Harry Potter films. Of all the Harry Potter films this was my least liked because of the way it was filmed and because of the severe lack of incorporating the context of the book into the film.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Our 18 month old loves bike riding with us. The bracket was extremely easy to install, the foot rests were easy to adjust and our son (81cm tall, 24lbs) is completely comfortable riding in his new WeeRide seat. We had read many reviews and made our purchase based on the reviews and have not been disappointed. The attachment is on my husbands bike and although he had to slightly bow his legs to accommodate the seat, he has had no problems adapting to the new pedalling style. The price was in the range we were looking in and as mentioned, we have been extremely happy with our purchase. Happy riding!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary is a 'must see'. It disturbingly delineates the greed, mismanagement, and hubris of Wall Street (financial industry), and how 'carte blanche' deregulation helped bring about the collapse of some of our largest, once trusted financial behemoths, as well as a large chunk of our middle class who lost great sums of money and their houses.  Ever since Reagan took office, there was a huge push to deregulate the financial industry, who eventually did what they wanted by knowingly pushing faulty financial vehicles and investments that were doomed to failure. It is also a documentary about how influential and connected their lobbyists are, who continually (to this date) buy immunity and lawmaking influence in D.C.  All in all, a scathing indictment of deregulation and greed, and those who have suffered because of it.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I got this book when I was 14, and I read the first 170 pages. But I had to stop because A) I was young and I had no idea what the crap was going on; B) I was still in high school, and I had to focus on school before I flunked out; and C) I had only ever read the Harry Potter series, the Twilight saga, and the Percy Jackson series without fail before. Sci-Fi/Fantasy is a complex thing to me. But I picked up the book again a few months after my 19th bday because if I begin reading a book, I have to finish it and I finally finished it after 5 years. I'm very glad I bought A Clash of Kings earlier tonight because I read about 200+ pages in a few hours. Now I can finally begin A Clash of Kings and work my way up. :)<br /><br />**note: my books weren't bought off of Amazon.com.**

0525422943|5.0|I liked If I Stay, the book that tells part one of Mia's and Adam's tale.  But somehow, it seemed to lack emotion (for me, at least).  That's been remedied in Where She Went; the emotion is raw, genuine, and believable.  Perhaps it's because the story is being told from Adam's point of view and he is less reserved that Mia, but whatever the reason, it works.  The sequel is satisfying, moving, funny and poignant.
0857680986|5.0|This Classic was published back in the Golden Age of drawing. When sketching was an art form approached like painting, and all commercial art was hand-drafted with mechanical, photo-realistic precision; this book a guide made to help young artists climb their way into that elevated world.<br /><br />Andrew Loomis had a heavy hand influencing art in the second half of the 20th Century. In this book you will see the seeds that influenced both Frank Frazetta (perhaps the most significant American fantasy painter), and Alex Ross (without question the most noted Comic Book Art painter). The style is incredibly distinctive, you can't help but notice it. When you read this book, you'll look at a posture, or a manner of shading, and say to yourself, \\"So THAT'S where that \\"look\\" came from.\\" The purchase is worth it for that alone.<br /><br />Art students and hobbyists have been after used editions of this book for years, until they have all but vanished from the market. Copies in good condition were hoarded like gold bars and gently examined before tucking away in a safe place -probably for posterity.<br /><br />This faithful reprint is an artist's dream. I can't wait for mine to arrive.
014241543X|4.0|My favorite aspect of 'if i stay' was the characters.  They were well-drawn and real, and their interactions were clever and funny.  Mia has really led a very privileged life: she has a passion, a family she adores and who returns that affection, and a fantastic boyfriend.  To lose all that in one fell blow would be devastating almost beyond comprehension.  The reason I'm giving this book 4 stars rather an 5 is that, given the overwhelming nature of this tragedy, I didn't feel as much raw grief as I expected to.  Maybe that's just me.  Or maybe it's due to the fact that Mia is in an in-between state and not experiencing the full blast of her feelings, and since the story is told from her point of view, her emotions are filtered for us, too.  My barometer for judging books tends to be how much they move me, and from that standpoint, it's a 4, but it's definitely worth reading.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|As a child of film, I have seen my fare share of movies, all genres, all qualities...and this movie provides some great special effects!      Also, I am an advocate of the book-to-film process, and though I haven't read the book for this movie, the story that the film tells is very detailed and goes beyond the pedantic alien-in-human-disguise...it tells a very human story.  What do we choose to fight for?  The people we care about.
B004K00NMG|5.0|This is a movie we have wanted in our collection as this our first movie date, back in the day. We wanted to share with our children this wonderful movie. We loved the music, the cast, the animation, etc. The music brought back so many memories!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I recently purchased this knife for my wife for backpacking and field survival. I figured at under 70 bucks, it wouldn't be a big loss if it let me down.  I was very pleased with the construction. Most of the working knives I own are well made with adhesives and rivets to attach the handle. This little spitfire has nuts and bolts. Awesome. The blade thickness is great at 1/4 inch, and it takes all the abuse I've been able to give it so far. The handle is a bit on the thick side for my wife, and it is a bit heavy, but she feels confident that it won't let her down. I would go so far as to compare it to my Chris Reeve Green Beret knife that cost almost $400. I will be purchasing the Kabar Becker 7inch Combat Bowie in the near future.

0143112724|1.0|I have my own artistic musical compositions posted at various sites (they were available here at Amazon, but I think that the free amateur MP3 section has been eliminated), and it hurts my feelings when people speak poorly of them, so I will not comment on the quality of the paintings by Maria Kalman that are used in this edition of The Elements of Style, or criticize her ability as an artist.  She's apparently successful as an illustrator of children's books, and best wishes to her. I will say, however, that my late uncle Al, who specialized in murals in the basements of neighbors, was far superior in technique.<br /><br />My complaint is that, why does The Elements of Style, being a manual for English grammar and punctuation, contain any paintings in it at all? Just how does that improve the book's utility? You are searching for assistance on some thorny point of punctuation, and you turn the page, and instead of examples, there's an Uncle Al painting. It's the worst idea since stamps you have to lick.<br /><br />What next?  Watercolors in an [[ASIN:B001EDD18K Engine Manual]]?  Abstract expressionism in the set-up instructions for your new camcorder?  Perhaps Ms. Kalman's next assignment will be to illustrate the [[ASIN:0833030477 Book of Random Numbers.]]<br /><br />I would assume that this edition is being marketed as something suitable as a gift, but I can assure you that whomever you give this to would much rather have $10 and a used edition of the plain book.

0684135051|3.0|I expected something a little more complete and well written.   However, I found the book dull, the pcitures were very poor and hard to figure out and hard to deciper.

Add this to the must see list. Everything in the movie, from premise to execution, and excellent acting and directing work as a solid piece of superb and engaged movie making. The kind of subtle and powerful movie art making which trusts its own talent and trusts the intelligence and sensitivity of its modern viewers.! Thank you Amazon! And you can't get it on Netflix either!

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I decided to order the first 3 seasons of Supernatural, because I didn't start watching it until the 4th season. I am only through the 2nd season, but was not disappointed. I found out the whole history of the Winchester brothers, and also enjoyed all the episodes I missed. My only gripe is the 3rd season is only 16 shows, and the other 2 seasons are 22 episodes. Even though I got all 3 at a discounted price, the 3rd season should have been a deeper discount,in my opinion.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Well, I'd already borrowed this from a friend before actually purchasing it. I was really impressed with it, the quality, the bonus features, everything. When I bought it for myself, I found myself watching it ALL the time. Definitely worth buying!
0553801473|2.0|The first three installments are groundbreaking and phenomenal writing. Great action, twists, turns, and the pacing was perfect. Definitely a page turner and you can't get enough. Unfortunately A Feast For Crows bogs down with uninteresting plot and little movement in the overall story. Since A Dance with Dragons is essentially part II of AFFC, it suffers from similar problems as mentioned by many other reviewers here. Not much advancement in plot and lots of busy work by characters that sets up . . . the next two books. Hopefully anyway. Way too much repetition of \\"words are wind\\" and a few other terms that got extremely annoying fast. I'm not sure how it got such rave reviews by major critics. It is definitely better than AFFC, at least I didn't skip over whole pages or chapters then read the plot summary on Wikipedia just to make it through. But I do miss the wonderful pacing and incredibly refreshing plot lines of the first three installments of the series. Here's to hoping that GRRM can wrap it up in the last two books within our lifetime and bring back some of the magic from the first novels. Wishful thinking though. It'd be awesome if Brandon Sanderson can finish it off just like WOT. If you've read the first three books - I suggest waiting for the final books before reading ADWD and AFFC. You won't miss much as its just filler and may frustrate more than satisfy.
B002V3QPE4|1.0|This toy has not functioned properly since it arrived. The castle actually inflates in section which is fine. I guess its better than having to blow the whole thing up at once. Unfortunately the main section (the towers and the lower section surrounding the main bouncy section) leaks. There are two different ways to inflate this section (the other section only have 1). One the way that is used to inflate/deflate this section to a cap that screws on/off. The cap is rubber and the section it screws onto is rubber. Well guess what, it's not air tight. Lots of time wasted inflating this thing to have it deflated within hours.
B0058YPGP2|5.0|I caught this show one Saturday afternoon during reruns. I was waiting on a friend to finish getting ready and I got hooked instantly on this show. Only to be completely surprised it was on MTV! This show, on a network famous now for showing the likes of Jersey Shore and Teenage pregos. I love this show. It has all the makings for instant addiction..........good to above average acting skills, fantastic special effects, lots of build up in the script (from EXCELLENT WRITERS i might add) and a little comedy thrown in for good measure (love Stiles) It sure breaks up some Monday night boredom!!  I cannot wait until it arrives on blu-ray. Bring it on!

B004TTZHBK|4.0|I should probably start off by saying that I am not a big fan of Jamie Oliver, Something about his personality just puts me off. \n\nThat said, I am rating the app and its contents, not, Jamie Oliver. \n\nI am very pleased with the recipes and the layout of the app. I have not been able to view all the videos because of the DRM related glitch, but, I have been able to view some of them, and I like what I see. \n\nI would give this app 5 stars for certain, depite the fact that in my opinion $7. 99  is an absolutely ridiculous price, but, I find that it has a major flaw..... \n\nThere is no nutritional data provided for the recipes. This is supposed to be a &quot;healthy lifestyle&quot;  cookbook, and, while it is true that I can use &quot;my fitness pal&quot; or any of a million other calorie calculators to generate nutritional data, I really shouldn&apos;t gave too. \n\nBecause of this, and not because of my distaste for Mr. Oliver, or because of the glitch with the videos, I am taking a star.
B003X9W98G|5.0|The Doctor escapes from the Pandorica Box. He finds out that the universe is ending one bit at a time and the Earth is the last thing to end. With the help of Amy, Rory, and River Song, he saves the universe by sacrificing his life. He dies and then he is thrown back in time time where he gets to see his past with Amy being eliminated one day at a time. The Doctor has a brilliant plan to have Amy remember him so he won't die. This works. The Doctor cheats death and now the story continues on to the next season. Now Amy is married to Rory and River Song gives hints that she may be married to the Doctor.    This is the episode that really won me over for Matt Smith. Matt Smith is the Doctor to me now. Smith had huge shoes to fill when he took over David Tennant's role as the Doctor. Smith's performance is extremley good. He had to be very funny and very serious at the same time and he done it perfectly. I was giggling at him when he was really farce. I was cheering for him when he saved the universe. And I was very touched when he talked to Amy before he died. Matt Smith has won me over as the legitimate Dr Who. I'm sure Matt Smith will really shine in season six.

0670022411|1.0|Skip it. I know it sounds good in a blurb, but I really don't understand how this novel has gotten such a positive critical reception. This book is horrible and boring. I love to read, I read all sorts of books, and I actually couldn't finish this one. I think the author was trying to write a \\"Twilight for grown-ups\\" type story, the problem being that that concept is a complete oxymoron. Also, the prose comes across as that of an academic trying desperately to write creatively and failing miserably. There is an abundance of description of her running, her adrenalin problems, and food. And it's all really boring.

0062060554|4.0|I got absolutely sucked in to this book.  The plot was intriguing and the concept was very creative. I loved every bit of it until the last forty or fifty pages. At this point it seemed like the author got tired of her thickening plot and decided to just get it done. Although there was a twist I did not see coming, right after that the author quickly tied up loose ends in a way that did not match the previous craftiness she showed in the rest of the book. So, overall, I would say it was a great book that let's you down in the end.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised with the third book of this series. The first was rather boring. It did not hold my interest and only OCD let me finish it. I bought the next two for some easy summer reading. I did not even bother starting them until July. I did not expect to actually like them. The second was only slightly better than the first. And I thought it was quite revolting that Clarissa and Jace continued to like each other when they both believed they were siblings. This continues in the third unfortunately. However...I loved the third. It is the first book I have read in a while that has a true love story. Because of the third-person point of view, you know it is recipricated. Other books are first-person, and you have know idea what is going on in the other person's mind. I don't, however, like Clary. She is what I consider a weak character. It's annoying. Rose from Vampire Academy is mind kind of lead female character. Anyway. Worth the read. Great book.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|The price was great, compared to some of the others (for the complete series).  Packaging was good also.

1594744769|4.0|Jake is a likeable, yet typical angst ridden teenager, who as a youngster was entertained by the unusual stories his grandfather told him.  They were just stories, right?!?  Following his beloved grandfather's death, Jake begins investigating and feels that grandpa may not have been such a nutter after all, (as Jake's mother and father seem to believe and have been telling Jake for years that grandpa was a little off his beam).  Thus begins Jake's journey to find out the truth about his grandfather's past. It takes him quite literally and figuratively to a whole new world.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story.  It was just unusual enough for me that it held my interest.  The pictures were a great touch. The story ends in such a manner that yes, it could be a stand alone story, or it could be continued.  Personally, I'd vote for the latter, as I came to enjoy these peculiar children and would like to know more of their history.<br /><br />The only drawback for me was, (and really has nothing to do with the story itself, but it is a heads up to Kindle owners), I downloaded the book to my Kindle 3.  While the pictures were easily viewed, the letters and the note Jake writes to his father remain a mystery, I have zero clue what they said.  The handwriting was too small to be able to be legible on the screen, nor is there a way to zoom in on those screens to make out what was written.  So, it was a little bit of information lost and I would love to know Jake's explanation to his father.  Maybe the next generation of Kindle will address this issue, as this isn't the first ebook where I've had this exact same problem.<br /><br />~ jade ~
0439023521|5.0|I was a little hesitant about this book at first.  I assumed it was going to be good, but I didn't know how good it would be.  There was so much hype about it, that I was afraid I would begin reading it and find myself disappointed.  But oh, was I wrong.  I absolutely loved this novel.  From the first pages, it had me.  And let me say to all of you that have yet to read it...  believe the hype.  Give yourself up to it and just read it already.<br /><br />The main thing I loved about this book was that it wasn't easy to figure out.  You didn't know what was going to happen until it happened, or how things were going to happen.  You were basically left in the dark with no choice but to continue reading.  I was kept guessing on every single page.  The Hunger Games is very well written.  Whether it's the horridity of the violence and the Games, or the heart and emotion you feel as you read on about the individual characters.  It was easy to get sucked in and you remained there until the end.<br /><br />Another thing that stood out to me about this novel was the lack of romance.  Of course, there's a little romance in the novel, but only a tiny portion.  It doesn't take center stage and demand all the attention.  The book itself does not revolve around lust and love like most do.  I love my love stories, but this book was a bit refreshing in that sense.<br /><br />I loved this book so much and it is so different from anything I've read recently.  As soon as I finished the last page, I honestly wanted to throw myself right into book two, Catching Fire.  This book really does live up to the hype.

B004X8W4A4|3.0|This is the second Nikki Heat adventure I've decided to tag along on and I wasn't too disappointed with the outcome.<br /><br />This time, Nikki is called to the scene of a recent murder and finds Jameson Rook on the scene waiting for her. He has been shadowing gossip columnist, Cassidy Towne, she of the poisoned pen and vicious bite, for another profile. Nikki is still burning from all the attention she's gotten since Rook lauded her in print on every news stand in New York City and she doesn't need Rook in her face again. The thing is, she needs his contacts and his insight to figure out who killed Cassidy Towne and why, especially since the list is so long and filled with celebrities willing to spend the money to kill anyone who gets in the way, including her.<br /><br />The basic premise of the mystery is a good one, and one that is no doubt dear the hearts of any celebrity who has been made to pay for their foibles and moments of bad judgment, as well as their drugged out nights and prima donna behavior. That part of the mystery works, and works all the way to the end. The off again, on again romance between Nikki and Rook is a little forced at times and yet it seems Rick Castle, the author, is still working all that out. His main focus is on the story and not on Nikki and Rook's love life, at least not this time around, except for one instance when Rook's desk is trashed by spontaneous combustion, not once, but twice.<br /><br />The writing is pretty basic without too many frills and only slight lapses when the adjectives and adverbs are piled on to gild an already gilded lily. It seems Castle is working too hard to make what should be a fun and interesting book into high art and failing. He should stick to what he knows and leave the art for someone else to wax poetic. Where Castle does not fail is in plotting and setting up of possible murderers. What does get in the way is the ubiquitous garbage strike (does NYC really have so many garbage strikes?) and some pretty pointless sighing and half-hearted yearning from Rook and Nikki.<br /><br />Castle uses the romance and the footwork to spin out the pages when he should have focused on the story, which, garbage strike and coyote spotting aside, is a good one. There are sufficient red herrings, twists, and turns to make the story without slowing down the forward movement so much with too much emotional claptrap that did nothing to advance Nikki's or Rook's characters. Aside from the intermittent navel gazing, Naked Heat was a good read that should have been about 50 pages shorter. Still, Castle did not disappoint too much, and finding out Rook's secret identity was worth the read.<br /><br />All in all, I am in for the next Nikki Heat mystery. Don't expect great literature, it's not in here. Don't expect too much bodice ripping, it's not in here. Expect to be entertained for a few hours and not miss the time.ghing and half-hearted yearning from Rook and Nikki.

B00006AW2G|5.0|In the history of rock music, it's difficult to beat 1969 in terms of some of the greatest music ever recorded. Think about it, you had the greatest rock artists in history all putting out their best music! The Beatles, The Who, Hendrix, Clapton, The Doors, Led Zeppelin and on and on. There was always a rivalry going on between the Beatles and Rolling Stones and for the most part the Stones usually came out on the short end of the stick. In 1967 the Beatles went concept and psychedelic with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and they came out with the rather lame \\"Satanic Majesty\\" album. The next year was the rootsier \\"White Album\\" and the Stones countered with \\"Beggars Banquet\\". Beggars is a very good record but it's not the \\"White Album\\" in terms of commercial success and musical significance. But 1969 saw the Beatles release \\"Abbey Road\\" which became their final recording as well as one of the best albums of all time. The Stones might have actually matched and even one-upped the Fab Four with \\"Let it Bleed\\".  This record can be considered great alone for the inclusion of two of their best songs; \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You want\\". But, with \\"Midnight Rambler\\", \\"Monkey Man\\", \\"Live with Me\\" and \\"Love in Vain\\" there are really no bad tracks at all. Even the country-fied version of \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" is a wonderful counter to the original. Along with the aforementioned Abbey Road, this record resides in my top ten of all time favorites and \\"You Can't Always Get...\\" is arguably the most original and ambitious song the Stones ever recorded. \\"Let it Bleed\\" is a must have for all rock music fans.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Finally had a chance to install the app this evening and I really like it. After installing I ran the app and the intro video started playing but then stopped when a pop up window opened to inform me that the 80MB of media data needed to be downloaded. I clicked OK and waited for the download to complete.    When I ran the app again, I was very pleased with how it was set up. It's very intuitive and easy to navigate through the recipes, tips, and photos. I selected a stir fry recipe and it was an interesting and fairly simple recipe (Dan Dan Noodles). I was able to save the ingredients needed to a shopping list with no trouble at all.     The photos and video are all very nicely executed. I think most people will enjoy this app.    Worth 7.99 and definitely a steal a zero dollars. My phone is an LG Optimus V from Virgin Mobile running Android 2.2. I did have a slight problem in that the intro video started playing once with sound but no video, but going back and starting over it played without problems.

B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Small, sleepy town. Odd folks. Strange doings. Smokin' hot FBI agent. Yeah, count me in. I'm not sayin' HAVEN is the best show on television, but it's certainly kept me tuning in. HAVEN draws its roots from Stephen King's novella, THE COLORADO KID, and the ironic bit is that this novella has closer ties to the mystery genre than to horror fiction.<br /><br />Cracks on the road, holes in her past. Deployed to Haven, Maine on a routine investigation, FBI agent Audrey Parker stumbles onto sudden fissures on the road and onto the puzzle of the Colorado Kid, an unsolved, decades-old mystery which may or may not shed light on her murky orphaned past. Agent Parker is intrigued enough and hopeful enough that she opts to bide a while in Haven. She rapidly susses out that this little town hides its fair share of secrets. What makes Haven special is its status as refuge for those with paranormal attributes. The townspeople, in hushed tones, label those with extraordinary abilities as \\"Troubled\\" or \\"Afflicted.\\" Sometime in the past, a plague of supernatural horror - or the Troubles - swept over Haven, and then eventually went away. Today, dormant powers are reviving; there's a strangeness in the air. the Troubles are back. And Agent Parker, with her training and her natural bump of curiousity, may just be Haven's best hope.<br /><br />The picturesque seaside locations - mostly shot in Nova Scotia - lend texture to the show, serve as an effective counterpoint to the town's dark underbelly. The Troubles are a widely accepted urban legend in Haven, and you often have characters dropping remarks such as \\"It's the Troubles, isn't it?\\" or \\"The Troubles are back, aren't they?\\" or in Audrey Parker's case, \\"The FBI never trained you for the Troubles.\\" Season One unveils thirteen episodes which are predominantly stand-alone stories, although recurring sub-plots and themes do run thru the entire season. In the unraveling of Haven's mysteries, Agent Parker regularly comes face to face with otherworldy phenomena, and she's open-minded enough and thinks outside of the box enough that she doesn't get too much ruffled, even though the foul play involved is often of the staggeringly preposterous sort. I don't know that Emily Rose makes for an entirely convincing detective - she's a bit too pretty and glib and breezy - but damn if you don't get drawn into her exploits. Emily Rose is a capable enough actress that she sells her moments of vulnerability, and then there's her intriguing chemistry with Lucas Bryant.<br /><br />Bryant plays Nathan Wuornos, a local cop who becomes Audrey's partner. Nathan is one of them wounded souls. He's afflicted with idiopathic neuropathy, a condition that prevents him from physically feeling anything. As one may expect, this has made Nathan a detached, almost painfully shy character. Except that he's very sympatico with Audrey Parker. And matchmakers that we are, we start hoping for them to hook up. Now if only that charming rogue and smuggler Duke Crocker (Eric Balfour) would beat feet... He's threatening to steal Nathan's thunder.<br /><br />When not wallowing in flirtatious moments, HAVEN dives right back into the supernatural procedural. There are some really nifty episodes featuring phenomena such as rapid aging, dream murders, a homicidal shadow, living stuffed people, a person whose moods influence the weather, shapeshifters, a pyrokinetic, an artist whose drawings affect reality, et cetera... not to mention, an assortment of folks sporting ominous tattoos. All of these crazy bits of hoodoo, by the way, are given life by - for television - pretty excellent special effects. I like that Agent Parker, often times, resolves a case without resorting to violence. On the other hand, the way she handles the unrepentant pyrokinetic demonstrates a certain ruthless streak on her part (in \\"The Hand You're Dealt\\"). If you're a Nathan fan, then \\"As You Were\\" showcases him saving the day. If you're a Duke fan, what the hell's your problem?<br /><br />Season One is chary with the reveals but we are treated to several big ones, with Audrey, Nathan, and Duke each either unveiling or discovering a huge secret about themselves. Nathan's discovery would make him even more attached to Audrey, the poor sap. For Audrey, curious orphan, it's all about her digging into her blurry past, her search galvanized by a mysterious photograph shown her by those two odd newspapermen when she first arrived at Haven. What she learns in the Season One finale is a humdinger and nicely dovetails into the startling season ending cliffhanger. Favorite episodes are: \\"Welcome to Haven\\" (the pilot); \\"As You Were\\" (basically a taut \\"killer-in-the-midst-while-trapped-in-a-confined-space\\" murder mystery; \\"Sketchy,\\" because how can you not love an episode in which a guy gets his limbs brutally twisted like pretzels and another bloke has his eyes and mouth cold vanish on him?; and \\"Spiral\\" - the very good season ender in which several plot threads come together. Now, in Season Two, if they can only escalate things a bit further and maybe develop these Troubled incidents so that they feed into a more cohesive overarching threat, why, that wouldn't suck at all. HAVEN's biggest problem is that it's harder to connect to the stories when the format insists on these creature-of-the-week stand-alone episodes. And, in fact, \\"Spiral\\" does a good job of changing the status quo. So, again, HAVEN may not be the best show on television.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|It is a great retake to the original Evangelion series, on the first movie everything is pretty similar to the original series, just a few small changes, but on the second movie everything changes!

1597801585|5.0|Bacigalupi won my heart with \\"Shipbreaker\\", but I actually had this book on the shelf not too long before that was released. \\"Shipbreaker\\" is for the YA market, and is about a post-petrol America, but that's where the similarities end. \\"The Windup Girl\\" is an awful, wonderful future that is SO not for kids, about a new kind of slavery that may await our descendants if we keep going the way we're going. This book just made me love him even more.    For those not comfortable about human trafficking, you probably shouldn't read this book. Well, semi-human trafficking. You get what I mean. But even if you're uneasy, the way Bacigalupi writes it is masterful, and only goes for the jugular with anything that might be considered triggery in the abuse catagory a few times when he could have gone wild with it the entire book. For that I thank him, it made things easier to digest.    This book is far in our future - or is it? Once again, we have a post-petrol world, a world where entire parts of countries and continents are covered by rising seas, and the Thai Kingdom is now the center of the world instead of America with its \\"generippers\\" (geneticists who literally rip the genes out of something to create chimera of anything - plants, animals, and now humans for sale) and the calorie companies, the new currency of the future. No longer oil, or dollars, or euro, or yen, but calories, and all the measures thereof. I had to pause at one early point in the book and wiki metric calorie count because I honestly couldn't keep it straight, but once I did, it was smooth sailing from then on. The currency of the future is in joules, the measure unit of energy provided by calories, and fines are determined by how many you use versus how many you waste (for anti-pollution measures), and power everything from lightbulbs to factories.    Bacigalupi does not make this a beautiful, peaceful future. There is constant tension in the Thai Kingdom between everyone - the foreigners (farang), theYellow Cards (Malay-Chinese), the gangs, the white shirts (bureaucrats, mostly in the inspector divisions), the market sellers, and the regular Thai people. So much tension that I was kind of on the edge of my seat going \\"Okay, who's going to slaughter whom first?\\" the entire time. When it does happen (and I won't say how or when), it was kind of a relief, with such a huge buildup. But again, it's a subtle one, slowly pushing at the boundary of the already stress-taxed people in the book, until literally, all hell breaks loose.    I loved the characters. I want more out of this world, I'll be frank - but I'm pretty sure we won't be getting any more from the \\"Windup\\" universe. The characters were rich, but I want some kind of prequel telling us about how we got to this point of the calorie companies versus the world, and why everyone hates them (that's kind of obvious, but still) - but considering what we got, I'm extremely pleased. The arc development of how the characters changed was excellent, and honestly, I couldn't want more out of a futuristic almost-dystopic book. Seriously. It really is that good.    I could keep gushing on and on about how awesome Bacigalupi's work is here, but for the sake of brevity, I won't. Just go out and read it. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, go read it. It will teach us about how we can prevent such a future today, and about the basic nature of people (the human animal), period. The human animal. It sent chills up my spine for large portions of the second half of the book, and that's pretty rare for me.    So, this has made my best of 2010 AND 2011 list, and it's high up there on both. Congrats, Bacigalupi. Now get back to work on the sequel for \\"Shipbreaker\\", and we'll call it even.    (posted to goodreads, librarything, shelfari, and [...])
B004EC5IUW|4.0|It is really an amazing retake of the original Evangelion series, the quality is great, and there is a lot of info in the booklet, the only downside was that, the box have some little scratchs,(the cartoon one) but in regards to the movie itself, no complains.
B003E6K1VK|3.0|Well, first I decided to buy a good headphone to use (I bought the Bose Quiet comfort15). Then I found some reviews saying that the Ipod signal is not enough for the good headphones like Bose, Senheiser, Pioneer... So I looked for an amplifier.  This Fiio E7 does a little bit of amplification, but nothing really awesome. The only good feature is the bass boost, but I think we could choose the frequency of the bass boost.  The sound quality is good, it doesn't increase noise or any distortion. But the amount of volume increase is low in my opinion. You have an electronic device just to amplify the signal, it is almost the size of an Iphone and the result is below the expected.  The results are better for pop/rock songs then electronic music, as the electronic music already has high amount of bass.  Also, the cable that comes with it is very short, the Ipod needs to be side-by-side to work.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|As my first after-market cooler for my i7 920, I am extremely pleased. It brought my stock idle temps from 65 C to 38 C. Doesn't go above 60 on load now.

For new buyers it would be best to watch their YouTube video on how to install it.<br /><br />Great cooling, great value, knocked one off for installation difficulties, but definitely worth it.

B004BLDD9Y|4.0|At $13, these are less costly than similar LED bulbs I've seen, but still expensive. If they last as long as touted, they'll be worth it. Like incandescents, they come on instantly at full brightness. That said, the supposed 50 watt equivalent is not as bright as I'd like, even for a bed reading light. I'll bide my time for now, awaiting a brighter, less pricey bulb.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a Woody Allen film, but in his new mature style. His style has evolved over the years. It is a comedy, but not so broad--it is a sophisticated comedy. In a way, it is almost a panel discussion about why it is so difficult to define love. Vicky and Cristina (Rebecca Hall & Scarlett Johansson) are two young American women who have radically different approaches to love. Cristina knows what she doesn't want, and that is a stable but boring relationship. She wants to gamble with her feelings, putting them at risk, for the sake of grand passion. She has accepted that love might cause her great pain, but to her it was worth it. It is significant that prior to the film's beginning, she has made a 12-minute film about why love is so difficult to define. She felt her film had failed in its objective. Vicky, on the other hand, values stability above all, and has picked her fianc&eacute;, Doug, because \\"he was decent and successful and understood the beauty of commitment.\\" While Vicky and Cristina are in Spain on vacation they meet a dashing painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who tries to seduce them both. Cristina is interested, but Vicky is having none of it. However, against her better judgment, she agrees to accompany Juan Antonio and Cristina on a side trip to a small Spanish town. This little snippet sums up the dynamics of the situation:<br /><br />Cristina: [Looking at a sculpture of Jesus] Are you very religious?<br />Juan Antonio: No, no, no, no, I'm not. The trick is to enjoy life, accepting it has no meaning whatsoever.<br />Cristina: No meaning? You don't think that authentic love gives life meaning?<br />Juan Antonio: Yes, but love is so transient. Isn't it? I was in love with a most incredible woman... and then in the end...<br />Vicky: Yes?<br />Juan Antonio: She put a knife into me.<br />Cristina: My God, that's terrible!<br />Vicky: Well, maybe you did something to deserve it.<br /><br />Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) is the woman from his past. She doesn't even appear for the first half of the film, but when she does arrive, she is a force of nature. Bardem and Cruz made a charming, if troubled couple. Their relationship was nothing if not tempestuous. Cruz earned a supporting actress Oscar for this role. Javier Bardem and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz ended up married two years after this film was made.<br /><br />Woody Allen had Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson in mind when he wrote the script, and he never even considered anyone else for the role Bardem played. The script was originally set in San Francisco, but Woody Allen had a deal to make a film in Spain, so he dug out an old script that could be reset there. It seems such a perfect location that it is surprising it wasn't originally set in Spain. Woody Allen films used to always feature the writer/director in a leading role, but as he got older, it became problematic. At one point he tried using Larry David, one of the creators of Seinfeld who later had the show Curb Your Enthusiasm. This substitution of one curmudgeon for another didn't solve his dilemma. But with someone like Bardem in the leading role, or as in his latest film, Owen Wilson, all of that is changed. Bardem plays well the dashing Spanish artist who can proposition two women. Bardem can get away with propositions that would make you cringe if it was the aging Woody doing the propositioning. No country for old men, indeed. Bardem totally gets away with it. Another point in Bardem's favor is that in spite of his good fortune, his luck with the ladies, there is always a cloud on his horizon. Even while living with both Cristina and Maria Elena, things aren't perfect. He is always brooding. This makes him much more likeable. If he were just a suave womanizer he'd be totally and irredeemably insufferable.<br /><br />The lush Spanish setting is beautiful and the Spanish guitar music evokes a transcendent mood. Why is it so difficult to define love? Woody Allen has really matured as a director and he knows how to tell a story with film. The actors are all excellent, with my personal favorite being Rebecca Hall, who played Vicky. I really enjoyed Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Vicky. It was fun to see her initial hostility to Juan Antonio melt. She was so judgmental, so condescending, so sure of herself, but then... she questions all the fundamental beliefs she has held so firmly up to this point.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is, even if you don't like Woody Allen films, you will probably like this one, and don't worry, Woody stays behind the camera at all times.<br /><br />Cristina: If you don't start undressing me soon this is going to turn into a panel discussion.<br /><br />2008 [[ASIN:B001TH92N4 Frost/Nixon]]<br />2007 [[ASIN:B00118T63C No Country for Old Men]]<br />2005 [[ASIN:B000EQHXNW Match Point]]<br />2003 [[ASIN:B00005JMJ4 Lost in Translation]]<br />2003 [[ASIN:B00000F2L9 Masked and Anonymous]]<br />2001 [[ASIN:B00005JKMZ Vanilla Sky]]<br />2001 [[ASIN:B00003CXWV Blow]]<br />1999 [[ASIN:B00004STRD Sweet and Lowdown]]<br />1997 [[ASIN:B00005LZOD Open Your Eyes]]<br />1977 [[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]]<br /><br />Cristina: I'll go to your room, but you'll have to seduce me.ors are all excellent, with my personal favorite being Rebecca Hall, who played Vicky.

0312370849|5.0|I've read many books about the Holocaust for the last few decades and each time I am deeply moved.  Reading these stories of survival, their torture or death is a continous reminder for me that this happened just 'recently' in our human history and that it's unfortunately still happening today, around the world! WWII is a war that is unimaginable to me - this happened in Western Europe, in civilized countries with civilized governments.  I feel obligated to read about the Holocaust - in memory of those who suffered inhumane and unspeakable crimes, so that it stays in our collective minds and not be repeated ever again!  This book is simply one of those unbelievable, moving stories during WWII.  A must read!  I could not put this book down!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I didn't buy these earphones from Amazon. I bought them long before Amazon was a mere twinkle in Jeff Bezos' eye; i.e., something like 20 years ago. Since then, I've done a lot of live performances, DJ gigs and home studio work. I'm back now to buy my third set of replacement earpads.<br /><br />Over the years I've owned quite a few earphones. Nothing has ever come close to the high-quality sound and comfort of these Sonys. I can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort, save a bit of ear sweating due to the excellent sound seal of the closed design. They have stood up well to two decades of use and much abuse. The cable length is generous enough for almost any need, and the gold-plated, screw-on convertible 1/4\\" TRS/mini-plug allows them to be used on virtually any piece of equipment without worrying about carrying around an adapter.<br /><br />They aren't cheap, but you can certainly pay more for other brands or models that will not likely be any better, if even as good as these. I'm not surprised to see that this same model has been around for longer than Amazon has been in existence. There are obviously a lot of satisfied customers. For professional work, or for people who need to spend a lot of time wearing them, I can recommend these headphones without any reservations. A good example of \\"you get what you pay for,\\" and then some.

0316056863|5.0|I bought the audio book version of BOSSYPANTS and had intended to save it for a long car trip. I listened to the introduction, just to see what it was like, and couldn't stop myself from playing the whole thing. I'm almost done listening to it and now have to buy another audio book for my trip! Any suggestions anyone??    Was I guffawing out loud while listening to this? Absolutely yes, from time to time, but that is almost beside the point because these essays are also very insightful, interesting and REAL. They are not just a set up for jokes at the expense of content...okay, sometimes they are, but not too much.     One of my favorite parts is how she applied things she learned in improv class to her life. It's borderline deeply philosophical, just enough so that you can feel like you are also enriching your life when all you really wanted was to know what Sarah Palin was really like and was she mad about the impersonation.    Yes, you have to be a Fey fan and/or a 30 Rock fan to love this book as much as me because this is Fey unadulterated. (Full disclosure...I'm a Philly boy and may be regionally biased to her brand of humor. On the other hand, I am also an elitist nerd, so that might figure into it.) If you \\"get\\" her, you will love this. If you don't, you still might love this because it is a solid autobiography with plenty of humor.     If you are from \\"real\\" America...you might want to pass.
0553582038|4.0|This novel is different than the previous three; it is much slower paced and new characters of questionable interest are introduced.  I do not disagree with the other reviews stating that the novel is too drawn out and does not focus on the primary characters of interest from the previous three novels.  But the detail and slower pace was also engaging almost James Joyce'esk in style.  I think George RR Martin has shared more of himself in this installment than the previous three novels.  So in conclusion this novel is superior to the previous three, and I think it represents a style never presented in any other sci fi/fantasy novel, I listened to the audio book which I think is the preferable format for book IV of the \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\".

It also escapes my reasoning ability to understand how anyone in their right mind could possibly go any further.  Absolutely brainless aphorisms gilded by cheesy imagery make this book an overpriced and sloppily thrown together turd.  Avoid at all costs; your brain cells will thank you.

0062060554|3.0|I was excited about the concept of this book, and at first had trouble putting it down.  But, the characters were predictable as was the outcome so I was slightly let down about halfway through the book.  Having had trouble with amnesia myself, maybe I just wanted some answers that made sense, but the many inconsistencies throughout this book made it less believable. A person with this degree of disability would not be left alone as much as Christine, but try it for yourself...you might not be able to sleep tonight or any other night!

B003QNXPUK|2.0|The items was not as expected as it started to peal off from the sides after one week of applying it.    It was accepted at the beginning then it had bubbles accumulating inside the shield and also it scratches and scratches do not go as their marks remain.
0670022411|3.0|When I started this book, I wasn't sure I was going to finish it, and that's rare for me (I'm sort of a compulsive book finisher.) The writing was so pedestrian and every character seemed a gag-worthy stereotype - like some teenager's vision of 'cool, supernatural adults' who are all the most beautiful, most intelligent, most fit people who ever lived and who also enjoy yoga. Bleh.    But I kept reading, and slowly the book drew me in. Yes, I was constantly laughing to my husband as I turned pages, but the pages kept turning, faster and faster. By about the middle of the book, the plot becomes faster paced, so that you don't spend as much time doing yoga and learning about the characters (which is not this writer's strength). As long as things are happening, the characters are travelling, being abducted and otherwise threatened, this book is actually very enjoyable. By the end, I was very eager to know what will happen next and, much as I still may criticize the author's writing chops, I will probably buy the sequel.

B001993Y2C|2.0|I watched the first disc in the Season One box and was totally enraptured. However this quickly gave way to total exasperation as the final three chapters on the very first disc were all unwatchable - the picture froze and could not be advanced beyond the freeze except to load the next chapter.  Augghhh! I have contacted Universal HD and am hoping I can replace the individual disc and not have to return the entire boxed set. I will post an update when/if I hear back from them.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I have to be honest and upfront about everything I write. I am forever linked to the Memphis Belle as my great uncle, Robert Hanson, was the radioman on the actual Memphis Belle on all 25 of her missions. I remember family reunions when Uncle Bob would borrow the actual film from Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane and show it to dozens of us. He'd mist up at every showing. It was this film that eventually was released as the documentary. I bought the VHS tape in the 80's.    When the Memphis Belle movie was released, the entire family went to the theater to see it. We knew that it wasn't going to be a true representation of the 25th mission of the Belle, but a compilation of what happened to the B-17 crews stationed in England. It was filmed in England and the surviving members of the Memphis Belle crew were \\"hired\\" as consultants, flown to England with their spouses, and had a wonderful time according to Uncle Bob. I have a picture that was taken of the movie's Memphis Belle crew and the actual Belle crew members. Many of the actors in the movie have gone on to have great careers. The filming inside the belly of the B-17 was amazing as it was to see the restored aircraft used in the movie. At a local air show, a B-17 was one of the many aircraft. I climbed that straight ladder into the center of the plane. I couldn't believe how narrow and tight the spaces were. What the men of the B-17 crews endured and what they did during WWII under such extreme circumstances is amazing. It is unfortunate that all Belle crew members are now deceased.    If you see this movie for nothing more than the historical value it offers, it is well worth it. It's imperative that we not forget the sacrifices made for us by previous generations.
0061730335|2.0|This book is written like a children's story. The themes and messages from the book were extremely cliché and predictable.
0553801473|2.0|This isn't a book or even a story so much as it's a random sequence of events that happen to take place from one point in time to another. It's the same problem that Feast for Crows had, except this time we get characters we care about. It's also the same problem that nearly every Fantasy writer makes these days.<br /><br />\\"Timmy took his dog for a walk. Somehow he lost the dog. Timmy searched but could not find him. He had to decide either to give up and get another dog, or to persevere. In the end he chose not to give up, he eventually found the dog and they lived happily ever after.\\"  - THAT is a story. It's trite, boring and cliche but it IS a story. \\"Timmy searched but could not find him (his dog).\\" Is NOT a story, it is a fragment of a story, and that is precisely what this book is.<br /><br />Just because the MAIN story takes up over 7+ books doesn't mean that each individual volume is allowed to be 1 of 7 pieces of a story. Subplots and minor themes are interwoven into larger plots and themes so that books in a series can stand on their own while adding a piece to the main storyline. Martin did this masterfully in books 1 - 3 but has failed with 4 and 5. If I'm not mistaken, the only reason 'Dance' and 'Crows' were separated was because of sheer length, in which case all would be forgiven since it's an unfortunate necessity for publishing. However, even combined, I still don't see the POINT of this seemingly random series of events. All that happened was a movement of characters from point A to B and world building, and plot setup. NO loose ends were tied, they just became more frayed. What NEEDS to happen, is for a loose end to be tied which then CAUSES others to become frayed. Again, this was the case in books 1 - 3, they are absent in this volume with or without book 4.<br /><br />Other problems I had with this particular volume was its imbalance of light and dark. That's not to say it was \\"too dark\\", it's that the amount of darkness in it has no real perspective since there's insufficient light to draw a contrast. The characters that supposedly represent 'light' (what's good and honorable) are mostly new and not fleshed out yet. When familiar characters finally decide to stop sitting on the bench and get up to do something Martin cuts them off (meaning he ends the book). This makes for a ridiculously cynical read - and I'M a cynic!<br /><br />My personal opinion on WHY there's so many problems with these past two volumes is that Martin seems to have made the mistake of predominately concerning himself with the chronological order of events, rather than (for example) the thematic order of events. In short, he could have (for example) travelled further in Daenary's and Tyrion's plot and hold Jon back at a certain point in time - allowing timelines to overlap each other from one volume to the next rather than this bizarre paralleling. I don't pretend to know the full scope of this story or Martin's reasoning behind his decisions. Nor do I pretend to be more competent with writing. Yet, clearly there's something to be said about virtually every fan loving 1 - 3 and being genuinely disappointed with 4 and now 5.<br /><br />I believe Mr. Martin has baked a delicious cake (the entire series), but the pieces of it he's cutting for us right now are a bizarre shape and don't contain enough frosting to be considered 'dessert'.  If it's a choice between that and a slice of mud pie (nearly any other fantasy writer's series) then I'd have to say \\"No thank you, I guess I'm not that hungry after all.\\"

B004BSFC46|4.0|I bought this for our baby with combination of Lamaze socks and it works out well. It catches baby's attention and the rattling is just right sound level, not too noisy, not too quiet. But, if your baby's hand is chunky, you will have little bit of issues with one of the rattles. The strip is made out of beautiful but fuzzy material and it is not too long, so it barely fits on the hand of our little one. The other rattle is pretty ok.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me after my husband's death.  It was meaningful and comforting to me.  Maybe it's not for everyone but I understand the \\"scenery\\" is based on descriptions from people who have had near-death experiences.

B0052FDRI0|5.0|This album did not disappoint. The lyrics were written better than in We Stitch These Wounds, and the music was more complex.

0553801473|5.0|After A FEAST FOR CROWS I was worried that Martin's story was on the decline, but this book is marvelous. Of course, I haven't been waiting 5 years for it, since I only read the series for the first time last year. Maybe I would be more critical or demanding if I'd suffered that wait.<br /><br />So many great scenes, and some important new characters. We've got a new villain to hate-- and boy is he hateful-- and we witness his nastiness in person unlike the way the exploits of previous monsters such as The Mountain were presented. Lots of satisfying scenes with favorite characters. There are a few really incredible set pieces, where the action is orchestrated on a grand scale.<br /><br />One thing was frustrating, though: one of \\"Feast\\"s big cliffhangers ony advances a few inches in the new book, and we have more questions than answers.<br /><br />The big plot twist cum cliffhanger at the end is one of Martin's best surprises ever!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I had purchased this stabilizer for my Canon 60D and man was it worth it!   Let's start with aesthetics. I connected my 60d to the front of the stabilizer and put my rode videomic in the stablizer's hot shoe slot and it made my setup look so much more professional. Every time I do video work, people think I have a super expensive setup as compared to before when I used to shoot handheld with my 60D. Which now goes into performance. When I film with this set up, I film with the stabilizer pushed against my right side of my chest, my left hand on the lens, my right hand on the grip of my 60D, and the swivel screen out and facing towards me so I can see what I'm filming. This definitely makes my shots look way more stable compared to shooting handheld. Walking and filming with it can make sorta shaky footage, but if you walk slow and smoothly enough then it wont be shaky. That's pretty much the only down to it when shooting with the 60D.  Overall, I love it. I say for the 35 bucks, the X-Grip is definitely a steal. If you have a Canon 60D, T3i, or any other DSLR that has a swivel screen, then this is a wonderful stabilizer for its price. It has definitely exceeded my expectations.
B003L8GPT8|5.0|Yes better than Frampton!!! Simply the greatest double LP live rock album of all time.    This high quality vinyl set, remastered is just outstanding.  Using a Rega P3/24 turntable, Jensen speakers with SPL of 95, the bottom end on this recording is like standing behind a 747 engine. It will blow you away and shatter windows two blocks away.  John Lords special sound amplifier/looping treatments for the keyboard makes a wall and Ritchie Blackmore was on fire on this tour.
0743454537|1.0|I will indulge in brain-candy from time to time and wasn't expecting great literature when I read this book.  I found the plot cheesy and contrived throughout, but I didn't get really pissed off until the end.  What the hell?  The author spends all this time trying make us think about this difficult question, and then \\"poof,\\" never mind, she can get that kidney anyway.  This was the first, and I can promise you last, book of Jodi Picoult's that I will ever read.  I resent an author copping out so spectacularly.  Perhaps leprechauns could have come down and taken everyone off to a magical little world and they'd all live happily ever after.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|We must remember that up until about 1968/9 monaural was the dominant format for popular music.  The stereo mixes were not given the same priority as the mono ones, and almost treated as an after thought.  So many of the stereo mixes lacked critical overdubs and other finishing touches common to the mono mixes.     The mono mixes of Please Please Me and With The Beatles are the superior versions of those albums.  The reason being is those albums were recorded specifically for monaural sound.  And it can be said that a few other titles sound best in mono as well.    These remastered mono mixes have a refreshed, renewed vitality to them.  You will hear resonant bass guitar, solid drumming and clear harmony vocals.  In particular the song \\"Revolution\\" has more punch and vigor to it.  The opening guitar riff has undiluted impact that is filled with urgency.  The song has a message and wants your attention, and that comes across clearly in the mono mix.  In stereo the impact of the song is diluted in favor of the two channel mix.  The song still carries a message, but it doesn't leap out at you the same as it does in mono.    Fans have asked for the return of the mono Sgt. Pepper for years.  After hearing it in this set I can see why it was so well wished for.  In mono Sgt. Pepper carries a unity that is only suggested in stereo. In short the stereo mix seems a little unfinished when compared to the mono.    The mono White album is another long wished for release.  On vinyl the mono version suffered from some LP mastering and pressing problems.  The album sides play for longer than usual and some compromises had to be made.  On CD those compromises are removed and you will hear the album as sonically intended.  Again the mono mix is crisp and detailed.  But the white album was released at a time when stereo was becoming more the norm.  With that in mind if you have never heard the mono white you will instantly spot the differences in the mixes.  For me neither the mono or the stereo is the superior mix, both have the same appeal.      Lastly, I turn to the collection specific to the mono box, a two disc package called Mono Masters.  This is where you will hear mono mixes of singles and b sides including the a fore mentioned \\"Revolution\\".  Mono Masters returns to us the original mixes of the singles, and playing the collection you get a sense as to why these songs sold boat loads of copies.  The mixes are fresh, progressive and invigorating!  In mono these songs do not blend in and become background fare, they stand out and crave you to listen.  And listen you will, believe me.    To hear The Beatles in mono is not a compromise by any standards.  It is a revelation, an invigoration and a renewal of you as a Beatle fan.
0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has made an art form out of bringing together random information and packaging it within a single context. Sometimes this works well, other times not so much. I agree with many of the other reviewers, that the examples in this book would probably have held together better as a series of articles, and yes, the first half of the book is a more cohesive read than the second. I found the best way to read the book was as a pick up and put down book. If you read a few pages here and there the examples are interesting and make you think, challenging the way you perceive the world and the way you make judgements about it. In this way, the overall premise becomes less of an issue.<br /><br />The more I think about this book the more I wonder whether this was the book he really wanted to write. There are so many examples of racial stereotyping, I wonder whether that was the issue he wanted to tackle, but didn't quite have the courage to write a whole book on such a topic. It's a shame he doesn't because it would make for an interesting read and with his profile it would get a broader audience.
0062060554|5.0|This book has stayed with me long after I finished it. It is a very thought-provoking book. I cannot say whether the protaganists diagnosis could be real, but it makes for a very interesting read with a wow finish that you don't see coming. Takes journaling to a whole new meaning.
B004WKI204|3.0|As someone who was introduced to Tina Fey courtesy of her Sarah Palin sketches, I enjoyed filling in the back story. It's a classic example of how someone becomes an overnight sensation after twenty years of hard work. We see the flash, but not the hours of long days and long nights building a career. My only criticism of the book is that I was left wanting more - a more rounded memoir that fleshed out the gaps between stages in her life. It feels a bit like it was written in a hurry to meet a deadline -  perhaps she was trying to cram it in between the other demands of her life. I think there's more depth to her story, and I'd love to read it.<br /><br />That said, this book is worth buying just for her letter to her daughter. It is absolutely brilliant.

B0002HZLWI|5.0|I bought these for my daughter's first birthday.  My husband and I have really enjoyed building structures for her to knock over with these blocks.  I have enjoyed all of the unusual pieces in the set and find that they encourage me to come up with different structure types than I previously have with more traditional block sets.  I love the texture of these blocks as well (much more \\"wooden-feeling\\" than the rubber wood type).  So far my daughter is just stacking a few at a time, rolling some of the pieces around and holding them up to examine, but in the two months she has had them her interest in them has already increased.  I imagine these will grow well with her over the years.

0553381695|4.0|As another reviewer indicated, there's just enough 'fantasy' to keep your imagination going here, but not too much to the point where you lose interest.  For a reader who does not usually indulge in these kind of fantasies, I can only take so much.  This book (and the one before it) tend towards the less-fantastical.  And frankly, killing off main characters goes straight to this reader's heart of hearts.  I literally have no idea where this series is going - and I'm not just saying that.  Sometimes people say 'I have no idea' and really, they expect the good guys to win, at a very base level.  Not only do I not really 'know' who the good guys are, but if I had to pick, the good guys are in awful shape right now.  And I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't eaten by dragons at the end of this series.  Furthermore, if that happens, it would be awesome.

B000002ADT|5.0|I know that my coach William Vogt cried when I was spinning on the turntable to Flamenco Sketches on my favorite Miles album, as the original 1960s way. But why did the Coach say that I was his worst Mariner after he cried? I am one of his great Mariners on the team. I don't get it. I think he loves Waiting for a Girl Like You so much. This is my favorite Miles album, and a jazz classic, doesn't get any better than this stuff. But I agree, I need to lose weight to Flamenco Sketches, as I heard the Coach said that I need to lose weight because I'm fat. You can hear So What and Freddie Freeloader as the highlights. Miles way to go!!! Jazz live on forever. But my coach also cried to Flamenco Sketches on the LP again when I was playing the ballgame down in San Francisco vs. the Giants doing 50 years when Giants pitcher Stu Miller got blown off the mound and he didn't want me hit a grand slam, why does he always cry to that jazz? I was glad to hit that grand slam.<br /><br />Abner Dubbleplay of Seattle Mariners<br /><br />Kind of Blue is one of my favorite Miles albums. My favorite Miles are the Nixon Miles of In a Silent Way, A Tribute to Jack Johnson, which features his great rock song, Bitches Brew and On the Corner. I hate the last song off this, which makes me cry because it was two decades before my favorite and precious song that I love Waiting for a Girl Like You was released, 1981, especially 1960 and John F. Kennedy era. I love the other songs from this album. We had recently did a video that was about 50 years ago when Stu Miller of the Giants got blown off in the 1961 All Star Game and featured this album on LP, the way it was 50 years ago.<br /><br />Coach William Vogt II of Seattle Mariners

0061784788|5.0|I love this book. Adventure, mayhem, hidden treasure, science and natural disasters--what more could you want? This Sigma Force novel takes place in America and includes the Founding Fathers, Mormon lore and American Indians. While there is a requirement for a suspension of disbelief, the story was so tightly wound, I didn't care. There wasn't a great deal of characterization--there wasn't time because something was always happening. This is my first Sigma Force novel, but it didn't influence my ability to enjoy this book at all. It did exponentially increase my interest in reading earlier entries into the series. Rollins does in an appendix following the book detail what was fact and what was fiction, which I appreciated after the fact, but it did nothing to douse my enthusiasm. This book was right up my alley.
B000PC0ZWQ|5.0|This is a classic French novel that I had wanted to read for a long time. I was not disappointed. It is beautifully written. The characters are well developed and it provides a good sense of the time period. The main character is a somewhat perplexing combination of sheer ambition and wayward love. I admit, I found the ambitious side of his nature more convincing, but towards the end of the novel that seems to have given way to a more philosophical frame of mind. I purchased both the paperback and the Kindle versions. I am happy to have it in both of my libraries.

1567184855|5.0|I attended the last workshop that Dr. Newton conducted for the general public before he retired.  After retiring, Dr. Newton has limited his work to training younger therapists in how to conduct an LBL (Life between Lives) regression in which the patient is able to retrieve the memories of his or her life in heaven.  Heaven is our real home.  It is where we spend most of our time -- between a long series of physical lives here on Earth.  This is a book backed up by science-based inquiry, observation and fact gathering.  It is not a book that is based upon opinion, philosophy or theology.  It is the most profound book that you will ever read.  And it will change your view of the world and your place in it forever.  It will also enable you to evolve spiritually much more quickly than you could on your own.  After reading this book, read Dr. Newton's second book: [[ASIN:1567184995 Destiny of Souls: New Case Studies of Life Between Lives]].

159562015X|2.0|This started off on a shifty prospect.  I have to buy their book to take the test?  Really?  Why?     I take the test and a few times I was thinking of the answers and it went on to the next question, not allowing me to finish.  Strike two.    Then I got the results that were in some cases what I want to be viewed as my strengths but actually were not.  I just know how to answer questions.  In some cases the so called strength was a dead in for me.  Kind of a \\"so-what\\" moment.  I didn't care for any of what it told me to do as an action plan so some of them left me flat and uninspired.    But my biggest beef is that I know people who, for the life of me, I can't figure out ANY strength of theirs.  This program forces everyone to supposedly have 5 of 34 strengths whether you really possess all of them or none of them.    Waste of time and money.

B0048WQDIE|1.0|Fifteen dollars in the Canadian Kindle store for a novel that is almost 60 years old.  Ridiculous.  Boycott greedy Simon and Schuster and all of their books and authors.  Their prices are way out of line.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|For music from the '30s to sound this good. This collection surpasses all. Honestly, I love my old vinyl and cassettes and CDs of this material with hisses, clicks and pops.. but THIS... you can almost hear the man breathe! His fingers sliding across the strings... Johnson's voice, scary and playful and soulful and timeless. No need to go over the set list here, you likely already know this music well. I thought I did, too until I heard the first note... it was like finding Robert Johnson all over again.
0385523394|4.0|A woman who gets busted for a drug offense spends a year in the clink and goes on to tell us about it.  She offers a much different view of life in a women's prison than what the cliche made-for-TV movies portray.     Our prisoner/story-teller is talented and funny (sometimes hilarious), and she does a good job helping you imagine yourself on the inside.  She describes interesting and complex social systems,  prison food (\\"home-made\\" and otherwise), and talks about some of the abuses that go on.  She also introduces you to a cast of characters who have real moxie.  A quick read, very enjoyable.
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|When trying to escape Gargamel (Hank Azaria), a small group of smurfs (Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Grouchy, Brainy, Clumsy and Gutsy) stumble into a magic portal that transports them to NYC. There they meet Patrick Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris) and his pregnant wife Grace (Jayma Mays) and....give Patrick the practice he needs to be a father \\"I'm serious!.\\"<br />  While the Smurfs need a blue moon to get home and Gargamel \\"who followed them to NYC\\" is closely catching up to them. Can they warm up Patrick to the idea of having a kid \\"I'm serious\\" and also escape the wrath of Gargamel ?<br />  The first 10 minutes \\"or less\\" are like the show and have the Smurf Village, then the ingenious \\"being sarcastic\\" screenwriter J. David Stem came up with the idea to transport the smurfs to NYC. He also gave us a Scottish smurf named Gusty Smurf (Alan Cummings) that wasn't even in the show and him being in the movie doesn't even make sense when they are all related and no one else is Scottish. Smurfs being used for an upcoming father to warm up to father hood...is also pretty lame.<br />  As a fan of the show, I was surprisingly amused by a lot of the jokes though, like how they poke fun at how the smurfs use the word smurf...to describe everything. Gargamel's cat Asriel also supplies some laughs, while the movie has enough heart and charm to be one of the better films based on a cartoon series. Still, I have to ask myself, \\"who the smurf! came up with that horrible plot!\\", oh yeah, J. David Stem. I guess he was watching Enchanted while writing the script and thought \\"wow that same exact story will work for the Smurfs!.\\" What the Smurf was he thinking!! I heard 2 sequels are planned and I really hope they just leave the smurfs in the Smurf Village, we don't need them transported to...Iraq \\"oops I just gave Hollywood there next big idea.\\"
