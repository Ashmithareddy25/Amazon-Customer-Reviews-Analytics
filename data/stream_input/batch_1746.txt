B005FUTBWS|1.0|Red State (Kevin Smith, 2011)<br /><br />So I finally saw Red State, Kevin Smith's controversial thriller that combines the Fred Phelps cult with the Waco disaster, and I have come to the exact conclusion I expected to: Kevin Smith is as incompetent at making thrillers as he is at making comedies. It's a terrible, terrible movie, which I was expecting--but I will admit, I wasn't expecting it to be terrible in the ways in which it is.<br /><br />Plot: a crazy-wingnut religious group in Texas, known worldwide for protesting at the funerals of homosexuals (sound familiar?), entraps three youngsters (Sky High`s Michael Angarano, The Perks of Being a Wallflower`s Nicholas Braun, and The Haunting in Connecticut`s Kyle Gallner) with the promise of wild, uninhibited antics with an older woman. This, plus a coincidental sideswipe-and-run accident involving the sheriff of the podunk town where the church has its headquarters), brings the attention of the law on the church's compound, and within hours, the sheriff (No Country for Old Men`s Stephen Root) and a CIA task force headed by Special Agent Joseph Keenan (John Goodman) are parked outside the compound, just waiting for something to happen. And oh, does something happen...<br /><br />I was going to say \\"let's begin with the script\\", but in all honesty, every shortcoming this movie has both begins and ends with the script, which is ludicrous. Now, if you follow my reviews at all, you will know that I am not normally the kind of guy that's going to get on a script for gratuitous anything (come on, I'm the guy trying to make the case that porn films should be reviewed just like everything else!), but the amount of profanity in the first five minutes of this script is about the same as one would get in the entire script of most R-rated films. And, SPOILER ALERT: it never cleans up, nice or otherwise. Come on, folks, there's a point at which you go beyond \\"gritty realism\\" and into the land of \\"utterly ridiculous.\\" (There's a great, great scene in Chris Smith's American Movie where a couple of actors are rehearsing a scene and Mark Borchardt steps in to show them how he thinks it should be done that's been my benchmark for this sort of thing since 1999. Mark Borchardt could have easily written this script...)<br /><br />Now, pile on top of this a number of long, talky, entirely unnecessary scenes that seem to have been added for the sole purpose of bulking this out into feature-length territory. The first scene inside the church itself, where ultra-bad-guy Abin Cooper (Kill Bill`s Michael Parks) is sermonizing to his flock, goes on at least five minutes longer than it should (and feels like it goes on at least a half-hour more than that). I'm almost willing to cut the movie some slack for its final sequence, which is another completely unnecessary bit (save that it explains the literal deus ex machina in the climax... but the fact that there is a deus ex machina, and that it needs explained afterwards, is a weakness in itself that no filmmaker who has gone beyond Film 101 should be indulging in), because it affords one of the cast's excellent actors--can't tell you who, that's a spoiler--to not only show he still has chops, but that in the hierarchy of really-damned-good actors in this flick, he's still at the top of the food chain, thankyouverymuch. But all the rest of them should have been left on the cutting-room floor. This is a thriller, Mr. Smith. Worse yet, it was originally billed as a horror film. Thankfully, your marketing department saved your behind on that one before it got released...<br /><br />There are a lot of people here in front of the camera who are very good at what they do. Unfortunately, they are continually sabotaged while attempting to do their best with it. The result is a paceless, plotless mess that I wish I could say could only have been made by Kevin Smith.

B009NPKTN6|5.0|A quick trip back to the life of the 80's.  Music was great and entertaining.  If your looking for a real plot or story line - this isn't it.  If you just want not to think and re-live the 80's and your youth for a little while - this is the movie.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|The ghost of Jar Jar Binks is back, ruining what could have been a good movie. This time he shows up as the two bumbling fools, the guys who do everything wrong and defy all logic. One guy is basically Begbie from Trainspotting, looks kinda like him, sounds kinda like him, and acts kinda like him. Who takes psychopaths on the most important mission ever? Ridley Scott, apparently. Then you have the bigger idiot, who is basically Skipper from Sex and the City, goofy, naive, etc.<br />I propose that someone edit this movie removing every moment of these guys on screen. I am sure we'll at least have a better movie. Everything they are involved in is a subplot at best and does not really affect the shit hitting the fan. Even if it does, a little mystery could go a long way. I might be able to forgive the \\"daddy doesn't love me\\" stuff and the \\"really?\\" tacked-on ending... Please don't let RS ruin Blade Runner with a twilight career sequel.

B007IQWQ88|5.0|For nostalgia junkies like me, this set is yet another must-have.  Even if you're not an ardent fan of HvK (and I certainly am not, though I find the man and his artistry remarkable in many ways--not all of it positive), this set is definitely worth having for the lavish presentation as well as for just having a small slice of recorded-music history. HvK's output of recordings was prodigious, but many (including myself) would say that the 1960s were his best years, which is precisely what this set gives us. (At least from Deutsche Grammophon, his primary label doing this period.)  The ultra-smooth sheen and lack of sharp edges so characteristic of his conducting style were never more in evidence than here, with few of the mannerisms and oddities of tempo and phrasing that were to creep into his recordings over the next couple of decades.  Some standout performances: a galvanic and riveting Bruckner 9th and Prokofiev 5th, lean and sinewy performances of Sibelius's Symphonies 4-7 and tone poems, a chilling Bartok 'Music for Strings, Percussion, & Celesta', and of course the famous 1962 set of Beethoven symphonies.<br /><br />I haven't made direct comparisons with previous CD issues, but I think one can assume that the latest-available remasterings were used; indeed, all of the discs themselves are emblazoned with DG's \\"Original-Image Bit Processing\\" logo. Now while this might strike fear in the hearts of audiophile purists, my ears tell me that the remastering engineers have left well enough alone: the recordings I've sampled sound naturally balanced and ungimmicky (unlike what HvK's DG recordings were to become later).<br /><br />DG's packaging is as lavish as they come, with gorgeous reproductions of the original LP cover art (front and back) in glossy cardboard sleeves.  (Though I must say that the colors seem ever-so-slightly muted in many cases, at least compared with their 'regular' CD reissues, but this is a small complaint--they generally look gorgeous.)  Thelarge booklet includes a long essay on HvK (of course) and also lists the complete contents of the discs, along with full recording information.  And to top it off, there are 5 reproductions of recording-session logs from the DG team.
B001BANK32|5.0|I originally read this about 25-30 years ago as a youngish boy.<br /><br />It's still great.<br /><br />I'm sure the gajillion reviews available out there already cover the hot review-points, so I'll make quick of this:<br /><br />Simply put, it's a good idea and story.  And, it's written well.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"Mommy's face was pale, and there were horrible brownish bruises on her neck where Daddy had tried to...where Daddy had tried to hug her too tight.\\"<br /><br />That's just one of many morsels from the book which is simultaneously frightening and darkly humorous (sort of).<br /><br />The thing that bothers me is that anyone could possibly give this book a 1-star rating.  There are, in my opinion, very, very, very few books deserving of a true 1-star rating.  Are you saying that the book was mechanically unsound & poorly written; had a horrible plot; was badly constructed; had undeveloped characters; and no redeeming qualities whatsoever?  Does this book really strike you that way?<br /><br />Or was it just that you didn't like it?  Was it just a topic you did not fancy?  Was the ending not what you wanted to see?  Was something left to your imagination and you prefer to have things clearly resolved for you?<br /><br />But, again, that's just my opinion and why it is rare that I will give a book a 1-star rating.  I will even bump it up a notch if I see that other people have found joy in the book when I did not...because the writer obviously knew how to please an audience...just not me.<br /><br />But, I digress - how silly of me.  I suppose that was the defensive, paternal instinct coming out.<br /><br />It's a great book, give it a try!

B004PGAQMW|5.0|Thank goodness \\"Megamind\\" was finally made available on Amazon for my Kindle.  I somehow got addicted to this movie.  I'm not sure who the writers wrote this movie for - kids, or 25 to 40 year-old females like me.  This darn movie never gets old.  It's a love story at its heart, so women my age (particulary those who have extra interests in the superhero genre) will love it.  It also happens to be my son's favorite movie, but that could be just because I've watched it so many times.
0060935464|5.0|When it comes to a spellbinding story told efficiently with heartfelt love, few titles can compare to Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Heck, none can.  Like most people, I was introduced to this classic while in high school; it was one of the few books I was \\"force fed\\" that I ended up enjoying immensely.  Over the years I've returned to this inspiring tale about growing up in the Depression South--a place that could be downright ugly and archaic, if not for the innocent point of view of 9-year-old Scout Finch.  To Scout, life pretty much consists of trailing big brother Jem and Dill Harris--who spends summers in Maycomb with his aunt--in their adventures \\"outing\\" the local boogey man, Boo Radley.  The harsh realities of intense segregation are lost on Scout; she's just a tomboy living in a small town with Jem and her attorney father, Atticus.  It's not until Atticus agrees to defend a young black man accused of raping a white woman that Scout discovers a disquieting truth about her town. . .about the culture of racial prejudice.  And Scout and Jem even become victims of this ugliness, until they are saved by a most unlikely hero.<br /><br />My goodness, can Ms. Lee write.  Her prose is simple and direct--with this author less is definitely more--but her passages, descriptions, observations, and dialogues are mesmerizing.  From a spinster neighbor showing Scout her bridge work, to the courtroom loft of African-Americans rising to their feet in tribute to Atticus, Lee's story brings Maycomb and its people to rich, dynamic life.  Atticus Finch is a literary icon, and rightly so; a gentle, patient, and loving father to his motherless children, Atticus never does things because they are expedient, he does things because they are right, and because, as he tells Scout, he could never hold his head high if he didn't do the right thing.  This is a character who flows through the narrative leading by example in the eyes of his children--in the eyes of the reader.  I always feel it's redundant rhetoric whenever I hear someone lament that Harper Lee only wrote one novel.  As flawless and as timeless as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is, what more would Lee have to show or prove?<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.ys feel it's redundant rhetoric whenever I hear someone lament that Harper Lee only wrote one novel.

0547884591|5.0|I bought this book to see how someone like Tim Ferriss aquires skills. I believe a book like this speaks to the beginner in all of us. If you have ever tried to learn a new skill or language, but given up due to steep entry curve then this is your book. The stories and examples are personable and that helps to motivate me into action. The advice and tips are enough to get you started and from there you can explore on your own.<br /><br />Visually the book is stunning. I own both the hardcover and kindle versions, but find myself reading the hardcover more often due to its beautiful layout. The material just seems to be represented better. However, there are times when you just don't want to lug a 675 page book around and the Kindle version fills in nicely.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I have read Tim's two previous books and enjoyed them. If you have read Tim's other books you will see some familiar topics, but there is a lot of new material as one would expect. I am currently following the Slow-Carb diet and am drawn to the recipes featured in the book even if I don't become a world class chef. Finally, As the title of my review says I am focused more on skill acquisition. I have devoured the meta-learning section and am re-reading it to make sure I haven't missed anything. I don't expect to to dig into the cooking section until this weekend when all the Thanksgiving excitement settles down. will try to update this review once I have worked through the cooking sections.
B001P36OY2|5.0|A cyberpunk film based on the cataclysmic idea that one day our world will be a series of wastelands- What can I say, I love this kind of film. Intelligent in the way it weaves a well told tale of the anti hero that wants out of hell rushing towards a new life.<br /><br />If you loved Gattica, The Fifth Element, and Blade Runner, then this film will not disappoint. If you are  looking for a Casablanca, or some other film of that ilk, you will not like this movie at all.<br /><br />I love all of Vin Diesel's films, as a whole they are the types of movies I can watch again and again. When I want to be entertained, I reach for one of his videos. When I want Jane Eyre, or Wuthering Heights, I reach for those videos---<br /><br />In other words, films are only as perfect as the mood you are in at the time of watching them.<br /><br />It's that simple!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I got this, then I tried to play, and I found it near impossible to move, due to the fact that to use the controlled, you have to &quot;slightly&quot; go to the left.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Save your time and money and finish with the second one. I mean, the storyline, when there actually WAS a storyline' was good. It's just there wasn't much of one. There aren't enough moments of suspense or excitement. We get it, it's a raunchy romance, there's sex in here, but it's major overkill in this third part of the series. I gave it a 3 because apparently I'm a generous star giver. The end.
B004FPZ2KY|5.0|I've seen several movie versions of the book, and decided to read it again since the first time that I read it was in high school in 1964.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|My first box set was pretty banged up in shipping and I will say that a lot of my stuff comes nicely pre-damaged from UPS.<br />My regular driver will sometimes ask me if I want to open items before he leaves because he knows I am just going to have to re-box and go through the hassle of starting a return and then dropping off.<br /><br />The upper corner on the top of the first set was completely crushed.<br />Oh how my heart sank, I like to show my friends and family the cool vinyl sets I have collected.<br /><br />Thinking this may be a really limited (or possibly low numbered, and by the way, no it's not) box set I decided to give it a listen through before returning.<br />I remember reading somewhere that the Beatles only recorded something like 520 minutes of music. So one by one I opened and listed carefully. I have to say that the records that didn't have no fill issues sounded really really good to me.<br /><br />On some of my favorite songs though there where definite pressing issues, on one song only one channel of sound played (weird) and on a few others the dreaded zipper like sounding of no fill noise was present. It was very random on the first set I got. I also noted that some of the vinyl records themselves it looked like they weren't completely pressed or cut all the way through from the factory and there a bunch of long vinyl shavings that needed to be removed from the edges.<br /><br />Also it should be noted that most of the records in this set also had minor warping but not enough to affect their playability on my system.<br /><br />My replacement box set arrived very promptly but again was pretty banged up in shipping. The outer sleeve that slides over the set itself was somehow ripped. Still not sure how that one happened, maybe it was ripped by the amazon reboxers when they did their bubble pack job???<br /><br />At that point my thoughts where unless I could get a different retailer and carrier (like Fed Ex, or even USPS) I wouldn't be getting a box set in decent enough shape through amazon and ups. But all of that may not matter due to the quality issues of the box set itself.<br /><br />My thoughts are that amazon did a sub par job packing these box sets. On both of the sets I received the outer shipping box was huge ( you could have fit 3 or 4 box sets in them ) and was only filled with the bubble bags. The first one had the box set on one side and bubble bags filling the box. That may explain the crushed edge as it looked like ups had crunched the box in shipment. The second set had been bubble wrapped 1 time around and then stuck in it's big box. There was lot of room in there for the 24lb box set to flip and flop around on it's bumpy ups ride to me. What a shame as I really wanted this box set. At this point though I just think I am going to look for something else and hope they do better the next time.<br /><br />Updated:<br /><br />I read another review here where someone who didn't buy the set put up a 5 star review??? Concerned it may bring the overall rating up on this crap shoot. Just wanted to do my part.

I will have to grab the next two silo stories as well, just to sate my cravings for all things SILO.

B004KO803G|5.0|The other reviews here paint an accurate portrait of how Red Fang sounds, so I won't attempt to explain any better than others already have. I love it, and recommend checking them out if you haven't. I just wanted to post a review for the other vinyl purchasers out there. This was labeled a 'Limited Edition', which I incorrectly assumed was their pizza picture disc available on the Relapse site store. This isn't the picture disc (at least mine wasn't), but is the normal LP. I have yet to find anything 'limited' about it yet, but I don't have another version to compare it to. I also ordered the self titled Red Fang vinyl at the same time I ordered this, and the self titled album shipped with a download coupon to obtain the MP3z from their Bandcamp site. The Murder the Mountains vinyl I received did not come with a download coupon (maybe that's what is 'limited' about it, ha ha). Red Fang is an awesome band and the vinyl still shipped quickly and arrived in great condition, so no complaints.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am a John Grisham fan and this book did not disappoint. It is not his best but its an OK read. It took me under 48hours to read the whole thing because I couldn't wait to get off work and keep reading. The story can be made into a great movie with the right actors. He sold the plot in a way to keep you guessing until close to the end when things came together. If you like John's writing, you'll enjoy this read.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I happen to see a commercial for this movie that showed Channing Tatum<br />dancing, which really peaked my curiosity. Enough so I rented it on Amazon's Instant Videos.<br />I was a bit nervous about what else would go on, but I figured it wouldn't be over the top.<br /><br />The story was okay, and the acting was pretty good, but I really enjoyed Channing Tatum's<br />dancing. He is a pretty believable male dance entertainer. Beyond having a great physique he has interesting moves.  I found his dance scenes the best. Matthew McConaughy also was mesmerizing as the barker & occasional dance Star of his adult male dance show. I found the plot a bit predictable but watchable. I would recommend Magic Mike for Channing Tatum's dance moves.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|The PS3's controller is just kinda small and causes my hand to cramp after some longer game sessions, plus I don't like the stick layout.  I Love the xbox360 controller.  So when I found this controller I thought it was perfect!...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Great Layout.  (Offset Sticks)<br />2) Buttons light up. (Kinda Cool)<br />3) Aggressive Hand Grips. (lil more than xbox360)<br />4) Hand grips are bumpy.<br />5) Internal Rechargeable battery. (Guess this could be + or -... No AA batteries to replace, we will see how long it lasts after some recharging)<br />6) Wireless.  (Also can be used wired (cord included) if battery is low or dies)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Small Dead Spots in Sticks. (Kinda hard to get pin point long range accuracy)<br />2) Small Delay. (Noticed a small delay in button pushing)<br />3) PS button does NOT turn on System. (you can turn off the system but NOT on)<br /><br />All and all I do like the controller.  Not gonna jump up and down or light off fireworks but its better than the PS3 Orig.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Brilliant, spiritual, surprisingly funny. I didn't want it to end! Please, treat yourself to a journey with Pi! You'll be glad you did!
030746363X|5.0|I've held off writing a review for this book until I was done with a few experiments.II was skeptical of some of the claims but kept an open mind. After more than a year of implementing he advice given i can say that it has definitely worked for me. the experiments tried include...<br /><br />- Geek to Freak, gained 4.8kg of lean muscle in 5 weeks with 4.5 hours in the gym total.<br />- Slow carb eating resulting in a drop of 3% body fat (down to 14%) in 6 weeks<br />- Boosting testosterone through food. Very easy and surprisingly effective.<br /><br />I was not a health freak coming in to these experiments. As a beginner I found the principles easy to follow and very effective. My mood improved and my energy levels went up. is this the only way to get results? I doubt it. But it did what it promised to do and I give Mr.Ferriss full credit to delivering.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|What's not to love? This series is super funny and it not just for the kids. The group is growing by one and adventure is right around the corner when Sid is envolved because trouble just naturally find him.
1442444053|5.0|I once heard someone say that there are books we enjoy reading and books we enjoy having read.<br />Watership Down is the former.<br />This is a book I find myself coming back to again and again. The story is compelling, characters well drawn and well paced. A firm favourite.
B008S847X2|3.0|Oh dear...this is what I call a typical Abstract Logix album,high on group interplay and musicianship but utterly lacking in emotion and soul.After the excitement of John re-discovering his self ( and his guitar sound) on the last album ( after too many poor efforts) I'd expected this re-birth to continue..but no.We revert to the usual tired cliches and frenetic interplay.Am I the only one who thinks that the drums are mixed way,way too far in the front and are too loud? Less is more,fellas..really. Add John's obsession with the dreary synth/guitar ( why doesn't he just play that wonderful electric guitar more?) and it's just another fusion album.No soul,no emotion however many difficult notes they play.Have they all forgotten why the jazz fusion movement ( thankfully) fizzled out in the mid to late seventies??? Mahavishnu proved that high levels of musicianship could sit happily with emotion in music..as did Shakti but this? It's all very clever and no doubt some will wonder at the frenetic interplay but it's sterile,going through the motions fusion..I've heard it all before on many occasions.Sorry John,you're still my hero but go back to the basics,throw away that synth guitar and get back to producing music that moved us,that changed our lives.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A fan of Mr. Grisham's novels, I was surprised and disappointed by this often-vacuous book.  We would rather wait longer than read less sooner ...
B008EL4YX6|4.0|This game is pretty cool. It's interesting. I think it's worth trying. If you don't like it, then uninstall it. No harm done.
0007447868|3.0|First and foremost - this is not a bad book. It took me a little while to get into it. I had to push aside some of my biases, but once I got into it I found it very enjoyable. That said, this is still the least entertaining of a superior series. The biggest issue is that A Feast for Crows, the fourth in the A song of Ice and Fire series does, not deal with most of the series most popular characters. No Tyrion Lannister, no Jon Snow, no Daenerys Targaryen. These are the character that the faithful readers keep coming back for. Reportedly, these characters were originally to be in this volume, but the size of the book became unwieldy and Martin decided to divide it into two volumes. He made the division by character arcs instead of by chronology. Therefore, the first half of the fifth book, A Dance with Dragons, features these missing characters during the same time frame as the events of this fourth volume.<br />Now, enough of what A Feast for Crows doesn't have. We are introduced to new characters here. We are given insight into lesser known characters. Cersei Lannister has her own chapters as does her brother/lover Jaime. Brienne is featured. There's a great arc involving Sam. The creepy and mysterious drowned men are introduced. The disappointment isn't in that this is a lesser book, it's that midway through a series Martin has pushed his principle characters into the wings and brought the supporting cast forward. Ah, but what a cast! Martin is a master at character development. Some of the best characters in all contemporary literature reside in this series. Conclusion: If you haven't yet started A song of Ice and Fire, start at the beginning with A Game of Thrones. Once you get to A Feast for Crows, give it a chance. It really is a good book. Just temporarily set aside the fact that you're reading about characters with whom you're not yet very familiar. Give it time. You'll get on board.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is EPIC!!! I love it and have been addicted to it since it came out. I don't think I'll ever get sick of it. I've never heard of anyone not loving this game. Couldn't love the graphics more. Way too cute. Can't wait for PvZ 2!!!!! :)
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I walked into this movie with moderate expectations but after watching it was very dissapointed.  Its overly CG'd and poorly done.  Want my advice, stay away from this one.
B004V5A7K8|2.0|This game is okay. I love brick blaster games but there's better ones out there than this one. Ones that have better graphics, better level designs, and cool things that drop down that change your paddle. I'd suggest finding a better brick blaster game.
0071422943|5.0|Just about anything you need to know on hand about almost any chemical engineering problem. If its not there there are references.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I thought it couldn't be very fun cause it has a very simple concept but the graphics are adorable and it's actually pretty addictive and fun. I'm always trying to be my high score.
0792846443|5.0|This movie is really a good movie to watch.  I remember seeing this movie several years ago and I still enjoyed every bit of this movie even today.  This crazy woman who claims she was his number one fan was an acting performance which was fascinating to watch.  I would recommend this movie.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Super fun and addictive! Very challenging but not frustrating. Love the graphics for this game! Keep your mind sharp by playing this game.
141659521X|3.0|It's sort of okay if you like super heroes. Rapp is hard to believe. he's such a perfect and ruthless agent that he<br />Really belongs in a comic book.  Do I sense a bit of right wing politics as the sub message?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is interesting and fun. I appreciate that there are so many levels to this game so I can't finish the entire game in an hour.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The story told in this book rings so true to me.  It's convinced me to go wheat free.  Thank you!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I always enjoyed sudoku. I like most games that make me use my brain. They are much more fun and entertaining.  It's easier to play sudoku on the go using my phone than to bring a book with.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It is a grim book about a grim subject, North Korea, yet it was not depressing to read. It is 1984  in present time.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game doesn't need to be reviewed again. We all already know that pretty much everyone enjoys this game. It's great for kids as well as adults.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is perfect for mynephews who are big fans of Phineas and Ferb.  I also have fun playing it. A good mix of logic and problem solving
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This app is a great thinking game. Thinking games are my favorite. I can see this game being fun to a lot of people. I would definately recommend it.
B007EE5820|5.0|Arnold is a very intelligent man. There  is a lot more to braun than the average person thinks and Arnold is very diverse and interesting to read about.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Much more fun than I thought it would be. I like the graphics. Very cute. It's a pretty interesting game. Glad I gave it a shot.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This is a bit better than the other album. i just love the songs on take me home. i hope that anyone that buys this love it as much as i do!!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Bought this set after watching Prometheus. I loved the movie and had never watched the older ones. I'm not big on most older movies usually but these movies did not disappoint. They were great and the video/sound quality was exceptional especially considering how old the movies are. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who has also been living under a rock.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I bought the book for my kindle and a LOT of links are broken or -which is worse- they send me to a wrong page.<br />Sometimes I ended up in a loop and the only way to get out of it was to go to he next chapter and find my way backwords... not easy, since the table of contents just lists the beginning of the macrochapters.<br />It makes everything very frustrating.<br /><br />Amazon customer service was super kind and super quick and sent me an updated version... which still has several of these glitches.<br /><br />As for the content, I was enjoying my read...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A few of my fellow bookaholic friends read YA and this series' name has come up more than a handful of times. Most recently it came up due to the fact that is being made into a movie expected to be released next summer (2013). The hype surrounding the movie continues to escalate as the cast has been selected and now fans await a movie trailer to be showed.<br /><br />Back to the book, I `listened' to this book as there are not enough hours in the day to be able to read all the books I want to read. Thankfully the day job is one where I can work and feed my book addiction with audio books.<br /><br />I was surprised as to how much I actually liked the story/book. The author did a phenomenal job creating a world different from ours but providing enough details/information for us to believe it could actually exist. However, where she excelled in that world building is that she didn't lose the audience nor did the character fall to the back burner.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, we have our main heroes and heroines. Yes they are plural as there are more than one and I think they each are heroes/heroines within their own rights. Though in the literally world I'm sure the others would be considered more of the \\"beta\\" hero/heroine.<br /><br />I love Jace! I do! It's a shame he's a minor! He's a smart ass, sarcastic, born bad-ass and hot! This is where I remind myself that he is a minor (again). Jace keeps things entertaining and the momentum moving forward. He hides his emotions and protects his true self from others due to the losses he has endured. What is it about guys like that that make smart, independent, strong woman (like myself) turn to mush and just want to make things aright fro them? Well, maybe because he's hot (darn it - MINOR).<br /><br />Clary has been thrown into a world she knows nothing about and must rely on complete strangers to keep her alive. Then the truth begins to unravel and we join Clary in the discovery of who she really is.<br /><br />The tension between these two is undeniable. They have chemistry. She has it bad for him and for the first time in his life, he has feeling for someone like never before. Remember, this is a series and though they may end up together, they are not together in this book. And talk about obstacles. Of all the reasons one would be able to come up with as to why these two should not be together, the author comes up with a doozie.<br /><br />Enter our Beta Hero and of course, being that this is a YA, here's the love triangle.  Ah Simon! The doting, always there for you BFF! It's obvious from the start so I'm not spoiling anything for you. He also provides some of the humor and sarcasms!  We empathize with Simon for I'm sure we have been in his shoes before in our past.<br /><br />Aleck and Isabel are also beta heroes/heroines in my eyes! They are siblings whose family adopt Jace at a very young age. They each bring balance to Jace and Clary. Alec is the voice of reason while Isabel is the fearless, independent \\"Let's do this\\" girl.<br /><br />Each of the characters have their strengths and their insecurities. They are still trying to define themselves and see where they fit into the world. Classic young adult stuff, right? Well, now add that they are Shadow Hunters and fight demons. Up the antes just a tad.<br /><br />There are only one or two times throughout the story where I thought \\"Jeez such teenage angst\\" and then \\"Duh\\" I remind myself that it's a YA silly hahaha. Like I said this only happened once or twice. So I totally get why my \\"adult\\" friends enjoy reading this YA. It's about the story. The age of the characters isn't a major factor. In fact, you at times forget that they are teenagers. I love it when an author makes you forget about those types of details, when they create a world where you can \\"implant\\" yourself as part of the story. Though I will say I miss the limitless energy I had when I was 18 and 19 yrs old.<br /><br />The villains are bad! Evil as they should be! They are also shrouded in secrecy that you discover little by little as you read. The powers they will, the plans they have and their reasons are not just plopped in front of you. I do enjoy it when an author shares information but doesn't paint the whole picture for you.<br /><br />Some of the reviews I've read have mentioned the absence of parents/adult guardians. Making it seem like the kids are on their own and running a mock. This actually isn't the case. Keep in mind who is telling the story. They are! So their world revolves around them and what's going on in their immediate circle and at that moment.  My mom was always ( and I do mean ALWAYS) around but if I were to tell you something back then, I'd leave her out of my story. The adults are there and are involved in the teenagers' lives.<br /><br />I loved \\"City of Bones\\" and immediately uploaded the second book onto my iPod. Devour both books. I have the 3rd one now waiting for me. But I'm being a good girl and getting reviews up  and posted before getting to far into the series.ould be!

B000I186FW|5.0|Best and most universally enjoyable political movie ever. Hugo Weaving has an incredible masked personality. It's a must-see every November 4th or 5th ... or both, and then some :)
B0086700CM|5.0|it had been a while since i played it on my cousions i pod on when i got a kindle fire that was my first game that downloaded. i knew this was going to be epic
B0088WGBC8|4.0|Anything with Denzel Washington is a good bet and this did not disappoint.  Was pleasantly surprised that Ryan Reynolds came off somewhat credible in an action flick.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|yes i was very happy with the item and the fast delivery  thank you i used to hear this  while in collage in ill in the 80s i'm now 71 years old and well
B009VB97EY|3.0|This was definitely a Chick Flick, but it was better than expected, from a male point of view.  The plot was pretty thin, but it was still entertaining.
0800141849|5.0|This is one of my favorites in my movie vault.  I enjoy the theme song too by Bryan Adams and Barbra Streisand.<br /><br />I found the chemistry between Jeff and Barbra wonderful in this film.  It's a goofy, fun look at two academics who are worlds apart but come together through chance and a little planning.  The film is cute, feel good and Jeff Bridges provides some great eye candy as the nerdy, shy professor.<br /><br />Nerdy, sweet romance that does not disappoint.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game.....hard to put down!!! Simple enough for my three year old to play and challenging enough to keep me entertained. still trying to beat the timed trials.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I don't hate it - one star apparently reflecting 'hate', according to your scale - 'hate' is too emotionally-charged for such bland, idiotic and nondescript writing. Such 'prose' - for want of a better word - would  never have made  it through the most elementary creative writing class. And the same goes for the content. I have only one comment left, one made by another reviewer:: 'the author must have laughed all the way to the bank.'
B003THHIEM|5.0|I really really like Castle.  The stories are good, the chemistry is good, and the violence is minimal.  There aren't many shows on any more that offer that.  This is one of them.  I like watching the shows without commercial breaks (as on the dvd's).  I am very happy to own this set.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Just something I was looking for, for my grandson for Christmas! He is constantly doing Lego creations and he is on a traveling soccer team. I think I will get a great response with this present!! Thank you!
B00846REIS|5.0|Read first two books of this series and love it definitly a good read.  Eagerly waiting on the 3rd book.
B008578JI0|4.0|This is the story of some very brave airmen, and a key segment of history; but the real point was that watching this preview convinced me to rent the actual feature.  Both are worth watching.
B0063IH60K|1.0|First, it asked my age. Then, a few moments later, it asked my gender. On next use, I got an animated ad blocking the game. I deleted it before it asked for my bank account and showed me dancing diamonds and gold......
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I've read all of Jane Austen's classics.  Emma is my favorite one.  I've read it twice.  I really connected with each of the characters and the story unfolds in a compelling fashion. Austen's writing is impeccable and a effortless joy to read.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a really great dvd.  Not only does my grandaughter love it, but I think it's a cute movie too.  It arrived well within the alloted time frame, was well packaged, and very reasonably priced.  Made a good addition to my kids collection.  Thanks Amazon for having so many options for buying older dvd's.  I really appreciate it.  Ellen P.
B009T1J0PM|4.0|This is a very entertaining book.<br />I'm 12 and my mate recommend it to me. I loved it and its a nice brake from harder reads.<br />You should read it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I did purchased This Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol DVD for my Nephew's Birthday. And That's one of our all-time favorite movie.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Yea we know make a game about once every 5 months ok and make the game about a rip off price.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|I set this up for a friend i got it for his birthday, and there are jsut some hoops you have to jump through to get it to work with most games is not just plug and play.
B005IQZB14|5.0|We read this book for our book club.  I really enjoyed it, especially since she was on the PCT in Oregon and was ended at Cascade Locks, just down the road from where I live.  It was suspenseful in many ways because she was a woman hiking alone and I was fearful for her.  It was a good ending!
B000VI12ZS|5.0|A must see, over and over. Nicholas Cage brought his all in this historic movie. They got theyre fact straight. Two thumbs up!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I thought there were a lot of great deadpan, sarcastic lines in this movie that made it an enjoyable version of the original storyline.  This is definitely more of a comedic homage to, rather than a remake of, the original, but I think that was the best way to go with classic material like this.  I very much enjoyed this - Johnny Depp has become one of my favorite actors through the years and I always look forward to see what he will do with a role.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I may not be able to finish this book, it is so boring my mind keeps wandering.  Ms. Reichs needs to leave this character and challenge herself to writing good fiction again. We loved this character many years ago, but like a TV show that we have all loved, there comes a time when it seems like the names, places, and circumstances change, but the endings are predictable.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Amazing! This is so much different than the first season.  This is a freaky show, but I am so drawn to it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really was lost in it. Nice twists and turns.  Couldn't give it five stars cuz I wasn't that crazy about the ending..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I loved it I'm so brony and I could help but try it and it's so adorable my kindle got 20% cooler!
030758836X|3.0|I read this book based on some very positive feedback from friends, and I was enthralled...until the last chapter. The ending is unbearably disappointing, I'm sorry to have to say. Up until that point I was reading with a pounding heart - couldn't put it down - my husband would see me reading it during the day, which I never do. I couldn't wait to suggest it to all my friends and family. It is, I have to say, brilliantly written, but I just found the ending bitterly disappointing. Ugh, what a bad taste is left in my mouth. Flynn doesn't need my review, nor does she care, I'm sure. I just want readers to be forewarned.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I had a really hard time getting into this book - literally, the first HALF I struggled with. So why am I giving it 5 stars? Because the last half was worth that much AND MORE!<br /><br />This story is about love, the kind of love we all hope to find - and some of us find, but never SEE.<br /><br />He had me in tears when I finally got it.<br /><br />\\"There is a reason God limits our days.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"To make each one precious.\\"<br /><br />Now that sums up this book!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and I look forward to watching it each and every week!  I hope that it continues for a long time.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I have read all parts of this trilogy & though not the greatest literary work, it does what it should do - entertain! This 2nd installation is similar in style to the first & is a fairly good read. For those persons who really enjoyed Book 1, I would suggest that you buy the combi package offered by Amazon for Books 2 & 3 since having enjoyed Book 1, you should also enjoy Books 2 & 3. The combi package is cheaper than buying the books individually.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game pretty well. It's cool that you get to unlock new games with your points, but sometimes you have to play your unlocked games over many times to get more points.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read books previously, told wife how good it was.  She couldn't stop reading, ready to read again.  Also she is waiting now for the second movie
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I still have a warm spot in my heart for the original Thomas Crown as played by Steve McQueen.  Faye Dunaway was fabulous and the story stayed true.  They don't make them like this any more.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read this book for a book club. It read more like non-fiction than fiction. It was good to read about Alzheimer's from a patient's perspective.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The right amount of incredible action and the right amount of humor. The good old boys are still in good shape. I enjoyed every minute of it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|my hunny let his granddaughter play this starting on a Saterday and after we showed her to use the guide she was showing us the steps to solve the clues to finish the game. she loved it.  so did my hunny, i have not had the time to finish. but it is fun.
B009X00E18|1.0|I've bought cases for original Kindles, K2s and K3s, the original DX Kindle, iPads, the Kindle Fire, the Kindle Fire HD, and even a Velocity Cruz tablet. Every one I've ever received has been a substantial cover that provided some padding as well as just surface protection for the device ...<br /><br />until this one.<br /><br />This is the thinnest, most cheap looking plastic cover I've ever seen trying to masquerade as a suitable cover for a tablet device. It will never be placed around my 8.9&#34; Fire. There is no way it could provide suitable protection against anything but a scratch, plus it just looks cheap from the word go.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are much more durable alternatives at its price point. Marware should be embarrassed that they ever greenlighted this entirely unsuitable product. The phrase &#34;rip off&#34; comes to mind.<br /><br />You might have gathered that I cannot recommend purchasing this product under any circumstances. I was extremely disappointed when I took this out of the package
B008I2OAEE|5.0|I really enjoy the new direction that The Gathering has taken.  The songs do not feel rushed and blend very well with each other. The new sound is fresh and reminds me of their older works mixed with a hint of Theatre Of Tragedy and more recent Mostly Autumn.  This is a put on your headphones, sit back in your favorite chair type music.  Bands change, at least we hope they do and the new sound of the Gathering is something that I find refreshing.
B00846REIS|5.0|I picked this book up after seeing it rated highly on several lists of books like Fifty Shades of Grey, and boy was I pleased! This book was a great follow up to Fifty and definitely recommended to those looking for their next read!!
B009P5S11G|5.0|At first I thought I wasn't big into this album but I when you listen to it some more it grows on ya and is a lot of fun. I love the variety of songs and recommend this to all. I love the song with Chris Brown, love Diamonds, and think this album has a lot to offer. Enjoy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After having read the first book, Bared To You, I couldn't wait for this one! Reflected In You was just as great at Bared To You, but let us know so much more about Gideon and Eva and their love for one another. I'm [not so] patiently waiting for number three!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is a bad ass show I love it. If you like a good zombie show this is the one.
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I am obsessed with this album. Emotionally and sonically beautiful. I had heard of the band from a friend and once I checked them out on Spotify, I couldn't stop listening.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Sent the movie to my daughter in college.  She had seen it in the theater and wanted her own copy.  Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss?  It was delivered on time for her birthday.  My only complaint was I spent the extra money to have it gift wrapped and she said it was wrapped in plain paper-not even gift wrapping paper.  I was very disapppointed and would not recommend anyone spend the $5.00.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|This was an amazing movie. I highly recommended it. I would consider it probably my favorite movie of Jet Li's.
0316182060|5.0|For the people who love manga, this is not manga format. You open the book and read it from left to right.<br /><br />I haven't counted the number of pages, but since chapter 14 starts in page 209, you will get a fairly thick book.<br /><br />The first three pages are in glorious color and the rest, obviously, in black and white.<br /><br />This graphic novel is wonderfully adapted from the second book of the installment, so if you are hesitating about reading the books, please don't be afraid, all the five of them are great.<br /><br />The illustrations are great and personally I love how REM captured the essence of Lord Macon and Lord Akeldama. Alexia lost her prominent nose, but she kept her generous front.<br /><br />So, I enjoyed every part of this graphic novel and it is a great addition to my Soulless collection.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down. Highly recommended.<br />Great for late teens and adults.<br />Good good good good good good
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! Great book, but I don't care for the narrative style. At times it detracts from the story. Overall 9.5
B009VB9VKY|2.0|My wife rented the movie.  She thought the story wasn't good, the acting wasn't good but she enjoyed the dancing.
034580404X|5.0|I bought these form the wife and she read them all in about a week. I was wishing they would have lasted a little longer, but she goes through books on average a book in two days.
B009439HEY|5.0|As one who still plays The Lamb and other older Genesis on a regular basis I just love this album. The sound quality is superb. Others have described very well the album itself (btw, mine does not skip or stop)and I look forward to seeing Hackett do this live next year when they tour. I will travel anywhere I need to in order to see and hear this music performed live.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I read a lot and it isw rare to be surprised, but this book kept me on the edge and the ending was spectacular.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! I swear when I first saw this I was thinking oh this must be cool...  but now that I downloaded it I relized This is great and HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!!  I COMPLETLEY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|was looking for file management app which allowed to move to extsd this app is great and free bravo great app
B001USHRCK|5.0|I bought this set and it is awsome!!! It is the best set ever!! It comes with two houses and a blacksmiths shop! One of the homes is on the blacksmiths shop! I have two blacksmiths so I built a extra stool and made it so they can have dinner!! I would recommend this set!! GET IT!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well, the Hunger Games movie trailer is boring. But I can't really imagine how good the book is compared to the movie(I am very serious).Many action-packed scenes, that's why my classmates recommand me this book. I will give this eight stars if I can.
B008NABUU8|1.0|I gave this one star because I had to force close this app every time I wanted to exit it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is book certainly is worse than the first except for the hazards part I love it. It can improve by having a more exciting beginning.
B009B2VBWE|4.0|A little different for Ms. Krall, by the sound of the album, her husband had a hand in it. Quite enjoyable.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|What a page-turner!!  If you love the Beatles' music and/or have any level of interest in how the process of recording works, you will absolutely love this book.  Geoff Emerick recounts in vivid detail, all of the many recording sessions of the various songs and albums he participated in over the course of The Beatles' recording career.  You'll love the intimate details of the events and interaction between him, George Martin and the individual personalities as they recorded these historical songs.  Also fascinating are Geoff's description of the risks he took as an engineer in his passionate effort to achieve ground-breaking sounds with what we consider antique technologies by today's standards.
0525952926|1.0|This is the second of a planned trilogy of 20th Century history. The first volume, Fall of Giants (2010), was an interesting and rewarding effort. In fact, I reread the first volume in preparation for this one. But Winter of the World is a total failure--Follett should forget about the third volume.<br /><br /> I am a student of 20th Century history and love to read historical fiction of the Winds of War genre. But I don't like to be fed rank propaganda in the guise of history even if it advocates benevolent and largely positive social goals. This patronizing book is just saturated with the author's social agenda. The plight of women, gays, Jews, blacks, workers, union members, \\"disadvantaged people,\\" and social \\"progressives\\" of every kind fills every page, while the establishment is portrayed as lazy, intolerant, and decadent. After a while the reader just wants to cry out \\"All right, enough already, enough of your preaching. I just want to read a good story in the context of historical events.\\"<br /><br /> In addition, the story line is so contrived and implausible that the history becomes tainted by its proximity. The book has a central list of shallow characters, from the US, England, Germany, and Russia, who just happen to continually run into each other, for decades, and all over the world. In the first volume, for example, the aristocrat Earl Fitzherbert, while in the British Army in France during World War I, coincidentally wanders into the path of a German friend, an officer who had done diplomatic service in the UK and got to know the him well. This meeting takes place during the famous Christmas truce where German and English soldiers wished each other holiday cheer in no man's land. And if this were not enough, the German officer was secretly married to the Earl's sister. These kinds of coincidences occur throughout this book. The evil Earl, moreover, fathered a son by his maid, who turns out to be infinitely more intelligent and socially correct than the Earl, and the bastard child twice has occasion to meet his half-brother without knowing the relationship.<br /><br /> The principal Russian characters are brothers Grigori and Lev Peshkov. Grigori is an intelligent and kind person, responsible and thoughtful of others, while Lev is irresponsible, cruel and scheming. The bad Lev ends up as a rich capitalist in America, while the good Grigori ends up as a Bolshevik revolutionary, a warrior for social justice, who becomes an assistant to Lenin and Trotsky.  And, of course, by a tortured set of contrivances that just defies rationality Lev is forced to join the American army, his unit is among the small contingent that was ordered to Russia in 1918, and in that vast land that occupies one-sixth of the earth's surface, the brothers just happen to bump into each other near Omsk in Siberia, where Grigori is a high political official. The book is filled with such coincidences, which are so implausible that they infect the entire narrative and make it not believable.<br /><br /> This book reads like it was written by a staff of adolescents, who have no notion of plausibility or history and whose only purpose is to wag their fingers at the readers and teach them the ways of the world.  As I read it, I kept thinking that it would get better but that never happened. The dialogue is often laced with 21st Century jargon that is worlds apart from, say, 1914 Wales or 1930's America. People just didn't talk that way either in Edwardian England or Depression Era US.<br /><br /> And oh! I must say a word about Follett's plastic sex scenes. He must have a fetish for tongue kissing because he includes vivid descriptions of it in every such episode, which invariably involve young people whose wonderment at the practice seems extraordinary.<br /><br /> All in all, don't waste your time on this nearly 1,000-page pile of words. There is a lot of good reading out there.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|Great writing, even better cast.  New Girl is fresh, authentic, hilarious and truly contemporary. Season 2 &#62; Season 1. And I loved Season 1.
057809665X|1.0|What a disappointment.  It started out with what I thought would be the same goal....having everyone on the same even playing field but this guy..geez what he was basically saying was ...bend down and apologize all the time.  Turn your head and bare your neck - -- you name it --- every single body language / movement possible he offered up to you/us to use to placate ANYONE and EVERYONE else.  I'm in no way saying that we are the center and leader of all and any possible intereaction but gimme a break dude, what you are recommending is to turn myself into a bathroom rug....  Aint gonna happen.  I just wanted a little help in the department of stopping myself or even slowing myself down when it comes to my bad habit of finding ways of turning conversations around to \\"me\\".  And my other problem of being a bit to open with my personal information.... you know  the TMI stuff.  But this book....nope....not a drip (funny, huh?  drip is what he suggests we become  LOL) of intelligent direction.  Don't buy - a total waste of your money.  If you don't believe me go to the library and see for yourself. Quick rapport - really?  only as the guy they keep around to take the trash out, lock up at the end of the night, pay the pizza guy when it comes.....geez  i had to give it one star or it wouldn't take the review...it didn't deserve one star.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|If you're expecting a continuation of the old TV series, save your money, but if you're looking for the unique stylized Burton/Depp comedy, this is it.<br /><br />I am a difficult comedy audience and seldom laugh out loud.  This one provoked deep, satisfying chuckles.  The sex scene with Barnabas and Angelique gave new meaning to monkey love.<br /><br />The whole movie was beautiful.  The story was actually incidental to the movie, but who cares.  It was a feast for the eyes.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Why I have never read this book before I do not know. The fact that it was written by Shelley when she was only eighteen or so makes it an even more remarkable story. Very easy to read and access the language. The misery of Frankenstein and his monster is described so eloquently, sympathy is evoked by the reader. As I say above, I wish I had read this book a.long time ago.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was SUCH a satisfying read. What a treasure and delight, thank you Hugh! I am reminded of Canticle for Leibowitz among other things, but I preferred this by far. Can't say enough. Thinking, \\"yeah but who is Hugh Howey? Do I waste my time on this?\\" YES - DO IT. You will not regret it. I finished Hydrogen Sonata by Iain Banks right before this and I can't decide which I liked more. This book is top shelf.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The movie was all talk no walk! I did not enjoy the movie at all. Dont waste your money! Pick something else!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is an extremely entertaining flight sim. It works well on the Droid Razr at full detail level and controls are very responsive. This game is definitely worth yhe price
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but how do you explode Tnt in creative mode???? taco draco raco. muchos gracias seniorita we are pepepepepe
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have had no problems with this app. it loads quickly and is really easy to use. too bad more apps don't work as well
0425263908|5.0|This has to be the best book I have read all year. Hands down. Written well. Awesome story. I am so glad there is more to it...in fact three books. I couldn't put it down.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Don´t just think about buying this book... DO IT!!!!!!  DO IT!!!! DO IT!!!<br /><br />This is a money well spent item! I bought a kindle version and it´s great. This book will make everything easier for you in your way to change your body! You find everything in this book that you will need.<br /><br />This book will give you confidence to go and hit the gym and doing so the right way. Also all you need to know about nutrition.<br /><br />I am going to buy more copies of this book for my friends for Christmas!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great app for creative people or just anyone bored but I'm having problems trying to join a game. Any one else have this problem?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show. I am not even a fan of the horror genre but what makes this show so good is not the occasional gore that surpisingly isn't a turn-off -because it's not the focus of the show-. This show is about how people deal with life not just as a group trying to survive but as a family, friends, people who knew each other before the zombiepocalyse or meet for the first time. It's tastefully done, action packed, suspense ridden and pulls you in.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I read this book for a book club and I found it very boring and depressing. I could barely make it to the end. Normally I read books really fast and this one took me over 2 weeks. I didnt even want to pick it back up.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book has a story line for every taste, history, crime drama, love story, science fiction.<br />Very well written. I preferred the present and future stories.<br /><br />Not sure how a movie would work for this.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read this book so that I could get a better understanding of what a friend of mine is going through with her recent diagnosis of early onset Alzheimers. I would highly recommend reading it esp if you know someone going thru this dreaded disease.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I am one of the most loyal and supportive Taylor Swift fans, but this C.D. is not a Country Music C.D.  It is more of a teenie-bopper album than anything.  It is the only Taylor Swift C.D. that I would ask for my money back.  Just my opinion.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Def not a Harry Potter book. I loved Rowlings writing style as well as the story in Harry potter. This book as her same unique way of describing the setting and characters so well that you can really envision them. But the story is dark, the characters flawed and sad. I did wish there was one character that I could root for but you dont really 'love' any of them. That said, I couldn't put the book down, waiting to find out what horrible thing would happen due to the awfulness of the characters! Def worth the read.
B0054SMID0|4.0|There are enough twist and turns to keep you entertained. Also as others mentioned, gives a slight glimpse of how things really work in the justice system.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|quick read. the characters are a bit 'twisted'. the ending a bit predictable but it was a good, quick read.
B0068THAGY|1.0|Loss of words on how to describe. Boring.. yes. Didnt even finish watching. Maybe a teenage or younger crowd may enjoy but as an adult, I found it lacking and definitely didnt keep my attention.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I'm a Soundgarden fan from way back and I was so excited to hear they had a new album coming out. It's a pretty good effort for their first studio album since '96, but it does leave a little to be desired. It's an album full of pretty good songs, but their just isn't that one song that stands out as great. It just doesn't have edge that Superunknown or Badmotofinger had. Where are the dirty guitar riffs that were such a part of their sound? I would have given this album 3 1/2 stars if that were an option. I hope they continue to make new music and put out more albums that get back closer to their roots. Still a good album though, and much better than most of crap I hear on the radio today. Music in the 90's was just better than today, period.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It kept me entertained. I liked the plot and the characters were interesting. I am looking forward to the next book.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I was hooked on this show from episode one season one and it just keeps getring better! I watched the whole season in one day. Never has it been predictable.
6305428042|5.0|I recieved this about two months ago and my 4 year old daughter still wants to watch it everday! This is my all time favortie movie and now its hers to :) not to mention its great quality, one of my favorite purchases
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Takes me back to when I used to play this game in grade school. I would like to be able to control more than one person.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I cried, I laughed, then cried again. An enjoyable story about life as told from a dogs perspective. It gives one hope.
B009IA9OLE|3.0|This game was fun but it needs some more levels.  You cannot acquire all the skills available even if you get the bonus on every level.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Why is there a 24 hour watch time from when movie is started. I like to rent them and watch while flying and would like to watch it over several days
B007TNS6JI|5.0|totally awesome its fun and you dont have to purchase extra content to enjoy playing it. i love this game
034580404X|5.0|I loved this series!!!!!!  I'm sure I'll be reading it again!  Best books I've read in this catagory.  My friends also loved it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like twitter because you don't get long winded stories. It's short and to the point and it gives you the added feature of posting URL's and photos. It's a great way to communicate with friends and post your opinions.<br /><br />Great idea.<br /><br />Rick M.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|please read, awesome book.superb book what a great book to read. you will get attached to these characters you are drawn right into the story.  You cant put it down
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game. It is sooo fun. I cant stop playing it over and over. It has amazing graphics and a suspenceful storyline. I would recommend this for everyone!!!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I probably could have gotten a free replacement but was in a hurry so I ordered this to replace the original which was flaking in my hands. Ask me again in 2-years and I'll let you know how this one worked out
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Wow ! John Rebus is back, joy unbounded.<br />Now retired he works as a civilian within the Police Department helping resolve old cases.<br />All our favourite friends and villains come onstage as Rebus tries solving apparent serial killings while also trying to rejoin the police force.<br />We travel from Edinburgh to the Scottish Highlands and back again as things progress.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Product came in great condition.  Present for my wife.  At first I was sceptical about the 3D but it really did come out great.  Any Titanic lover should have this as an addition to thier library.
B000BNX3B4|4.0|It's funny that almost every one says that the movie is very predictable because of the formulaic concept of the film. For some reasons, after I watched it for the first time the expectation of the critics became true.  What is funnier is after I have seen it for the first time and I already knew the outcome of the film, I kept on watching it again and again until I lose count of it.  But it doesn't matter.  I do believe in the film because of the following.  1)  Great Actors (from the major players to the minor players) 2) Great acting. (I do feel like as if I am watching it in real life.) 3) Great dialogue (Witty, LOL, Crisp, etcetera.  Because of this they get my first ever review and who knows when I would stop watching it (maybe, after 20 times?) Must love this film and must have this film.  BTW, I happened to watch a re-run on TV after I recorded it for curiosity reason. One of the great lines I love to hear \\" I want a romance\\".  The film always makes me cry at the end when Sarah pursues after the love of her life by being crazy when she jumps into the cold water and swam to get to Jake's boat, and then Sarah delivered her line that  touches my heart every time I watch it.  Help!
B009GN6DT4|5.0|My 7 year old loved this movie.  I forgot about the cussing and confusing scenes with the emotional drama when ET died.  She took that pretty hard but I would still recommend it for 7 and up.
B009A9BF5G|1.0|This DVD is so choppy I could not watch it.  The camera doesn't stay still on one seen long enough for you to be able to enjoy the great performance by Coldplay.  Also, some scenes are grainy, poor quality.<br />I wish I could get my money back.  It is beyond terrible.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game...I love it!!!<br />Some of the levels are very hard to complete and<br />honestly it gets frustrating but not enough that I<br />stop playing the game.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I got this as a gift for my girlfriend, but it seems to have hit and miss performance.  Sometimes it will work as advertised, and the other times there will be no noticeable difference in the sound levels.  Had I been the one using it I would have returned it, but I think she felt bad about returning a gift, so she has been living with it.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to find another brand if you are in the market for a headphone amplifier.
B004JMY312|4.0|The movie was good and exactly as I remember it.  The only problem that I ran into was that it stopped a couple of times and had to restart.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Finally, Patricia Cornwell is back!!! She's gone back to her roots.<br />Good book. Good read.<br />Some of the same people we've met in her earlier books.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wow,  It was a great story line, one would be willing to bet that they could figure out the plot, Well let me say, Kate Morton does a fine job to lead you to the finish line.
0393327345|1.0|I got a damaged book. Amazon should print this review as I wanted all the. Buyers to know that selling a damaged good is not acceptable. Also Amazon should note that I will report Amazon to Better business bereau if they do not print my review.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|I love listening to Great music in my car, I have listened to Adams music for years, I crank up the volume in the car!!!
0425263916|5.0|I think a lot will relate to it  also was good reading right through the book , have read both books lved it....
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love Pretty Little Liars!!! It's one if the best show I have ever watched! It's so suspenseful you don't know who is going to surprise you!
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I gather most folks loved this book, and I am sticking with it, but it's a bit confusing at times. If you have a character named Eddard, why does he go by Ned? Keeping up with all the characters, their lineage, and their place in the sequence of things is a struggle and I often feel the author likes to try and put more texture in his descriptions than is warranted. I will say that I have not finished it...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator I have ever used. Its easy to read large buttons are great. I love that you can look at your calculations like an adding machine.
B006T4NQNO|1.0|ordered a METAL ring for my sx50 got a pice of plastic that broke right away<br />sent back for refund don't know how it will take { Bower }

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept me guessing right to the end.  He keeps getting better with great plotting and character building. I'm looking for some really heavy cigar tubes!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Sam & Dean rock. I love the music they play. I think Sam needs to get a hair cut. I like it's Demons and Angels and everything between.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I played it many times without any issues.  games are fun and can be challengeing.  This app is better than other Solitaire apps.
1583334386|3.0|The book got off to a slow start.  It seemed really fishy at first, and I almost put it down, but since I was listening to it digitally, it wasn't that much work to keep going (and it was a long run anyway).  Once I got through the rah-rah of the opening section, I did encounter some helpful ah-ha moments.  The most helpful was the concept that will power is like a muscle.  I really connected with that one, because I find when I am highly disciplined in one area of my life, other areas suffer. This doesn't have to be the case.  This book will challenge you to leverage will power in every area of your life.  It also draws attention to the fact that Will Power is a key to being successful, and that it is something that you can develop over time.  Nice concept.  I am glad I finished it, but the mind over matter theme (really, again?) gets tired in spots.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Captivating book... A fast read! Couldn't put it down. John Grisham is my favorite author..I can't wait for his next one!
B000JJS8TM|2.0|If you really love the Beatles, you probably won't think much of this.  A few good (unaltered) tunes.  The rest is not so great.
B00846REIS|4.0|I like the characters in this book!  Eva and Gideon are flawed, but lovable.  The sex scenes are HOT, and the story is really good.  Well worth your time and attention.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a app with many games and so many options to choose from. Plus not all the games are easy like most apps
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was an awesome sequel, and I can't wait for the story to contine.  The characters are well-rounded, flawed, and lovable.  This story is well worth your time and money.  Once you pick it up, be prepared not to put it down until the dramatic conclusion.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|This movie sucks, do not buy it. I would never listen to the pumped up adds again. Don't buy this movie.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I, too, have seen the Swedish version of this trilogy and have read all 3 books. It is, without doubt, and hard to disagree with, that the books are amazing ~ truly great reading...albeit a bit disturbing. I, however, do NOT agree with others who have rated this movie so badly because they liked the Swedish version more. It's true, that the Swedish movies are great. Noomi Rapace is an amazing actress and SHOULD have been cast in the English version. However, I found Rooney Mara quite convincing. One thing I can agree on is that Daniel Craig was miscast in this role - that or the guy should have put on a Swedish accent - Now THAT was unbelievable. But, I can put those things aside and enjoy the movie for what it was. Not everyone will like a foreign movie with subtitles (I never watch dubbed versions of foreign films - looses too much), so, this film DOES stand on it's own and is good entertainment. I also LOVE the fact that it keeps the Trilogy going....So, here's hoping they continue on with the next 2 installments - cause, I, for one, will be at the cinema to see them.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|This movie was highly recommended, so I was kind of waiting for something fascinating or beautiful to happen.  It only kind of did.  Good compared to a lot of movies, though!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I downloaded this game and I played it for about 2 weeks or so.  It worked great and I enjoyed the game.  I didn't play it for a day, then I came back and the game had completely reset on me after hours of hard work.  I deleted the app and gave it a bad recommendation to anyone that asks about it.  My sister even tried to download it on the app store, but they completely removed it!  Not too many bugs, but that one big one pissed me off and I quit this game since.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This movie is not for everyone,  but the thought it was hilarious.  Parents loved it as well.  Not a Rushmore fan, but like liked Life Aquatic.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Well written, as usual, by Stephen Ambrose. It gives an intimate look into the intense human love that develops when we are put into situations of life and death. It also speaks honestly of the co-mingling emotions that accompany war: fear, courage, despair, hope, and the devotion that surprises the parties themselves: self sacrifice for a brother.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|AWESOME series - own all seasons!!!<br /><br />Castle becket ryan, esposito, mcdonald, asley, alexis, martha, fred, bill, ted, blow me, eat me
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|its fun for like 3 min. but I arety played it on my brother I pod before it was popular.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Unfortunately, I forgot to record this on my DVR and had to catch up so I could watch the ones I had recorded.  While there are...umm...more economical options available I opted to purchase the episodes.  It was money well spent.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Only reason its not a 5 is its slow sometimes. Totally love this app! Great ideas on everything! Craft ideas are my favorite.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|In a few words, this takes the zombie genre and gives it a human story line that inspires conversation. Well done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! Works great on my Kindle Fire and IPhone! Pulling this app up while shopping is a great bonus.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Great story, flows well with a lovely twist at the end.  Hard to put down and a very satisfying ending.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have several of Rod Stewart's CD's and play them a lot.  Great background music.  This one is a great background Christmas CD.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Check out their YouTube channel. They have amazing music videos! This would make a great gift for yourself or someone else. It's definitely worth the money.
0345505387|5.0|I read it pretty much straight through.  Diana Gabledon draws you in and you don't want her books to end!
B004P1JEWU|5.0|What a brilliant read once again so many twists and revelations throughout the book can't wait to read the next one!
0385335997|5.0|Just when you think Diana Gabledon can't come up with anything that will surprise you, she does. Loved, loved, loved it.
B009L32R5I|5.0|This album is everything I hoped it would be. The song selection, musicians, singers, arrangements, everything is great! There's just enough different in these songs that it was worth redoing them; these are not note-for-note copies. The variety in singers is refreshing, and I actually prefer some of these songs to the originals! My only issue is with the fact that no \\"digital booklet\\" or some kind of liner notes are included with the MP3 downloads. I was able to find some info at Steve Hackett's website, though: [...]
0385311400|5.0|Once again, Diana Gabledon comes through with a wonderful book.  She makes you want to read more and more.  Fatastic book!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Why is Amazon so far behind the Google Play Store in updating apps? Come on Amazon, keep up with the updates!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I turn to their music anytime I need to get my mind stimulated. I'm an avid listener of the classics and great modern scores, and these guys are easily on my top ten of all time greatest.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|For all the hype it didn't meet my expectation.  Quite a nice story and great messages but the writing just didn't flow that well. Maybe it's more that way reading it on kindle but was definitely let down. Maybe that's because it was translated and wasn't originally written and English
1451695195|5.0|I've been researching this topic for well over 15 years, and reading at least 150 books on the subject, and I've also listened to many first hand accounts. What I like most about Eben's book is, it's coming from a man who didn't believe such a thing as the Near Death Experience was even possible. I personally don't need anymore proof of the reality of the NDE and the Afterlife, but I Love hearing about other peoples experiences. Having a man with a VERY good knowledge of how the brain and body works gives his account so much more credibility. It's not like I doubt the stories by other individuals, but hearing a person talk about something so incredible, and being of a scientific mind gives me chills. It shows how powerful the NDE is. What other experience can you have that would take you from being a total non-believer in something, to an absolute believer, all while your in a Coma? I can't imagine how anybody interested in this subject, won't thoroughly enjoy this book!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|A book filled with suspense.  Although the book has technical terms relating to forensic science, these are given in a way that the amateur can understand
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Its one of the excellent cases out there. Big fan of Amazon Basics products. Very good quality TPU case. I have a 2 year old and my phone has fallen a number of times on wooden floor at my home. See thru design makes the White phone shine. Also the best part is after months of usage also its didn't turn yellowish or pale as a lot of clear cases become  that way. I got it in a deal for 5$ ... but $9 is also worth it ... Recommended.
B0067EMFLA|5.0|I bought this album for the workout music and I was not disappointed.  It's been really motivating for my runs and lifting weights.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the entire trilogy and couldn't be more pleased.  I found each book hard to put down as I wanted to know what happened next and how things would end.  Although quite sexually explicit that was not the overall theme of the books.  It is a story of romance not sex.  I highly recommend this book as well as the first two of the trilogy.
0785163174|2.0|Spoiler free review:<br /><br />I will keep this short.  I have not bought this trade, and have no intention to do so.  I am only writing this so that I can save some people the trouble of buying this waste of an event.<br /><br />I made the mistake of buying the first 10 issues of the series when it first came out earlier this year.  Notice that I said 10 issues, not 12.  I didn't even finish the series.  That says something.  In the time I have have been reading Marvel, I HAVE NEVER given up on an event story like I did with this one.  The premise seemed okay to me, but I had faith that with the combined effort of the writers and artists, something cool would come out in the end.<br /><br />In the end, the results were very mixed.  VERY mixed.<br /><br />The art is really hit or miss due to the fact that the book came out twice a month AND that they used more than one artist.<br /><br />The writing was my biggest problem.  I felt teh characterization was HORRIBLE for the majority of the series.  Cahracters fighting character for no good reason other than their leader said so.  I mean, they show Black Panther and Storm fighting!  AND THEY ARE MARRIED!  It's stupid stuff like that that made me think of this story as fan fiction.<br /><br />I am all for \\"event\\" stories.  I get excited like most people.  This was really let me down though.  And the scary thing is, it seemed to be a success and Marvel has said that they hope to use this format again.<br /><br />Reader beware...you're in for a scare.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is the first I read in the series but it leaves progressingly each chapter wanting more. Seen hunger games the movie,read this book. Descriptively great written thoughts of katniss make this an epic journey.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Far to much time spent on Corey' smart alec remarks and thoughts. This was a major distraction interrupting the normally fast paced flow of DeMille's writing style. I would place this novel near the bottom of an otherwise great reads by DeMille
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I would have loved it if it was the very first haunted house move I'd ever seen. But it wasn't. And so it was predictable and boring.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Very well written for a debut novel. Actually- well written for a novel full stop. Engaging, novel and the only disappointment is that it's his first book so I've got to wait before I can read the next one.<br />Well developed characters with backstories - no 2D pulp fiction here. I'd rank his writing up there with Brandon Sanderson (Stormlight) and look forward to seeing more. The only downside is that with these rankings, and his popularity- I doubt we'll see any more releases at $2.99.
B003B02PEU|5.0|After THE PAINTED HOUSE, I stayed away from Grisham's books for a long time. But I remember loving some of his early stuff so picked up the audiobook of THE LAST JUROR, and am so glad I did. The story is told in a languid style that fits the genteel, slow pace of the South. Grisham focuses on character development and does an excellent job. I felt I knew these people (could literally pick them out in our local town) with all their quirks and passions. While not technically a thriller, the story's plot, pace, and descriptive style kept me listening.<br /><br />I was sad for the story to end and would love to read another Grisham novel set in Clanton, Mississippi, to find out what Willie Traynor and the rest are up to.

B009ZXT4BY|2.0|this app was a somewhat okay rip off of Minecraft but I hated the controls the controls are little pads that you slide your fingers around on and half the time they wouldn't respond
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I like this book because I think it's a really cool book. I have also read Diary of a Simply Kid the Third wheel which was also a fantastic book.
B009IU6N5Y|2.0|Abe Lincoln as a Vampire Hunter is certainly an imaginative idea. The movie's execution of the concept is far different from the book's:<br /><br />1. The movie is loosely focused on a plot and a super-vampire that does play a major role in the book.<br />2. The movie's characters are loosely based upon the book. However some key characters are omitted, others are new, and some key characters are entirely different in terms of what they do in the movie vs. the book<br />3. The surreal depiction and exploration of American History is 99% lost in the movie<br />4. The definining events in Abe and Henry's lives are completely different from the book.<br /><br />Think of it in the following sense. Abe Lincoln was a legendary president...someone wrote a fantastic tale that he was also a vampire hunter...someone heard about the book (but didn't read it) and wrote a movie.<br /><br />I was not pleased and considered my time spent on the movie to be wasted.
B007PFD90G|1.0|I was very eager to read this book, but was left disappointed for two reasons. First, that the book is poorly written. It's less a memoir than Rushdie just copying from his journals. There isn't really a narrative to string it all together. There are way too many details that do not move the story forward. The name-dropping is ridiculous - it's as if he promised everyone he ever met that they would appear in his book.<br /><br />The second, and bigger, source of disappointment is how selfish and oblivious Rushdie comes across in this memoir. I was a fan of his work, and it was sad to see what a self-centered, petty old fool he is. He is self-congratulatory about helping one of his myriad ex-wives get a job by dealing behind the scenes without her knowing, claps himself on the back for this anonymous act of selflessness, and then mentions it three times in the book. He details several of his affairs in the book, but pushes off responsibility to other people, and it comes across as though he's just pleased with himself for being able to bed women that most men who look like him would not. When he laments that Padma Lakshmi has dumped him for some creepy old guy with a lot of money, he is completely oblivious to the fact that he, himself, is a creepy old guy with a lot of money. I felt embarrassed for him, reading this book.<br /><br />He complains throughout the book about his perceived lack of \\"freedom\\" when he was under protection from the government. I would guess that the men who died and the men who were attacked because of his book would have gladly welcomed the lack of \\"freedom\\" in exchange for some safety. If there is any central theme to this memoir (and it's a stretch) it's that Rushdie felt like the whole world should have been up in arms, outraged at the threats and censorship related to his book. He wanted to be protected, but resented the fact that he had to coordinate his activities with a security team. He paints several airlines as the villains, whenthey were reluctant to let him fly aboard regular commercial passenger flights. It's as though he felt like he had a right to do whatever he wanted, without regard to the risk to others. He plays the role of victim without a trace of irony, and shows no gratitude for the team of people working around the clock to protect him and his family, for which he had so little regard that he sacrificed them to get his ego (among other things) stroked by younger women. I trudged through this ridiculously long crazy-person's journal to the end, just in case there was a redemption arc at the end, where he has a moment of clarity or perspective, but it never comes. It was like watching a reality TV show, where the central character never realizes she is the fool, and everyone else is laughing at her. I can't believe I'm about to compare Salman Rushdie to Honey Boo-Boo, but I had the same uncomfortable feeling reading his book. I just wanted to pull him aside and say \\"You need to stop. You think it's clever, but everyone is laughing at you. This is not how normal people act. Normal people take responsibility for their actions. Normal people show loyalty and gratitude. Normal people don't air their dirty laundry in public.\\"<br />This was a very long book with no redeeming value, other than some \\"what not to dos\\" in case you're ever under government protection, or under the delusion that supermodels like you for your mind.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Most likely the problem is they use some actual bounce algorithms, and the program should adjust the ends of the paddle so that you can play different angles.  Seems fine to play, but the bounces sometimes seem monotonous.  Oh well, I guess you can't have it all for free... A good attempt, but left wanting more...
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I have listen to all 16 of these LP's. They all sound digital and sound nothing like the original analog UK vinyl recordings. Digital transfers to Vinyl are still digital no matter how you see it. The vinyl is just not as loud as the CD's because the vinyl recordings are not limited. I have returned my box set. I can't see paying 319.00 for the same digital sound as the CD box set I purchased.<br /><br />After listening to my  friends set i  wish i could give this set a 0 star rating, But it the rating  systen doesn't go that low. The vinyl is very noisy.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down! The writer deals beautifully with the sensitive issue of teenagers coping with terminal cancer. Life goes on and they still have their dreams. Not in any way morbid or morose.
057809665X|2.0|I give this book 4 stars for content; I give this book 0 stars for the author's unrelenting need to remind the reader that he is a Marine and graduate from the Naval Academy.  For a grand total of 2 stars.  Oh yeah, and he commanded a Marine Corps boot camp company.  Did I mention that he is a Naval Academy grad?  No worries, read this book, and you'll be reminded - continually!  The otherwise useful methods described in this book are completely watered down by the author's merciless need to justify himself.  So a guy who ran a first class steak restaurant in NYC gave you free dinner passes for two, and you gave him an FBI pin to put on the lapel of his blazer.  Somehow the author believes these gifts are of comparable equity.  Umm, OK.  How about this: stick to the meat and potatoes of elicitation, how to be a great conversationalist, etc.  Stay away from how cool your FBI gig is and how profound of a resume you have.
1601251505|1.0|This book was $20 less expensive on amazon than any other retailer i could find. so i bought it however it was disappointing The corners were a little bent and the cover had bubbles and some very small cracks in it. for a new book i was a little disappointed. I could probably have sent it back but the rpg group I am in needed a physical coppy of the book to make our lives a little easier. and being passed around the table and thrown on the floor im sure that the couple imperfections will not bother most people who play these types of games.
B001URCM44|5.0|I love Yanni! And this CD is my favorite,  i have wore it out in my car and listen to it on my Kindle when I work out.

B007TML4EI|3.0|It was fun for a few minutes, but it quickly got very difficult, at least for me.  The amount of effort to ace the level and move on became a little too much and I lost interest.  It was an app of the day, so its worth a try for free.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I'm new to the kindle fire.  I read the reviews &amp; decided to try thus since i like to find things in games.  i wasn't disappointed.  I did have to use the hints on line a few times.  But that was ok.  overall i would say this is a very good game for mystery, &amp; thinking.  Reminds me of Zelda on the wii as dar ad you have to find it &amp; figure out how to use it.
B001I189MQ|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies ever. Christopher Nolan is a Genius. A must see. Heath Ledger is brilliant and Christian Bale is a boss
B0041QSZTW|2.0|Angelheat had some potential, and does have a few strong moments, the bloody incest scene not being one of them, but really just poops out by the end. Rourke starts off looking pretty cool in those old clothes but is run ragged by the end of the movie, looking like a dirty bloody wadded up towel. The back story never quite comes to life, and the cheesy glowing eye effect on Di niro and that little baby bump this, up until that point moderately interesting who-dunnit film into the misfire basket.<br />And whats up with the terrible opening scene with the cat dog and dead guy in the alley?<br /><br />Johnny Handsome is not a great movie or a cool movie or even an interesting movie, its just a bad B movie. A revenge tale with the typical emphasis on successful plastic surgery trumps a failed redemption.<br />Its an interesting idea with a lousy script, middle of the road performances, and hasty execution make it b grade all the way except for Rourke. The cajun accents were as phoney as can be, and the bad couple was BAD, but not good bad. The crummy production values and cardboard characters are typical of the genre. What's most obvious in this and other films by the same producers is that they will bend over back ward to use blasphemy unnecessarily in christian setting like churches cemeteries or when Freeman moves into frame with a cross right over his shoulder before cursing, then moving out of frame when he stops cursing. Likewise the scene in angelheart where the devil reprimands rourke for cursing in the church.
0547884591|5.0|I pre-ordered this a year ago for my chef brother and myself, because for a long time he's wanted to teach me how to prepare food and make delicious meals. Already from the 4 Hour Chef I've used the photos demonstrating correct knife skills, that I know I've been shown before, but put into context within these recipes has really made it stick. Also appreciative of the free materials available on Tim Ferriss' fourhourworkweek.com/blog because the book itself could be imposing in how thick it is. Tim calls it a choose your own adventure style, and I'll be preparing along with the calendar of meals. Great design in the book and I love how photo-heavy it is!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love Ridley Scott's attempts to explain our existence. Why are we here on Earth? What is our purpose? It's possible that evolution has a direction, and not just mere reaction to its environment. Evolution itself maybe a grand design towards a goal. A rising of a living form that made a last shot at survival from an impending doom. Maybe we all live in the wake of that attempt to survive.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Having read the book, I was hoping this would be a lot better. Seth Grahame-Smith's book incorporates a lot of real-life historical detail that not only adds depth to the story but really gives special meaning to all the vampire stuff. It's surprising that Grahame-Smith signed off on this movie, much less that he was responsible for the screenplay, because the story is hollowed out into a stylized action/horror movie that's pretty much what the title indicates, but nowhere near its potential, leaving it maybe a notch better than Sharktopus territory. Also, Benjamin Walker was really not good.<br /><br />I guess if you just want to see Abe Lincoln fight vampires, go for it, but if you know better or want more, just stick to the book.
B00000J048|5.0|This gear set I orgianly bought it for my 2 year old, she has so much fun with it that i bought another set for my nephews. I love that it doesn't have and electrical gadgets ex. lights, music... and its hours of fun for all ages (Even the adults enjoy it) I find the little pegs from the gears are a bit thin but worth buying it anyway.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|A really great movie, I have seen it twice now and I still don't understand why they aren't going to make a sequel. Oh well though lets be thankful this one was made... And made very well.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I will echo most of the reviews here.  The special effects are great.  The lighting and mood are perfect for this type of movie.  THE PLOT STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!  I am so glad We did not drop $50 to see this at the theater.  I feel cheated at $20 for the DVD.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|And not one character I felt the least bit of empathy for... This book was not at all what I had imagined.  The pace was fine, the back and forth in time was fine... but I wished for one character that would draw me to connect with the story.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love fantasy books but it also has some truth to it. You learn about the Greek and Roman gods.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My son has been able to distinguish the shapes to build the pictures. What I do wish is that when I purchased the app I thought that there would be lots of different puzzles. Need more puzzles. Puzzles that generally get a little bit harder.  I feel he might get bored with it soon. I hope not he enjoys the app
0451418441|5.0|I love the story but the print is so small that it's a real challenge to read.  I would have appreciated a heads-up on that fact before I ordered it.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I thought this movie would be great. Lots of music and fun music. I love Julianne Hough. But I mean really, this movie was too, too corny and they only sang a few lines of every song. So if  you loved a song, you didn't really get to hear it. All in all, I think it was pretty bad. Too bad Julianne let herelf get dragged into this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead was a hit from the get go. Season 3 is no different. If you're a zombie fan, you should be watching.
B009CPE424|5.0|This was just a fun movie. Have to love animals, but if you love a cute talking dog, you can't miss this one.
0316228532|4.0|There is no doubt about it: JK Rowling remains an expert at her craft.  That being said, this is one of the most difficult books I have ever tried to read.  There are many characters with intersecting plot lines, and most of them are unhappy.  I continued to read hoping for a triumphant ending, but mostly what I found was more misery.  That being said, I found her overarching message of social responsibility very powerful, and one that will hopefully inspire others to look past outward images, and understand how others have been shaped by their environments.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Seriously though. Jack Bauer was lame and the plot writing was awful, even in the first season before they had an excuse to trot out weary tropes like amnesia. Everyone in this show gives a strong and balanced performance. It has Mandy Patinkin (Inigo Montoya, always amazing) and a naked Morena Baccarin (Inara from Firefly). That's all you really need to know.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I am NOT going to say this film is leading to the decline of our culture, I will leave that for Twilight and the like, but this film has a really weak script and dialogue and emotional sequences that just don't fit in AT ALL. It's pretty ****ing hard to believe this guy was involved with something like Alien or Blade Runner in particular. The latter film being one of the greatest films of all time in my book and Alien not far behind. This one.... well it certainly had the chance to be completely awesome and it just comes across like some high-budget made for TV film.<br /><br />WHY can they no get competent script writers and people to tell these guys this stuff resembles really weak storytelling and acting. As others have pointed out the incompetence of this high-tech culture is a little unbelievable and the situations they find themselves in are just a little too much to bear. It is well shot and the settings are very cool I just wish more talent and taste were put into the film. At the point one guy addresses an alien snake creature with, \\"Hey baby, Hey baby,\\" I almost had to call it quits. That is about all you need to know. I am willing to say at this point that Ridley's late brother's films are quite underrated, many of them with great scripts to be honest, compared to the blockbuster flicks the elder is putting out. I mean, you find an alien creature and the thing looks horrifying and is staring at you as it slithers up from a pool... and you sit there addressing it with that? Really? How about when the captain asks Charlize if she is a robot and then they go sleep together as she proves she is not one or something? WTF?<br /><br />Seriously, Roomi and the lead male are TOTALLY miscast. Just insane how bad they are this film. Pretty much ruins it for me. Your mileage may differ but Roomi is by far the worst here looking like someone totally different from the love interest the male would truly be into. Her lines are cold and without much emotion at all. Beyond that it doesn't get much better. People just walk around and into trouble looking scared, dumb, interested, mysterious, and a whole lot of them like to push fancy buttons.d that it doesn't get much better.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|The book lacked the richness of the characters and their relationships that past books of hers showcased.  I have read many of Cornwells books and always have come away satisfied with the end result. It felt like something was missing and I felt let down when the book was done. It is difficult to purchase a new author by merely reading the dust jacket. When you have developed a liking for an author, you tend to buy regardless of what the jacket says. You develop an appreciation of the characters the author brings to life. If this had been my first read with the author, I am not certain I would be buying the next one. It is not Cornwell at her finest.
B001414XLQ|5.0|Great band, all their music rocks!  I can't say anything bad about it except for if you were to listen to it 100 times, you'd want to change it after a while!  Good music though!

B005LAIGZU|5.0|Very well done. Gives an inside view of a seal's life at home an on a mission. Plus, according to the movie writeup, the missions depicted were based on actual seal operations. I am  a Vietnam Veteran,  and the only contact with Seals I had was in jump school. This was the last part of their training and they were in such fantastic physical condition that they partied at the club all night and joined us for training in the morning! Very tough dudes!
007174889X|5.0|Arrived on schedule. Hard cover great. Prints are fine and came with the discs as described. I would recommend it.
B008G33OJM|5.0|Very enjoyable. Good production & sound. Would not play in an older Sony (Bd-PS300) player. Works fine in a NAD T-557. Also got the dvd just in case. The convenience of having all the content on 1 disc is a big plus for the Bluray.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another good read from Baldacci. Great page turner, keeping me up late at night to finish a chapter! Engaging characters.  Highly recommended!

B009IJJB8G|5.0|This is a great show. I loved Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock and Johnny Lee Miller is just as good. Lucy Liu is a great dead pan Watson and the cases are interesting without the regular formula feeling.
B009C5Z112|5.0|This is the long-awaited second record from Wintersun, and it is very good.  The addition of the additional band members has been a good thing!  This record has a more symphonic feel to it, relying more heavily on synth and keyboard sounds, but it has some great guitar riffs and great drumming by Kai Hahto, as always.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked 50 shades you will love this book. The characters are believable and its just a good read. I like the story line. I like the way it is written. The writer seams to know how to write to keep you into the story not just the sex. I do suggest that this be an adult read.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|Murder the Mountains builds on the self-titled album by Red Fang and delivers more awesome rock.  All the songs are good.  The SUNN amps these guys use have a very unique sound that really gives their music a cool flavor.

0525478817|5.0|This review is so hard to write due to the massive tears I have in my eyes. Lord I have no idea where to begin this review. I have so many emotions going through my mind and my heart. First as a mother and second as a person who has close knowledge of what cancer children suffer and how the families suffer. I work for Pediatric Cardiology at a local hospital and I sometimes see the kids who have cancer and are post treatment to see if the treatments have harmed their heart like Augustus.<br /><br />I have never ever read a book so beautifully written that has caused me to cry through the whole thing. I want to thank my buddy reader Becca for asking me to buddy read this with her. It took me four days to finish the book because I had to keep putting it down because all I did was cry. This morning I woke up and said dammit I am finishing this book. So with my box of tissues in hand I sat at my desk at work and finished reading Augustus's and Hazel Grace's ending.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus both have cancer and they are survivors but this story is about so much more than that. It is about first loves. Augustus fell in love with Hazel Grace from the moment he saw her. He knew she was spunky and smart and he wanted to know her and he did. Together they had a whirlwind relationship that was just right for the both of them.<br /><br />They also shared a mutual friend and cancer survivor Isaac. Isaac lost his sight and Augustus and Hazel were there for him. Even when his girlfriend dumped him and he had a recurrence of cancer Hazel and Augustus stayed right by Isaac's side. They all shared a love for one another and in the end they were the ones to comfort each other.<br /><br />This story is so amazing that I feel privileged to have read it. At first I was leery because I knew by chapter three I was going to be a crying mess but I am glad I finished it because it is a story about love,loss, and healing.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|I am a Smashing Pumkins fan from the old days.  I wanted to pick up this box because I read about the demos recordings in here that preceded subsequent recordings which wound up becoming the final SP Siamese Dream release.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  I really enjoyed hearing the demo recordings.  A bonus that I didn't even know was in here was an exceptional dvd of a Smashing Pumpkins performance in 1993.  Having recently seen the SP live in concert, I was extremely curious to see this concert footage from their earlier years.  I liked the concert footage better on the dvd in this package than the recent show performance that I saw.  Don't get me wrong, I really liked the Oceania concert recently, but in this DVD I see \\"Billy\\" in his prime historic launch as a rock star.  I was transfixed by the band's performance and Billy's energetic performance.  I see the look on Billy as he seemed to fully realize that he was arriving to an era of life when his years of hard work were about to hugely pay off.  The vibe from beginning to end in the concert performance is incredible. The audience knows the words to the songs and the place is a madhouse of fun.  I don't really care much for the little artsy cards.  I'm sure there's a meaning to them, but the meaning of this purchase for me was the music and it delivered.  I cannot speak to the quality of the Siamese Dream remaster because I didn't listen to it.  I really wanted this for the demos and as a bonus enjoyed the heck out of the unexpected dvd performance.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved this book, found it hard to put down.  The development of the characters in this book was logical, realistic, and sometimes heartbreaking.  I liked how the families from different countries intertwined.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Loving this book even better than the first.  Can't put it down.  The plot thickens and more characters are introduced as the story moves on to war!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a fabulous game!! Very engrossing and addictive!! Challenges your deductive skills and is entertaining. I highly recommend this game and will be lost when I get to the end
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I believe I saw this film in the spring of 2004.  After recording it on DVR, and seeing a so-so picture, I wanted to get it on Blu-Ray.  It's AMAZING.  It's like you're right there - going through what Christ went through.  A stunning and quite accurate depiction of the end of Christ's life.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I would suugest that ppl should buy this album. reason being is that this album is really great and each song is mature so it would be a must to hear

B008Y5OW20|5.0|I have a bunch of friends who look down on Jeff Lynne and his work with ELO. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! When I get the opportunity, and when my friends open what' s left of their minds, I play tunes from his Birmingham days with the Idle Race and The Move. The Move were fun, outrageously talented and tuneful, ambitious to a lovely fault, and were operating on a pop wave length that would keep them in good melodic company with the likes of The Beatles and Beach Boys. They morphed into ELO. The first ELO album (\\"No Answer\\") was built around Lynne's pop twin and founder of The Move, Roy Wood. ELO, according to Wood, attempted to \\"carry on where \\"I Am the Warlus\\" left off.\\" Not quite hitting the mark, but brilliant in its own way, Roy went off to explore more musical esoterica and criminally faded from any significant American notice. Lynne expanded ELO, commercialized it, but remained true to the sweet puffy pop melodies for which he became famous and pretty wealthy. The latter ELO albums were marked by some mediocrity, but by today's paltry standards of songwriting, craft and the sheer effort it takes to put some balls into performing, they stand as pretty good works. Lynne's first solo album (\\"Armchair Theatre\\") was and is a wonderful affair, full of  great originals, classic covers, craft and production, revealing Lynne's mastery of the studio. You can hear everything. The vocals are refreshingly dry, the instruments have appropriate separation, the performances Beatlesque (George Harrison is all over the record), and there's joy in everything.  The new disc (\\"Long Wave\\") is Lynne's love letter to classic songwriting. One can immediately discover the allure of these songs through Lynne's full throated performances and his tasteful arrangements. His choice of material is a showcase of the majesty of melody and is a classroom in pop craft, as his production is a clinic in restraint. It is too easy to fault Lynne for his style of producing. His muse has always been the Beatles and these songs feel very much like songs written by the Beatles on their best days, not weighted down by their personal ambitions or private demons. It was no mystery to me why Lynne was asked to produce the final two Beatle songs.and these songs feel very much like songs written by the Beatles on their best days, not weighted down by their personal ambitions or private demons.

B00846REIS|5.0|loved it and can't wait to read \\"Reflected in you\\" couldn't put it down had to finish it! 2 days and i had to know more!! loved it
B009EE6OGW|5.0|Best Sci-Fi Horror Flick ever. I purchase the movie from Amazon video on demand - felt like I was watching it for the first time. The quality is great. Brought back memories when I first watch it back in 1979 – great flick.
B009E3EY38|5.0|If I had to sum up the concert in one word, it would be, \\"Thundering!\\" I had paid extra for the shipping just to make sure I received it the day it came out. I sat down at 7 pm, EST with the Blue Ray and I couldn't count how many times I said. \\"whoa, this is amazing.\\" Having seen every Robert Plant tour since the 80's, I was sure he would be a bit weak but I was wrong. Of course his voice doesn't sound like it did when Zeppelin was still together, but, well, I'm thinking since it was a one night event verses a full tour, he could afford to give it everything he had without having to worry about doing it all over again the next day.. J. Page and J.P. Jones, well they are what they are and do what they do. No one can do it better. They where as powerful as they were ever known to be.  As for Jason, I remember reading about his performance when the show actually happened. I had very high expectations, after reading how great he was. Well, now having seen and heard it for myself, all I can say is that he played as if it were his only reason for living. I believe the liner notes where he stated that it was the greatest night in his life. I'm glad for him and what he was able to accomplish. If I were him, I'd remember that night for the rest of my life. You just have to see and hear it to believe it.<br /><br />If you're a fan, than you absolutely MUST own this, if you even like the band a little and do buy concerts occasionally, then this is certainly one to add to your collection.<br /><br />I do have a slight problem with CD1 as it skips during Ramble on and In My Time of Dying but I'm not sure what I want to do about it, anyone else having an issue?
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is so cool. its unbelievable how much you can do.  defines what games should be about. incredible.  cant even wait for.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I bought for my grandson. He was so happy to get the combo. I also got the T-shirt and he is very happy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is amazing. It gives you all the details of what the day will be like or the next. Must get this app!
B009IF82SK|5.0|i really like this show either past season or this season of the show. i am big bang theory fan
B009LDXQGC|5.0|All the hits are here...2 new songs...Many times I just buy a bands GH to compliment my collection.Having 2 or 3 new songs are also a bonus. If you're a 3DD fan such as I,why not add this to your collection... Great band and look forward to more new music soon 2013...  Aloha!!!!!!!!!

B004UQPM4E|5.0|Superman was always my favorite superhero since I was five years old.  Seeing the those films on Blu-Ray just suprised me BIG TIME.  And I love it!
B0034G4P80|4.0|It is what it is. Basic DVD, no frills or special packaging obviously. In good condition, crisp plastic wrappings so it should play well and play well.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is such a great movie.  You will never get tired of watching this.  The imagination behind this story and how it is brought to life is incredible!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Fast-paced and full of action.  Hard to put down.  Would like to see another book written to cover the time period between this one and the first Maze Runner.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I know I'm going out on a limb here, but Sunken Condos is not only the latest of Fagen's four solo projects (that is, without Becker, as Steely Dan). It Is His Best!! Oh sure, the new one has all the jazzy pop sensibility that all his songs are known for; and the quirky, existential humor which is his lyrical trademark. Fagen's tunes on this outing, however, are, for this llstener, a cut above, matching classics found on Dan's albums such as Royal Scam and Aja. And the Sound?! The recording and mixing is absolutely superior to any of his past records. If you are a Steely Dan fan, don't hesitate to make this purchase! If you're not.<br />start right here!
B004SIPAJG|1.0|well I actually love the movie but was unable to play it in my region - Australia -  so it went in the bin
B0054R6BFM|3.0|It was hard for me to buy into the story.  Also it was difficult for me to follow which character was speaking through out the book.  At times I found myself re-reading to figure out what was going on.
0060005696|5.0|My takeaway is that choices we make determines our quality of life and our options and choices have exploded making our life unhappy and stressful. The reasons I did not like it in the beginning was the author talked a lot about studies after studies but eventually it started to make sense.<br /><br />My other takeaway is that  I got that by  paying gratitude for what you have is important to increase the quality of life; concentrate on what good about the choices you make; be a satisfier -choices should be for good enough not only the best like maximizer; expects adaptation which means that all excitements get back to ordinary;.stop the regret and stop comparing, it could be better but it could be worse ; have rules- no more then 2 stores, 2 vacations-limit the choices.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book which will  make you more aware of choices and that having more choices is not a good because of the opportunity cost-trade off and wondering if you made the right choice. You will learn to be a satisfier that makes choices that are good enough.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|this is the worst he has ever written. Perhaps hes burned out. having bought prior to release i anticipated a book as good as all the others.
0802798225|5.0|i always buy books in bulk, like 4 or 5 at a time, and go through the list. i always have that one book that i say to myself &#34;this really doesn't look very good&#34;. well, this was that book, but boy was I wrong! this book was great, and kept me reading and wanting more!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I play this game over and over. On easy level it's just that, but as you move up into more challenging levels the games challenge changes quite a bit more - and I just have to conquer them!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Aerosmith has never missed a beat! Still rocking with creative songs but classic sound. A mix of 9lives and Get A Grip albums
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I is great alarm to wake up to your the song you like the most. instead of a loud annoying ringing bell don't get me wrong if you like the bell this app has it too
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Great product just what I wanted I can recommend to my family and friends, it was very good experience buying the product.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love every sick twist and surprise that this season has offered... In fact, I'd say this season is the best yet!
B006OKOZGU|5.0|The color quality is exceptional however the surround sound is set more like stereo. However the movie experience in Blu-ray is a real treat. If you like the classics then you want this in your collection.
1451695195|3.0|I was very excited to read this book after reading an excerpt recently. I believe the descriptions of heaven are wonderful, but the book never provided more than a vague, nondescript image of a God that could be anyone. Without belief in Christ and His sacrifice, heaven is not possible. I don't know if this omission is because the Dr. wanted to avoid this touchy subject, or if it wasn't part of his experience. Either way, it sidesteps the point. Also, the description of the goo, of being trapped and uncomfortable, was hardly heaven-like...
B003F3NE1Q|4.0|Season six was a good mix of plots, some changes in actors, lots of suspense, mystery, action and it's usual humor added into the mix. Really enjoyed this season.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|As a fan of the original, I was sure that it would be fun and I thought Johnny Depp would actually add to it- I was sooooo wrong!
B004GYY714|5.0|I like listening to old radio mysteries, they used to have them on mainline radio but not anymore. So it's nice to find them here. How nice?, only the shadow knows!,,,
B009P5S11G|5.0|I have bought that. As design is perfect. Because its design has great size. This isn't album size. The songs also are flawless. Rihanna's voice usual is unique and flawless. All songs make me happy. My favorite songs are: Phresh Out The Runway, Diamonds, Numb, Pour It Up, What Now, Stay, Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary, No Love Allowed, Lost In Paradise. You should buy that album because this is unique. UNAPOLOGETIC is the best album of Rihanna. The next singles must be What Now, Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary, Numb. Every kind of music is in the album. Reggea, Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop, Classic, Rap etc. so this album talks to everyone. Lyrics has deep sense and full of emotion. And Loud Tour Dvd (20 Minutes) is also so funny. 10/10 EXCELLENT! Congrulations RIHANNA!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really want to light Tnt on creative mode but I cant, help me please! Other then that its a fun game and I recimend it.
B008ER9QLK|4.0|I loved seeing this on Live from the Met. Lepage is a genius in my book: he adopts a 21st century aesthetic and technology to a thousand year old legend. Tremendous production.<br />Levine is excellent in the first two operas. Luisi is marginal: he is good at Verdi, but needs to study Levine and Conlon to learn how to feel Wagner.<br />Eric Owens is a stupendous Alberich, and Morris is wonderful looking and sounding as Siegfried.<br />I am REALLY glad to own this.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I ordered Phillip's new CD a month or so ago from his website.  Received it Tuesday and have listened to it at least 6 times already.  In fact, I'm now going to order 2 more copies from Amazon for friends.  Several of my favorites are Get Up, Get Down; Gone Gone Gone; Tell Me a Story, Drive Me -- Heck, I'm delighted with every track.  Phillip has surpassed expectations.  I was hooked the minute I saw his first audition on AI and never wavered.  He has true passion and artistry in his voice,in his writing ability, and especially in the magic of his lyrics.  WHAT A TREAT this album is. I challenge you not to listen to the full CD at least 3 times the first few days you own it.  It's a gift to all of us.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|When Amazon recommended this book to me, I took a look at the reviews and the price and decided I'd give it a try.  As an adult I'm not as keen on fantasy as I was as a kid, and so I tend to be fairly particular about what I consume, often putting books in the genre aside if they can't capture my attention.  I can honestly say that I had no such problem with this book.  From the first chapter to the last I was completely hooked on the narrative, and I can't wait until the next book in the series to come out!
B0063IH60K|4.0|An enjoyable version of the traditional solitaire game. Unless you are willing to fork over a small sum, you are challenged with ads at the beginning of every new game. It's easy to avoid but annoying and even though a trifling amount of money, this game is so readily available that paying to eliminate the ads grates my penury.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Having seen Justin Bieber in concert performing the songs contained on this CD I can say that he is entertaining, talented, and the music and his fast paced performance makes the ticket price worth it - what more could you ask?<br /><br />Clean cut, well behaved, and has yet to embarrass himself or his family (unlike so many celebrities - knock wood). Justin Bieber performs catchy music completely devoid of \\"pimpin'\\" and \\"ho's\\" while repeatedly reminding his target audience that they should aim high and believe they can be and stand for anything - yes we should all hate on Justin Bieber IMMEDIATELY. &lt;eye roll>.<br /><br />His songs are catchy and the criticism that they are repetitive could be said of almost any performer. I'm not going to dismiss the kid because he knows his demographic, knows what sells, and consistently delivers it. Combining talent with smart marketing is called success. Good for him for obtaining it.<br /><br />The CD is catchy and doesn't make this middle aged mom want to poke out her own eardrums with a sharp stick or have to explain to the kids that \\"we don't use that kind of language around grandma.\\"<br /><br />This review is less music criticism (tastes vary) and provided more for the parent/grandparent/aunt/uncle/family friend looking to pick up a copy for a younger listener in their life.<br /><br />The CD - and JB - are a win in my book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing...I cant stop playing it....no matter how hard I try to stop...I cant...its like there is a spell on it to make you not want to stop playing.

B004FGMV0W|5.0|luv it cant listen to it enough and hope to here more from this artist me and my neice both
B0076DCT2G|2.0|First let me say I'm a big Nelson DeMille fan.  However, I didn't think The Panther was up to his established standards.  I thought the story line was slow to develop and when it did, it was very predictable.  I did not like this John Corey and often found myself rooting for The Panther.  I was extremely happy to see the return of Paul Brenner but all I could see was the face of John Travolta's screen version of the character.  That said, when is the next DeMille novel due out?
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Starts out a bit slow and simple, but builds beautifully and adds all the fantasy elements I was looking for.  Upon completion I immediately puchased the next 2 books.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The whole fam damily loves it. We bought it for the Android phone, the Kindle Fire, and the PC version. And we STILL fight over who gets to use which device. I actually like this game better than Angry Birds, and THAT was the best game ever. PVZ: you ruined me for any other games.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This is a wonderful game for anyone interested in the keyboard!It's so much fun and very challenging at the same time.My 9 year old grandson and his friends really love it!

B000QRIGLC|4.0|If you want a book that will make you proud to be an american then this is the book for you.  Our military is out there fighting every day.  Each and every one of them is a hero even though they don't have a story like this.  They all fight and live by the same code and they love America.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|this show is awesome. i had never seen this show on SyFy but did remember hearing it advertised. i stumbled across some clips while watching YouTube and had to find out where i could get full episodes. i was a little daunted at first by the price since i had never seen a full episode but i decided to buy it and i'm really glad i did. i bought the second season before i was even done with the first!!!
B004WKI204|4.0|A light enjoyable read that has you giggling with Tina's clever and wry sense of humor.  I could almost hear her voice when reading it as it is written in a conversational style, which is easy to read.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|good movie over all. i thought it was going to be more creepy than it was. worth watching and maybe owning depending on your taste
B00873GRU4|5.0|This would be of the best book series I have read. I am looking forward to another release in 2013.<br />Of all the ebooks I have read this year this series it the best of the lot.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I'm no Twilight fan. But I have to stand-up for Stewart a bit here. The rare quality she possesses is the ability to be fragile yet formidable at the same time. Was she out of her depth here? I am seeing a lot of praise for Theron and I actually found her performance to be less believable. Chris Hemsworth's performance was most notable in my mind. If the rest of the acting were 5-star, perhaps Stewart would have fallen behind. But, this is not a 5-star film and I think she held her own. It was a new and dark twist on the story we grew up with and truer to the original. It had much more action and a much more subtle romance. I enjoyed the action and the tougher, central role of Snow White in the evil queen's demise. But, I think the story would have benefitted from an obvious and discernible romance between Stewart and Hemsworth.  These are two beautiful, passionate people. Let's be honest here: we wanted it, we longed for it and we didn't get it. Disappointing! This is a visually stunning movie and the actors are no less visually stunning. Is it predictable? Of course! Aren't all fairy tales? It does lack some depth and cohesiveness at points. All in all, its virtues outweigh its faults which make for an entertaining and worthwhile movie
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|This is downright sad. It's a total take-off of Minecraft, but with better graphics,  so where's the fun in that? The controls are confusing and hard to use. It has a story at the begining (a story!) and blocks fall on you when you try to build a dugout shelter! Don't waste your app space. Just get Minecraft.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app is buggy. It doesn't allow you to scroll down through more than one page of updates. It doen't always allow you to &quot;like&quot; anything- it'll just ignore your click. I just put do<br />wn my kindle fire and pick up my iphone...
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|Sometimes, this microphone make a sort of noise like interference. I think this problem is due to the length of the cable.
B00A4GXJD0|4.0|Its not my favorite work by Kid Rock, but its new and entertaining. Maybe after I listen to it more I'll appreciate it more like I did Born Free.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|A continuation of the first with the relationship between Gideon and Eva.  The troubles and tribulations that occur between them and the continued seduction left me wanting more.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|The writing and acting in this series is some of the best I've seen or heard in many years. The charactors become a part of your \\"family\\", so to speak. Great job all around.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book.  The story line between Travis and Abby was complicated, suspenseful and kept me reading.  I can't wait for the second book to come out in April 2013.
1401907725|1.0|it just tells good things! almost no bad things. Not realistic at all. and the drawing is not attracting enough. I think it is for teenagers to play with their friends. It's a pity I cannot see some cards of the deck before I buy. If it is ok, Amazon should show 20 cards of the deck, so we'll know what it's like and whether it's suitable or not.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have found myself re-reading this series.  I loved the crossfire series!  Gideon Cross is seductive and sexy.  I found myself staying up way too late entralled in the story line.
B00022XOAO|4.0|This cd was sourced from taped live recording.  It was played fast compared to its competitors, in particular in the first movement.  According to liner notes, Kleiber thought this work should be played at brisk.  The sound quality is actually pretty good.  I picked it up in local music store for $5.99.  I could not imagine why amazon marketplace is so outrageous while you can purchase it from UK for $12.99.  Be aware, this CD cannot be played on computer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is an excellent pass time especially when you are really really board and are just looking for some thing to do
B009KKLQVS|2.0|I preordered this disk after having seen the tour and held off posting a review until I received it and watched it.  I'm very disappointed, and the list of reasons is long.<br /><br /> *Only 21 of the songs - that is VERY disappointing for a BlueRay<br /> *ZERO inserts.  Nada.  ZIP.  Nothing<br /> *As I watched it became clear that not only the vocals were doctored to make them sound better (expected)<br />  but it is a STUDIO TRACK of Isn't It Time (totally unexpected.)  I went to the concert, I and thousands<br />  of others LIKED IT.  There was no reason to add pretend audio if we already liked the show and bought the<br />  disk.<br /><br />Seriously considering sending it back to Amazon for a refund.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I enjoy all the Reacher Series books by Lee Child. You just get hooked on the character. This may not be the best one but it is close. They are all good...

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie was a summer blockbuster. In case you were living in a cave or under a rock or something and hadn't heard, The Avengers was a great movie.
1451608659|5.0|I thought this was a good account of what it was like growing up in the world of gymnastics.  Dominique seemed to have such a happy face on her in the spotlight.  It was heartbreaking to hear what the Karolyi's and even her own father put through when she was growing up.  It was nice to hear how she met her  sister that she never new existed and that Jennifer was treated well by her adoptive family which was really the opposite of what Dominique and Christina had growing up. It was too bad that they never knew each other growing up.  I hope the best for all of them.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This book is very slow and goes into details that do not need to be there. I am very disappointed in this one. Her books are usully very good.
B008VBYN80|5.0|awesome the game was so awesome but the fact you have to use diamonds to upgrade that's the only thing I don't like.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|I've just finished reading the first book in the Cold Equations series, The Persistence of Memory. Good book, well-written, I enjoyed it. David Mack is known to bring about certain changes to the continuity (that's an understatement, he's the author of the Destiny trilogy). The middle part in first person narrative was quite interesting, you don't see many of those these days. Also, using the plot of orbital skydiving again was a good idea, especially because Geordi does talk about what went wrong the last time they tried.<br /><br />Two things I didn't like: killing characters and very little about the Typhon Pact. After reading John Scalzi's Redshirts, I can't help but cringe every time a redshirt is killed off for no good reason or a supporting character dies off for dramatic effect. Remember when Lt. Carey died in Voyager's 7th season, in his first appearance since the 1st season? Yeah, like that. As for the Typhon Pact, I just happen to be really interested in interstellar politics, what's going on in the large picture. Books that deviate to tell a side story and then reset, like Indistinguishable from Magic, get a low score from me, after reading the last two Typhon Pact / DS9 novels.<br /><br />Those two are the reasons why this book lost a star. But on the rest, it's really good and I recommend it. I can't wait for the next one (already bought it).
B004V546IW|5.0|I found this book very interesting. There are a lot of facts about the band that I did not know. I would recommend this book to any Bon Jovi fans.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Saw Coldplay live twice in Germany and I can definitely recommend this live DVD! All the great feelings are conveyed perfectly, the sound quality is very good. I've had goosebumps all the time :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a psychological thriller that gets you from the beginning. Good story, although disturbing. Not a feel good book.
B007Q0K9TE|2.0|We were very disappointed with this DVD. The pictures were not clear, showed the audience too much, some of the musical numbers were dubbed in from previous shows and the selections were not his &#34;best&#34;. We gave this dvd away after one viewing. Do not recommend this one to anyone. It does not do Andre justice.
B009UZBLSG|3.0|Adapter works great on the new Nexus 4.<br /><br />It does not fit with the stock Google bumper however. Also new HDMI RedMere cables do not work with it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the issue is, software, or the slimport, but on the Nexus 4 when you navigate to a new screen the hdmi display flickers black, then back on. It's fine when you're actually watching something but it can get kind of annoying.<br /><br />Update: I took sandpaper to the edges of the slimport adapter and it fits with the stock bumper on no problems. Just a tip if you want to go that route.

B007JCP8FE|5.0|I love Shinedown, hands-down my favorite band. I have to admit that I don't own every one of their CD's. I did, however, go out of my way to make sure I got this one. And I don't regret a bit of effort!<br />The whole CD from beginning to end is very relatable. From the heavier rock sounds to the slower more contemporary songs. You can tell that the lead singer Brent puts his heart and soul into what he's singing. Not to mention how beautiful his voice is.<br />I have listened to this album so many times on repeat I can't possibly count the number of times. I love this band.<br />If anyone doesn't like this CD then they need some serious therapy! I HIGHLY recommend this CD to every single person out there.
B00004U45G|5.0|this album is outstanding from start to finish.  I'm a diehard LZ fan and a modest Black Crowes fan, but thought the mixture really  brought home my love of Jimmy's guitar and the distinct style of Chris Robinson.  I picked up a few tunes while listening to my LZ radio on Pandora and knew right away I needed to purchase this cd.  Nobody's Fault but Mine is one of the best on the cd.  If you love LZ, you'll love this one time marriage (taking nothing away at all from Plant).  The only slight issue I could tell was that it was obvious that the great John Bonham was not on the drums....the Crowe drummer just doesn't play as hard...but he is still great as well.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I like stories where \\"history comes alive.\\"  Ken Follett is a master at this kind of fiction.  I feel like I receive a real appreciation for historical events that I never would have obtained from a history book, while enjoying the story and the characters involved.  Follett is just as good as he always has been with these types of stories.  After reading his first two books in this series, I am greatly looking forward to the third.

I may see it being polished.<br />I am only picking on the fact. They do not have 10 years to spend creating it.<br />Not money. Time. Interesting views on time. I do like this use of fantastical time better. Then the absurd idea of going backwards. Only travel back in memories. To use for now. Be present. With truth. Much more satisfying for the fun and play. So love.

1405910259|3.0|So far I have been disappointed in the titles rushed to publication on the coat tails of Fifty Shades of Grey incredible success and I confess that I expected I would read a few pages of Reflected in You and then set it aside. Instead I was surprised to find myself caught up in the relationship between Eva and Gideon as they try to build a life together. While their mutual attraction is never in doubt, Eva and Gideon are finding that reconciling their emotional needs is much more difficult.<br /><br />There isn't nearly as much sex as I expected in Reflected In You, instead the focus is on the couple's attempts to connect in ways that are not exclusively sexual and establish trust and honesty in their relationship. As both Eva and Gideon have major issues stemming from the abuse they endured as children neither trusts easily and true intimacy is something they need to work at developing. Unfortunately their pasts seem intent on sabotaging their attempts with Gideon's scheming ex lover causing trouble and Eva's abuser making a shocking reappearance.<br />While the relationship between Eva and Gideon is not exactly healthy, clouded as it is by lust and obsession, it's a surprisingly equal partnership. I had expected more of a master/slave scenario both sexually and in their everyday interactions but that was not the case.<br /><br />Perhaps what I found most surprising about Reflected In You was the quality of writing, Day's experience as an accomplished author is evident. There is a lot of angst, contrived misunderstandings and melodrama but there is also a genuine portrayal of passion, affection and intimacy.<br /><br />I haven't read Bared to You, the first installment in the Crossfire trilogy, so I came into this storyline without any knowledge of the characters but I found this didn't really matter. Reflected in You is a surprisingly engaging read and I think that readers who have been reluctant to embrace the mainstream erotica trend should sample the Crosssfire series before dismissing the entire genre.series before dismissing the entire genre.
1451627297|3.0|I don't normally read King. The couple of his books I did tackle years back bored me to tears with the endless padding wrapped around a pretty basic story. However a friend recomended 63 to me so I decided to give it a shot. Needless to say it took me back in time as well, it reminded me of the earlier books of his I had read. A pretty basic story wrapped in endless padding.<br /><br />You can't deny King's writing ability, the guy really is a master but boy does he need a good editor.  To be honest I had to put it down for a few Months before I could trudge to the end. The love story seems to take up about 70% of the book and the actual assasination day with Kennedy was a real let down. Needless to say it reenforced what I always thought about King, he writes beautifully, then he takes a basic story and wrapes it in endless padding.

0062183591|3.0|This is a fun book for sure, very easy to read (low prevalence of $2 words) and would serve as a great introductory book into the cognitive sciences for a high school or even middle school student.<br /><br />That said, I do have some issues with the complete absence of the emerging field of cognitive behavioral therapy which would tie together much of his research. His studies suggest that when taking an oath of good will before one is confronted with a situation where a decision is to be made about whether to cheat or be honest, we are more likely to be honest.  This is where a nice connection to cognitive behavioral therapy would have been so nice to see in my opinion.<br /><br />Part of the root of cognitive behavioral therapy is the repetition of positive reinforcing coping statements about whatever it is that we are trying to overcome until the brain has become aligned with the premise being reinforced. For example, a session of CBT could include writing down \\"I am willing to be honest\\" for 5 minutes straight followed by looking oneself in the mirror and saying the phrase to oneself for a few minutes followed by telling a friend the same phrase with them repeating back to you \\"Yes, you are willing to be honest\\". There are a multitude of other ways CBT offers tools to reinforce all the types of behavior we would like to change.<br /><br />Another suggestion from CBT that Ariely misses is the value of a statement written in the positive form is far greater than a statement written in the negative form. Thus, \\"I will not cheat\\" will not work as well as \\"I am being honest\\". Try not thinking of a white polar bear. I mean really do not think of a white polar bear. Are you still not thinking of a white polar bear?<br /><br />Ariely talks about the catholic flagellants that cause self-mutilation upon themselves whenever taking the wrong course. While this does work to some extent, and Ariely suggests against that he again misses the opportunity to introduce to the reader CBT and wide array of tools present to dispense of the wanderings of the brain.<br /><br />One revelation I have had recently that has settled my mind is associating religious prayer as simply a spiritual version of a positive reinforcing coping statement. Prayer works because it refocuses us on the present situation at hand.<br /><br />The other bit to notice, that has already been pointed out in another review, is the heavy reliance on college students to gather data. This is could impact the results quite heavily but who knows.<br /><br />Like I said this is a fun book and you will flip through the pages non-stop but the huge piece of CBT has gone missing.der CBT and wide array of tools present to dispense of the wanderings of the brain.<br /><br />One revelation I have had recently that has settled my mind is associating religious prayer as simply a spiritual version of a positive reinforcing coping statement.

B005LAIGPA|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />Reading some of the other reviews of \\"Chronicle,\\" I was a little reluctant to bother watching it. Yet another \\"found footage\\" film--maaannn, when are they going to realize that this technique has been done to death?--and there's not even any logical reason to use it here. Nevertheless, I was very impressed with what this film's creators were able to do. Really fine acting and storyline: The way the three very different protagonists interact is quite convincing. \\"Chronicle\\" also aptly portrays adolescent/high school existence, an age that so many films screw up with clich&eacute;s and stereotypes. Very true-to-life dialogue: Whoever wrote the script did an outstanding job. All the Greek morality play elements, the theme of hubris, etc, add a great deal. Special effects are good but not too Hollywood-slick, which makes them all-the-more convincing. Humankind's common desire, unaided flight, is portrayed without strings attached: The flight scenes are, well, awesome, and they also capture the complications of achieving this dream. Plenty of surprises--love the ending.<br /><br />Still, \\"Chronicle\\" would benefit from a little more-in-general (only 84 minutes?!), which is, I suppose, the best sort of flaw a film can have.

Also, it arrived a few days early, and works better than I would've expected of a second-hand copy. You literally have no reason not to buy this album if you don't already own it.
B005K01VZS|5.0|'Have a Little Faith' is a true story about Mitch Albom's Rabbi as a child growing up, as well as a Baptist minister in Detroit.

B009KZMFOA|1.0|Both the concert, which I saw at Carnegie Hall, and the CD are valiant efforts. But they do not work. Kaas turned the Piaf catalogue into a morose Film Noire / Shostakovitch experience. Her great voice so wonderful in her original material is not suitable for Piaf songs. Her limited vocal powers cannot do justice do these songs.  She captures neither the drama not the joy of Piaf, and turns it all into monotone expressions of anguish that come across as forced and artificial. It is akin to listening to the same movie soundtrack over and over. Kaas does best when she stick to her own style. Everytime she takes on signature works of other artists, she falls flat.

B009HV2JT8|1.0|Very poor movie, found it to be a very poor storyline, acting was ok, but over all a waste of time.
0553386794|3.0|Never been a fantasy reader: It was almost fantasy for me to wander into that section of the book store. But I did, because my curiousity was piqued by a colleague who was reading the series. I grabbed Game of Thrones, and here I sit, a day later typing my two cents worth.<br /><br />To be honest, I'd say that Martin went easy on the fantasy to make the series more palatable to a broader audience base. In some sections of the book you think you're reading historical fiction.<br /><br />A conservative perceptual framework bids me to comment on the sex--Martin does not blush, nor does his editor, apparently. Bedrooms have walls and doors for two reasons: privacy and discretion. The fantasy setting is pluralistically pagan; gods are worshiped rather than God. To be honest, if I had teenagers, I wouldn't let them read it because of the unbridled intimacy.<br /><br />Dialogue is decent and realistic--ironically, I enjoyed the parts with Tyrion the dwarf, because he is so candid, to the point of leaving the reader wryly smiling.<br /><br />You feel regret when the character you're rooting for dies, or does something stupid. Martin doesn't become attached to his characters and you know this as a reader, which makes you almost hold your breath in some places.<br /><br />It really does open your eyes to political intrigue, and makes you wonder if you'd want to be king after all. Who can you really trust? No one, not even yourself.<br /><br />In a patriarchal society Martin does a good job of balancing POV with female characters--Catelyn, Arya, Sansa, Dary, etc. You grow comfortable with the constant POV shift after the first several switches.<br /><br />Overall, the book held my attention well, though it could have been shortened a tad.<br /><br />I leave you with part of the last sentence of the book, which was an awesome sentence: \\"...and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.\\"
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It was worth the time to watch. Good effects, good acting and storyline was good. It was worth watching. (:
0062183591|4.0|I came across Dan Ariely's book, \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\\", as a required reading in Carlow University's Masters of Science in Fraud and Forensics([...]) for a course on Forensic Research and Analysis. What a pleasant surprise. The book provided a refreshing angle to a topic that could easily turn dry.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the engaging narratives Ariely provided for each scenario and study he conducted. Having a witty, comprehendible story to depict each study on cheating and dishonestly made the ideas relatable and real and transferrable to problems noted in society. The book was written in a manner in which the chapters could easily stand alone, but yet you could see the progression of Ariely's thoughts and discoveries about dishonesty from beginning to end. A reader could easily pick and choose a chapter here and there and still come away with some intriguing ideas about why we cheat. Overall, the book was very reader friendly to and `outsider' to social science ideology.<br /><br />One thing I would have like to have seen in the book would have been some examples of real-world applications. Although,  I realize the concept of the book is to provide theories and evidence on why people act dishonestly for one's own interpretation on scenarios, it would have been nice to see some of the concepts come full circle. An \\"a-ha\\" moment of clarity when the reader sees the studies translated to real life would have had a greater impact.<br /><br />As a reader stemming from an rather new field of study, fraud/forensic science, the book provided some input that could be used in many industries and professions. Ariely offered some ideas and scientific research to back some theories that could be applied to white-collar crimes and fraudulent activity.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I rented this movie 90% for the eye candy.  Sadly the other 10% ruined the 90% for me.  This movie is dull.  Terrible acting.  And the storyline sucked.  I get your brother involved with drugs by proxy and fall in love with you.  So, sorry about your brother but you take me anyway.  Mkay.  What a waste of time.  I want my 2 hours back.  If you aren't offended by the language (which I expected some of but not as much as there was), and the terrible plot....if you can look past it, the eye candy is nice.  But you see most of that in the trailer so just save yourself the time!

B008PPUMVY|5.0|Ok so Zappa isn't everyone's cup of tea .... but, this is a fantastic album. This is a bizarre play based on joe and his exploits. There are tongue in cheek swipes at those who would censor music, the church of scientology and many others. We are lead through the story by the central scrutinizer, who with a whispered voice through a plastic megaphone keeps us up to date with what's going on. The music is fantastic, old time rock n roll, blues, rock, disco, weirdo, all with Zappa's uniqueness to color them. There are plenty of great zappa guitar solo's especially in the second half and probably the most beautifully exquisite thing he ever recorded, watermelon in easter hay.<br />If you have a decent sense of humor, like variety in your music and aren't easily offended i would highly recommend this album. you'll love it, it's a way of life :)

B005K01VZS|5.0|I have to admit I haven't read a Mitch Albom book I didn't like, but this one takes the cake.  I think it's because HE's one of the main characters - it's a true story about two very different men of faith and their impact on Mitch.  Great read, highly recommended!
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|This book is informative and applicable. It shares ideas and examples of how a person can stay positive, make wise decisions, and develop effective communication skills. I enjoyed the format of the chapters. Of course, this book isn't as deep as \\"a crossing or the drop's history\\" by Anatoliy Obraztsov what I've read before and, in fact, I prefer deep books. But I rated \\"The Science of Mind\\" 5! Each chapter expresses an idea and gives an example from the author's life, an example from research or scientific authority, and an example from the Bible. The information is clear and easy to read, yet causes the reader to reflect and ponder new ideas. It motivates change and improvement.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the way of all of the zombies look real and the stuff you can make its like a ultimate universe in a game
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I chose this book because I love legal/psychological thrillers, and this one really delivered, for the most part. The author uses passages from a grand jury transcript as a flashback/foreshadowing device that in a few places seem to not match what happens in the story, but I would not say that detracts hugely from the book overall. It could be that the author was trying to show the main character's lack of attachment to reality, but if so, the result were a few foggy plot points. The characters are well-drawn, and the first-person narrator has a likable voice and a charm about him, which creates a nice tension for the reader, since there are points at which you feel conflicted about his actions and motives. Very enjoyable read in all.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|The truth is in the title: This is just simply amazing! Nothing else I can say ... It blew my mind ... of all the Tinkerbell movies, this is the one that makes me stare in awe ... if you are looking for a good movie ... this is where you should look ...
B0050Q3UEM|4.0|Digitally Imported Radio is an entertaining app which offers a wide range of high quality music channels. Ambient and Tech House are favorites but Breaks, Chillout Dreams, and Latin House are among the many enjoyable channels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!! Read it in 2 days...just got lost in the story. Wonderful ending. Ordered all three in one week.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great series of books definitely a great read, I am officially addicted to these. Can't wait for the next one
B005FITIK0|3.0|Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman are well-known mavericks on the Indie film scene. Perhaps Ms Cody's script was from personal experience, and maybe Reitman thought he could rely on a good cast to make it work. It almost does.<br /><br />Charlize Theron plays the most selfish, unlikeable and despicable character I've seen in a long time...and she's magnificent. Her futile meltdown at the end is priceless. Patrick Wilson shows more depth of character than I've seen from him, and was quite good. Poor pitiful Patton Oswalt plays a guy we've all known; misunderstood, out-cast and bullied mercilessly in his youth, he's become cynical and all-knowing in his lonely later years. It's really not as bad as some of the 1-star reviews claim; the only unlikeable character is Charlize, and it's played fearlessly.<br /><br />I thought the script was clever in many places, and laughed out loud a few times. It's not really easy to watch, and I'll never buy it, but I'm glad I saw it. There are a lot of films about \\"You can't go home again\\" (my favorite being \\"Old Joy\\").<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it, and it really does create another perspective toward the idea of living in the past, and the way various people deal with it.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|Not exactly what i expected, but i have to admit, this book had its moments. Not just a romance, but a story of soul searching in a way, but without happy ending. Well written, but slow read. Interesting story, but it's missing something.
0345803507|5.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />The beginning of the book starts out with Christian and Ana finishing their honeymoon, which at times is hilarious! During their honeymoon something happens at home and soon after they leave their bubble to face reality once again. Jack (aka ex-boss) is after Christian for revenge...which tells why later...and continues to torment Christian and Ana. Christain gets more security which gives him a reason to even be more protective with Ana. Which of course we know Ana doesnt always listen to Christian and suffers the consequences of his 'twitchy hand'.<br />The book basically wraps up Christian's past (Mrs. Robinson, ex-subs, his childhood) and gives us some SERIOUS twists regarding his relationship with Ana. Of course, there are humorous parts....Christian realizing Ana didn't change her name at work and still goes by Anastasia Steele, a very short dress, topless, jetski, lots and lots of sex,  etc etc<br />Overall the books were great...I was really surprised of how much I loved them and a little sad to see a good series come to an end. I hope E.L. James will continue on with the movie and make sure the producers/directors will not leave out the important parts of the book. (Not just the sex lol)<br />If you haven't read any of the books...I would highly suggest getting them.<br />Twilight for MA only! ;)
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I have loved Owl City for a long time, and this album is no exception. The music is fun and upbeat.Great on any workout playlist. I love the fact that I can listen to this with my kids in the room. The more I listen to this album the more I love it!
0385344333|3.0|Compared with the standards of thrill and entertainment that I would typically associate with a Reacher novel, this was a notch below. The plot and the story is mediocre, the narrative style is too staccato, and the overall speed slow. In fact, Reacher is stuck inside a car for the first 30% of the novel, either in the capacity of a passenger or as a driver, which itself is a huge let down. Reacher needs to be on his foot to do what he does best!<br /><br />Further, there are portions where Reacher deciphers puzzles which perhaps even a computer will take years to solve, but then there are portions he finds himself having made wrong deductions. It is understandable to make a character \\"human\\", but not at this huge a variation! There is also a lot of unnecessary flab, and resulting in the novel being at-least 50-70 pages too long. Overall, an average read, whether judged in the relative context of the Reacher series, or even otherwise.<br /><br />Btw, don't miss the obvious joke played by Lee Child in this novel as a revenge- a dumb and worthless police office in this story has been named John Puller (remember Zero Day by David Baldacci, with an almost Reacher like protagonist named John Puller)?!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a well written book, that has rich characters and a compelling story.  It may be hard to read at some points, but each story is meant to build upon the others.  Its not about love and hate, its about the struggle and persistence to live greater fuller lives while fighting the 'ocean' of conformity.  This book is not for simple readers, but for readers who want substance and not pages.

B004QIG7CW|5.0|I was recovering in the hospital when I started watching this movie.  I missed the second half, so the second I was out of the hospital, I bought the movie.  I loved it!  I've watched it three times, and even bought the soundtrack
034580404X|4.0|OK! Books.  Kind of the same thing throughout the entire story.  If you want a good intelligent book, then I would not suggest this.
0547884591|5.0|I've never been big into cooking, mostly because I never really knew how. But I thought I would give this one a try. Although the book just came out yesterday, it was recommended to me by a \\"foodie\\" friend of mine who got an advance copy. The 4 Hour Chef truly teaches you how to cook instead of just giving you recipes and assuming you already know how. Great book for someone who maybe didn't get it before... but you will now. Thanks to Tim!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love, love, LOVE this show! When the show first started, I decided to try it out. Shows I like tend to get canceled, so I really hate starting new ones. I loved the first episode and I was hooked. Every character in the show has a great background story and fits perfectly within the show. Emily Thorne is one of the best written characters I've ever seen. One of the best things about this show is how it keeps you guessing. You really never know what's going to be around the corner and that's what hooks in viewers in to keep watching! I highly recommend the first season for you or as a gift to someone! It's wonderful!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fast moving .<br />Good plot..keeps you reading and guessing very beliveable would recommend it to.friends<br /> Keeps his string of enjoyable books golng
B004YM6JLO|5.0|The third season of The Vampire Diaries is the best yet. When the show started out, I was on the edge on liking it. I loved the book but didn't see how the show could be as good. Wrong! This show is one that gets better every season. I'm sure the fourth one will be even better than this one. The characters are like able and complex. The scenery is wonderful, also! I highly recommend this series!
B000VSYRO6|5.0|I was trolling around on youtube and found an interview that Herbie had done about how he came to write \\"Watermelon Man. I actually remembered the song from the 60's and looked for it on Amazon. Needless to say I was blown away. I have no idea how I missed this album since I have just about everything he has put out...This one not only shows but proves his greatness even in the beginning...Thank you Mr. Hancock...thank you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Through this whole series you will find yourself blushing, hot, turned on, mad,, sad but most of all wanting more. You feel like you are Anastasia the way it is written . All the books are awesome...can't put them down. Actually rereading them now.

B009LL4LMM|5.0|Jellyflop's a cute little beast of a game, as is its protagonist. Ultimately, like a lot of physics-based puzzlers, success mainly comes about through trial and error, but it can be fun to find those solutions.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case seems very sturdy once it is installed on your phone.  The silence switch is very finicky.  The little plastic piece that is supposed to toggle the switch came broken on mine and was loose in the box.  Once I figured out that it was supposed to be attached to the inside of the case (and then spent 20 minutes messing with it so it would seat properly), I finally got it to work.  The screen protector does diminish the touch screen sensitivity a bit, but not really a big deal once you get used to it.  All, in all I thought it was a pretty good case...until I tried to make a phone call.  The person I was talking to sounded kind of muffled, again no big deal.  The big problem was that he could barely hear me.  I would not recommend buying this case if you plan on using your phone as a phone.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had a hard time putting the book down! The plot of the story was not easily given away. There were twists to the story to keep you engaged. Love it!
0547884591|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive an advance copy of the 4-Hour Chef and I have to say it's absolutely awesome. The 4-Hour Workweek completely changed my life and the 4-Hour Chef will probably do the same. It's absolutely amazing how Tim Ferris deconstructs the learning process and teaches you how to learn pretty much everything. As a physician, I have to learn so much new information on a daily basis. This book will really change the way I approach the acquisition of new skills. Thanks for sharing this knowledge with us! Highly recommended.

B009369Z8A|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />Lawless started out as a form on genealogy. Matt Bondurant knew his grandfather Jack Bondurant and his grand-uncles Forrest and Howard were bootleggers. This led to the historical novel The Wettest County in the World (2008). The book wound up in the hands of director John Hillcoat (The Road, The Proposition).<br />\\"Bootlegging sort of drew the Bondurants into this crazy kind of world of corruption and lawlessness ironically,\\" Hillcoat said. \\"But then mostly they survived, they got through it all and actually went on to have businesses and children. And traditionally the gangster film teaches us that we've to  pay for our sins. Usually the gangster is shot down in a blaze of glory and doesn't get up again.\\"<br />In the movie Lawless, the Bondurant brothers have created this almost immortal image. And according to how much of this actually happened, they certainly live up to that image.<br />It's 1931 and the brothers are the most successful bootleggers in Franklin County, Virginia. Cricket Pate runs their bar, which is a cover for their illegal venture.<br />Maggie Beauford, a dancer from Chicago, arrives and becomes their new waitress.<br />The brothers have been selling moonshine to everyone from clergy to law enforcement. Special Deputy Charley Rakes confronts Forrest and tells him things will be changing, that all profits made by bootleggers will stop. All bootleggers but the Bondurant brothers fold to Rakes demands.<br />Lawless is an intoxicating film, filled with brutal imagery and you can't help but pull for the backwoods boys.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommend this book to all women who are 21 and over.  Once you have read the first two you will be very eager to read this one.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|i havent been able to download this damm game since i bought it. im so annoyed! why sell it for  kindles if theyre incompatible?

B002BWP49C|1.0|I tried to watch \\"Breaking Dawn Part 1\\", but the movie was so boring, I had to fast-forward through it. There was one good moment though: when Bella told her pasty husband and Jake the shape-shifter her daughter's name. Jake's face was spot-on!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Every episode is creatively funny and a treat in itself.<br /><br />I wish the episodes were longer but perhaps then you wouldn't crave more.
B00926J3K6|5.0|Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp's \\"2012 stereo mix\\" of the original \\"Larks' Tongues\\" LP is one of most radical improvements of a studio recording I've ever heard. It's up there with Iggy Pop's remix of The Stooges' \\"Raw Power\\" in terms of revealing the the true album that's been hidden under poor mixing and mastering all these decades, more breathtakingly clear than one could ever have imagined. It's one thing to hear a standard remaster and feel like like you're hearing a favorite record given a spit shine; it's not exaggerating to say that this feels like the original band had a chance to go back in time and re-record the album properly for the first time. I nearly jumped out of my seat the first time I played this, it lives and breathes in ways you never thought possible. An immensely satisfying experience and a must for any Crimson fan.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I just saw this in the theater.  Pending Les Miserables not out in theaters yet, this is the best movie experience  I've had since The King's Speech.  Compelling and spellbinding.  I'll be seeing it again this weekend.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|One of the best aspects of the plot is  that it is reflective of the gender issues of the time + it is plausible, engrossing and exciting.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|The sleeve is simple, durable, reasonably inexpensive, and serves the intended purpose. It could be improved by either adding more space inside or a holder on the outside for a stylus.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I picked this up when I saw it on the best sellers list, even having heard about it being a rip of twilight with a \\"mommy porn\\" twist. The characters in this book were complete copycats of John and Elizabeth in 9 1/2 Weeks. Any character development I thought this book had was because it reminded me of those in 9 1/2 Weeks. Don't bother reading this. In fact, don't bother watching it either when the movie comes out.
B0026S1XD2|5.0|A wonderful classic album l had to have. Timeless. Its one of those albums everyone should have in their collection

B001AH6ZWY|5.0|My review of this movie can be summed up with this quotation from the movie: \\"You wanna hear something really nutty? I heard of a couple guys who wanna build something called an 'airplane,' you know you get people to go in, and fly around like birds, it's ridiculous, right? And what about breaking the sound barrier, or rockets to the moon, or atomic energy, or a mission to Mars? Science fiction, right? Look, all I'm asking, is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision. You know, to just sit back for one minute and look at the big picture. To take a chance on something that just might end up being the most profoundly impactful moment for humanity, for the history... of history.\\"
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A good read but not really up to Lee Child's standards.  I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels and as they go on they are losing some of there energy.  I used to learn a great deal about weapons, social morals and many other things that Jack would encounter.  Now in some instances they are quite dull.
1451683405|5.0|I rarely write reviews for anything, but I felt compelled to do so for this book. Simply put, it is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. I was familiar with the free will is an illusion philosophy but never took much time to read about it. This book is a must read.
B006588YUE|5.0|I bought this when I built my own system with the i7, but wasn't sure how it would fit or work. I don't regret buying it at all, and the price was great also!

B000JJS8TM|1.0|This sells looks like DVD movie and CD music, but the reality is that both are the same, the DVD is not the movie nor even have fotos , just the picture of the cover and the same music that already have the CD. They should put an advice that the DVD is just the same music and have no images.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Amazing book that really makes you reflect on the power of your action, or I actions, on others. I thought the premise of the book sounded depressing, but in reality the book was moving and enlightening. I continue daily to think about the impacts of my actions on others because of this book.
0385504225|3.0|This is a good book. I considered he has written better novels and this is not the best of them, but if you already have the book  you can read it and you will enjoy it.

0312427565|5.0|'The Right Stuff' investigates the beginnings of the American space program. In particular, it follows the stories of the seven astronauts in Project Mercury. According to Wolfe, the intent of this book was to pry inside the minds and motivations of America's astronauts. He has succeeded, and with gripping clarity and storytelling flair.<br /><br />The lives of the Mercury Seven and their families are weaved into a background of Cold War politics, media sensationalism and unspoken military social codes. Wolfe's writing shows a mastery of selective detail. The personal quirk of one of the astronauts might lie side-by-side with a historical fact that would seem obscure by the pen of a less talented writer. Carefully selected impressions like these blend together to paint a heady and comprehensive picture of the characters behind the early space program. Indeed, I felt as if I'd finished a book twice its size (in a good way!)<br /><br />This is a highly recommendable introduction to Wolfe's writing.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Having read Kate's other books I was really looking forward to reading the Secret Keeper and she did not disappoint.  I couldnt put the book down and kept me guessing until the end.  I cant wait for her next book....
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not sure why this book cannot be critiqued on its own merit without comparison. It was a page turner from start to finish. That is what I expect from Vince Flynn and it is what he consistently delivers.  Strong plot, lots of action and an ending that makes you stand up and fist pump!
B009PEPML4|5.0|If you like the old Godpseed, in particular Yanqui UXO, then you'll like this too. They stand the test of time better than most.
1607066017|3.0|Just a warning, this is my first review and I have read a lot more books than comics but I still feel like I know a good story and comic when I see one. OK, I just finished this a minute ago and I have to say I feel like it is pretty overrated. As far as the design goes, it seems pretty average. The art looks very photoshopy and some of the lettering looks like it was literally the first draft.  I see some people say the art was amazing but I honestly can't think of one page that really made me go, \\"Whoa..\\" It seems rushed as there is hardly any detail in any of the panels. The story was also very average. Possible spoilers here. First of all, this is not science fiction, its fantasy. There is magic, ships grow on trees, there are ghosts, etc... Two people from different sides of a war in another galaxy fall in love (apparently the only two on both plantes because everyone seems to be after them for no real reason other than that everyone hates eachother) and they have a baby they are trying to raise. It has potential but it just feels very generic to me. Also, none of the different races feel any different than humans on Earth. Even the robots have sex,poop, and worry about staph infections. People get married, have divorces, and even eat mbilical cords after the birth. Apparently in times of interplanetary war people still have issues with cell phone service as well? Also, the \\"forgein\\" language of one of the races is basically broken spanish. The entire thing feels incredibly rushed and just not very well thought out at all. The only thing I really enjoyed about this is that it was a comic book. I think you can still read the first issue on comixology for free if you want to give it a try. Its a fair price and still decently fun so I will give it a 3 out of 5, although for ten dollars you can get some incredible stuff on here.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I like action,the first film was fast paced. This one was wicked. The makers had to of went all out,this movie has all the players I like to see. So if you like action and sometimes find you are skipping to the good parts you will like this one. NO SKIPPING!!
B009WJ2XT6|2.0|How can you have a soundtrack CD for a James Bond movie without either the title theme or the James Bond theme? Thomas Newman did a good job on the rest of the sountrack, but it's not compelling enough for me to buy with Adele's \\"Skyfall\\" or John Barry's \\"James Bond Theme.\\"
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book in Junior High and really identified with it. Since then I have reread it multiple times and it has stayed salient. It's a book I give away and recommend often.<br /><br />I think the success of the book is the realness of the characters. Never at anytime do you feel like you are reading about children. I believe that's what makes it work. I never remember thinking of myself as a child when I was one. All my experiences then were just and important and consuming as the ones I have now as an adult. It's that perspective and belief that I feel resonated with me as a child and still now as an adult.<br /><br />This is one book that will be on my children's reading list.
B0044WZHKS|5.0|This movie is a classic and the quality was superb. I never had an issue playing on my Xbox360 and definitely recommend this classic as Michael Myers is hands down the scariest stalker of the era of slasher movies.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing farmville on facebook!  They are so similar and a joy to play.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I was ready to have a snarky comment on this movie.  Then I watched it.  It's worth watching.  I never thought I'd say that.  The phrase \\"Footloose remake\\" sounds like the start of a stand up act.  And the soundtrack was pretty good, too.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Always awesome music, though slightly different from their previous albums. None the less it is still amazing. three more epic words required.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i cant believe its free! its challenging but not to hard and it has tons of levels. i definently recomend it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is an awesome game with no glitches and lots of oppurtunity without having to pay any real money unless your impatient. I would get it, its so much fun
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This movie was not worth watching.  Also, there's a part in the movie where a girl strips down to her underwear and bra.  Like we need to see that.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Not too much gameplay here but a nice flight sim that works well. You can land on a carrier or an airstrip. There are some recon missions in the 6 mission career mode, but most of the game is just landing. Modeled are the F14, F18 and C2 Greyhound. The weather can be pretty tricky so that's what the game is all about.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I got this app for budgeting. Its easy to use and simple. I like it for what I use it for.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game because it is a cool game about fun histery and you get to make your own town by your self
B009CPIR9K|1.0|How did these actors get through all of these scenes without busting up. Really, the story is so much in need.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I don't understand everyone's fascination with these books and movies.  I don't find anything entertaining about the fact that a child is forced to fight for her and her families lives to the death for food.  How horrible and morbid.  Don't get it and couldn't get past the 2nd chapter.  Snooze-fest and annoying.
B00A3AY134|5.0|these are all great songs!! and i love the new ones. 3 doors down is such an amazing band and i cant wait to see them live in a couple of days! BUY THIS! even if you haven't heard the album you wont be disappointed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|a great app and i love it but it is not very useful. that is unless you check you constantly worry about your battery
B006S08RLU|5.0|I always get lost in this movie, this movie is actually amazing and will transport you to a new world :D
0739311123|5.0|Have been teaching this book in my classroom for years. Was in need of new audio as the old cassette tapes just weren't getting it any longer. The audio cds are perfect. Thanks.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Lots of variations/options to play so it isn't boring.  Can play as single or multiple players.  I'm really enjoying it.
B0081HLM2E|4.0|[THIS REVIEW INCLUDES MINOR SPOILERS.]<br /><br />\\"Headhunters\\" (\\"Hodejegerne\\") is a thriller about Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), a headhunter by day and art thief by night. With a help from is accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander), Roger continues to steal so that he can maintain his lavish lifestyle. Living in a fancy house with his beautiful wife Diana (Synnøve Macody Lund), Roger Brown thinks his life is going well until he breaks into a certain person's apartment where Roger discovers something that strongly suggests his life was not perfect after all.<br /><br />The situation goes from bad to worse when Roger realizes he is being hunted down by someone - someone holding a gun with a malicious intent. As the body count increases, Roger, now a desperate fugitive, must find a way to survive and fight back, no matter what it takes, in his case, like hiding in a very stinky place.<br /><br />Directed by Morten Tyldum with skills and confidence, the Norwegian/German film is not so much about deadly cat-and-mouse chase as our protagonist's internal changes through hardships including bloody violence. The film's strength lies in the twisty plotline that is not only unpredictable but suspenseful and even darkly funny at times. This is a thrilling 100 minute ride with a character-driven story.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Loved this movie. Very entertaining. I've watched multiple times. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and family even though it is older now.
1426209584|4.0|I have been waiting for this book to come out and just received it.  Phenomenal photos that took years to take, and yes, unfortunately the colors are highly saturated. Many years ago I was a photo journalist, and I too find the over-saturation quite disappointing.  However it is still an excellent book with superb details on the natural history of all 39 species of the Birds of Paradise.<br /><br />I noted on the last page that the book was printed in China which may go a long way to explain the over-saturation.  I lived and worked in China for almost 25 years and have found that the Chinese publishers most always print over-saturated photos.  I was told it is a combination of the type of ink, with the type of paper (made in China), and the printing machines the Chinese use.  Should any other photographers have ideas about this saturation - would be interested to hear from them.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is now my go to movie to show off my sound  system. Blue ray copy is terrific One of Tom Cruise's best
B009NQKXYK|4.0|It was entertaining and a good Saturday night rental.  Kept me engaged and I enjoyed it.  Good for people who enjoy sci-fi movies.
B009YU62H2|5.0|One listen indicates that they're older, but a few more listens confirm that they're also wiser. They maintain that other-worldly (superunknown?) quality that left their contemporaries outshined. Please don't make us wade through another decade and a half of karaoke before you record the next one!
0761171703|5.0|This book has been getting a lot of positive press attention and rightly so. Jordan Matter is brilliant, his dancers are stunning and he poses them in interesting and innovative ways. His photographs are technically amazing and are printed extremely well. This book will delight anyone who dances, anyone who wishes they could dance, anyone who has ever photographed dancers or wished they could. Jordan Matter is very much a modern-day Paul Kolnik. I look forward to seeing what he produces next.[[ASIN:0761171703 Dancers Among Us: A Celebration of Joy in the Everyday]]
0767830555|5.0|While most of Martin Scorsese work is pretentious garbage, Taxi Driver is a true classic. As a bonus, John Hinckley's infatuation with Jodie Foster (who portrayed Iris, the young hooker) led him to shoot greedy scumbag, Ronald Reagan. That personal opinion aside, this movie is very good and is well worth owning.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The story still works after the sexual tension was released. What a relief! I hated the idea that we would be dished out another year of desperate misunderstanding and longing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game on my kindle fire, but the updates come out late. 0.5.0 came out on the other devices like the ios and apple products but it still hasn't come out on the kindle fire like it says below the reviews. I would rate it 5 stars if the updates came out sooner. Write a review or like my review if you are haveing the same problem.
B00932A2MC|4.0|It is a shame that the story couldn't be better scripted. Since it received such panning in the published reviews, I waited until is came out in DVD and like it.
0743270754|5.0|I'm not generally a big non-fiction guy, but this book was terrific.  It's been a few weeks since I finished and I can't stop thinking about it.  Doris Kearns Goodwin peals back the layers, and even though everyone knows what's coming at the end, it's still a tragedy.  I never knew how truly amazing Lincoln was -- a pillar of a man in any era.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I watch the TV show and reading the comic book is just as entertaining!  Page to page was addictive and fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is very addicting, a waste of time, but a lot of mindless fun. recommend this for kids and adults of all ages
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have recently become aware of the many classic British films out there. Researching films I found this one listed and bought it. Let me tell you, once I started watching I could not stop until I watched the last DVD. Its a beautifully romantic story with good characters and great actors. I would definitely recommend this series to everyone. I actually have watched it 3 times since purchasing it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the oregon trail is a really fun game and my 12 year old 9 year old and me just LOVE to play thus on my kindle fire ya hear
B007A2O3FO|4.0|I love British films. This one was clean family entertainment. I ejoyed the movie. I also liked the actors and the plot. I would recommend this film to others.
B00863DOL0|3.0|In 'Castles and Dreams', we got 2 DVDs with 27 songs, 5 videos and a dozen or so special features. The full band at their most vibrant and fresh, on castle grounds in front of an enthusiastic audience.<br />'Paris Moon' was much more plain and subdued, but I mwas willing to attribute that to the fact that Blackmores Night's special brand of entertainment probably plays better in northern and central Europe than anywhere else.<br />'A Knight in York', however, seems to be another step backwards.<br />1 DVD with 14 songs and a few pics of downtown York.<br />With all the gorgeous medieval architecture in what was the English capital at some point, they picked a concert hall? No stage effects, no Sisters of the Moon (wonder why they left?), lackluster audience, the band pretty much just going through the motions.<br />I realize that being a mother is more important than being a songstress, but Mrs. Blackmore seems to have fully morphed into the Queen Bee of the outfit, the band being more or less just her decor.<br />I was never very happy with their tendency away from the Renaissance part and more towards the Rock part - there are plenty enough Rock bands already, Renaissance ones, not so much - and I keep hoping this trend can be reversed.<br />'A Knight in York' didn't do anything in that vein.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is very interesting and provides a lot of good background information.  I would recommend it for everyone to read even if you aren't looking to go wheat-free, just for general understanding of how your body works and how our food can affect it.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Trying to remember my statics from physics class.  Like being able to see the load change as vehicles drive aross the bridge.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I ordered the pink lifeproof case for my I Phone 4 S a couple of weeks ago on Amazon... And it's great!!!! Did the water test for an hour and I put the case on my phone and I've dropped my phone a couple of times and the lifeproof case has really kept my phone protected! Hasn't encountered water yet... And I don't plan on taking it swimming with me.. But at least if my phone DID get water on it.. It would do just fine. I'm a pleased customer and I paid a VERY reasonable price for this item. It's a great product and I HIGHYLY recommend it to anyone who has a I Phone!!!!!!!!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|As author of [...] this book was a huge inspiration to me. Although this book is set in France and mine was not. I really enjoyed this novel and the details and of the roundup of the Jews in France. It was chilling that the people did not try to prevent the Nazis from taking them. We are taken to Auschwitz in the novel and are once more privy to the conditions and horror of that place. I really enjoyed the novel, and would certainly like to read more of de Rosnay's books.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|from what I used so far, its just as good as the real program on the computer.  Adobe did a good job.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I first saw this amazing performance during a fund-raiser for PBS.  I immediately notified numerous friends & strongly urged them to do their best to seek it out & watch in their local areas.  This intimate little musical gathering is probably the most explosive &#34;live music&#34; DVD I've ever had the pleasure of watching!  One would fully expect Paul Simon to summon a first-rate set of players, but this goes far beyond that, as this incredibly tight, well-rehearsed & versatile band of amazing virtuosos kicks it from the very beginning and never once lets up!  It's a delight to watch them switch instruments, share incredible licks and bask in the obvious energy on that stage!  Paul Simon's vision, artistry & incredible voice at this point in an amazing career stamps a tremendous exclamation mark on the genius of his art!
B007EECSFA|3.0|This book is well researched and has a fantastic ending. However, it drags in many places which makes the reader not want to finish it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Been looking forward to DragonVale on aneroid a long time! Been playing on the iOS for over a year. Now I'm just waiting on Gizmonauts! Hopefully soon!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|On the borderline of fantasy, this book keeps the reader riveted until the end. Setting changes from time zone to time zone, keeping the reader interested. Characters are quite fun and almost believable.
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|Love Karen Carpenter...her voice is so beautiful and this album is a wonderful Christmas album! A great variety of songs in addition to that voice. Highly recommend!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the second book in the series. Kept my interest, was hard to put it down, developed the characters a little better
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game. I have both this one and the original on my kindle fire and my andriod. I have dprng many a sleepless night playing this game. It does take patience but once you get started you are hooked!<br /><br />I got both games for free via Amazons free app of the day but would have paid 4.95 for both!!<br /><br />Can't wait to see what else they can do.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great writing and acting well produced. How come there aren't more show like this?  I am<br />waiting impatiently for Season II
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Is it possible that this man, like fine wine, just keeps getting better and better with age?  Masterful numbers that will not disappoint are found on this disk.  If you're into Cohen...need I say more?  And, if you're not into Cohen...you ought to be!  This would make a fine start for a wonderful relationship!
B000YABS8E|5.0|So true it hurts.<br />I lived the transition from the sixties to the nineties as we lost that idealistic belief in Camelot.<br />My parent's generation built a booster rocket that took mankind off the planet for the first time.<br />My generation was the second stage that got us into orbit.<br />The current generation was born weightless in orbit, without references that we all took for granted.<br />It shows in their morality and superficiality.  They cannot tell right from wrong or truth from CGI as well as those who came before them.  The next generation will be even worse.  Get ready for a Brave New World.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|The man, himself, is ever humble.  He's gone beyond being an &#34;artist&#34; - he's a &#34;master&#34;, plain and simple.  I stumbled on the PBS presentation of this performance and fell in love...only to buy up pretty much everything Mr. Cohen has released - yes, he's addictive (should have mentioned that).  He writes his own songs, and they always have a surprising reach.  I've yet to meet anyone who has heard his music and not loved it.  So, recommending him is a no-brainer!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Now that I have had some time to learn how to navigate around I like it more and more. So many different versions.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi was a very enthralling story that kept me hungry for the next part of the story to be revealed to me. When it was I was not let down but re-energized  to keep on reading. I would recommend this to friends and strangers alike.
B005LAII08|5.0|I found this animated film from PIXAR to be delightfully entertaining. I would not have any reservations letting my children see this movie inspite of it's modern profeminist point of view depicted in the movie. Our young heroine shows courage and strength as well as beauty and charm and her message voiced by, I think, women everywhere. The film is fun to watch and very entertaining and I would buy it again.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Could be a little crisper in the visuals but not a bad game. Runs clean on Kindle Fire HD, no crashing.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Love this movie. My daughter got me watching them and I was hooked. Even if you didn't read the books, you can still enjoy the movies.
B0002VFXFE|2.0|For my V6 GT I've been using the stock CM thermal compound.  Temps got up to 80C or so at 4.6GHz @ 1.3V on my 2500K.  80C is a high limit for Ivy and Sandy Bridge, so I was interested in getting the \\"5-10C\\" drops other people are getting.  The result:  10C HIGHER temps at idle and 3C HIGHER temps at load.  I know AS5 has a LONG cure time, so I hope I can give it a better review after it cures.  It's supposed to cure in 100Hrs or so, but review websites are finding it's more like 120Hrs+.  Still, the stock thermal compound from CM has NO cure time, which makes it more valuable to me.  If performance doesn't improve over the next week, I'll try reapplying and see where that gets me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun and a great way to pass the time. love it a lot. kind of addicting. plus it was free. bonus...
B007URVZJ6|1.0|It's interesting that this book, which has a table of contents, that table of contents does not show up on the Kindle Go to menu. One would think that people who presume to tell us how to build a Kindle book would know how to build one themselves. I'm just saying...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I started to read this book, I wasn't sure I could finish it.  This first novel of this Trilogy is very intense and may not be for everyone.  However, I think many people can relate to both of the main characters, I believe there is a little bit of them in each of us.  That said, if you are going to read the first novel then treat yourself to the second and the third, they are worth the read.  Again, be warned, this trilogy is very sexual and very explicit.  I was able to put my feelings aside while reading this book but some of you may not.  I loved this book but I loved the second and third better, I enjoyed watching the main characters learn to live in each other's world and watching their love blossom.  This book has it all, passion and compassion, love and hate, tolerance and acceptance, dark and light!  Buy it and don't forget the other two!
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|This film was well done with very good action and special effects. As a fan of this genre, I found that seeing all of the Avengers in their own adventure packed odyssey made their collaborative effort even better. I would definitely recommend Thor.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think I would probably recommend this book to my sister Madison because she likes funny story with pictures to go with them.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I really did love this offering. It really showed the history of a long time super hero. The special effects were super and the story line flowed with ease. I would highly recommend this version.
0896898288|5.0|I am sooooo pleased I purchased this from Amazon.  I first saw it at a Quilting show and the cost was $52.00.  I purchased it  for $28 plus change AUD - what a bargain.  this book has 111 different squares to be made up into quilts, along with guidance for the amount of fabric required and how to place them for different patterns.  Can't wait to start!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This genre is one of my favorites. As a movie buff, I have a wide taste (and tolerance) for remakes and deviations from what I grew up knowing. This film was done very well and includes a good story-line, special effects, and a good cast. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a different slant on Snow White.
1878424777|5.0|If you are into personal growth, relearning your ways, and setting new standards this is the Bible for personal improvement.<br />I have used it, recommend it to friends and has totally changed my life for the better. Burdens has been removed!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|As a fan of this genre and an avid movie buff and collector, this was great. Special effects were over the top and the story-line was very good (giving decent time to each of the Avengers). I would highly recommend adding this to any collectors collection (especially this combo).
B0027BOL4G|4.0|t is a sad process by which our money driven society controls food. Definitely an eye opener! I will recommend it to anyone.
B00000J0O2|1.0|I ordered this product and received a dried out, useless cartridge.  It only printed streaks of gray on the pages.  Would not purchase this again.
1401937519|3.0|It's a very lengthy prelude to the message, and a very long explanation (redundant) of the same message!<br />I understand, some need all the explanations to grasp the idea.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I love LOST, and this is such a great way to experience it.  The Blu-ray format highlights the gorgeous scenery of the series.  The extras are a bit kooky but can be fun.
B0042816YK|4.0|It's a great movie if you are into personal growth and overcoming fears and obstacles in your path. It's about making choices and being open! It also has some great scenes.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Kay Scarpetta is getting a little long in the tooth to be lusting all these younger men.  I think that Patricia Cornwell should stick to the autopsies and gore and leave out the romance.  She makes Kay very unsure of herself in the romance end of an otherwise good book.
B007MG360G|2.0|dont know what to say because i havent played it yet.it took me strsight to this review to swy what i think about it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun game, and the Kindle Fire version comes with a much wider variety of levels than some other versions I have played.
B000S1M9LY|2.0|I pick up on this book when Wallace's editor recently published a book that he had left unfinished. The reviews sounded interesting and made Wallace sound like some one I wanted to read. The book is about addiction. You almost need to be an addict to appreciate it. It digs deep into the 12 step program and occasionally throughout the book has insightful asides (sort of like Meville describing very species of whale). But it is a poor read the story does not flow. I was more than 1/4 of the way thru before it made any sense. And then at the end it just stops, does not tie the stories together in any way.<br /><br />As you  can tell from my title I find the hype on this book pretentious. It is a long slogging read find something else.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love it. Can't wait for season 2. May actually have to subscribe to Showtime next year. Don't know if I want to wait.
0060392886|4.0|These guys are disgusting and horrible and utterly compelling. I stayed up WAY later than I should on more than one night because I couldn't stop reading. Though I'm sure the story is the same for a lot of 80s bands, I haven't read theirs. So this was pretty good and new to me. I read Keith Richards' autobiography this year and these guys make him look like a priest. Not for the faint of heart. Only thing I wish were different is the \\"flexibility\\" of the truth. Two sides to the same story come out as two completely different stories. I know that's how things go, but I'd love to know what really happened.
B009B0L324|4.0|I have no real complaints here, other than there's a few tracks I could go without.  I'm not a huge fan of the Bon Scott era songs, BUT the ones I DO like ARE on here: \\"TNT\\", \\"Dirty Deeds\\", and \\"Highway to Hell\\".  A really good mix here.<br /><br />I really DO like this CD set...although I see no reason for the two discs...just cut a few songs off and make it one CD.<br /><br />BUY IT!!!!!
B008ETOSYI|5.0|I loved this movie very romantic and Zac Efron is a great actor.  The young boy in this movie was very good as well.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I stand a lot and need to stop and start. This game allows me the freedom to that w/o starting completely over. Fun and not too challenging.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|I purchased this and downloaded it to my Kindle for my 5 year old granddaughter. It has large uncomplicated pages with easy to do colors bar. She enjoys this and you can even save the colored pages.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This show has no boundaries for the violence, sex, and madness that they depict of Roman society. A great second season comeback from the 2010 Blood and Vengeance. Every actor and actress did a terrific job and the season finally is by far tops season finale. If you are a fan of Gladiator, 300, and the Rome series, this show will not let you down. If you haven't seen season 1, it's best to watch it to play catch up.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|The best songs on this album for me is bones of birds,black saturday,and taree.I believe soundgarden did a great job for making an album after sixteen years of not being together and still proving that there still just as great.In my opinion one of the best albums of the year.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|although i know that the story is not real i think its an interesting story to find out how facebook got developed
B001TCHDPS|4.0|He is a very talented and thoughtful person.  His music is full of social and humanistic commentary.  I enjoyed the movie about him.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|amazing finisher to the marvel collection cant wait for iron man 3 the new captain america and thor and hulk and of course avengers 2
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The only way to know is to read this book for yourself. Please do. It made me cry in the best way possible.
B002ZG981E|5.0|this is a really hard movie to follow. try to understand what dream is real if you can. must watch
B0026P3G12|5.0|Give me anything this woman sings and I am happy.  What a beautiful voice and she continues to have the small town attitude and jitters which makes her charming.
B00A9Q70Y4|5.0|I caught my daughter watching the first season on Netflix last year and I was very upset with her... However, I sat down as I was scolding her for watching a zombie killing show. And I got so engrossed in the show that we ended up watching the whole season together.<br />And season 2.<br />And now season 3.<br />This is my ultimate ALL TIME favorite series hands down.
B003XQM2YU|1.0|The movie is terrible. I have to say 18 words in order to submit a review but all I can think of is terrible.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Wonderful effects, great characters, interesting plot, and very funny in spots. The special features disc was filled with outstanding extras. The cast and director did a fantastic job!
B007SGM084|4.0|relaxing, easy read; story exciting; characters seemed as though they could be a neighbor or friend; awaiting to read suppliment to the story if written
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My little girl's face lit up when she saw these. She helped me put them on the wall, or rather, I helped her. She is five so she only needed help with the bigger ones. She has moved them around and they are still sticking great. The little gems that come with it are very pretty. For some reason they don't stick quite as well, perhaps because they are so small. We've lost about half of them to the floor and then they get fibers on the back and are unusable. Very happy with this purchase though!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Great movie!  Johnny Depp is spectacular (again) and the movie is also a great piece of nostalgia.  Tue period touches such as the music and Alice Cooper's cameo complete the mood!
0525952926|4.0|2nd in Follett's triology.  Very interesting following the families as they go through the World Wars.  Historical fiction lets us know how the times affected ordinary people, while we learn history itself.  Great reading.<br />Although it can get a bit confusing following all the characters and where they fit, in the story line.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Gresham is still the master of the can't put it down novel.his characters jump off the page and provide the reader with excitement intrigue in improbable conclusions. I can't wait for his next book.
B000EHRXKO|5.0|I love Blondie.This was a great addition to my collection.I would recommend this to any one that wants both music and video for their enjoyment.
0345803485|1.0|On a tv morning program they recommended all men read this book to spice up their marriage.  What a joke,  it reads like it was written by a clueless teenager.  Not beleivable in any way, from the over orgasmic virgin heroin, to the Adonis like billionare who has only one fault, he likes to hit women that he is in a relationship with.  And to top it off a very unsatisfying ending, trying to get you to buy the next book, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|Its really a shame that a company as large as lego or walmart or toys r us creates a demand for a product and then allows employees to buy every one that comes in to resell on the internet for a 300-600% profit, my grandson really wanted this set and i gave in and bought it but shame on ALL the people involved in keeping these off store shelves theoney may seem great now but karma will be biting their butts at some point!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Unfortunately... this book is so bad no one in my family could even finish it. Nelson completely misses the mark on this one. We are all hoping that Nelson gets the message and figures out what went wrong because Nelson is one of our favorite authors. Don't buy this book... it is a waste of money.
B000S9WLBY|4.0|This allowed me to be closer to my Dad, who was there... He developed jungle rot from bringing up the wounded Marines to his hospital ship.
B000002GFC|5.0|I forgot just how good Cream were.  What a shame they broke up so soon, But they still left us a great body of work I highly recomend this C.D.
B000M4RG4C|5.0|After watching it I understand now why my father was against me becoming a Marine. He was there and was a sailor on the hospital ship and had to carry the wounded from the landing craft to the doctors when he was not at his battle station.  I think he actually breathed a sigh of relief when I became a sailor.
0316069884|5.0|A fair warning to readers who prefer the bliss of ignorance:  don't read this book if you want to keep on eating the way you always have.  This reviewer, who has consumed meat and fish for more than 60 years, can no longer blissfully do so without recognizing what that entails.<br /><br />Some things are uncomfortable to think about, so we tend not to think about them.  One of those subjects is how animals are raised and slaughtered for our consumption.<br /><br />When we learn about the farm-factory methods of raising and slaughtering chickens, pigs, cattle and fish, we either have to rationalize those methods or repress our memory in order to continue consuming the \\"tortured flesh,\\" as Jonathan Safran Foer calls it in Eating Animals.<br /><br />Readers such as this reviewer, who didn't know much about the subject, will find plenty to learn from Foer, including the main reasons vegetarians eschew meat:<br /><br />1) The cruel conditions under which livestock is raised and slaughtered in the factory farms that provide almost all of our meat.<br /><br />2) Animal agriculture is the number 1 cause of climate change since it makes a 40% greater contribution to CO2 emissions than all transportation in the world. \\"No daily choice we make has a greater impact on the environment than eating meat.\\"<br /><br />3) Meat production is a highly inefficient way to produce food that pushes up the cost of food (unless they are pasture-raised). The vast majority of what we grow in the US is fed to animals.<br /><br />4) Because of the way animals are bred and crowded together by the thousands, they are consistently fed antibiotics, and this causes antibiotic resistance that  may lead to creation of super-pathogens.<br /><br />5) The worst environmental problem emanating from factory farms, hog farms in particular, is the quantity of manure and waste produced that contaminates rivers and air.<br /><br />6) \\"Eating animals is in absolutely no way necessary.\\"<br /><br />Among the factsilluminating the subject are these:<br /><br />* Americans consume more meat than any other culture in history, while paying less for it.<br /><br />* Some 99% of all land animals eaten or used to produce milk or eggs in the US are factory farmed.<br /><br />* Each hog produces 2-4 times as much excrement as a human.<br /><br />* Though farmed animals as a whole produce 130 times more waste than the human population, there are no sewer systems and treatment plants for manure.<br /><br />* Instead, the waste from tens of thousands of animals in a factory farm is put into huge open-air pits, aka lagoons or lake-sized latrines, which sometimes leak into the water system.<br /><br />* Even when they don't leak, the lagoons emit an overpowering stench for miles around, but also toxic airborne chemicals that harm the health of people who live and work around the hog farms.<br /><br />* Layer hens spend their lives in cages so tiny they can't turn around; after the first year their production declines, so they are destroyed.<br /><br />* Half of layer chicks are male and are destroyed in ways that most would consider cruel.<br /><br />* The hybrid broilers grow faster and heavier than their ancestors, but they can't survive without drugs and confinement.<br /><br />* The USDA allows the sale of broilers with just over 11% liquid absorption from cooling the carcasses in giant water vats.<br /><br />* The average shrimp-trawler throws overboard 80-90% of the dead or dying sea animals it captures.<br /><br />* There are 145 species regularly killed while catching tuna.<br /><br />* The vast majority of Americans favor laws to minimize animal suffering, though most don't give much thought to how their food choices affect suffering.<br /><br />* \\"Nothing we do has the direct potential to cause nearly as much animal suffering as eating meat.\\"<br /><br />* The cost of meat doesn't include farm subsidies, environmental impact, and human disease.<br /><br />* Vegetarians have lower rates of heart disease, lower blood pressure levels, and lower overall cancer rates.<br /><br />* Suffering is embedded in modern hog production. Since pigs aren't permitted to live in stable social groups, factory farms cut off pigs' tails and teeth to prevent biting and cannibalism. Males are castrated without pain relief, as with the other amputations.<br /><br />* Except in a few states that have banned gestation crates, pregnant sows are kept in crates so small they can't turn around and they are forced to lie or step in their excrement to force it through the slatted floor.<br /><br />* Fish farms, like livestock farms, have conditions dictated by the bottom line rather than by the welfare of the creatures.  Consequently, farmed fish live in crowding so intense that animals begin to cannibalize one another.  Their water so fouled it makes it hard to breathe and that produces an abundance of sea lice, which create open lesions on the fish.<br /><br />* The conditions on fish farms lead to a 10-30% death rate prior to slaughter.<br /><br />* Branding of cattle is done more for tradition than necessity, since cattle rustling hasn't been a problem for some time now. Castration and disbudding (removing of horn buds with hot irons) are other forms of pain imposed on cattle, even in the few family farms.<br /><br />* The handling of cattle getting them ready to transport may cause them greater stress than the slaughter.<br /><br />* Some cows are only dazed by the slaughterhouse knocker -- instead of being rendered unconscious or dead -- and either remain conscious or later wake up as they are being \\"processed,\\" the euphemism for bleeding, skinning and dismembering.<br /><br />* Judaism, Islam and other traditions teach specific rituals about how animals should be treated and humanely slaughtered as we exercise dominion.<br /><br />It's not eating meat per se that Foer finds wrong; what's immoral is eating meat produced under inhumane conditions that harm the environment and raise world food prices.  He sums up his case well:<br /><br />\\"If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be?  If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when?\\"  (pg. 243)  ###
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Would definitely watch this move again and again. Did not expect what happen. I was amazed at the action and story line.
B0060D2SU6|3.0|If you're looking to remind yourself of the early years of the new millennium via film, this would be my recommendation. I loved this movie then, and even now it still makes me chuckle. Weird? Yes. Campy? Yes. Oscar worthy? Not even if you drugged the entire nomination committee. All in all, three stars. Lower your expectations, then rent this movie when you're bored.
B000021Y77|5.0|Loved the acting. I even thought the plot was amazing. The musical score was perfect for this movie. I saw this movie in one of my classes and I was glade I did because it is a great movie. Would recommend this movie to everyone.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|So easy to male razor sharp blades with this! Used it on my tactical, kitchen, and utility knives. Put awesome edges on even my most ragged, old knives!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and feel in love. I had to get this movie it was so good. It has some funny scenes. Plus the  acting was pretty good. Loved the use of color!
1439181780|5.0|Received my book just as it was described - New and in perfect condition.  There was a shipping issue due to Hurricane Sandy.  I was really impressed with the constant contact and suggestions that this seller offered.  I will definately continue to purchase items from this seller as well as tell my friends about this experience.  I found my purchase to be \\"MORE THAN WORTH IT\\".
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Memorable book of a memorable man!, now I feel like Steve Jobs was one of my closest friends and more sad about his dead... Every time I think of success and great ideas I remember Steve Jobs, I even wonder what would he do in some cases when I need to take a decision about something big and I remember one of his maxims &#34;Simplicity is the greatest sophistication&#34;.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is violin at it's modern best.  Lindsey pulls off what many have tried and failed to do...to bring violin into modern music in an original way.  She's nailed it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000490M|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this transaction.  The Karate Kid was brand new and in perfect condition.  The movie played perfectly on my VCR with no skips or problems.
0385233132|4.0|This novel shows a more mature Asimov as a writer. Very entertaining, with a surprising element of romance which is most unusual for him.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|It says the file says is 2.1 MB, but then after you make the purchase it says you need 633 MB of free space to play it!  Didn't have that much free space on my Kindle, and it looks like I can't return it. Waste of money for an app I can't use.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like string to figure out the right way to get it right first try. Lots of fun hours. I suggest you try this one yourself.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nothing to complain about, works well, no bugs, great basic solitaire game and oh by the way it's free too!
B00632HWOG|4.0|It is really nice to tap on the app and it pulls your email right up. It is quick and easy to checkyour mail. I would have given one more star but some time it is slow. But I really do enjoy using it. Thanks Yahoo Mail.
1250000971|2.0|Not up to Archer's usual high standards. If you have not read the prequel this is not much. If you have read the prequel this is not much.
B003NX75B8|3.0|I've read almost all of John Green's books, and I have to say this was a little disappointing. It wasn't a bad book, but I found Looking For Alaska, An Abundance Of Katherines, and Paper Towns to have all been more thought provoking and clever in terms of character development and plot line. The divided viewpoint between two protagonists could have worked had they been more integrally linked, but as it stands their stories were too separate to offer a lot to either one, reducing the possible complexity and ingenuity of both. In short, it felt like two good books cut down and forced into one.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|If you seriously bought or rented this without paying attention to the title, you are 1: blind, 2: naive, or 3: in a box. \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is a graphic novel by Frank MIller, only one of the most important pieces of Bat-literature to be penned in the last 30 years (circa 1985 to be exact). This is the animated adaptation of THAT story.<br /><br />If you wanted \\"The Dark Knight RISES\\", as in the last of Nolan's live-action Batman movies, that doesn't come out until December 4th or so.<br /><br />This is NOT bait-and-switch. Anyone who knows the first thing about Batman knows this is based on the famous graphic novel. If you don't know that, the least you could do is read. Was Peter Weller Batman in the live action movie? No? Then maybe you're thinking of another movie, no?<br /><br />Just saying.<br /><br />And when was there a girl Robin in Nolan's films? Or any full-fledged (pardon the pun) Robin?<br /><br />READ WHAT YOU BUY AND DON'T BLAME ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book will enthrall and excite the reader. From cover to cover you will NOT be able to set it down. If you enjoyed &#34;Bared to You&#34;, this will not disappoint. Sylvia Day is a literary artist in every sense. The way she portrays Gideon and Eva's romance has the ability to make one truly believe in once in a lifetime loves. Incredible! A must read!
B0071BY2OG|2.0|[[ASIN:1578651611 Fast Dates 2014 World Superbike & MotoGP Swimsuit Model Calendar]]This latest DVD movie Fastest, and its earlier edition Faster, really come up short for me. Producer Mark Neale does no real race track filming himself for the movie, but actually compiled all the footage for these MotoGP documentaries from his access to Dorna TV broadcast coverage. Some of it will be new to American viewers who do not get to see the all Pre Race, Practice and Grid Walk TV coverage that European viewers do see. Including one segment where Valentino Rossi drives his rental car around the Mugello GP track and takes about racing there, which is probably the highlight of Fastest.  But most of it is just rehashed TV race coverage that is rewound and played in slow motion to show and repeat the crashes and slides. Which we can do at home with the race broadcast on TiVo. Really disappointing was when Neale did take a video camera to Rossi's home village and interviewed some of the locals about their hometown hero, which anyone could have down, and it was frankly boring. I wanted to be taken into Rossi's private world and home on and off the race track, to show us what the man is really like with his friends, to see his house, his cars and bikes, and talk about his personal life - all of which has never been done before. I saw Faster and Fastest at free screenings with Neale and actually kept falling asleep they were so boring and poorly produced, and I had no interest in buying them to see again.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|Watchable Bond film with lots of senseless action and mayhem - perhaps too much. Do like Craig as Bond though.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I loved Rowling's Harry Potter books.  This very grown up novel shares the ability to introduce a sizeable cast of characters and make them distinct, to tell a complex story, and to plot tightly, with every thread tied in the end.  But it is a book for grown ups, with an adult understanding that there are no wholly good or bad people, that little matters loom large for those who are directly affected, and that terrible consequences flow from indifference.  A very good book.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  It definitely kept you on your toes.  I read this book because I had read Flynn's novel \\"Gone Girl\\" which I couldn't put down.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I must say that Arthur J. Bullock, Jr. has written the perfect review of this movie and the funniest review I have ever read.  So, buyer beware and be sure to read Mr. Bullock's review before you spend your money.
B007N8RULO|4.0|no problems,  would like small ads but not that big of a deal. great graphics,  plays as expected. free,  what else is there to say??
B0049P1ZZQ|1.0|This was advertised on Amazons Black Friday deal buster section as a Blu-Ray under $10 but when you get to the product page it then sells for $15.99 - great series, still a decent price, sleazy sleazy sales tactic
B0091XEW9M|5.0|A great movie. Action pact and thrilling. A great view of the future to come. A must watch every Nov. 5th
B0091QSNEE|4.0|My granddaughter loves playing this.  She feels like she is really cooking and serving the food to the guests at the restuarant.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Good special effects but incredibly slow and hard to follow.  Never gets better but one keeps hoping...  for scientists they were totally foolish!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book.  I can't imagine the research Mr. King had to do to complete this but it was ver thorough and even sparked enough interest in me to do some research as well. I especially like that he added a love story in the tale.  I was very pleased with this novel.
1455502758|5.0|This is the last book written by Christopher Hitchens before his passing. It chronicles him dealing with his illness. The book was brief, due to his passing before he was able to write more. It was incredibly inspiring to see how well he handled knowing that he was most likely going to die. He never lost his hope, but he remained brutally honest with himself and those around him with regards to his chances of survival. A touching and moving final work from a great man.
B000002UZ4|5.0|It is rather strange to see some reviews herein centered upon recording techniques and arrangement quibbles. May I ask: Do you ask that the classic cuts of Aretha Franklin be enshrouded with digital effects rather than raw,R and B emotion? Do you expect the output of Lady Gaga to be less than perfectly filtered/digitalized sound quality for her little monsters? Then how is it that you ask a band that was spawned in the 1980s not to offer a stunning collection of tracks that perfectly reflect the era they come from? Say what you will, but \\"West End Girls\\" still stands as one of the best singles of that era ever recorded. I listen to music of all eras; I would not want any era of music to sound fake-manipulated to make it \\"commercial\\" for our auditorily unimaginative era, for I would say \\"It's a Sin.\\" There's a lot of noise in pop music, but not enough genius: left to their own devices, the Boys delivered genius. Period.
B003WUYP56|3.0|Most of the descriptions of string theory in this book will be over the heads of most readers, but the author does make some important points.  My interpretation of what I read is that string theory gets too much support among physicists, and it probably has much less merit than is widely supposed.  My sentiments exactly.
0810993139|3.0|My 7YO son has read a few books from the series and thinks they're funny, but he's started behaving more like Greg, most noticeably in what he calls people or how he describes and talks to girls. (Do I really want him calling his infant niece \\"hot\\"? I think not.) The main character, while sometimes funny, lies, manipulates, underachieves, sneaks, disrespects his parents, and isn't even that great a friend. My son reads these snippets and, because they're in graphic form and described humorously, doesn't check to see whether Greg's actions are right or wrong or hurtful to another person (neither does the main character, really)--instead, he innocently imitates Greg's way of doing things. In a way, Greg becomes a hero to him, but perhaps one not so worthy of his admiration. So while the books have a creative concept and may be okay for middle school and up, the subject matter and flaws of the main character make them not so great for more impressionable younger readers.
0446580848|5.0|Another book about John Cory fighting Arab Terrorists UGGGGGGGGGGGGG.  But I got much more then I expected John Cory at his best from another angle and Paul Bremmer from Up Country another of my favorite characters in the same book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Backflip actually listens and doesn't inundate you with gem/crystal/whatever spam (looking at you, Dragon Story). So glad they made it to the Android verse. I've been playing in ios for a year, only thing you need are a couple of friends to get you gems. :)
B0025UHKNS|1.0|My husband bought this GPS watch for me February 2011. Until now I would have rated it 4/5. It has started not holding a charge, basically not functioning. This equipment was too expensive to break down in such a short period of time.
B009SCRERI|5.0|Beautiful graphics and effects.  Just worth watching it for that. But this one is deep layered with hidden meaning-- great for adults to watch too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love minecraft my house is made of random blocks it also has animals in it i mostly like survial
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I couldn't stop watching it was so good. I watched all 5 seasons in 2 weeks!  There are many layers to this. The weak husband weakened by a diagnosis of cancer and also weakened by a squashing wife gains strength in cooking meth to make money in order to support his family when he dies. The character rises to overcome many adversities and struggles with what he is doing making unlikely friendships and distancing ones that are close. Beautiful.
B001JNND9W|5.0|my dad loves this movie and the blu-ray is actually much better quality then the dvd.  If you have a blu-ray player this is the way to go.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This is my favorite show ever. Amusing entertaining with a right dose of darkness. But behind the darkness is a realism that's scary layered and engaging.  Leaves you thinking and wanting more. Funny how the objective to make money is portrayed as one step forward and two steps back. Like Dexter it leaves you rooting for the bad guy.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great quality stuff but it is missing Prometheus.  This is why it was such a good deal but I knew that when I bought it.  Cool behind the scenes features too!
B007T99ENE|5.0|Another good story from Ian McEwan.  Straight forward writing, good twist at the end.  Imperfect, relatable characters.  Trademark mixture of misunderstandings and human failings.  Very good.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|this thing really helps out if you are short on room or you have a big kid and a short kid or an adult and a small child playing.  works great!
B007TK77QE|2.0|Reads like an aga saga.  Disjointed story and far too many tedious and similar characters, none of whom I care about.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|UPDATE (June 15, 2013): Finally updated to Mountain Lion. I was afraid I would have to forgo my card reader, but I actually found the updated driver. Do a google search for DSKCD-JMB38X and you'll find it, you'll be redirected to a website called SonnetTech. Anyway, the driver worked like a charm.<br /><br />------------------------------------------<br />Original review: got the thing. Installed the driver, restarted, and tested it. It did not work. One day (about a month or two later), my computer crashed and I was forced to do a hard reset. It magically worked after that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far this season has been non-stop action, plot twists, and great new characters. Unlike the second season that was slow paced and mostly uneventful season three picks up the story and takes it to a new level. Great new characters are introduced like the Governor, and Michonne and the actors really bring these comic favorites to life. Can't wait for the rest of the season to unfold!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is so well written. It keeps you involved from the first page! More twists and turns than the Monaco Grand Prix!
B003DNN0L2|4.0|Definitely enjoyed it.  Very cleverly done with some very funny moments. Another great Wes Andersen flick; if you're a fan you won't want to miss it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like the first two books, this one is a fun, easy read.<br /><br />DIdn't really like the ending, but that might just be me.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|super good in enjoy the audio sound and graphic, we have a gaming feel when watching this movie.<br />even have a lot bad comment about it, but I like it so much.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wasn't expecting much, so i got a lot more than expected.<br />It is an easy and fun to read book; you won't find it life changing, but you will enjoy the time spent reading it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I wanted to get Twitter for my kindle and this app works great...never any glitches or issues. This app is great!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an amazing book that will inspire you to do things in your life and live them out to the fullest. You will also see life in a different perspective. Definitely recommend this book!!
0345803485|5.0|i am still working on reading this book, as I'm a busy person. I'm loving it so far, and cant wait to finish!
B006CHML4I|5.0|This watch is great, the price was right and delivered in 2 days with Prime. Other things  are that it's thinner than my other watches which are digital. The base fact is that it's great.
B004WE01YA|5.0|A masterpiece of Disney in a great presentation! He had the 2D version released in my country, Brazil, and I chose to buy the 3D version American, because it is much more complete than the released where I live. Here the 3D version has only 1 disk, with no glove box (it looks like a joke, just in bad taste). So I hope they continue to release these editions neat with audio and subtitle options in my language!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I really like this stylus.  I used it on my ipad and works perfectly.  It just glides across the glass with minimal effort and with quick response.  It is nicely balanced and has quality feel to it.  I especially like the 3 different size rubber tips.  Now I can choose the tip size according to type of work I do, from typing to sketching.  Overall, it may not have the luxurious feel as the $30-$35 stylus in the market but at this price, you can't go wrong.  I would recommend this stylus.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love the puzzles but it is constantly forcing a close.  then I have to re download it.  when I download free puzzles. they disappear.
B0036SXQEA|5.0|Great movie. Probably my favorite PT Anderson movie.<br />Watch it. Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br />What's not to like ?
B003QJME5G|5.0|Bought this fan controller to manually control my Corsair AF/SP Series fans for my water cooling build.  It has a very nice anodized finish and doesn't look cheaply built like some on the market.  The Lamptron FC-6 does what it supposed to do and is easy to setup and install.  The temp sensors give you a fairly accurate reading, just within a few tenths of a degree from my Fluke thermometer.  I like the alarm feature should the temps rise, indicating if my pump has failed, even though highly unlikely to happen.  But you never know and that feature is a good thing to have nonetheless.  I also like the option to change the LCD display to match your build's theme.  My only minor gripe is that my fans don't spin it's full rated speed at 12V with this controller.  I guess it's because of its 20W rating vs the FC-5's 30W rating so it's basically undervolted.  Anyway, I really don't need ridiculously high rpm fans in my build and at full blast with 20W, my fans are still quiet while effectively extracting heat from my system.  5 stars from me.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Update 12.01.2013:<br /><br />These are still fantastic studio headphones for the price. I find I use them very seldom though. They are very large, so not for portable use.<br /><br />Where they excel fur me is listening to movies on headphone. The tonal balance is great for movies.<br />Good full bass, without being sloppy. High frequency is subdued at the top end, but this works nice for movies and laid back music.<br /><br />I would compare these to Sony mdrv6 and Grado sr60/80. Of the three these (AKGs) might be the most power hungry. Grado and Sony can be powered by iPhone or pmp. Grados sound best with lots of power but then they are loud. The Sony has better mid range and highs, but more restrained bass.<br /><br />If you like a very neutral sound signature these are for you.<br /><br />Great headphones. I was looking for a set of very accurate phones with a nice warm sound as well.<br />I am NOT a bass freak so these phones are great as the bass is there, but is tight and accurate.<br />Not booming and overwhelming.<br /><br />In the past I have owned Grado SR80s and they have a very flat frequency response.<br />And considered getting another pair.But the Grados are really uncomfortable.<br />I remembered that and decided to try these out. I'm very pleased.<br /><br />These phones are semi open design which helps with the fine details. They are also very<br />comfortable due to the self adjusting headband and the large earpads. These remind me of<br />the sound of the Grados but are way more comforable. These will work with most laptops<br />and portable devices but benefit from a headphone amp to get the most oomph out<br />of them. I use these with a Nexus 7 and FIIO E6 and they sound awesome.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Since I'm in school I don't always get to watch supernatural every week so it is nice to have a back up which will download to my computer by the next day and then I can watch whenever I have time. Wonderful series which I highly recommend though I recognize that it isn't for everyone.
030758836X|2.0|The book is certainly engaging.  I read it on vacation this week, and it kept my attention in the airport, on the plane, and while waiting to be picked up for my tour.  The problem as the book winds down is that the characters are so loathsome that you feel like you need to take a shower for having spent so much time with them.<br /><br />Amy is a psychopath, and making her a hero is just wrong.  I finished this book and wanted to throw it in the trash for that reason alone.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I really liked this book. I read it all in one night and read it again the next day because I was afraid I missed something.
0780619587|5.0|As a pianist, physician, and writer, I watched this film with great anticipation. It more than met my expectations. The portrayal of David was moving, heart-breaking, and, finally, rewarding. The acting was superb. The screenplay, including the plot device of the domineering, over-protective father fatally flawed by the Holocaust, all fit together. The redemption relationship at the end--perfect. I don't know exactly how closely all this parallels the true story, but the film was wonderful. The music was sublime, too.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I love the culture series, but for some reason this didn't resonate with me as much. As always, the motivations of the Minds are very lofty which I used to enjoy, but in this book they seem almost arbitrary.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie has done it again-what a great albumn.  Both sophisticated and playful the mix of songs is great.  The addition of the orchestra on some of the songs adds unbelievable depth.
B0090O07RS|5.0|This makes you appreciate GREAT bands and GREAT music --both sorely lacking in today's pop driven world.  Great bluray.  It's a buy... No brainer.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|downloaded app on Nov 20 2012. tap to open. Bam.  crash and close. on new kindle fire hd. pop up box oens then dies .  it was/is a good app on iPhone.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|i love this show.  it is very entertaining.  24 meets the wire.  again, great show.  i like the acting and the directing.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Bought 3, all shipped same box.  They may lock up and ask to be reformatted.  Find if have them Out Of The System when you turn it on, there is no issue loading them.  Just turn on the console, go to Browser, insert mem's and/or game.  Check to show mem's are loading correctly, start game.  I'm sure this is because of fact that they are after-market third-party items, not completely 100% compatible with Sony PS2.  Still, for the price and size of mem-cards, really good buy!!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This is a great prequel!  Ties in a lot of things that happened before the House of Batiatus was so &#34;blessed by the gods!&#34; I adore Gannicus and Crixis!
1400096936|5.0|I like Don Winslow.  I like his quirky, literary mind, his enthusiasm for Peregrine Pickle, Cuchulain, and his understanding of the influence these fabled characters have on his allegedly untogether but self-effacing heroes like the redoubtable Neal Carey, and in this novel, Callan.<br /><br />Aside from \\"The Power of the Dog\\", my favourite is his first, \\"A Cool Breeze on the Underground\\", in which Carey messes with London punks and holes up in the Lake District.  Winslow is a Yank, but seems to know Britain quite well.  His second book evidences a decent knowledge of China, and his third and fourth seem at home in the mid-west.<br /><br />I understand \\"The Power of the Dog\\" took him six years to research.  Some say it is not really fiction, and at many points it reveals a comprehensive understanding of the history of the whole of Central America over a thirty year span.  In particular showing how your nice cuddly Ronald Reagan, among others, terrorised a whole region of the world in the interests of protecting the USA from Communism, as he thought.  Personally I've never read anything that has made me think Communism as such was ever going to take a hold in that region, just farmers trying to make a living.<br /><br />I have read several nonfictional accounts of recent history in Central America and at no point does \\"The Power of the Dog\\" make me think, `Oh, he's gone way off here.'<br /><br />Perhaps it is easier to construct a dynamite plot which doesn't creak at the hinges when it is all based on reality.<br /><br />Either way it is up there with Stone's film \\"Salvador\\" as a brilliant fictional treatment of the dark underbelly of US Imperialism.
B003PIUC02|5.0|FAbulous writing.....amazing costumes and characters....the cast sucks you in. No matter how much you love/hate them, you can't stop watching. I'm addicted to my gladiator porn!
031603441X|4.0|A very good read-and in paperback form, a very good price. Personally I could've done with a little less about his childhood, but I'm sure Keith freaks will eat it all up. There's got to be something missing, but I'm not a Stones freak, so I have to go with what's here, which is an entertaining and colourful read from an unmistakable rock legend.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I love this series! While Liam doesn't completely fill Andy's shoes, the writing and acting is still phenomenal! On Blu-ray you're able to see every blood spatter and gory battle in great clarity!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next season to be available!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is my new favorite. Great book by a great author. I really liked the political undertones. The false identity's were like Rush Limbaugh and Bill Maher, kinda. Anyway, awesome read...BUY IT!!

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It is very well written, but a little too much about the workings of the government. The characters are interesting and I had a hard time putting it down sometimes.

B009E3EY38|5.0|After having suffered through bootlegs with dubious audio and video quality, I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am that this show has been released. And what an amazing show it was. They may be older, but the magic of Page, Plant, and Jones is still evident. And Jason? Captured his Dad's essence and showed how much he appreciates his fathers legacy. Watching the Blu ray, you can really tell how happy all of them were to be up there, paying tribute to Ahmet and cementing their legacy.<br /><br />Highlights of the show, for me, were In My Time of Dying, Kashmir, and Whole Lotta Love. Just amazing. For Your Life was another highlight, having not been preformed live before. This may sound weird, but I loved that they didn't wait until the end to play Stairway. Don't get me wrong, I love the song, but it's like the elephant in the room. I'm sure everyone expected it to be at the end, and it was a nice surprise for me to have them play it about halfway through. My only disappointment was that they didn't play Achilles Last Stand (imo, their best song), but that's just a personal nitpick.<br /><br />I didn't mind the video editing. I loved the close-up shots changing frequently. I appreciate the little intricacies of watching musicians play their instruments. And this video gave us a lot of that.<br /><br />Another highlight was seeing the sheer joy on Jason't face throughout the entire show.<br /><br />CD sound quality is great. I've already put it in my iPod and had the volume turned all the way up. Sounds awesome.<br /><br />My only really big disappointment was the bonus DVD. Very little to see. Yeah, we see rehearsals, but there is only one angle and its from way back. And the sound isn't all that great. I wished they would have included interviews with the guys talking a little bit about the lead-up to the show and their thoughts afterwards. The included segment of the news media was also a let down.<br /><br />All in all, I give this 5 stars. Nitpicks aside,I think this set showed what a magical night was had at the O2 in 07'. There is a reason why Zeppelin is my favorite bad (and Jimmy being my idol), and this set shows why. There is none better.
B008WOULPK|4.0|I know of Grace Coddington from the September Issue, the movie about American Vogue.  The iconic scenes for me were her interactions with famous editor Anna Wintour.  In this book she discusses her years as a fashion model and her life with the celebrities and fashion innovators of her day.<br />I found the book interesting.  She has been so many places and has been a part of the fashion industry for over fifty years.  It is a foreign world to me, but fascinating nonetheless.  The pictures are beautiful and it is fun to compare them to her descriptions of their conceptions.<br />For me the most interesting parts are her perceptions of beauty.  She prefers the quirky to the symmetric and the unadorned when possible.  She ages as she ages, and that is a fresh perspective.  I always enjoy a retrospective from someone at the top tier of their sphere of influence, and this is such a book.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I'm a young undergraduate who has a degree in environmental studies and planning. I really think that sustainability in terms of producing more food in the future using less water is important, and that it's a useful skill to know how to garden, even if you don't live in an place with good soil. Aquaponics is definitely a good way to meet all of these goals, and the author of this book does a great job describing the different components of an aquaponics. If you're like me and want to know more about how aquaponics systems work so that you could have your own one day, then this book is definitely worth investing in.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|mystical...<br />At first it was a little confusing following the three stories, but once the connection between past generations surfaced it was had to put down.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It is a great game but it sometimes glitches and keeps making me attack when I don't want to.All in all not bad.
B00631VJIC|5.0|My Husband and I have just recently started watching  the SOA series and really love the music during the episodes.I found this and had to surprise him with the CD.We both give it 5 stars.There are some songs that give you chills because you can remember what was occurring during that tune.And some give you chills just because the singer or group has made it so haunting.Only disappointment is that they can't fit all the songs from the series on the CD.Listened to Curtis Stiegers in his earlier years and have to say I love this gritty sound from him.And Katey Sagal singing is an added surprising bonus.Wish Katey's version of Ruby Tuesday was on the CD, any CD for that matter.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|A glimpse inside a rehab centre - written in such a way that you really have empathy with the characters. Superb!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie, but I am surprised that more people did not comment that it is really not for small children. I'd recommend it for ages 8 and up--minimum! But I guess that a world that lets 6-yr-old watch Batman would find this tame. The animation is gorgeous and the story original.
0062127241|3.0|If one takes the concept of a memoir in its most literal form, than \\"Who I Am,\\" can been seen as an engaging book in which Pete Townshend gives an account of his life. But I think it is fair to say that what people-Who fans in particular-hoped for was more of an autobiography. One suspects that given the amount of time Townshend labored over the book, that was the original intent. But like other aspects of his life and work, (Lifehouse?) this book not only goes off on some odd walkabouts, but is woefully absent and sketchy on key areas of his life and career.<br /><br />The lack of depth and accounting of his musical process is the biggest hole in this book.  That he sums up, \\"Who By Numbers,\\" by noting that, \\"Roger seemed to like the sad songs most,\\" is astonishing given how that album was viewed as a turning point is his writing and the direction of The Who. Contrast this with how much space in the book is dedicated to boats...well, you get the drift. And while his marriage and affairs are important sources/muses for his art, there is an imbalance on that side of the ledger vs. more in-depth analysis of his songs, guitar sound, and writing process.  At times the book reads more like and apology and account for his sins to his ex-wife than a memoir meant for the public. \\"Dear Karen,\\" could easily have been the title.<br /><br />Despite these failings there are some insightful revelations in the book. One that stands out is how the lack of a writing partnership for Townshend hurt The Who and probably shortened its creative peak by several years. One gets the impression that Townshend saw The Who as more kindred spirits with Pink Floyd than the Beatles or Rolling Stones.  Not having a creative team in the Barrett/Waters/Gilmour mold (even with the tension and aggro of the Gilmour-Waters realtionship) left Townshend in a vulnerable position as the sole writer for The Who.  That The Who wasn't able to string together a quartet of albums like, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals\\", and \\"The Wall,\\" must have left Townshend envious and frustrated. Again, this reader wishes he would have gone more into this instead of a quick, \\"perhaps if Roger had done more songwriting The Who may have had a longer run.\\"<br /><br />For all the talk in some of the reviews about how open Townshend is in this book, this reader senses a lot of reserve in the classic English sense (and to be fair, Townshend admits this-in particular when he writes about Keith Moon's death) in this memoir. \\"Who I Am,\\" is not a poor effort but it's not the book this reader was expecting.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is an addictive game that I and many other players have spent hours glued to a screen playing this magnificent and challenging game
B009G8GRX6|1.0|I bought this cd because I heard Madness and thought it was a great song and thought the whole cd would be like it, but I was wrong. It is a terrible album and I consider myself an occasional Muse fan, meaning I generally like their stuff but I'm not crazy about them. THIS ALBUM SUCKS. DO NOT BUY IT.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mine craft is so much fun to play.I always play it on my kindle. I have to say I will always play mine craft.
B009AZZ6H8|1.0|Near worthless from start to finish. Touches of Audioslave and modern indie with not a hint of Soundgarden's old quality.<br /><br />As I stated for a review of the single \\"Been away\\", this is the work of individuals who have lost their way, their direction, their morality, their soul, and when the eye is that jaundiced as to make the observer, Chris Cornell, go actively support a war mongering, tree of civil liberties chopping tyrant, Obama (new boss, same as the old - for those fools who will still misread this as partisan) - there is no true creative spark in them. This garden has decayed at the roots.<br /><br />Last song's lyrics, about says it all: \\"Don't know where I'm going, I just keep rowing.\\"
B009AZZEU2|5.0|At my first listen I wasn't too sure if I was going to like it much.  But after a few listens, all the songs grew on me.  It's not the best they've ever done, but its a still a very  good album.
B00002DE2L|5.0|In my humble opinion this is one of the best versions of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons I have ever heard. The level of emotional expression is exquisite.
B008J34466|2.0|I have been following  'P!nk's music since i saw her in the beacon theatre in nyc(2000). I love most of her songs but this cd threw me a curve. Her voice is way too high and its obnoxious!!! The lyrics are not like her other cds. With all her wonderful cds<br />I guess she was bound to make a so so cd. You are forgiven Pink LOL
B009VB97EY|3.0|rent this movie for the beefcake, not the story line!  I really enjoyed WATCHING this movie.  These boys are so hot!
B0020BUWX2|2.0|I think the plot was cool, but there were too many interruptions talking about the past. People might say that it is to explain the history of the story, but seriously, there were TOO MANY interruptions. I was sick of the book, honestly. Some of the interruptions aren't even necessary. Well that's my opinion. I don't mean to be mean, but I'm just writing this review because the Amazonian people told me to.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Can't stop, needs improvement in some controls but that won't keep you from playing! Edge needs adjusting as stuff drops that shouldn't. Great game though!
B0083EM24C|5.0|Honestly, this record is terrific from start to finish.  The lyrics are on another level compared to others in a similar genre.  My favorite album to spin since it came out -- people of all music interests, age, shape, and sizes have commented how much they enjoy listening to this music when I play it in the background at parties/get togethers.  Just buy it.  Won't regret it.  A little different than their first album, yet just as strong with maybe more in depth sounds and lyrics.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Led Zepplin was the best band in the 70's and it still is today. They perform to perfection. A must have for any rock and roll fan. They are still #1!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i like this game a lot,its relaxing and some logic is needed to play. its easy to understand and play.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|You can tell they have put more into the second and third seasons.  I really hadn't even planned on watching again after season 1 but I watched season 2 on netflix and got hooked.  Obviously it's a zombie show and if that's not something appealing to you I doubt you would like it, but if you do this series is worth checking out.
B000B63IEI|5.0|This disc has the distinction of having one of the most important hallmarks of a truly great performance. That is that for the duration of the performance it seems as if this can be the only way to play the piece.<br /><br />That reaction, of course, is complete nonsense when considered in the cool light of day. In this case how can it be possible to eliminate such luminaries of the repertoire as Ashkenazy, van Cliburn, Lugansky, Pletnev and Richter to name but just a few in strictly alphabetical order? Indeed, all of those performers are also able to give the illusion of being the only way and to that end the name of Andsnes must be added to the list of the elite.<br /><br />In this case he has the undoubted advantage of the tonal resources of the BPO under the ever-watchful eye of Pappano, a conductor of considerable experience and depth of musical understanding. The second concerto is a 'live' performance and this extra frisson generated is apparent over the fine studio performance of the first concerto. It is a very strong coupling indeed.<br /><br />EMI have provided a high quality recording and the whole disc is a very fine achievement and needs to be considered along with the very best. As such it should give most purchasers considerable lasting satisfaction.
030746363X|5.0|Just got the book last night and like what I've read so far. I like his stories and is pretty easy to understand
B009NPA3MS|3.0|I am a Phillip Phillips fan.  I previewed several songs and they sounded OK so I snapped up the album.  I really miss seeing the look in Phillips eyes as he sings, however his personality does come through to some extent.  That being said, it feels like someone else was in control of the production.  There are way there is too much orchestra in the \\"background\\".  Sometimes frequently it intrudes on the vocals.  I like Phillip when he plays and sings, him and his music.  There is some of that on the album, but not enough.  Someone seems to believe that there has to be a crescendo in every song.  Sort of a trend in music these days --- gotta be a big note or the song's no good.  I think Phillip, left to himself, would lean towards quieter, more sensitive, deeper music.  Just my opinion.  Would I buy it again?  Yes.  Will it be my favorite purchase this year? No.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game is awesome. Because if you like Road of the Dead then this is the right game for you. If u start to play the game u wont want to stop.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|The book is  fast moving with a lot of twists and unbelievable turns.  A little too far fetched but still fun reading. As usual Grisham paint beautiful pictures and you are right there in the story. Well done.
1936608618|4.0|Prior to the advent of the internet, software programs or even sophisticated email, I began coaching multi sport athletes using a periodization model based on much of Tudor Bompa's work.  During those times I found that most athletes performed better on reduced volume training. In 2003 I stumbled upon a creative and fun GPP method known as CrossFit.  Greg and Lauren Glassman connected the dots for me in regards to sport specific preparation and physical conditioning in general.  I successfully overlaid a strength template on the CrossFit template (Max Effort Black Box)  and have watched young to old excel with this approach.<br /><br />With Power,Speed & Endurance Brian has put together an intelligent approach to preparation for endurance sports in a similar theme.  His book goes into great detail showing the reader how to integrate strength, CrossFit and sport specific volumes and modern methods.<br /><br />If I would have known what I know now, I would have trained those endurance athletes in a similar vain. If you are looking for a better approach to your endurance preparation this book is for you.
B000008B01|5.0|The tastiness of this album is beyond compare... every track is simple and beautiful... Joao Gilberto at his very best with the percussion genius of Sonny Carr... it's wonderful... it's marvelous!
B009NQWAX2|5.0|Eros is like a good wine, gets better with time. It is obvious that something good is happening in the life of Eros. After listening to this album a few times I can positively say this is by far the best album produced by this great singer, even better than Dove c'e Musica, which was my favorite until the release of this one.<br />This album is being characterized by more rockish style than former albums, which I find fantastic.<br />The album opens with NOI, an awesome rock song with very good rhythm and great piano \\"bridge\\" and guitar solo towards the end. In my opinion this song is one of the best 5 songs of Eros of all times, together with the likes of Dove c'e Musica and L'ombra del gigante.<br />UN ANGELO DISTESO AL SOLE follows - this is a catchy, more of an old-style Eros song. nice violins play in the chorus. Thumbs up.<br />The next 3 songs goes back to the rock style. QUESTA NOSTRA STAGIONE - In English \\"This is our Season\\", IO SONO TE - \\"I am you\\" and FINO ALL'ESTASI - \\"to ecstasy\\" a great sensual duet with Nicole Scherzinger.<br />All first 5 songs of this Album are very \\"strong\\" songs with very good rhythm.<br />I also like Balla Solo La Tua Musica and Sotto Lo Stesso Cielo.<br />COSI - This is the surprise of the Album. Absolutely marvelous and magical duet with a trio of tenors, which begins as a ballad and gets a little more rockish towards the end. This absolutely stupendous song alone is worth the price of the entire Album.<br />All in All - A brilliant and refreshing Album. a great hearing from start to end.<br />GRAZIE EROS - See you in Berlin, May 2013
B002QEXN8E|5.0|All the great hits, pretty well recorded, overall one of my favorites. The only problem with the dvd is the video quality.

1469984202|5.0|First review I ever write for Amazon. I bought these 5 books because they were cheap, with 5 stars, and had thousands of favorable reviews. After reading all those books in a week, I can tell you Mr. Hugh Howey: you are a great writer! I'm from Brazil, English is not my main language, but you write in a way that is very easy to read, understand, and feel what is going on with the chars. The story is fascinating, fast paced, fluid. Many times I knew what would happen, but it was worth reading the author's way to tell it. To anyone in doubt on buying all the collection, my suggestion is to grab it right now and give it a shot. Before these books, I always read only \\"blockbusters\\", books written by famous authors, Nebula and Hugo winners. Thanks to Wool - Omnibus Edition, I discovered a new world. A very interesting new world.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|While I must compliment Amazon on their fast shipping this time around (I ordered it on Monday, chose free shipping, and it arrived on Wednesday!), I am very disappointed in the fact that the digital copy of this movie is EXPIRED and WILL NOT TRANSFER. It is one of the selling points of this particular product, seeing as it is even called out IN THE TITLE, so I find it ridiculous that it does not work. This is NOT a 3 disc set seeing as the 3rd disc is completely dead. If you buy this product NEW, then the digital copy should work. I find it upsetting that the digital copy expired a YEAR ago, and from what I can tell, there is nothing that can be done to remedy this. NOT COOL.<br /><br />In other news, the DVD itself seems to work fine. Haven't been able to test out the Blu-ray disc yet.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|This program does not seem to work very well.  I constantly freezes and there does not seem to be a way to refresh the only options are 1 hour and more refreshes.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a Nelson DeMille fan, a huge fan. Most of his other books kept me on the edge of my seat and caused me to read well into the night. I found this one to be a bit too predictable, I found myself putting the book down much sooner than I normally would.  I must admit that I have loved John Corey's humor in the prior books...but not so much this time.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, it just gets better and more gory! But the storyline does keep you intrigued, who will be alive come tomorrow?
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I owned all the DVDs and I realize these aren't the extended episodes but the picture quality alone makes up for it. Even Season 1 looks phenomenal! I don't know how they did it cause the DVDs in the earlier seasons are awful. If your considering getting this as a gift I'd highly recommend it! I'm so happy I took the chance and ordered this cause I am loving it! The casing is beautiful also, now all we need is Seinfeld to get this nice of an upgrade and I'll be set. I got this when it was 149.99 and I'm glad I didn't hesitate at all.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I'm generally not a fan of the whole post apocalypse genre, but I tried reading this one in order to discuss it with my son. Unfortunately, I found the style of writing very choppy and uncomfortable to read.<br />I well aware that The Hunger Games is a very popular book, it's just that it's not for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife is in love with this show, great quality and price she plans on buying the whole season. Thanks
0316228532|3.0|IT IS NOT HARRY POTTER! IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE ONE, so don't assume that just because it was written by the same author, you'll like it.<br />Essentially, this book is a literary Soap Opera, it certainly has all aspects of one. There is plenty of infidelity, underage sex, drugs, prostitution, physical and verbal abuse, self mutilation, bullying, etc, AND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE IS WORSE THAN ANYWHERE OUTSIDE OF A HIGH SCHOOL.<br />The characters are too complex for their own good and there is virtually nothing positive about any of them. The story jumps all over the place. The writing is very choppy and as a result, the story line doesn't flow smoothly. The storyline starts slow and stays that way for at least 1/4 of the book. It does pick up toward the end and that's what saves the story.<br />I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 40 or anyone who has a tendency to blush easily at the idea of masturbation, which is frequently mentioned along with female anatomy and genitalia.<br />After completing the reading of the WHOLE book, you feel like JK decided to shed her Good Girl image for a more sluttier and dramatic side.<br />Sexual content and foul langage aside, the book did make me feel something, I'm just not sure what.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so good for just a quick and easy game on a trip it is just a good game all in all
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The Setup is pretty basic you can pick the alarm sound, or name the alarm you're setting up , put the alarm on repetitive days, change the way the soundis executed etc. etc..<br /> This is a very handy app ..<br />I usually hide my kindle so that I have no choice but to get up and turn it off..<br />I use it to get up at crack of dawn for class or to get dressed to go to work..<br /> when the alarm goes off I love that the dismiss button is teeny tiny and the snooze button is huge so there's less of a chance that you'll screw yourself and hit dismiss.<br />Oh, you have to leave your kindle on standby for it to alarm..<br /><br />It's free too, can't beat that.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Good movie with good acting and funny. Loved to hate the Merle Streep character. Will not look at fashionistas the same again.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Nice looking watch.  Can't beat the price for a self winding and a Seiko to boot.  Works nice, looks nice.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I was hoping for an enlightening bio of someone I have admired from afar and the prospect of Meryl Streep  playing the part was to me particularly enticing.  I was however, quite disappointed as I found the story line difficult to follow - choppy bits and pieces of scenes without sufficient followup or explanation.  The method of telling the story set in the Iron Lady's old age with too many jolting back and forth flash backs to give a sense of what her life was really like is lame and ineffective.  What a shame and a waste to treat such good subject matter poorly!
B005723JSQ|4.0|Well written, with great humor and enjoyable story line.  The plot keeps you engaged.  I would recommend this book to friends.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|We both could not be more disappointed with this movie.  Artistic liberty... was taken all over the place.<br /><br />The book was great and i would recomment it to anyone for the book actually made this entire scenario seem plausible.  The movie on the other hand...????  Thank goodness we did not waste our money in the movie theatres.  Rending on DVD... sure, why not... but if you are picky.. wait for the \\"made for tv\\" for you are not missing much.<br /><br />Go read the book, it's great!  The movie... not so much.<br /><br />Sorry.<br /><br />T
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Yesterday was the first time I had ever seen Michael Cinimo's infamous film \\"Heaven's Gate\\", watching it on the newly released Criterion Blu-ray. Before buying it, I read countless reviews complaining that the movie's image quality was too faded, too washed out, too sepia-toned. (Famed critic Roger Ebert described the look of the film as \\"so unfocused and so brownish yellow that you want to try Windex on the screen.\\" He went on to say, \\"A director is in deep trouble when we do not even enjoy the primary act of looking at his picture.\\")<br /><br />Well, if that was the case before, it certainly isn't now. Everything on screen is sharp and crystal clear. The colors are rich and vibrant. If there wasn't indisputable proof that the film I watched and the film reviewers criticized for its bad picture were one and the same, I would never have believed it. The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond is lush and dazzlingly gorgeous, making almost every shot look like a great painting. Far from being unable to enjoy \\"the primary act of looking at [the] picture\\", as Ebert put it, I wanted to savor and drink in as much of its beauty as possible.<br /><br />The sound quality, however, is very poor in some places. Dialogue can be drowned out by background noise, like when characters are in a busy street.  Apparently, it was always like that. It isn't a distraction through the whole film; in fact it only seems to happen in a few scenes. But some of those scenes are near the beginning and are crucial to hear in order to understand what is to follow. Keep the subtitles handy.<br /><br />The film itself, I think, is underrated. It has flaws, the most evident of which is its slow start. (Be warned if you haven't seen it: The film takes a LONG time to pick up steam.) But it has merits that some of its harsher critics turn a blind eye to. Along with the magnificent cinematography, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" has a haunting score that creeps its way into your soul. It has characters I found to be compelling, played by actors who range from competent to truly brilliant. Kris Kristofferson suits the role of the burned-out, world-weary sheriff with lost roots in wealth and privilege. Christopher Walken is perfect as a hired gun working in the interest of ruthless cattle barons: When you see him commit murder in his first scene, you think he's going to be this immense antagonist. As the film unfolds, you realize he's more than some villain. One of the best things about \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is the way it gives Walken's character so much depth, allowing his inner contradictions and emotions to gradually emerge. Also, I thought Isabelle Huppert did a great job as the bordello madam who is the object of both these men's affection. She brought energy, liveliness, and vivacity to the role. I cared about her character and what might happen to her.<br /><br />Oh, and John Hurt is awesome as always. His part is small, but he steals just about every scene he is in.<br /><br />This is a beautiful Blu-ray release of a very divisive film. If you are going to experience \\"Heaven's Gate\\", this is the best way to do so. Give it a chance. You may like it. You may hate it. At any rate, the film has its place in cinema history and should prove an interesting experience for you.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Update: Someone commented on my previous reviewer that they were not required to have an Internet connection to play. I am glad they did because I went back today and tried again and it looks good. It let me into my puzzles and did not give me an error about needing an Internet connection. I didn't see an update but did clear the cache for this app before playing. So I am once again completely happy with this game. It is fun and challenging and they are constantly adding new puzzles just when I thought I had cleared a level. Great game and definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />This has been my favorite Kindle game for a while. It is fun and challenging and there are constantly new puzzles added. I haven't played in a while and today discovered that you are now required to have an Internet connection to even play the game. This is extremely disappointing as I don't keep my wifi on when not needed and prevents me from playing when there is no connection available. There is no need for a game like this to require that. I will no longer play this or CrossMe Color until this is fixed. And I will make sure to avoid purchasing or downloading any games from Dynamix because of this.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|Ludwig is twisting in his grave at the fact that this is currently the top-selling classical album. Any classical aficionado (ahem, snob) will look at the selections on this album and call them safe, vanilla, uninteresting. Make no mistake: This is an unabashed attempt to profit on the already-ridiculously-profitable Fifty Shades brand, and to do so by selling widely appealing (i.e., \\"vanilla\\") music.<br /><br />But this album wasn't made for classical snobs. It was made for people who want some musical mood enhancers for their reading experience. And for that, it works. You will certainly get a better Fifty Shades reading experience through this album than you will by, say, turning on the radio to Maroon 5 and Ke$ha and Flo Rida.<br /><br />The music on this album has a subtle, emerging intensity, a mysterious allure with a vague suggestion of danger. Which means it's a perfect complement for the book.
B00004W52U|5.0|this is tim armstrong before rancid. all songs are good. if youre thinking of getting this becouse youre a rancid fan dont. this isnt anything like rancid. in my opinion its better. i never got into rancid much, but love this.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Pure genius. I consider this book to be the most glorious distillation of word and thought.  The years following the revolution are portrayed so lyrically and vividly.  It is, and in my opinion will always be a literary tour de force.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|'Kisses on the Bottom&#34; should be &#34;required&#34; viewing for everyone!!  It's Marvelous!!!!!!!! How wonderful to be able to hear talented people without all the yelling and shouting that is so prevelant in most of today's acts.  Audrey Jean Naughton
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I'd been confused, on Wikipedia, about the deliniations between &#34;Serenity&#34; and the series.  I was PLEASANTLY surprised to find that &#34;Serenity&#34; the movie is NOT the same as the first 2 in the series - and it filled in a lot!  Of Course, utterly enjoyable!  So glad I got it!  Wish, so much, there were more to the series ...
B007TK77QE|5.0|I experienced similar (and strong) emotions to The Road by Cormac McCarthy. That's because it is relentlessly bleak, yet somehow uplifting. I don't know how she did that, but I'm glad she did.
B005LAII08|5.0|Arrived Tuesday, 11/13/12, via pre-ordered - Wonderful, sealed, new, all versions included - So glad to have it - Thank You!  THIS IS A GREAT, Great Movie!  Story - What incredible Animation Detail - Fascinating!  A Must Have!
1416562605|5.0|This was an intensely good book. The sardonic anger of the narrator came out at every page. There were individual passages that really stuck. For example, he relates how many of his fellow drivers read periodicals like Murder Weekly, with lurid tales of servants killing their masters, but says that the upper classes needn't be threatened--\\"It's when your driver starts to read about Gandhi and the Buddha that it's time to wet your pants...\\"<br /><br />The character's deep-set cynicism is convincingly set up by the circumstances of his life but there is also an attempt to preserve some moral core even in the midst of that which is believable and creates an interesting dimension.<br /><br />It has elements of a picaresque novel but the character's main act (indicated fairly early in the book) is too intense for that, and there is a degree of character development not common to that genre. It is, instead, a dark, vivid and angry satire...and a very good one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My 15 year old daughter purchased the book and absolutely loves it. I haven't read it yet, but I certainly plan to do so.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|You really have to read book one to make sense of this book.  (I did read it first)  The author does give us a pretty good look at world history in both books unless you are a history scholar.  This second book leads up to and includes WWI and WWII from the English/British involvement.  He does go into the German side and Russian side because there are family members in those countries as well as the USA.  It was a book I found hard to put down because of the interconnected families.  The books would make a terrific mini-series because of the:  Political drama of England; the conflict and rise of Communism in Russia, and, of course, the upheaval of Europe during the invasions by Germany.  He deals well with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the United States involvement in Europe.  I am looking forward to Book three and how he deals with the world as it has become in the decades since the end of WWII both in Europe, Asia and the United States.  It is an historical novel with romance, suspense and a glimpse of the horrors of war.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Nausicaa... this movie is no stranger to Ghibli fans but for the average viewer, it seems to be often overshadowed by other Ghibli works such as Mononoke, Spirited Away, Kiki, Totoro, and Laputa (Castle in the Sky). It's the movie that started it all. This is my second favorite Ghibli movie after Laputa.<br /><br />The details are in the other reviews but I will say this - definitely read the manga (graphic novel). You'll see this recommendation throughout other reviews as well.  I first saw Nausicaa the movie and thought it was a decent movie but a few things did bother me, especially in character development and the exposure time (or lack thereof) of the giant warrior.  Then I read the manga. Whoa and I mean WHOA. There's a huge difference. The story is so much longer, the characters are so deep, and the giant warrior plays an integral part for much of the story... Side note: The manga reminds me of Akira... the movie came out before the Otomo finished his manga work and only captured a slice of the entire story (if you've not read Akira, highly recommneded). Nausicaa the movie is similar in that sense as the manga ran from 1982-1994 but the move was released in 1984. You will think Miyazaki's a genius and a true artist, having created and drawn such work during his syndication.  Miyazaki's usual themes of nature and ecology apply.
B008NABUU8|5.0|its free and is a great way to kill time while at the in-laws for thanksgiving.  plays great on kindle fire hd.
0385535147|3.0|With an interesting storyline and colorful characters, the book is definitely entertaining. However none of Grisham's subseqent books live up to his debut novel A Time to Kill. That is my all time favorite.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker gives you a lot more insight into the characters i have grown to love. I can barely put the book down. It is EVERYTHING!! It's love, heartbreak, wealth, jealousy, steamy sex, s&m, baggage....everything. i am addicted to this entire trilogy.

B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Gotta give some respect to these wonderful young actors. They hold the screen with just as much emotion and quirkiness as the icons they share it with (Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, just to name a few...). I'm sorta addicted to Anderson's stylistic flourishes that reside somewhere between heartfelt memory and satire of youth. The film's characters sorta left a &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34; flavor in my mouth, but I really can't explain why. That's the best part of Anderson's films for me. They leave me with something powerful, and I can never really say how or why....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think its a hey good calculator and does the job very well. It comes in handy with homework. Great app.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|Mr. French does a helluva job reconstructing the devastating and peculiar events surrounding the gruesome murder Pamela Werner in old China. It is incredible that so many loose ends could still exist, but alas, \\"out of the crooked timber of humanity, nothing straight can ever be built...\\" (I don't know who said that, but it totally applies to this book...)

You can create sample short animations by this book easily. You can find all animation elements (design, movie, editing, timing and more)in.
B002YCVX5S|1.0|This anti-German pro Talmudic Jewish Supremacist film was one of the worst pieces of lame brained defamatory propaganda I have ever studied as a means to acquire a clearer understanding of the twisted anti-human nature of the followers of the hateful, bigoted Satanic guidebook known as the Talmud.<br /><br />One more clumsy ill conceived strike against decent humanity that fully exposes the members of what Jesus Christ referred to as \\"The Synagogue Of Satan\\" for the demonic alien beasts that most of them are.<br /><br />All copies of this piece of vicious, spiteful, bigoted, hate filled, degenerate filth should be piled up on top of a trash heap of Talmuds (with a few copies of the Protocols of Zion thrown in for good measure)and burned!<br /><br />Tarantino's next sick perverted film \\"Django Unchained\\" is due for release later this month (just in time to insult Christian's of European ancestry at Christmas). I call upon all good decent Americans of all ethnic backgrounds and faiths to Boycott This Film!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very entertaining and very addictive. It does get glitchy when not on wifi but very fun nonetheless.  I find myself always checking up on my town.  This is a big step from the original game I played on old apple spinach screens as a kid.

You'll be fine with the stock cooler. You don't HAVE to upgrade it. You'll still get these settings right out of the box.<br /><br />Other Crazy Thoughts From my Pal: I can never understand why people who are fans of other products try to sway people's decisions on purchasing a product by posting bad reviews on something they don't own. I built one of these for someone and it plays games nicely with no lag on mid-high settings, (ie; BF3-35 fps solid, SWTOR 50-60 fps just to name a few) and it definitely out performs a P-4 Mr. Chris and yes I am calling you out on your poor review with no statistical data to back up your claim.<br />The Intel 4000 chip set is not meant for gaming it's a redone 3000 with a prettier picture, while it is faster than its predecessor it is not superior to a built in gpu. I have built both Intel and AMD equivalents and they are both faster in their own ways, Intel blowsup the benchmarks for sure AMD can't hold a candle to them. But in gaming situations the AMD is smoother if setup properly, most people have problems with AMD because they choose the wrong components (ie; motherboards, ram, etc.) but you learn based on trial and error. With Intel's in my experience its mostly cut and dry drop in and go. Bottom line both have their good and bad and it's all about competition if Intel didn't have a competitor like AMD they would not strive for a better product and you wouldn't have the high speeds we see from them competition drives innovation. If you thing this will be on par with an I7 you are mistaken it wasn't designed to be a gaming monster but for a casual gamer/web surfer that doesn't want to spend $1,000+ on a computer which makes up a majority of the economy. Trying to compare this to the I7 or even an AMD 8 core is like comparing it to an Xbox or PS3, it is a completely different animal. So please make your reviews responsibly because what you like/want may not be what someone else wants and worse may not work for their needs. Thank you and have a nice day :)

B004SUWR2C|5.0|Have to agree with the more recent reviews. This game looks great on the fire<br />HD. Play is smooth... really have no issues so far.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is fast paced unlike many other create you own city games. really enjoy it!! There are also many different challenges at any given time so you can do which ones you choose to.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There was potential for this to be an intriguing, sensual novel. Things moved too, too quickly. Not enough background into Christian's life... then BANG...Ana is under his spell... seriously?<br /><br />I didn't see the rush with 2 other books to read, in order to complete the trilogy.<br /><br />Perhaps the pending movie(s) will capture what the book didn't?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|AWSOME GAME very challenging I love flow free PLEASE DOWNLOAD GIVE IT A TRY.ok it might sound weird but don't listen to the people who say its BAD because its a really NOT I'm a LOVER!!!!
B009CPES4I|5.0|I loved the idea of learning....This movie will make you realize that you do not need to depend on others for your hapiness.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While I did enjoy the book, I think John Grisham's first books were his best. This seems to be formula driven.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Would have liked for it to have picked up where the third book ended, but instead it is a bunch of new charcters, and it goes a long time without hearing from characters you read so much about during the first three books.  Pace and action pick up half way through
B009DKFSUA|2.0|this is nothing new or different for pitbull musically bt its OK music at best..Some tracks of course standout more than others lk; \\"Feel This Moment\\" very catchy and turnt up track!!,\\"Im Off That\\" nw this is fiyah!! love it!!! my fav track off this album , & \\"Don't Stop The Party\\" aye!! this is nt bad will have you ready to dance!! the rest of the tracks on the album are just fillers if i must say so..better luck next album.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great characters and great history, this book has it all and sets the stage for a great series, a little slower then the next two however
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I honestly loved this book.the series is fantastic and I cannot wait until all the movies come out. Simply amazing
B000267JQK|5.0|Disclaimer II is an awesome album that has awesome live footage and videos on the dvd. It is a must have for me and It is really one of my favorite albums and dvds. Seether is awesome.
B009SCRERI|5.0|It is so nice to have a movie that has no scary element to it.  Just good clean entertainment!  My kids and I really enjoyed it!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|tried and tried to install, I have Space, Rio and 1 on this device, however it would not. I looked for what version is not compatible and its not listed, WTF
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This is not a great literary masterpiece; it is simply the kind of stuff I like to read.  It parallels the CASTLE series on ABC and as it turns out:  I am a fan.  I have always suspected that James Patterson is ghost writing the Nikki Heat series by &#34;Richard Castle&#34; because of the writing style.  In any event, if you like this kind of stuff, you will not be disappointed.
B008476HBM|5.0|I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected. The authors use of english is very enjoyable and more accessible than I thought it would be. Best bit of 200 year old chicklit you can read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Ok, at first I will admit I did not expect to ~really~ like this, as I thought &quot;what will be different than other games?&quot; But as soon as I started playing it I could see why I would prefer to play this one over other match 3 type games...<br /><br />This game has great graphics, pleasant music, and manages to incorporate a fun little plot with some power ups.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I have enjoyed every single story from Brandon Sanderson and this is no exception.  Every one is different but consistently a great story, great characters and hard to put down!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Works very well, but have noticed that I do not use it much any more.  Very good app. I would download again.  Thanks!
B00A3AUGEW|3.0|Great pop effort. Now that you hopefully made everyone else happy, have some change in your pocket and satisfied contractual requirements you can go out and make the music you really want to make?  I liked you because you took chances and did your own thing. Now go do your own thing. Your talent, courage and uniqueness will be forever wasted if you don't get at least one album of your real stuff out there.

B009VSW15Y|3.0|Bought the app last night but it didn't show up in my apps list. Contacted customer service by email and received a reply that it was showing up . Found I had to sync my Kindle Fire to get it to show in the list. Have only played with it a couple of times but seems to work as advertized. I'm happy now.

0596805527|5.0|I read a review (somewhere) that said that this was the ONLY book that was complete. I believe it. I have 50 years in the IT business; do not try to use this as a :First Introduction(!) to JavaScript.&#34; You will need this book, just not as the FIRST book. Make no mistake, JavaScript (JS) is NOT a simple language. It is not, realistically a stand-alone tool: it requires Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and using it without jQuery, or a similar package, is plane stupid. (If you don't start out stupid, you will end up that way.)<br /><br />Why do you need this book? JS usually provides the programmer with several (!!) syntactical constructions that perform the same action. They vary from place to place. If your statement 'looks OK' but won't run; this book is where you go to find out why, or at least what to do.<br /><br />Get the .pdf (or other 'ebook' format) version in addition to the book. The book is big, and if you need something quickly it is a bit of a pain to search through.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Take everything you know about Abraham Lincoln and discard all of it, surround him with 21st century douchebags, add in some painfully cliche vampire tropes, and that's the basic premise. There was so much potential here. If it would have actually been Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter it would have been awesome. but it's not. it's not abraham lincoln. it's just some dude. I can't even waste any more energy giving this a proper review, it's jut not worth it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Son's  opinion:Awesome! I love the suspense (SPOILER ALERT) and what I  thought was the best part was the wolves attacked. Again Awesome!!!!
B005NQ94KS|5.0|Amazing book. I didn't know what to expect with the movie but it was amazing. they stay as true as possible to the book so much so I knew what to expect. And whatever was left out I didn't miss. Ann HathawAy is one of my favorite actors and she stayed that way after watching the movie. I also enjoyed the male lead he was very well done. the chemistry between the actors was natural and the supportive cast were really good. DVD extras was something else I enjoyed
B000XA5K4I|4.0|gotta love the satire. this is a non-stop action feast.  i dare you to try to count the bodies.  Clive Owen does an excellent job.

0547884591|2.0|I read this book over 4-hours.  My biggest complaint is that Ferris lays out why cookbooks don't work: too many tools, too many ingredients, too many weird ingredients, too much.  Then he writes a humungous cook book doing EXACTLY what he says doesn't work with other cook books.  The dishes are just absurd with the menu.  Don't have 95% of that stuff in the markets around my town.  Might work if I lived in San Fran or NY, but who wants that? I'd say the cooking part is a huge FAIL.<br /><br />Did enjoy the outdoor cooking/survival stuff. Should be a book unto itself.  Also liked the 'deconstructing' learning things about language and other things you want to learn.<br /><br />On a side note, PAGG supplements do not work.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Well written and hilarious. Grabs you into the story and wont let go. Very addictive.  Can't wait for season two.
0385535147|2.0|I've read many grisham books. This one I didn't want to finish and didn't.Half way and I gave up.  Boring,Boring,Boring Someone else must have written this book. With so many books to choose from pass on this one!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent followup to the Fall of Giants. Can't wait for the third book in the trilogy. Both of these books are excellent  examples of historical fiction
B007SGM084|5.0|Who would not enjoy these books, so well written, I couldn't put them down.  All men have a little Christian in them.  Absolutely loved them wish there was more.
0434020362|5.0|This book was filled with valuable information, scientific evidence, and interesting stories, all related to and supporting the premise that we can change anything in our lives by adjusting our habits. It was inspiring, practical, clearly written, and the lessons are staying with me. I've recommended it to others, and would recommend to anyone who has a habit they think they can't break. You can!
B0068MNO4S|1.0|Finally saw the movie on cable today.<br /><br />Enough full reviews have already been written, and I've already commented at length on the \\"Merry Mary\\" 1-star review below, so can be brief here.<br /><br />Saddened to see Jacobi debase himself by telling so many hateful lies at end.  Of course, the whole movie is poppycock.<br /><br />The portrayal of Stratford was simply offensive, but in many ways the treatment of Jonson worse.<br /><br />And the full Prince Tudor theory. . . . Filth.<br /><br />Not sure why I drew these connections, but now more fully understand that (a) P.T.Barnum was right and (b) propaganda is a dangerous thing, especially very bad Teutonic propaganda.
0316056863|5.0|This book was so honest, laugh-out-loud funny, inspiring, and especially catered to women in the workplace. It was diplomatic yet not at all phony. Tina Fey has proven herself to be one of the great female comedians of our time. She is very bright, and her self-deprecating tales of her childhood are touching, conjuring up vivid images. She is fabulous.
B000OPOAMA|4.0|The movie was a  little damage in the box,  but anyway was awesome, definetely i will buy more later and i recived at time!!!
B00000IMTH|3.0|Since rock seems to be on life support right now, Dio only got us 30 years with the title track here.  Solid album with 2 of my favorite Rainbow songs.  The Dio era of Rainbow wipes the pop direction they would go in right after this.  This kind of music sounds dated now but I rather hear this than what's on the radio now.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Excellent family movie! It has a great story that children and parents will enjoy together. The photography is great! I highly recommended.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This new CD is wonderful - Kid Rock has never failed me yet - can't wait to see his concert!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|By now even those who dislike Christopher Nolan's Batman triptych have been so beaten into submission that, in lieu of screaming \\"uncle,\\" they have conceded that the trio of films serve as a sort of repository of all of the anxieties running through the first decade or so of the new millennium.  They may disagree about the quality of the films themselves, but after seven years everyone agrees that these movies have established themselves as important cultural artifacts.  In particular, I've enjoyed that Nolan has somehow managed to hoist his personal vision of the world in front of millions and it has still connected with large swaths of audiences.  The blockbuster as personal missive approach to filmmaking has become increasingly rare, because either the audience or the studio have rejected those directors (see: Lee's Hulk, Singer's Superman Returns, and Raimi's Spiderman series).  These days it seems as if Nolan is one of a few directors with the clout to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his own personal vision.<br /><br />So where does The Dark Knight Rises, the epic finale square with its predecessors?  Does it consistently meld its fantastical premise with a real world aesthetic like Begins?  Does it successfully tangle with questions of ethics like the sequel?  Well, not exactly.  At two hours and forty-five minutes, the film is unwieldy (how could it not be).  But it still manages to stick its landing, providing a satisfying and logical conclusion to one of the most distinct movie series of the last ten years.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises plays out like a dialectic of the first two films, stringing along the two main threads of the previous installments - the League of Shadow's terrorist attack and the moral fall and death of Harvey Dent - and combining them.  Because the people of Gotham still believe in Harvey Dent's martyrdom, the lie concocted by Batman and Gordon at the end of The Dark Knight, they have come together and passed something called the \\"Dent Act,\\" which has helped clear the streets of criminals.  It isn't exactly clear what was in the Dent act, but apparently it was controversial enough for some politicians to push for repeal.  The dramatic cut in crime has formed a city that no longer needs Batman as its protector, and Bruce Wayne hasn't worn the cape and cowl since the end of the second film, eight years ago in movie time.  After a stunningly shot jail break in mid air, the film opens with a large gala at the Wayne mansion, but Wayne himself is absent, leading one party-goer to suggest that he may be growing out his finger nails and filling jars with urine in solidarity with Howard Hughes.<br /><br />During the gala one of the maids, suspiciously played by the headlining starlet Anne Hathaway, makes her way into a largely abandoned wing of Wayne manor.  Of course, Hathaway is playing Selina Kyle, better known as Catwoman (although that name is never used).  And after a confrontation with her reclusive host, she slips out with some pearls and copies of Bruce Wayne's finger prints.  The pearls are for her while the fingerprints are for a mysterious new player in Gotham who happen to be a front for the League of Shadow, the same terrorist organization that trained Bruce Wayne and then later attempted to destroy Gotham in the first film.<br /><br />Like a lot of people, I was skeptical of Hathaway's ability to play Catwoman.  She has a tendency to find roles that take advantage of her mostly chipper attitude, and I wasn't sure she would be able to convincingly beat up guys twice her size on screen.  Luckily, my skepticism was misplaced.  Hathaway is easily one of the best elements of the movie.  Most of Nolan's Batman films are shrouded in a decidedly pessimistic view of humanity, an element that is both refreshing in a blockbuster but also, at times, oppressive.  Hathaway provides a respite from the heavier aspects of Rises because she's one of the few characters who seems to actually enjoyherself from time to time.  When she first stumbles upon Wayne during her burglary she starts by playing innocent, but when he calls her out on her lying Hathaway's entire demeanor shifts, from the way she speaks to how she holds herself.  Throughout the film Hathaway plays Selina Kyle as mercurial, and we never really know which side she's on or whether or not she has gained or lost the upper hand.<br /><br />The central antagonist, however, is Bane, the new leader of the League of Shadows.  Rumors about Bane suggest that he comes from a prison pit in one of the more brutal corners of the world.  It is nearly impossible for any prisoner to scale this pit and gain his freedom, and although many of tried, Bane is the only one who has made it out alive.  Bane's approach to leading the League of Shadows is different from Ra's al Ghul's.  Where Ra's obscured the violence of the terrorist group through reasonable sounding rhetoric and Liam Neesom's proper British accent, Bane himself appears to be brutality incarnate.  Without hesitation he guns civilians down but seems to prefer killing people with his bare hands.<br /><br />His followers also have a religious-like devotion, dutifully sacrificing their lives upon a simple request, which Bane makes in the same perfunctory manner that a boss might when asking for a TPS report.  But it's not exactly clear why Bane himself garners such allegiance from his acolytes beyond the mythology surrounding his emergence from the pit.  Tom Hardy, who has put in some great performances in his career, is constrained by a mouth piece that not only serves to obscure his facial expressions, but also distorts his voice, which ends up sounding like Sean Connery with laryngitis.  The end result can look menacing in a fight, but when Hardy has dialogue to deliver, his tools as an actor are hobbled.  This is no more apparent than when Bane gives an impassioned speech to Gotham's downtrodden, but the audience can't even see his mouth move, and his vocal range is electronically suppressed.<br /><br />Bane's goal is not only to break Batman but also to hold Gotham hostage, cutting it off from the outside world and allowing the city residents to turn on each other.  After a vicious battle against Batman where Bane methodically dismantles his opponent, the League of Shadows proceeds to blow up any egress from the city and arm a nuclear weapon, which they are prepared to detonate if the U.S. military takes action against them.  The sequence is impressive in the way that it manages to make the stakes suitably and improbably high, a difficult task coming off of the threat of the Joker.  While Batman is trapped in the same prison that once held Bane, the citizens of Gotham plot to bring down the League of Shadows.<br /><br />Bane's ideology and the film itself are peppered with pseudo-populist sentiment about inequality and class.  Selina Kyle, who has had to scramble to survive her entire life, resents Wayne and his high society peers.  And when Bane has finally cut Gotham off from the outside world his first move is to release all of the prisoners from jail.  Unfortunately, the film's handling of class issues is muddle at best and downright moronic at worst.  After Bane releases Gotham's prisoners, waves of the resentful underclass spread out over Gotham smashing the homes of the city's economic elite.  But it's unclear if all of this terror is a part of some Marxist dialectic, or if they're just angry prisoners.  The film suggests that the Dent Act, which is vaguely defined, has prevented parole for many of the prisoners and has in turn stoked much of their anger.  But later, these criminals form a twisted version of the judicial system in a kangaroo court headed up by none other than Dr. Crane a.k.a. the Scarecrow.  We're supposed to be incensed by a court whose sole purpose is to sentence its subjects because the verdict of guilty has already been determined, but we're not asked to question whether the Dent Act affected potentially reformed convicts who may have lingered in jail for years, or wonder about the potential for false conviction present in most attempts to create a tougher, more rigid judicial system.<br /><br />All of Nolan's philosophizing has the bong scented whiff of a dorm room soliloquy.  In the previous films the ethical and moral questions were wonderful thought puzzles buried within exciting action movies, but here the very premise of these concerns fall apart the moment you think about them.  The obvious contemporary parallel to the film's class anger is the Occupy Wall Street movement and the 2008 financial crash.  But is the inclination to open prison doors and suspend the right to a fair trial really all that similar to increasing the top tax bracket by three percent and reinstituting economic safety guards put in place after the Great Depression, like the Glass-Steagall Act?  Nolan himself has distanced the film from real world events and claims that much of it is based off of the Charles Dickens classic A Tale of Two Cities.  And at times it seems as if Chris and his brother Jonathan want to be writing novels instead of making movies (which would explain the incredible amount of exposition that at times bogs down their plots).  But this doesn't necessarily solve the problem that, unlike much of Dickens's work, the moral quandaries found in this film are not well thought out.<br /><br />But despite all of this, I enjoyed the film.  When it started to wobble, and it does from time to time, the movie got a boost from the emotional resonance that carried over from the first two movies.  Nolan does not treat this Batman series as a movie studio franchise, a fungible property that can be turned out by any number of studio approved directors.  If anything The Dark Knight Rises puts a cap on the series, and anyone would be hard pressed to awkwardly continue Nolan's story except for Nolan himself (and my guess is that he will be out of the Batman business for some time).  This is a situation where the studio should wait a decade or so, give the audience some distance from Nolan's vision of Batman, and then completely reinvent the character with a young and hungry director.  Whether you loved Nolan's movies or hated them, you must admit that the character has so clearly become his in the public eye that it will take some time before anyone will accept a Batman film that isn't helmed by Nolan.  Rises may not reach the heights of its predecessors, but its surprisingly moving denouement proves that it is possible to spin fully realized characters out of a world of superheroes.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I love this movie. Can't think of one bad movie Robert Downey Jr. has been in recently. Very versatile and talented actor.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|this  little cover is the best, and it cover and protect good, Love it and it doesn't coast a lot of money  5 start
B0062P3392|4.0|Was surprised. This movie was actually pretty good. Not the same old story. Nice twists and turns. Lots of action.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Loved it. Kept me guessing until the end. Recommend this to anyone who liked the forgotten garden. Couldn't put it down.
B004LWZW42|4.0|While the storyline was decent and actors who portrayed the future rivals Magneto and Professor X did their roles superbly the overall movie wasn't as great I felt.  I could understand some of the characters that were chosen to be in the movie are how they were able to stay so fit and active and later decades(Mystique) but at least one left me dumbfounded and that's the character of Havok. Havok or Alex Summers as I'm sure many comic fans know is supposed to be the younger brother of Scott Summers(Cyclops),so unless they had Cyclops alive and older in this time era then the writers botched that scenario in their script somewhat. Also would be the introduction of Emma Frost or the White Queen and Hank McCoy(Beast) and Sean Cassidy(Banshee),but I guess since two of these characters weren't introduced in any of the three previous X-men movies or the Wolverine movie that the producers decided to use them in this movie.  Despite that little mishap overall the movie gives fans of the series what they wanted the history of the relationship between Charles Xavier and Eric Lensherr before the tragic animosity that would come between the former friends and colleges and of course plenty of action and fights.  If you already have the first three movies then this is must have especially for X-men fans or if you just like super hero movies or action movies then here's a good choice as well regardless a entertaining movie awaits you....
B00973902K|5.0|great song. avid runner and just had to had this song to my workout list of music to listen to when i'm jogging
0307720950|5.0|I've long refused reading the books of the top minds of the Valley, probably from fear I could be convinced and would have to change my \\"fixed mindset\\" as I recently discover my brain was working. Hopefully, I'm not yet 30 and YES, I did read one of these books and YES, it's a game-changer for me at least.<br /><br />Chris Anderson's \\"Maker : the new industrial revolution\\" is a brilliant book, one of the kind you can't close without DOING something. And it really matches with all my current thoughts on a community-based world (may sound familiar for US readers, it's a new world for Europe at least, and what I experience in Asia confirms it's a US exception). By the way, this post and a few other to come will go into a new category (after \\"Playing with Data\\" and \\"Going social in Asia\\"), say hi to \\"The rise of Communities\\").<br /><br />\\"Products developed by a community are more likely to be embraced by one\\"<br /><br />For Anderson, the 3rd industrial revolution (after the steam engine and the mechanization in the 18th-19th century, and the oil and transportation in the 19th-20th) is about to come thanks the web AND the way it's changing manufacturing. Beyond the 3D printers, laser-cutters and other DIY toolkit that gives body to the Makers movement, Chris Anderson is best at showing us how these digital/physical tools are reshaping parts of our society :<br /><br />* If the web has democratized innovation in bits, Makers are democratizing innovation in atoms thanks rapid prototyping and affordable tools. Welcome to \\"the long tail of things\\"<br />* the way makers work is based on community : it provides market research, marketing and part of the sales in exchange for symbolic rewards such as recognition or extended rights within the community (think of admin and moderators in forum or the different rewards in Kickstarter)<br />* if you like geo-economics, you'll be happy to know that Makers could be a way for the West (and the US, notably) to counter cheap labor fromAsia, as the value of the product goes more and more to its community, its closeness to consumer, its reliability, its shapeability.<br />* this revolution is also the one of the amateurs, who, after conquering social media with lolcats and biting babies, enter the physical world with customized and passionate objects. Why buy IKEA or Muji when you can order more authentic on Etsy ? That's where the premium lies : you pay your avoidance of mass-consumption (for good !)<br />* this \\"cottage industry\\", in reference to the first stages of the English Industrial Revolution, is not a competitor to the big industry, rather something that fills in for a more personalized demand in lesser quantities. It's not (yet ?) possible to achieve economies of scale with Maker but it doesn't cost more to produce another customized product.<br />* the tool itself has a liberating power : the same way the press made people express, the web had people publish, we can bet that makers tools will have people build and manufacture<br />with the long tail of things come the long tail of talents, as many project offer a surface for anyone with the skills or the will to take part : \\"it' the ultimate market solution : open innovation communities connect latent supply (talent not already employed in that field) with latent demand (products not already economical to create the usual way)\\"<br /><br />\\"A Chinese company can make a clone of our products and maybe sell it cheaper, but it won't have our community\\"<br /><br />If you look to Makers with the prism of community, there's also many interesting hints in Anderson's book :<br /><br />* Making is a way to fulfill one's own inspiration with one's own tools, almost without any help from bi companies and the state. This is, for sure, a way for communities to develop further their own economics.<br />* This long tail of things or micro-markets makes us new \\"indie\\", allowing peoples differences to express and have more value than standard mass-production items.<br />* The law of supply and demand is, in a way, taken the other way-round. Instead of a product wanted by a company (and sometimes checked by market research), the niche products of makers are driven by people's wants and needs (\\"we might today think of manufacturing firms as linked to particular communities\\")<br />* The Maker movement is the pinnacle of the remix culture found everywhere on the web, every one, every community is now deemed able to produce its own products (or rather : its own way of a given product)<br />* The way community is integrated to Makers development is quite easy : you receive market research, R&D, support, product documentation, marketing and first sales if you manage to give social incentives that will make the community more engaged in your project<br />* The setup of a community-centric venture is also seen in its communications and marketing : there's a blog, not a site, and forums where people help each other. Tutorials are made by employees.<br /><br />Take the example of Lego. The brick brand would not develop modern weapons, and thus be cut of 8-9 year old kids who go through their war stage. A community, Brickarms, began to mold modern weapons, and is soon recognized by Lego provided it complies with two measures (no violation of trademark and security check for items not to be eaten by little kids). It's a complementary ecosystem : they product and sell items that would not reach enough volume for Lego to produce. They keep also quitting customers more longer.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the community in the cases shown in Makers are a competitive advantage over cheap and remote labour. This is a brilliant example and story of industries driven by social interest (purpose, passion) rather than merely commercial interests.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I liked that this one had more from the mind of Jack Reacher as opposed to his might overshadowing his brain. Still love the I don't give a f attitude of this character, that is until he gets pissed.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run iz a very fun game I don't recommend this game for little chidren under the age if 6. Although it is not that hard well for me because I am 17. It's not just fun bt it is also challenging. I thing it is a very active game for kids around the age 10 and above, well that was my review on Temple (fun) Run!!!!.
0060254920|5.0|While this award winning children's book is known for it's unique characters and it's wild setting, what stood out to me was it's freedom. Where the Wild Things Are takes you away from the typical scary monster story to a world where you can stop a wild thing in its tracks just by looking it in the eye and you can sail across an ocean and swing from tree limbs all while your parents sleep. The main character Max is sure to inspire young readers to imagine a world of their own where they are queen or king while also emphasizing the importance of home. Even though Max has the time of his life running wild with the wild creatures in this book, at the end of a long day he is still eager to head back home where a warm bowl of soup awaits him.
6305014140|5.0|This was A good movie with good action. this one is not for the kids, it has blood, vilence, nudity, & Rape<br />.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Gorgeous visuals and thought-provoking subject matter. Yes, some questions are left unanswered, but that merely serves to whet the appetite for a sequel. Fans of the Alien series of films especially will revel in seeing the earliest incarnations of the xenomorphs - man, the final shot of this movie gets me every time. Thank you, Sir Ridley, for making this film.
0375842209|5.0|This is a very different book ,even though many books have been written about WWII . Markus Zusak has a brilliant mind ,using words not just to describe scenes , but to go deeply into the emotions of strong characters. I read it quite quickly , then later reread it more slowly ,to savor the poetry of the descriptions .
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best movie I have seen in a while.  If you like this type of movie, you should look into the director's other involvement  such as firefly and serenity.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The story started out great, loved the main characters, but the way it ended made me upset. Nevertheless, very interesting and gripping story.
0345803485|3.0|I heard a lot of good comments about this trilogy so I decided to buy it. The first book I read it in one week, the second one I was kind of bored and took me a little longer, and the third one I just can't wait to finish it because I can't take it anymore.<br />It is not that I didn't like the story overall, but I think it is too repetitive and it becomes boring... same words, same expressions, over and over...<br />I think it could have easily taken two books instead of three for the whole story.<br />I am not one of those persons that can put aside a book once I started reading it so I will finish it.<br />I am almost done with the third one so I hope it surprises me at least in the end.<br />I have never read a book that contained so much explicit sex before so for those interested in learning a little bit more about sex, it could be very interesting!!!<br />Enjoy
B004CLYKMC|5.0|I was eager to read this book given all the hype about it in the media.  I have to say I absolutely loved it!  It was a great perspective into one women's ideas about motherhood, family, and childrearing that I won't soon forget.  I actually admired and agreed with many of her parenting views, but I can see why others, who don't, may not enjoy this book as much as I did.
B0025CS2GU|3.0|In spite of the insipid repeated singing acts. Every possible sexual innuendo was exploited, as well as a number of others involving passing gas. Lots of high technology, and a major threat threatens the world's future. And at the end good wins out over evil, without the violence of the obviously parodied James Bond movie genre.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As per usual, George's storytelling is crackerjack!  I was riveted and left wanting more, which is always the problem with George.  I fear that the next installment won't be for awhile!  Recommended!

B004H4XID6|3.0|This was a very informative read.  I have to say I was expecting to be more riveted by the subject matter, but as with all things that seem too good to be true, so was the case with the art and science of remembering!  I do recommend the book though.
B00007L4OM|3.0|A French detective or so came to Japan for a family business but proved being more effective in anti-Mafia (Yakuza) deeds than local professionals.<br /><br />A comedy of murdering demonstrating funny moments of Japanese culture-of youngsters particularly.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I bought it for my 9 year old daughter. She loves it. I have listened a few times and it sounds good to me as well. I recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This starts out seeming to be so simple but in later screens you need to think ahead.  Was very good to take to th Dr.'s office for my 30 minute wait.
0374203032|5.0|Great book that should be read broadly by the public. Sandel provides the reader with philosophical tools to assess the important policies of today. If everyone were to read this book, our public discourse would be far better off.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|ok.so first the graphics on the ponys are amazing and i watch mlp and i am a pegusister and i just love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very entertaining show. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, Only complaint is that it's only on once a week, lol.
B002NVTSGQ|4.0|but if I did I only got the pilot which was terrific but less than what I thought I was getting
B007HACDLK|4.0|No need to repeat what has already been said about this series.<br /><br />I have enjoyed all of the books in this series.  Alas, like other authors I am fond of, this one seems to be less than its predecessors.  Not bad really but not as sharp or thrilling or organized as the previous books.<br /><br />Having said that I did enjoy the book. I read in something less than 3 nights.  I thought the ending could have used some work.  I won't give any spoilers here but I thought the end could have been a bit more thought out.<br /><br />I will watch for reviews on future Mitch Rapp books before buying.  This one was worth the wait but I'll look for other fans feedback on the next one.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|as all of DeMille's books grabs you at the first page and doesn't let up.  Vintage John Cory.  hard to put down
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|I love this show, however I  must say that the early seasons are the best, now the storyline is a bit muddled and it seems like the show is just going on because it has such a large fan base. I LOVED the first few seasons though so I have bought them on blu ray.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is very User friendly.  Would like to see more hourly details, but this is my go to app for quick weather info.
B008MEM24S|5.0|i started playing and couldnt put my kindle down!! VERY ADDICTIVE!! i would recommend this to anyone! its a great gsme!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A highly credible and intimately personal (but not private) description of a journey from the rational world of the brain surgeon into the world on the other side and back. It's very hard not to believe it - and if you do, how can it fail to change your perception of life - and death?
B000YHG72E|5.0|Perfect Christmas movie for all ages. Adults and children alike--everyone has to see this movie at some point in their lives.
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|Bad Movie, bad acting ... ! Even at $0.99 to rent this I felt is was a wasted dollar ... could this movie franchise be anyworse?  The entire story is in anti-abortion story written by a Mormon ... the Worst!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|how did we ever live without this  seriously one of the best apps ever especially when lyrics play is available
B00159679S|5.0|I have been a Wagner fanatic ever since I was a teen, and this boxed set is the best one ever, and it is a great bargain to boot. Buy this box: you will not be disappointed.<br />This box has all his operas (except for the the early ones: Feen, Liebesverbot, Rienzi; trust me, you will not miss them). Keep in mind that these are all live performances from the annual summer festival in Bayreuth on das Gr&uuml;ner H&uuml;gel. Many of these are legendary, definitive performances that you will be proud to own (I certainly am).<br /><br />With so much material, detailed reviews of each one is not practical here. However, here are important highlights:<br />**Grace Bumbry as Venus in one of the greatest Wagner performances ever<br />**ditto for Jess Thomas as Lohengrin<br />**The greatest Tristan ever recorded<br />**Muscular conducting of the Ring by B&ouml;hm<br />**Levine conducting the second best Parsifal ever with Simon Estes and Peter Hofmann<br /><br />One Fly in the Ointment<br />OK, there is one el stinko: the 1974 Meistersinger led by Varviso. Yuck.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great ap.  I use it on my kindle all of the time. I reccomemend this to friends. and family and also have it on my phone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Husband plays every time he is required to wait for me. Spends hours playing it in doctor's offices and other appointment room.<br />He says it is a lot easier than handling cards. Fast!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent read..Hard to put down. Vince Flynn writes this action packed thriller with great detail as usual.<br /><br /> Mitch Rapp shows a different side of his personality in this latest action packed book.<br /><br />Now I have to wait for Flynn's next book..I have read all of his books so far.  he has become my husband and<br /><br /> my favorite author.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Like to play but have not gotten the swing of it yet. Had longer than month and still have won very few levels. Are there any hints or cheaters pages to help.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is...as the title says, the third time I have watched this series. It is brilliant of course and the Bluray is great. 5 stars all the way.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|not sure I can even understand what to do with this. Had it about 1 month but had few chances to play it. First couple of times I did so bad yet couldn't find a Help section.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Omg it was one of the best 3d movies I have seen 5 stars all the way,Great looking on Panasonic 3D TV.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Had major surgery and then doctor's appointments every week for one year. This game was a life saver from boredom while sitting in waiting rooms.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I did not think I was going to like it but I loved it,It was not at all a comedy as I thought A+++++
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love it...clear and fast recovery.<br /><br />wish I could replay the levels I did lousy on.<br /><br />Only have had it about 1 month but like it better than any I've played on my laptop.
B00005J6T0|5.0|WELL IT IS MADONNA I HAVE ALL HER CDS NOW WHAT CAN I SAY HAIL THE QUEEN OF POP GOT TO LOVE HER.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|i think it is an ok game but wat i have to say is ITS TOO MUCH LIKE BLOCKSTORY GET BLOCKSTORY NOT THIS
B000063V8S|5.0|GREAT DVD SET OF STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION I HAVE ALL THE SETS AND THIS ONE IS BY FAR MY FAV.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is AWESOME I have it on my ipad and my ipod touch it works just great but I really don't get what is the difference of lite and full
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I thought it was well put togeather and a great 3d movie to watch on my Panasonic Plasma TV Buy it you wont regret it.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Watched this with my 5 yr old neice. Some of it was a little scary for her, there is a bear that's a little frightening at the begining and the end of the movie. Other than that it was a very cute movie. Teaches a lesson about daughter/mother relationship.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I have been a fane of brandon sanderson since I first picked up Elantris on a whim while walking through the library. I was facinated by how he creates and explains systems of magic. The Emperor's soul meats the already high bar that his previous writing as set for itself. I just wish it had been longer haha
B004HO6I2E|2.0|I was excited about this movie, but left the theater disappointed. Yes, it has funny parts, but the porn and nudity is unnecessary. Not to mention, I love how the wife with baby twins is a skinny as a rail, wearing size 0 clothes, wow - that's practical. Seriously? I know its just a movie, but still. It's not just a baby, but twins!!!<br /><br />I think the dialogue was funny for the most part. And Jason Bateman makes the movie worth watching, but definitely not worth owning.
B0091REZMW|5.0|good game, good way to past time.  but it never  restores time fast enough. I like playing it anyway. gave 5 stars.
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|Bet me had the same funny tone but was better overall than this. Still worth reading for a light funny well written read.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is the best, and most fun game. You have to get this game because it is really entertaining and it's a fun challenge:)
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Moving the Century Trilogy into its second volume Winter of the World takes the characters introduced in Fall of Giants through the turmoil of the Second World War. Fast moving intense and at times distressing. Follett at his very best. Do read Fall of Giants first as whilst each volume stands on its own to read them in the sequence intended by the author provides an extra understanding. To live through one World War must have been horrific. To live through two unimaginable.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|it took a while for this cd to arrive, but it was protected well and the cd itself is pretty fantastic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played what it needs is...  mobs  1:spider jockeys  2:ghast.  3:snow and iron golem.  idems I know I spelled it wrong.  1:buckets.  And blocks  2:pumkins.  3:potions and brewing stands
B0098460O4|5.0|What treasures they are!!!  Such talent!!!  Love this CD and surely hope more will be coming.  They are very young and yet so professional and accomplished.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Good book but didn't like all the drug and sex references..it wasn't as tasteful and relate able as I thought it'd be!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I saw her on U tube quite by accident as I was browsing and just fell in love with her voice, with her style and with the nice person that she is.  I love to hear her but I also like to watch her sing.  She is lovely and her delivery is quite to my liking.  I will watch for other music by her and I surely hope there is much more of it to come.
B000006YXV|5.0|All the favorites you would expect from Marvin Gaye. Sexy, relaxing. I play it often. Not a disappointment at all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|have a good time uesing this calculator. in ur own hands God Bless you may you share it with pouters tooo
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love it it is so fun there is a bird for each good character and a pig for each bad
B00846REIS|4.0|I read 50 shades of grey and wanted another book like that,,,,this book was great and also carried a good storyline. I always wanted more,,,I cant wait for the next book
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Do NOT judge the movie based on the cover/title. It's a really good movie! I love movies that take historical events and put a modern twist on them. If you enjoy movies with a darker side, then I would definitely recommend watching this movie!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed the story it always keeps me thinking,,,once I read the first book in this series I knew I was hooked. Cant wait for the next book.
B000V63C4Y|4.0|Getz/Gilberto is the definitive bassanova jazz album.  The slow, melodic tempo featuring Getz's relaxed understated saxophone style, and Joao Gilbreto's delicate vocalization make this the perfect album for a lazy Sunday afternoon.  There is a listless elegance to the compositions which makes one feel as though he were listening to a group of Brazilian folk musicians on a Sao Palo beach. The Girl From Impanema,the albums first selection, features Astrud Gilberto's haunting vocal style. Sentiments of longing nostalgia fall from her lips with effortless beauty and interpretive honesty.
