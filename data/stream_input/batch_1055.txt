B003WTE886|5.0|There's no title that could suit best this album. \\"Speak Now\\" is, once again, Taylor speaking her mind out of her own words, beautifully and well put. Amazing how someone can provide a third album which is so in line with the other two previous releases under a great deal of aspects and yet manages to be so pleasant and refreshing. Call it consistency.<br /><br />All songs, regardless of the mood each one has, are country flavored and absent of country themed lyrics, which is nothing new in terms of Taylor Swift. The matters of the heart speak louder and are the main subject in most of the songs. Some of the struggles are sung with some bitterness, and others with an impressive head-on attitude. Surely, variety is here.<br /><br />In previous reviews of other albums, I said that one single listen enough for me to know if the album is good and worthwhile, if it deserves a second chance or it is definitely a throw-off. After listening to it only once, the conclusion is: Speak now and keep speaking for a while, because this voice sounds good.

1401323820|3.0|In the middle of a New York heatwave, a murdered real estate tycoon calls detective Nikki Heat to the case--and along with her comes the intrepid, aggravating journalist Jameson Rook. Heat Wave is almost precisely the book that you would expect it to be. The writing is indulgent and silly without ever going so far in that direction as to be bad. There's some purple prose and some clever quips, and it reads fast and easy. Those clever quips make for entertaining dialog, and characters are caricatured without being flat. The mystery itself is pleasantly unpredictable (and perhaps a smidgen too unsolvable), and while the big reveal is too staged it's nonetheless a satisfying conclusion. In most ways, the book is just solid entertainment--and has no pretensions of being more. It's a just pulpy detective novel, quick and fun, and perfectly satisfying (if unremarkable) in that regard.<br /><br />The book's biggest drawback is that it feels like little more than a novelized episode of Castle. The character names are different and the relationship between Castle and Beckett, i.e. Rook and Heat, is sped and spiced up (and as a result, more indulgent than intriguing--which suits a pulpy crime novel, but misses the core of Castle's appeal), but just about everything and everyone here will be familiar to fans of the show. It's not convincing as Castle's \\"actual\\" novel--it begs length and creative licence, and perhaps a bit more skill, in order to resemble those big, bestselling hardcovers. This feels like a transcription peppered with psuedonyms and wishful thinking (and a sex scene), which is fun--but doesn't fulfill the promised conceit of being a real book by the famous Rick Castle. In that regard the book is a bit of a let down--and since most readers will be drawn by that premise, they should be so warned. But as an entertaining, unremarkable, quick detective story, Heat Wave does deliver. I recommend it moderately: this isn't my preferred genre, and the book doesn't live up to my highest hopes, but it's a fun yarn.highest hopes, but it's a fun yarn.
0061714372|4.0|Nearly 50 years of a heavy metal deity's life encompass the 368 pages inside the novel \\"Mustaine:  A Heavy Metal Memoir\\".  The gritty autobiography begins with his early memories raised in a broken home and ending as a mega millionaire recently releasing his latest \\"album\\" titled \\"[[ASIN:B002C6K7N0 Endgame]]\\".  The stereotypical metal life involving alcohol, drugs, sex, and rehabs repeatedly challenges the angry (or is it passionate) musician.  His anger and jealously, and conversely compassion and self-reflection shines through many times.<br /><br />If you are a Megadeth fan, many of the tales are believable or known.  For the most part I do not imagine a non-metal or Megadeth fan reading and accepting the novel.  While every story has two sides, I lean towards Dave's point of view regarding his former band Metallica.  Years ago I was a Metallica fan and shortly thereafter heard some Megedeth.  When reading the lyrics on Metallica's music, I found Mustaine's name listed on many tracks in addition to hearing many similarities between Megadeth and Metallica tracks.  Mustaine wrote many of the more popular earlier songs Metallica performs.  I consider Mustaine to be the creative foundation for Metallica fame and fortune.  Their initial music has an aggressive and thunderous undertone where I believe the musical peak was the final CD Cliff Burton contributed.  Also realize how poorly Metallica treated bass player Jason Newsted during his tenure.  Imagine if instead of two top metal bands there could have been one Mega-Metallica band featuring Dave Mustaine.  Sadly Dave hurt his chances and members Hetfield and Ulrich were also jerks.<br /><br />I genuinely enjoyed his autobiography.  I'd bet he'd be a very engaging person to speak with sitting beside on a plane trip, assuming other fans didn't annoy him first.  HA!<br /><br />Thank you.

B002E9LP36|5.0|Having a long commute, I have been listening to audiobooks for the past 3 years at the rate of about one a week. This story has far exceeded all the others so far in terms of production and entertainment.<br /><br />I chose this book is because I have a strong interest in how ordinary people lived during World War II. This book describes what it was like to live on occupied Guernsey as told through the perspective of survivors through their correspondence. Most audiobooks use one narrator, but this one uses six, lending distinct voices to the characters. I could see where reading this book might have been a bit onerous, but listening to it was pure enjoyment despite the disturbing content dealing with the sufferings of war.<br /><br />My sincerest compliments to the authors for a charming & educational tale and to those involved with audio version. After all this time, you've inspired me to finally write a review of my own.
0307592839|3.0|I love Jennifer Egan's work. She is so talented and many writers can not hold a candle to her talent. As always I enjoy her narrative and style of expression. She's a great story teller, the problem is by jumping around so much, in terms of plot, it was unfulfilling in some ways. I wanted to know what happens with certain characters. Some chapters would be so entertaining and then they just stop and end and that's it.  It's because she writes so well that she's getting a reduction in stars from me with this rating. Had she only just developed more completely the plot of a few of the characters she introduced us to, who were already so interesting, she'd have five stars.  Also one chapter includes a power point presentation and although, creative, it just doesn't work for a whole chapter in my opinion especially b/c it's dealing with the character she's given the most attention to.    This book is entertaining and not a waste of time at all. It's gets you thinking about getting older, redemption, taking charge of your life, the struggle of life in a larger sense of the word. No one has it easy or perfect, and this introspection  is a result of her writing so effectively. It is worth dealing with the imperfections of this novel.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I was told about this new Blues CD recording by Cindy Lauper. I heard a few samples of her recording, and immediatly ordered a copy.  Although the recording was slightly different from the Blues Standards, I was surprised, and pleased. I listen to her CD often.  This would be an good sellection to be added to anyone's blues library.
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|This was my intro to Black Keys. Really, \\"You're the One\\" was, and it expanded to the rest of the album. I listened to it non-stop for 2 months. EVERY song on here is highly recommended. Also, it's the perfect mix of being mainstream enough to hear it in, say, \\"Chuck\\", but not too mainstream so your friends still think you listen to cool, obscure bands.      Listen to the previews, and if your ears are not blown off the sides of your head, then you might not like this. In that case, go listen to Jay-Z and Justin Bieber. Those who do have good taste in music will be downloading this album with gaping holes where their ears used to be.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I would apologize first because this is not the right place to vent out my frustration. But here goes, I own the paperback version of this book (bought it 10 years ago), I think its great and if you are a US citizen/resident go ahead download it and have fun reading it. I have great difficulty understanding why Amazon charges 2.00$(this is not the price of delivery as I have the WiFi only Kindle and yeah, the book is out of copyright in my country(India) as well) for this ebook as well as several other out of copyright books to non - US citizens. It is available for free on Gutenberg, but if I have to download all classic ebooks from Gutenberg I could have as well bought any other ebook reader and not the Kindle. I feel cheated as before ordering my kindle, I saw Jeff Bezos interview with Charlie Rose(http://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/mYYH89PLHLMUW/ref=ent_fb_link?pf_rd_p=1275764362&pf_rd_s=center-26&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B002Y27P3M&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1D91A9WQWAM277VR4H80) in which he speaks about the free classics as well as Amazon's customer focus. I guess ripping off your international customers, who incidentally pay more for the Kindle(hell, I payed around 200 USD for my WiFi only device) really shows your wonderful customer orientation.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This movie, (considered a comedy but is also a beautiful love story)based on Truman Capote's classic novel, not only has beautiful color, and pretty scenes around New York, but depicts a beautiful, warm story about a confused, young girl (who lives for nothing but donning herself with a black party gown and a large, black, wide brim fashionable hat and going window-shopping at Tiffany's with her \\"breakfast\\" of a small cup of coffee and two doughnuts) who also cannot face reality and thus lives in her own private world which to her is filled with nothing but happiness. She is loved by struggling writer Paul Varjak; he not only falls in love with her, but he loves her and becomes strongly concerned about her, so much so that he breaks off his indiscreet affair with a married lady, an interior decorator who, in one sense, uses him. (The versatile Patricia Neal plays the part of the interior designer perfectly.)  This is quite a successful directing feat for Blake Edwards, and Henry Mancini provides a beautiful music score for this classic movie.  Audrey Hepburn portrays so well the beautiful, mixed-up Holly Golightly, originally a girl who has run away from a marriage with a doctor from Tulip, Texas;Buddy Ebsen does a good turn in this minor role as the doctor. She encounters Paul Varjak (played so well by George Peppard) and their romance shortly begins. Without ever asking questions about her, he sees perfectly that she is in actuality not happy and, again, mixed-up. Because Holly senses love from him, she does believe that he strongly cares about her and genuinely wants to help her. The ending is sad yet very happy. I have never become jaded from watching this wonderful movie.
B000001ZS8|5.0|There was a phase in the first part of the 80ies when digital technologies where new or expected to become available very soon, and some musicians were in a mood for experimentation with idealistic utopias mapping out the new territories while still on a superstar budget.    I remember hating Zoolook when it first came out - a lot!  My expecations were set by Jarre's dreamy earlier works of Oxygene, Equinoxe, Magnetic Fields as well as the Concerts in China that were resonating daily through my teenage nursery evoking dreams of distant planets, space stations, nuclear wastelands and massive ocean waves hitting distant shores.    Unlike these earlier efforts which featured Jarre, Jarre and Jarre as composer, performer, producer, etc., Zoolook features guest musicians - people actually making music *together*... also, *real drums!!!*  People were probably sweating making this music. Unacceptable! :)    In retrospect, this shift in Jarre's oevre seems to have been foretold by the live setup used e.g. on Concerts in China: The tracks Souvenir of China and Night in Shanghai for example seem more related to Zoolook than to his earlier albums with an attitude much more clear cut and performance-oriented.  The album also represents a moment in Jarre's career when he was closest to contemporaries such as Peter Gabriel/David Byrne/Brian Eno (e.g. My Life in the Bush of Ghosts). Laurie Anderson even appears as vocalist on \\"Diva\\", being very much herself.  But Zoolook still occupies a very unique niche.    Next to Jarre's sound-experimentalism, which seems transposed from the warm and spacey analog sounds of his earlier albums into the transparent clarity of the digital, the album's conceptual identity is created by speech samples from a large variety of different languages, edited and shortened to effectively efface the specific word or language they originated from.  What remains are anonymous references to the universal human activity of uttering syllables - a kind of meta language understood (or \\"not understood\\") by every human being in a similar way.    Especially on the A-side which features the two long-form ear trips Ethnicolor and Diva, this works quite well.  The B-side features shorter \\"pop format\\" tracks that do display Jarre's tendency towards ultra-simplified \\"sequel of the chicken dance\\" melodies, but all of them have a unique atmosphere, interesting twist or funkiness to them that make them worthwhile and unlike anything else.    If you want to know what the Fairlight CMI meant to pop music, I think this is the Album where it is used in the most powerful way.  Whether you are going to love this album or are annoyed by it is a question of taste of course - it seems unquestionable that it will survive as a unique artifact of its era. Inimitable, unremixable, matchless.  In retrospect, it became my favourite Album of Jean-Michel Jarre.   But I will also never forget the first three Albums (Oxygene, Equinoxe and the A-side of Magnetic Fields).
0460110241|4.0|I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her.  Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet.  Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.       The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters.  For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go.  Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal.  Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|I purchased this DVD because I really liked the movie. However, beyond simply liking the movie, I usually buy a DVD for what we don't see in the movie, such as the making of the movie, star and director commentary, deleted scenes etc. This DVD came with no extra features, and this was very disappointing to me. I'm guessing that the DVD will be re-released soon as a special edition and it will contain all of the features I thought I was getting this time around.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I highly recommend this headset... with a catch. You should definitely also get the [[ASIN:B003O0KICS Ear Force DSS 7.1 Channel Dolby Surround Sound Processor]] that Turtle Beach also makes, otherwise the connection methods to your system seem quite clumsy.  I haven't even bothered to try the headphones by itself, they sound so great together.<br />  One morning I woke up earlier than everybody else in the house and was going to play with some friends online.  I put these on in the living room and the EXPANDER feature on these headphones tricked me into thinking sound was still coming out of the home theater speakers.  You really get a sense of space with these and totally catch all the sounds you probably miss if you're accustomed to playing off TV or any other speaker system that isn't a proper home theater setup.<br />  As for looks and feel, compared to some of the higher-end music headphones I have (Beats, Technics, Pioneer), these look a little tacky with the flat glossy ear cups and the company branding, especially the company emblem.  Being all black makes it a little better.  The headphones feel a lot lighter than I expected, which would possibly equate to feeling cheap to some people.  The headband is pretty soft and flexible, and the swiveling ear cups feel really loose, BUT when you put them on your head, all these characteristics either don't matter or only help to make the headphones sit on your head as comfortably and easily as possible.  I feel they're sturdy enough to withstand any punishment you can deal throwing them about your desk, table or floor, but I'd exercise caution if you are going to be stuffing them into a bag on the go.<br />  In all, I think this headset is a great deal for it's price and an even greater solution if you get the DSS with it.  If you wanted anything more than these offer around this price, you'll have to put up probably at least twice the money.  Again, this is a highly recommended headset, and especially so if you have more than just one of the systems this headset supports (PS3, XBox 360, PC).  Also, before I made my decision, I was comparing these against the [[ASIN:B0017IUFAE Tritton AX Pro Dolby Digital Precision Gaming Headset]] but ultimately found the PX21 + DSS combo much more convenient and tidy package, and the simulated surround the pair produce is quite remarkable.ou have more than just one of the systems this headset supports (PS3, XBox 360, PC).

B0048IMZMG|5.0|I bought this today - after previewing the tracks. I did not expect to like it as much as I do! I can't say I liked her Fearless cd as much as her debut, but this album is much better in my opinion.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I went to my local wal-mart at midnight to get this. This is an Enchanted album and you can instantly tell that her vocal talent has changed in a good way, she is very mature, and proving it. I won't list all songs, but the ones that are amazing, the whole cd is, but these are the top one's for me  Mine- we all know this song and love it  Sparks fly- Good beat, and lyrics this song is begging for radio, or music video status.  Back to December- good slow sad love song. Another radio begger  Enchanted- this song starts out slow and at first thought you may think boring, but give this a chance it gets real good. It's 7 seconds shy of 6 min, but it's good.  Haunted- A good rock beat song, but this is one song that shows her voice has changed  Long live- She closes the album with a bang, a good song  overall not a bad song on here, I can put this in and not skip any song.

B003WTE886|5.0|I went to my local wal-mart at midnight to pick this up. This is a good album, finally someone who sings and wears clothes. I believe when people hear this album they will see a change in Taylor's voice, she has matured in vocal ability. I won't list a review on every song, but some of the ones I find good. We all know Mine, so I won't speak on it. The song sparks fly, is begging for a radio play, and could easily be a CMT music video. Back to december is such a beautiful song, this could easily be another radio played or video. Enchanted is good as well it talks about meeting someone, and instantly being attached and enchanted. How many of us has this happened to. Hauted, has a rock theme,  but this song is simply put amazing. At the end of the song Taylor will prove that her vocal talent has improved. And the final song long live. Is a perfect way for the cd to end. All these songs I mentioned, could so easily and simply be radio as well as music video hits. This cd could easily serve her for years to come, if she is wise and chooses the right hits to show. I'm putting my money on this now, can anyone say platnum

I could complain about the lack of sleeve notes, information and lyrics, but I won't. I could complain about the changed cover (which has rendered the original striking image as pale and non-descript) but I won't. After all, it's the quality of the contents that are important - and that's what I do wish to complain about.<br /><br />Although the remastering itself seems fine in terms of sound quality, the contents of this album have been edited and altered from the original, with no notice or reasons given. The middle of \\"Ouija Board\\" has been cut out, thereby losing the structure and integrity of the song. It's always been one of my favourite songs on the album, and now the whole payoff/punchline is inexplicably gone! This is revisionism as vandalism, and constitutes unforgivable meddling with the integrity of the original song and album. The bone-headed decision to blend the end of one song into the beginning of the next is also a serious offence, demonstrating contempt for the integrity of the original.<br /><br />No number of \\"Bonus tracks\\" on a reissue will make up for losing or altering the original!<br /><br />The best options here are to stick with the original CD or singles or, better still, get [[ASIN:B002MVS188 Hmv/Parlophone Singles '88-'95 (3 CD Set)]].

As if by wanting to make it \\"world-readable for almost anyone\\", authors choose to end it where it becomes fascinating.

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|This movie has just become one of my favorite films of all time after my first viewing. Why? Because of its imaginative surrealism, hard-hitting subject matter, and the always lovable music by Pink Floyd. I never gotten into the band's music, but once I finished watching this movie, it made me become a fan. Anyway, the movie is tells the story of a man named Pink and how his past experiences with different people, places, & things have affected his views of the real world. The plot sometimes references experiences from the band members (for example, Roger Waters' father died during WWII). The best parts about this movie, however, is the symbolism that surrounds the images and music. From the marching hammers to the infamous meat grinder during the \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" sequence, you'll never see this much symbolism in the films of today. Plus, the stunning animation by Gerald Scarfe is shockingly beautiful.<br /><br />The Wall is almost like a Kubrick film: it's uniquely crafted and has a hypnotic quality attached to it. A lot of people say that you should watch this while either drunk or high. I saw it while sober and I don't see how you'd be able to see it any other way. I suggest that you watch it without any drugs or alcohol whatsoever, because you'll find it more awesome that way. The Wall is a great film, and I'm glad that I've seen it now.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5/10

B003VIW8DU|5.0|This is a review of Bryan Ferry \\"Olympia\\" CD/DVD Deluxe Edition.  This review is meant to summarize the Deluxe Edition of the album.  Hope it helps you decide which edition to get.  It doesn't do a track by track analysis because that is really for the listener to experience.  But, I will tell you the song titled \\"BF Bass\\" basically means Bryan Ferry Bass (just in case you were wondering...I was)...j/k.  Now as far as the deluxe edition is concerned: the content is packaged in a nice case with binding similar to a book.  The book is a hardcover with a slipcase on the front and back that is glued to the book.  Certain to create nice little scuff marks on the discs during frequent use.  You may need to bring your own jewel cases to this set.  A good example that springs to mind (as far as the \\"book\\" presentation) would be the recent Kylie Minogue Deluxe edition of \\"Aprodite.\\"  Inside the book contains the lyrics to the songs, pictures of Kate Moss, a brief two page description of the album that recounts Ferry past/present/future written by Richard Williams (I wasn't too big on the style this was written but whatever, some will think it is cool, it kinda is), and a nice photo of Bryan Ferry by Anton Corbijn.  The DVD contained is Region Free NTSC that provides an excellent 27 minute behind the scenes of the making of the album.  Shows the cast that made this album come to life.  This album has a nice amount guest stars.  For those interested in buying this because of guest stars on the DVD.  The DVD does show David Gilmour but, no interview.  Flea is shown and a very brief interview.  Brian Eno is talked about but, not shown or interviewed. Steve Nieve is talked about but not seen.  Good footage and interview snippets of Nile Rodgers and Jake Shears and Babydaddy. A brief interview of Groove Armada. Phil Manzanera is on many songs but, not on the DVD same with Dave Stewart. Nice interview of producer Johnson Somerset. Lots of Bryan Ferry interview and footage.  Also anice tribute to guitar player David Williams.  Also nice footage of young guitar player Oliver Thompson (whom I wasn't famalair with) and Bryan Ferry's son Tara on drums with Andy Newmark.  The DVD is directed by Ferry's other son Isaac Ferry.  All in all the DVD is shot with beautiful lighting and really brings the album to life.  Also included is the video for \\"You Can Dance.\\"    Now for the music aspect.  It must be known there is a more expensive version of this album coming out at the beginning of November called \\"The Immersion Edition,\\" with a bigger book and an extra disc of six remixes and one instrumental.  So yeah, this package does lack the remixes but, that set is almost as much as a cheap suit.  The CD included in this package is amazing.  The music is pure Bryan Ferry.  I liked \\"Frantic\\" but this is no \\"Frantic-era\\" Ferry.  This album reminds me of the Bryan Ferry of the Avalon-Boys and Girls era.  Words don't do the music justice but, it sounds like the Bryan Ferry of the 80's sting by a bumble-bee of 2010.  Every song on this album is really incredible.  It's not necessarily the type of album to sample on sound snippets but, really needs to be experienced in full.  The regular CD ends with a song called \\"Tender is the Night\\" which is an excellent conclusion to the album and really acts a dimly lit candle burning out beautifully.  The Deluxe edition CD has two bonus tracks: a John Lennon cover of \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" which is sung and arranged wonderfully and a Smiley Lewis cover (Elvis often sang live) of \\"One Night\\" which is sung well too.  Both of these songs would have fit well during the album perhaps they were left off to focus more on the Ferry-penned material.  The regular CD already has one excellent cover of the Traffic song \\"No Face No Name No Number\\" and a cover of the Tim Buckley song \\"Song to the Siren.\\"  The \\"Song to the Siren\\" bears little resemblence to the Tim Buckley original nor the This Mortal Coil cover.  It sounds like if \\"Song to the Siren\\" was thrown into the Avalon-era Roxy Music Bizarro time warp complete but this time with Brian Eno on keyboards and even whale noises.    For the extra few dollars I highly recommend this package.  The DVD is top notch (and works on US DVD players) the two extra tracks are not essential to the album but, a nice touch.  If you have never liked the style of Bryan Ferry solo or Avalon-era Roxy I don't think you'll be liking this CD.  If you only like early experimental Roxy Music you may not be too big on this CD.  I was disappointed when I first heard he was making another solo album and not another Roxy Music album.  My feelings have since changed because I think this is probably the best CD he has put out post Roxy and one of the coolest CD's of 2010 thus far. Buy it if want something just plain cool.
B0043X7WLA|3.0|After repeated listenings, I can say that Adz is neither as bad as I thought nor as good as I hoped.  Another reviewer described it as \\"undisciplined,\\" and I totally agree.  This album combines every sonic technique Sufjan has ever used, from the woodwind trills of \\"A Sun Came\\" to the electronica of \\"Rabbit\\" to the toy marching band of \\"Michigan\\" and \\"Illinois\\" to the folk of \\"Seven Swans\\" to the drum-heavy ten minute version of \\"You Are the Blood,\\" which Sufjan offered on the \\"Dark is the Night\\" compilation album in 2009.  That track is not on Adz, but it captures the kitchen sink spirit of Adz.  It's as if Sufjan just discovered a TR-808 drum pad and doesn't know how to control it.  As a result, Adz's sci-fi drum tracks are often hideously overbearing, like a soup with far too much pepper in it.  The vocals are often pitched in an uncomfortable, pinched part of his range which reverb cannot entirely obscure.    If the music has been layered too much, the lyrics seem underbaked.  The track \\"I Want to Be Well\\" consists mainly of a looped vulgarity.  \\"Impossible Soul\\" has a three minute segment that repeats a single line over and over and over.  Gone are story-songs like \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" and character sketches like \\"The Mistress Witch of McClure\\" or \\"Romulus.\\"  Instead Adz has romantic songs, but the references are so veiled and vague that they fail to paint word pictures for the listener the way his older work often did. Sexual ambiguities abound as usual, with the opening track confessing, \\"I think of you as my brother\\" and the closing track declaring, \\"Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure.\\"  Song titles are short and overly obvious, almost as if he's specifically trying to deflate expectations of what we should expect from him.    That said, some decent songs lurk underneath the clutter.  The opener \\"Futile Devices\\" shows that Sufjan still knows perfectly well how to craft a gorgeous acoustic ballad.  \\"Vesuvius\\" captures the _Illinois_  gang vocal spirit inside a lyric about infatuation.  The wall of vocals on \\"All For Myself\\" adds challenging dissonance to what's otherwise a gentle piano track.  Even the monstrous 25 minute \\"Impossible Soul\\" is really a suite of connected songs, with the opening and closing minutes comprising catchy tracks that can be easily isolated through MP3 editors today.
0316098337|3.0|While the plot in \\"Room\\" is unusual and the writing at times quite good it is overall a disappointment because of its unbelievable sense of place.  Two thirds of the way through, I realized it was meant to be set in the United States.  Yet, it was full of British words and terms - or, I suppose, Irish terms:  e.g. \\"stabilizers\\" for training wheels or a nurse saying \\"Good Lad\\" to Jack for a job well done.  There was no sense of reality in the way Ma and Jack were handled post rescue.  Did the author even research how these victims would be handled in the U.S.?   The Clinic sounded like something out a BBC series as did the Independent living apartment. It would be lovely to think that the victims would be so generously treated here but I fear that, as a rule, they are not.  It was well imagined but with holes: would a woman like Ma, so devoted to teaching Jack math and science and expanding his universe as best she could,  allow him to continue in his idiosyncratic grammar without EVER teaching him correct usage?  I am not sorry I read this book, if a little irritated at the sloppiness.  It is NOT, however, Booker material.
B003WTE886|5.0|Okay, I grew up with and still listen to hard rock: Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Faith No More, Iron Maiden, Testament, etc. Boy, have my tastes changed over the years! I still listen to all that, but now I've broadened my horizon. I've liked Taylor's music ever since Love Story. You Belong With Me caught my attention second. Downloaded both songs off Itunes and listened to them quite a bit. Well, I decided to try out Taylor's new CD. And I'm quite happy with it. I'm not a country music fan but her music doesn't really sound like country to me (save maybe a couple songs). Anyway, below is my take on all the new songs on Speak Now<br /><br />MINE is somewhat remiscent of You Belong with Me/Love Story in terms of rythum/pace. Pretty catchy. Can definitely see this song being radio played and music videoed.<br /><br />SPARKS FLY<br />Also reminecsent of Love Story, YBWM. I can imagine this song being played on a movie. Pretty decent song<br /><br />BACK TO DECEMBER<br />AMAZING SONG! Cool chorus, great, soothing, perfect melody. Slow-paced. Kind of song to move you, make you feel good.<br /><br />SPEAK NOW Good beat, but nothing real special IMO. She does some neat things with her voice in this though. Average/below average song<br /><br />DEAR JOHN slow song. It's okay. Not much for me. Doesn't seem to move me much, personally.<br /><br />MEAN this one definitely sounds country, but it's pretty cool.  I like the lyrics. Average song.<br /><br />THE STORY OF US not much to this one, IMO. Not much of a change in beat/melody. Feels kind of flat to me. Just my opinion, though.<br /><br />NEVER GROW UP this one is very slow, mostly just guitar/Taylor singing sweetly. I really enjoy the lyrics on this one. Pretty song. Fairy-tale/music box type of song (if that makes sense). Above average to me.<br /><br />ENCHANTED starts slow. Builds into a rock song. Slows/goes fast again. Good changes in pace. Her voice sounds great here. Definitely music video material/radio song here.<br /><br />BETTER THAN REVENGE pure fast-paced rock song. Sounds, to me, kind of like an Avril Lavgine song. That's the best way I can explain it. Okay song/not great, not terrible<br /><br />INNOCENT!!!!!! downright best song on this whole album IMO. I LOVE this track. Taylor's voice her is beautiful and angelic. Lyrics perfect, very soothing, slow sounding, but VERY meaningful and heartfelt. This song will be played on my Ipod A LOT. This song is where she really shines.<br /><br />HAUNTED starts fast, sounds pretty darn good. Another radio/music video song. Changes the pitch of her voice a lot in this one. This also sounds like an Avril song. I really hate to compare the two, because they're completely different and both talented. (I like Taylor better though :)<br /><br />LAST KISS easy-going, simple-sounding song. Could be a little more to it. Slightly one-dimensional to me. Surely not a BAD song or anything, though.<br /><br />LONG LIVE ... and another music video/radio song. The music/singing before the chorus deliberately builds, then boom - the songs explodes into a rock song. between good-great song.<br /><br />-These are just my opinions, of course. Doesn't mean any of them are true. Still, I highly recommend this album if you like Taylor Swift. I can't under emphasize the songs Back to December and Innocent enough. There are several good and great songs on this album, but these two stick out for me. So go out and buy it! I promise you won't be dissapointed.an Avril Lavgine song.

0307454541|5.0|I would like to begin by expressing my extreme disappointment that Stieg Larsson died in 2004... but he has left a legacy of literary genius.<br /><br />I am trying very hard to suppress my excitement and pure love of his writing but it's just more than I can stifle.  Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesting, arresting, perplexing, engrossing, and most entertaining character I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  She is a melting pot of so many personality factors that it boggles my mind how Larsson was able to consistently build her character.<br /><br />The best comment I can make is that this initial offering of the trilogy is quite an appetizer for what is to follow.  I had just finished this book and went immediately to my book shelf to continue the saga immediately with the second offering.  The ending to this book is nothing less than brilliant and whets the appetite for another smorgasbord of Blomkvist's and Salander's fantastic adventures.<br /><br />Recently I read that a 4th book will eventually be released and it came from Stieg Larsson's longtime lover who refused any compensation.  Apparently Larsson's father and brother have offered her very generous amounts of money gained from the sale of the first three books...but she has so far rejected them.  But at least she's surrendered the only manuscript in existence of the 4th book that he reportedly felt was the best of the series.  Santa, are you listening to me when I say...WOOOHOOO! ?<br /><br />I have not been this excited by an author for decades.  I've ready many entertaining and satisfying books but aside from John Steinbeck's novels, I find Mr. Larsson's writing totally captivating and masterfully crafted.<br /><br />I'm on the 2nd book and will undoubtedly go right to the 3rd at the finish of the 2nd.  Then the long period of waiting and anticipation begins until the publishing of the finale.  Stieg Larsson has left the literary world quite a legacy that I truly believe will be required reading in high schools and colleges that feature outstanding productions.  I feel cheated already in knowing there will be no more...but I'm sure I will re-read these books several times.  Yes he IS a genius in my opinion.  I dare you to not agree.  Put on a pot of coffee and join Mr. Larsson in his world of intrigue and complexity and be happy that you've read some of the most outstanding literature offered in decades.lleges that feature outstanding productions.

I am an avid reader and almost never stop reading a book in the middle, but I had to put this one down as it just could not hold my interest. I found the story to be terribly drawn out and extremely dull.  I kept waiting for something to happen but the story just droned on.  There are far too many good books out there for me to waste another minute with this boring saga.

Brilliant, ground-breaking episodes like \\"Contemporary American Poultry\\" and \\"Modern Warfare\\" are the highlights of this DVD, but there isn't a bad episode on the disc.  Everyone of the exceeds the standard of any other sitcom out there.    The show is so good, it's bound to be cancelled.    The DVD stands up to repeated viewings as well, with the episodes becoming even more entertaining after watching it several times.    Also, there are plenty of DVD extras.
159448385X|5.0|I have no idea why I waited so long to read this book. I have a tendency to avoid things that are too popular at a time, as this book did. But now, a few years later, after reading this, I can appreciate why it was so popular.    The book is about two women in Afghanistan who lead different lives until they met. Not only do we see the devastations war has wrought in the country, but we also see into the lives of those who suffered through it all. The people who were lucky to survive but at the same time losing all those they cared for. The friendship these two women develop is nothing short of amazing. It reminds me that while not everything in this life can have a happy ending, that there is always hope, and we as humans have the strength to live through the hardest adversities life can throw at us.     Hosseini's writing is simple, yet very catching. The end of the book definitely made me shed tears and sniffles. It was hard not to cry as I read this book. After I read the book, I felt like my emotions have been drained dry. I'd love to read this book again, but I don't think I can even muster enough strength to read this again. But maybe, sometime in the future, I will pick this up again, and enjoy it as thoroughly as I did this time around.
6305252521|5.0|This movie reminds me of the observation that comedians are often the best straight actors.  It is comedians who risk \\"dying\\" on stage every time they step up to the plate--so they have to be pretty good from the get go.  What Jim Carrey does in this movie reminds me of Jerry Lewis' straight role in [[ASIN:B00006RCNV The King of Comedy]].<br /><br />The other thing that I loved about this movie was Natasha Mcelhone as the errant extra who dares to attempt a real relationship with our captive hero.  What Natasha does with her expressive eyes is almost unbelievable!  Her looks of longing alone go far beyond anything else I have ever seen on screen.  At the appropriate moment her eyes also express profound joy and hope--and that's when she's only watching TV!

Say all you want about how her voice isn't powerful enough, but this girl has a talent for writing, and I quite like her voice. She never claimed to be the next Aretha, she just wants to write damn good songs, and that's what she does with \\"Speak Now.\\"

B003YK42LQ|4.0|I'm not a diehard KOL fan. Although I've been aware of KOL ever since they came onto the scene with their debut and before they blew up, despite a few songs that sparked, they just never caught fire with me. Therefore, I'm not biased or carrying the torch for the sound of their early albums and the baggage that goes along with it when a band starts to evolve. I'm not even biased towards the sound of their last album. Honestly, when they started to get all that buzz for \\"Sex on Fire\\" and \\"Use Somebody\\" I thought, OK, time to give them another listen. For me, the first half of OBTN was the making of a classic, but the second half fell flat and kept me ambivalent about KOL. Upon my first listen halfway through \\"Come Around Sundown\\" I felt I had again fallen prey to the buzz. The first half seemed clearly tailored for fans picked up by the last album, but, except for Radioactive, sounded like leftover B-Sides. However, I kept listening. The new album really didn't get interesting to me until the second half kicks off with \\"Back Down South.\\" I think its the best song on the album and most successfully combines their early southern rootsy sound to their recent arena-ready sound. I love how \\"Back Down South\\" would be a total front porch southern jam with its fiddle and slide guitar if not for the U2 BAD-esque bass and drum part thumping in the background. Speaking of U2, let me be the first to say that if I hear one more band being touted as \\"the next U2\\" I'm going to let out an arena-sized scream! Let U2 be U2 and KOL, or any other band, find their own sound without the weight and hype of the U2 tag. Luckily, unlike Coldplay, KOL doesn't jump at the chance to take on the U2 mantle and be something they're not. Sure, there are flashes of U2 and some Edge-like guitar playing here and there. However, I hear more of a marriage of KOL's southern twang and influences of Johnny Greenwood (Radiohead)and the Pixies on this album. The second half of the album really comes togetherand rocks and simmers right to the end. The rhythms and melodys are really tight while still giving the songs room to breathe and space so you can really hear the intruments and vocals playing off each other. The songs have a looseness and classic laid-back feel that flows well. This album seems to be more of a lesson in subtlety (something U2 has lacked since The Joshua Tree) as compared with their previous albums which I believe is more interesting and rewarding with each listen. Also, with subsequent listens I have come to enjoy the contrasts of the first half of the album as well. \\"Radioactive\\" is the best rocker on the album and \\"Mary\\" is a lot of fun with its doo-wop vocals and overdriven guitars reminding me of Teenage Fanclub from years ago. The only song that really falls flat and stalls the album for me is \\"The Face\\" which seems like a dumbed down couples-skate power ballad, forced and calculated to elicit high school makeouts and slow mirrorball dancing(It will probably be the biggest single). There may not be a song as classic as \\"Use Somebody\\" or \\"Sex on Fire\\" that screams to be heard and breaks down the barriers to rock music being heard on pop radio stations these days. But that's OK, I'm burned out on those songs anyway! As a whole, I think this is a better album then their last. It challenges fans both old and new. Taken alone, as I essentially took it, its a good, maybe even great rock album and that's OK in my book. P.S. I wouldn't spring for the \\"Deluxe Version.\\" Unless you're a diehard fan, save your money. You're not missing out on anything.

B003WTE886|3.0|I was a bit reluctant to invest in this album before I heard it.  Yes, I own Ms. Swift's two previous albums, and I enjoy them, in a \\"this is just so catchy I can't help singing along\\" sort of way.  But I knew I'd get bored by track 3 if this album was a rehashing of the first two. Happily, it isn't. Taylor maintains the essentials of her success: catchy melodies, vivid stories of young love and growing up.  Yet she stretches those elements toward maturity, exploring a more rock-based style and deepening her lyrical creativity with some truly enjoyable turns of phrase.<br /><br />The pop/rock seasoning of the album is done to best effect on the almost anthemic, string-tinged \\"Haunted,\\" the leisurely lilting of the 60's-tempo title track (the lyrics of which made me laugh out loud on the first listen), and the urgent, nonstop \\"Story of Us.\\"  Other highlights include the infectious chorus of \\"Sparks Fly\\" (which I'm calling as the next radio hit) and the old-time-folksy harmonies and bluegrass instrumentation of \\"Mean.\\"  I also really like the swelling idealism of \\"Long Live,\\" though it begs for a key change toward the end and never gets one.<br /><br />For me, fillers include \\"Never Grow Up,\\" \\"Innocent,\\" and \\"Enchanted,\\" though they appear to be favorites for other listeners.  Also, and this is a big \\"also\\" for me personally--the album is too long.  Eight of the fourteen tracks last substantially longer than four minutes, and five of those hit five minutes.  Somebody needs to advise Ms. Swift to sing her choruses a few fewer times.<br /><br />On the whole, this album is a pop pleasure and quite surpassed my expectations.  It has left me looking forward to the future musical evolution of Taylor Swift. 3.5/5 stars.
B0045QF6FE|5.0|After hearing Andsnes' fabulous recording of the first two Rachmaninov concertos ([[ASIN:B000B63IEI Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2]]), I knew this recording was sure to be outstanding.  And it was.  Andsnes, probably more than any other pianist, has given Rachmaninov an approach that is entirely devoid of sentimentality.  But he hasn't left us with dry, tasteless music.  There is a tremendous amount of emotion that will put you on the edge of your seat.  We hear power and passion one moment, and melancholy and retrospection the next.  While some pianists will bring out more outward show, no one can match Andsnes in making music that is deeply inward in nature.  The music spills from the keys in a very subtle, but natural way.  Andsnes brings out incredible detail that is fascinating.  The only setback is the recording quality.  It picks up excessive breathing, presumably from Pappano.  And while Andsnes' tone is captured wonderfully, the LSO's tone comes across as lacking some depth.  Still, the music more than makes up for these shortcomings and the recording sound is never too distracting.<br /><br />When I heard that Andsnes had a new recording of the Rachmaninov 3rd coming out, I couldn't wait.  I had greatly enjoyed his recording of this piece from when he was still in his twenties.  It's probably no exaggeration to say that I have listened to his earlier recording hundreds of times - I love it.  But his new recording, well, it's almost unbearably good.  His old recording pales in comparison.  All the youthfulness is still there, but there's a new sense of maturity.  Andsnes' technique is even stronger than before, but he also has a whole lot more to say.  In the first movement's opening poetic theme, Andsnes gives us tremendous grace and lyricism; the lovely theme speaks for itself.  The LSO's accompaniment is gorgeous; Pappano takes full advantage of their deep, rich tone.  And then when the simple theme gives way to running figures, Andsnes plays with an ease that only a great master can afford.  I listened to this rendition for the first time outside while taking in the beauty of the fall colors around me.  The music couldn't have fit in better.  While Andsnes' playing gives us powerful climaxes, one never loses the ever-present autumnal feel.  The cadenza (Andsnes sticks with the more powerful, dramatic version) shows Andsnes at his technical height - it's flawless.  But the music never sounds harsh.  It's powerful, yes, but not harsh or severe.  In the second movement, Pappano leads the LSO in a resigned interpretation of the strongly melancholy opening theme.  When Andsnes enters, it is with gripping emotion.  Pappano and the LSO interact with Andsnes to create an atmosphere that borders on being tense, but without lapsing into sentimentality.  After a particularly good closing in the second movement, we are launched into the Finale.  Yes, launched.  One could not possibly wish for a more controlled, yet thrilling account of this roof-raising movement.  In the more dreamy middle section in E flat, Andsnes and Pappano pull out wonderful grace and beauty.  The lyricism we hear is ravishing.  And when we come back to the passion and drama, Andsnes and the LSO reach their zenith.  The passage leading up to the closing major section will have most listeners holding on to the edge of their seats.  This masterpiece, possibly Rachmaninov's greatest, comes to a brilliantly triumphant conclusion.<br /><br />No one needs to be told that the 4th Concerto hasn't achieved the fame the other 3 concertos have.  But with the marvelous performance of it that we hear on this CD, one is left wondering why we don't hear it more often.  Andsnes' laid-back approach comes in especially handy here - it's all too easy to make this concerto seem unrestrained or even vulgar.  Pappano and the LSO likewise keep up the good work they began in the 3rd.  The soloist and orchestra interact in an intimate way throughout.  This concerto often takes advantage of the great effect of having an orchestral soloist to partner with the pianist.  These passages are particularly touching.  The music often becomes so beautiful that it is easy to forget that this is not one of the more popular concertos.<br /><br />In closing, this album is sure to please.  Pappano and the LSO are as brilliant as ever.  And Andsnes' playing puts him near the top of the list of great pianists.  I consider it no exaggeration to say that if his talent continues to grow at the rate it has been, he'll be nearly unanimously recognized as the greatest pianist alive in the next twenty years.  So unless you want to miss out on the treasure of a lifetime, you'll be buying this album.  Bravo, Andsnes!ge of the great effect of having an orchestral soloist to partner with the pianist.

Spanning more than a century, and four generations, jumping different periods of time, through notebooks, scrapbooks, casting so dim and shivering light over the darkness of mistery, reminding me of Wuhering Heights.  These are the resources of a great writer,who entwines a narration for adults with stories for children. A deep meaning to the desolate child hidden in an old woman. A novel which delves into disturbing, unsettling female characters. Also an allegory of the creative process. For creation implies the act of abandoning, of surrendering the  created creature, therefore a loss.

1593080220|2.0|EM Forester was a gay, upper middle class Oxbridge graduate that lived in the Edwardian era.  That is blatantly obvious in every word of his writing.  This book, its story, and the characters make no emotional connection to the reader.  I was thoroughly bored the entire time I was reading this.  Also the redeemable characters are destroyed in the story and the \\"heroes\\" are horrible people.  I could barely stand it.

B003EYVXYG|1.0|We are Romero fans.<br />I should clarify that to say we are fans of the first three (3) \\"DEAD\\" series of Zombie movies.<br /><br />Since then, each new Zombie treatment from Romero has been worse and worse.<br /><br />With this film, even Romero's usual commentary about mankind and society seems off base.<br /><br />Maybe he has lost touch, but not only is the film bad, but his attempt at a deeper meaning misses the mark here also.<br /><br />The acting is bad. The story is silly. The effects are poor. The message is flawed. The zombie attacks are stiff.<br /><br />There is no tension, no suspense, no feeling of impending doom, you care nothing for the main characters, it plods along with no energy.<br /><br />Nothing in this film works.<br /><br />Romero still deserves much respect for effectively creating the modern Zombie movie ....... but it is looking like he has lost the magic touch when it comes to his own Zombie stories.<br /><br />You can probably skip this one and not feel like you missed anything.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I own all of Kelly Clarkson's albums, and this is the most raw, real, emotional, and genuine out of all of them. I really appreciate this album, because when I feel down, the songs from this album reflect and mirror how I feel. Kelly's a gifted songwriter, and she's a normal, down-to-earth human being. And I thank her for penning her real and true emotions. I appreciate Kelly's songwriting so much that when I met her in person at the Dasani Fest in St. Louis, I gave her a composition book as one of my birthday presents to her so that she could pen her thoughts/songs. My favorite songs from this album are: \\"Never Again\\", \\"One Minute\\", \\"Hole\\", \\"Sober\\", \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\", and \\"Irvine\\". \\"Sober\\", \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\", and \\"Irvine\\" are real tearjerkers. I love sad songs because they reflect how open an artist is willing to be. Some of the best songwriting comes from sad songs because they get to the core/heart of the matter with no sugarcoating or gloss. I love it when artists are willing to be at their most real and raw selves. Kelly shares her soul and heart in this album, and I'm so glad that she fought for this album because this CD is truly a rare and honest gem. I highly recommend this album. Because it's a genuinely good album from a beautiful and real artist.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|okay, so i am completely in love/obsessed with The Vampire Diaries, so obviously this was the best purchase like, I could ever make :)   The box, the DVD, the CDs & the dvd booklet are perfect, & the content is absolutely magic :D  Every episode of TVD from season 1, with the deleted scenes & heaps of extras like cast interviews & such, make this DVD set soooo amazing!  I cannot wait for the Second Season to come out...but they have to finish filming it first :P    oh, and because i don't live in America & had it shipped overseas, I can actually watch the season before it's been played on air here tehe.  the vampire diaries is ridiculously addictive.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|In truth, there is as much Shakespeare here as Fitzgerald.  Specifically \\"The Merchant of Venice.\\"  This is Nietzsche's \\"resentment\\" turned into a pound of flesh.  Going back to West Egg for a moment,  the Winkelvii are a digitally enhanced twin version of Fitzergerald's Tom and Zuckerberg is a tech-Geek Gatsby.  I have no doubt this film will convey the spirit of \\"Great Gatsby\\" far more faithfully than the upcoming Baz Luhrmann production, sure to be a kitsch-fest-- and produced by Harvard's very own Lucy Fisher, which shows how low they'll stoop to keep the real estate.  As someone who was \\"punched\\" for a Final Club, I'm astonished by the accuracy of detail Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher muster.  Greed, betrayal, and ambition have been around as long as the human genome.  But this movie reveals how the societal forces that have kept them in check have all been circumvented by cyberspace.  A very distressing theme.  As I was leaving the theater,  I saw an elderly woman who appeared to be in distress.  She was telling her friend \\"I think I'm going to need a long time to digest this.\\"  I turned to her and said \\"I think the movie has a simple meaning:  civilization is dead.  We Americans and our technology killed it.\\"  She thought about this for a moment and replied \\"I'm afraid you're right.\\"

067144901X|5.0|I started reading this too my son at just 2 months old. Along with [[ASIN:0756655676 Baby: Colors! (Baby Chunky Board Books)]], these were the only books at first that really held his attention. he is a very wiggly baby and doesn't sit still much. But these books always make him stop and stare and reach for the pages. He seems to really enjoy them- and is just 5 months now.  There is no need to wait until 6+ months to read to your baby, they will enjoy it from the beginning. :)  I hope to get the other books by Boynton soon!

AMAZING. i think i mentioned that already, but still, it is.<br /><br />Just as good as the percy books, if not kinda better.

B00466H3DG|2.0|*****I just realized my idiot self posted this review under the wrong ESOTSM Blu Ray Disk. This review is only for the Canadian version, not the future US release which this is pre-selling. My Apologies. If it can be moved to the correct location PLEASE DO SO.****  *Please note this is more of a review for the disk, than the actual film*  If you are like me and couldn't wait for the U.S. release of this film on Blu Ray, then you are probably contemplating buying the Canadian import.   (I'm still not sure when the U.S. Blu Ray release of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is set for sale? Please enlighten me if you know.)    Movie   4.5/5  I adore this film.   Interesting and unique take on romance and how at the end of the day memories are really what make us who we are. Lose your memories (good or bad) and lose yourself.     Video Quality  2.5/5  The transfer on the Canadian disk is very poor. I'm heavily disappointed, but perhaps shouldn't be surprised. Grain is very noticeable, and the picture is flat and boring. Details that could be intriguing are instead blurry and forgotten.  I've recently heard the Japanese Blu Ray is quite impressive in it's video quality, but haven't seen it for myself, I'm curious now. Perhaps you should look into that version first. Bottom line, this transfer extremely uninspiring.     Audio Quality  3/5  I found the sound satisfying enough.  But far from top quality.   Dialogue sounds a bit low, but overall it's ok, it's nothing to show off your sound.     Extras/Special Features   0/5   Why?  There is none. This disk doesn't even have a menu...you pop in the disk and the movie just starts.     Overall  Come on Canada. :(  To those in America...  Don't bother buying this Canadian version, my advice, stick with your DVD copy until the American Blu Ray release happens. You will only be downgrading if you don't.  Or like I mentioned earlier, perhaps look into the Japanese disk.       HP
1439102813|5.0|As one who watched and sometimes helped his wife act as a care giver to her mom, who had Altzheimers, I can say that this book resonates!  It is very realistic.<br /><br />I remember asking my mother-in-law, when she was just beginning the steep part of her down-hill slide, how it felt and she said \\"It is awful and horrible and frightening and demeaning.\\"  When she no longer recognized my wife, my wife was crushed.  The pain and suffering dealt to loved-ones is more than some folks can deal with.<br /><br />Too many believe that it is an easier way to exit this mortal coil ... nope, it is just awful.  I used to laugh at the Altzy jokes, but can no longer do so.<br /><br />This book is so accurate and so tasteful and so empathetic, that I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|Very good album. Difficult to follow up their eponymous starter, and I don`t think it´s a strong throughout, but still has several very catchy gems.
159562015X|4.0|We used the book as part of an employee retreat. I must say,I learned more than I thought I would!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I have never been more excited for a book to come out and more dissapointed with how it turned out EVER.  THe first 2 books were probably my favorite books I have read and the third one was so dissapointing.  It seemed the author was focused more on letting us see how bad war is and forgot about the story all together.  I wish I would have never read it to be honest....such a let down.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Ok, I read some bad reviews on this movie when it came out. Me being a huge Predator fan I would see it regardless of bad reviews. I am always confused by how some people just pick apart some movies like it's their personal mission in life. I collected The Predator comics, books and so on. So I know a bit more about the series then the average movie goer. In saying that, I didnt think it was that bad. Yah, it was the same formula they used for the original Predator movie but that movie was a huge success, so cant go wrong there. I mean, dont expect to be surprised by much but it's worth viewing. My only real gripe is the size pf the Predators. They didnt use actors over 7ft in this movie, as they have in the others and you could kinda tell. Thats the only thing I really didnt like. I will buy this movie and in light of the awful Aliens vs Predator Requiem, this movie is WAY better. I would recommend giving it a shot.
1590171993|4.0|This is a really nice, quiet story, rather uneventful about a rather average man.  It sounds boring, but it's not at all.  Stoner is born a farmer, his father expects him to run the farm when he returns from school and instead he is lured by academia and becomes a university professor. His career and life are both rather uneventful. He marries, has a child and dedicates himself to his work.  The characters are extremely well drawn without being caricatures, his strange wife, the professor that is his memesis at the university, his lonely daughter.  THis is a very difficult book to describe, you might expect the usual saga that is found in books covering the span of a life, but this is much more subtle.  If you like thoughtful, well written stories that engross you with their simplicity, this is for you.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|If you're only after the DVD movies and not a bunch of packaging, etc, this is the way to go. Much cheaper. The DVD's can be a challenge to remove from the internal packaging initially, but, you paid for the movies, not ergonomics.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I had never seen this movie before I purchased it, and did so on a whim as I do like Cary Grant in most films I've seen him in and Love the art on the cover of the packaging. I am happy to say that I loved this movie and am Glad I bought it. Very fun to watch.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Anybody who saw \\"Alien\\" and didn't think it was the greatest sci-fi film of all times, hasn't got a clue what it takes to makes a bone-chilling, skin-crawlingg, movie.  Not since the original \\"Halloween\\" movie-score, did sounds cause your skin to ripple like this did.  I studied American short stories in college and this story-characters-setting really came to a frightening reality.  This film can NOT be missed by anyone who is a fan of great sci-fi.  For those of you who did not like \\"Alien\\", you probably like the rubber suited Godzilla or think Mighty Mouse could put up a good fight with Superman (even tho you know Mighty Mouse is a cartoon and Superman is a real man).  \\"Aliens\\" definitely had more action.  The first VHS release was disjointed by their editing, but the first DVD release added 18 deleted minutes which made the movie better.  I hope it is the the same in Blu-ray as I have not yet played it.  3 & 4 were OK, and I hope they made lots of money, but the effects were gone, and the frightening scenes were rather tame.  \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" are a must see!!
1607882302|4.0|I was told about this book by a friend and bought it thinking it was more of a \\"How To\\" book, and even though it isn't, It was great to listen to and they do bring up great business ideas and things to keep in mind when trying to build a business.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|The movie is at best 3 stars, falls below the 1st Iron Man.  Also the packaging indicates that there are 3 discs, but in actuality only 2.  A bit of deception here, the standard DVD and Digital copy are on 1 disc.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I love the first Ironman, and this one was very good, however I felt like they cheated the audience out of the up close fight scenes and did that long flying shooting one. I wish the flying around was like 1 minute and the fight scene with the robots was like 10-20 minutes. Otherwise, good movie, great graphics, great on Blu-ray.

Then please listen and admire this work of art.

0061245097|3.0|REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />Lots of action and interesting paranormal characters and events.  I liked the mixture of vampires, ghouls, and humans working together and also as enemies.  Cat is the tough female heroine, half vampire/half human but as powerful as a master vampire when it comes to fighting.  In each book 1 and 2, the main plot has a bad vampire causing problems that get resolved in the end.  For romance you need to read both books together.  Book 1 has Cat meeting Bones, but they are separated at the end, which made me very unhappy.  In book 2, they are brought together and have a happy romantic ending which pleased me.  The paranormal action is well done - a touch campy.  There are some interesting plot twists.  I think paranormal action fans will enjoy this.<br /><br />The romantic story was mediocre.  She makes inaccurate assumptions and stupid decisions causing them to be apart.  She whines because they're apart, but she was the one who left him.  She also lies to him saying she doesn't love him which annoyed me.  A better romance story would have less of that and have more conflicts based on personality quirks and differences - or more third parties causing relationship conflicts - or something else.  Each book had one scene with Cat being jealous when another female showed desire for Bones.  I enjoyed those.  In book 1 Cat grabbed certain body parts of Bones while glaring at the female.  In book 2, Cat was feeling insecure and Bones had to take action to counter her feelings.  But those were not enough to balance out the other weak romantic elements.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Cat works for a secret \\"Homeland Security\\" unit headed by Don.  She is the only nonhuman.  She is in charge of a group of guys.  Their job is to kill bad vampires.  A silver knife through a vampire's heart is the only method that works.  At the end of book 1, Cat left Bones because she thought they would not be a good match because she would get old with wrinkles and die before he did.  Book 2 starts four years later and Bones soon finds her.  At the same time, someone has hired assassins to kill Cat.  Bones insists on staying around to protect her.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Story length: 363 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.  Sexual language: strong.  There is one pretty intense sex scene with rear door activity.  Number of sex scenes: 2.  Total number of sex scene pages: 11.  Setting: current day mostly Virginia and Ohio.  Copyright: 2008.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|Wow.    I was a former user of bluetooth headsets but i got so tired of my ear hurting after using the bluetooth headset.  It felt like my ear was about to fall off.    One day i went to a friends house and it turned out he had some Turtlebeaches P21's. I was amazed by the comfortability and how you could hear in-game sound and chat.  So one day i was wandering on at Amazon.com and search for \\"turtlebeaches for PS3\\".  When i got these babies i plugged them in to my PStriple and wow.    You can lower the in-game volume, chat volume, and bass with the headset controller!  What more do you want?    Would i recommend these? OF COURSE!  Worth the 70$
B003INBNXO|5.0|Truely a great story. The movie is more than a Kung Fu flick. It is a very well put together story of a man whose style was great. Never seen Wing Chun work in the UFC MMA circuit but it did well against the Jap's. Ip Man was a Sifu grandmaster vs. Karate students. Not sure that would justify his technique as better than Karate. Would love to see actual footage of a Karate Grandmaster face any of Ip Mans grandchildren that have obtained Grandmaster status in Hong Kong.     Overall the FILM is a must buy/see. I watched it then put it on and watch it again immediately.

Wasn't aware of that fact when I purchased it but being that I am at least able to view it on my MacBook, and it is still a good quality disk, I'll hang on to it! It is one of my childhood favs after all!
B000MV8AE0|4.0|It's a film worth seeing. It likely didn't happen the way \\"Copying Beethoven\\" plays out, but I like original screenplays like this. My parents are well into their 80s and loved the movie, especially since   Ed Harris is from our birth state of New Jersey, which has nothing to do with the movie except a slight music connection: Ed's dad sang with Fred Waring's choir. The beginning, where the copyist is riding in a carriage, hearing a Beethoven fugue inside her head, mixed with all she is seeing outside, is very well pieced together. Cool.
B0040YFR1Y|2.0|This movie was horrible. Even from the beginning how do the predators put parachutes on all the victims after teleporting them to another planet? And with all the technology of the predators and aliens if they could transport people to another planet, do they really need parachutes? So many scenes were stolen from the original it was a joke. Then the plot was so bad, I mean 20 minutes into the flick Adrien Brody figures out way to much story too easily. Predator dogs? Really? I don't know whats worse wrestlers trying to act(Predator) or good actors (Adrien Brody) trying to act like a 110 lb. badass. This group of 110 lb. people are the Earths baddest badasses? OK. The Brazilian girl telling the same story about the Predator back in 1987 was just retarded. The best part of the movie was Lawrence Fishburnes part in the film, but the film was so bad he even had to get out quick. If you thought it was dumb that an Predator and a girl teamed up in AVP, well Adrien Brody does it in this flick too. I was however thankful after watching Splice that Adrien Brody didn't have sex with a Predator. If you just like mindless action, and don't care about the story or plot you should like this one. And truthfully there really isn't a lot of action.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased this video as it was recommended to me from a friend. I find it gives me a great workout, however it is unclear what the recommendations are for this video. Are 5 lb weights sufficient? Do they suggest you start with 3 lbs? Are 8 lbs too much? (I started with 8 and found it to be too much! 5 lbs seems to be slightly easier for me, while still feeling like it's getting the job done) Also, they do not say how many days a week to do the video. I've heard you should typically give yourself two days rest with weights. They don't say anything, only that once you've gotten better with level 1, move to level 2, then level 3. On chat boards I've heard people give many different approaches. I think it would be better for it to be included on the video so we aren't \\"flying blindly\\". All in all, I like the video, I feel stronger and have only been doing it for about a week and half (still on level 1!). I will continue using this video in hopes that it will \\"shred\\" and make me stronger. Would I recommend this video? Yes. Good luck!!

Over all this product is great but hey I'm a gleeker  so I've been told and it dosn't dissapoint  well me at least
B000W7JWUA|5.0|pros:  1. great fun  2. easy to learn - thinking of strategies often by the end of the first game  3. at $33.60 you can't get a better price anywhere    con:  1. the outside water border pieces don't do a good job of holding the island pieces down flat, curving slightly on first use. This was the same when I bought it now as when I've bought it for friends in the past as well as with other friend's boards. (I've purchased this game 3 times because I enjoy playing it with friends that much)
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Works great.  I use it to boost my signal from my laptop prior to jacking into a tuner that broadcast over loud speaker for a sporting event.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Not at all what I expected.  This album rocks!  What is stripped?  Mostly, the effects commonly added that sometimes muddy the sound.  A lot, but not all, of the compression, reverb and other processing is missing...but not missed.  What's left?  A heavier, rocking sound with most (usually all) of the instruments left intact.  The vocals are more prominent in the mix, and the clarity is unbelievable.  I can actually understand what Yoko is singing.  Now, I'm not a big Yoko fan, but I have to admit her stuff rocks, too.  With a harder, driving rock sound and the lack of processing, her vocals come across much stronger and deeper.<br /><br />I'm amazed at the amount of emotion that was hidden by dropping the vocals in the mix and hiding them with over-processing.  Not only on Yoko's vocals, but on John's too.  Right from the start, Starting Over reveals an emotion of excitement not heard on the original, or even on the last remix.  John is clearly excited about the subject he's singing about and the final product of the song coming together into what will clearly be a hit.<br /><br />You really need to hear this with headphones.  Why?  You will find recordings by some extremely talented musicians.  It's exciting to hear all of the different parts going on, culminating into some fabulous final songs.<br /><br />Here are some of the things that caught my attention...<br /><br />(Just Like) Starting Over - John's vocals; various guitar parts; Andy's drums sound like drums<br /><br />Kiss, Kiss, Kiss - missing the screeching guitars (didn't need them anyway with all the other screeching going on!!); very erotically passionate<br /><br />Clean Up Time - very similar to the previous version, subtle changes; nice guitars<br /><br />Give Me Something - much stronger vocals; prominent bass; excellent guitar solo, sounds more like a guitar - you've got to hear this!<br /><br />I'm Losing You - thicker, grungier rhythm guitar - nice<br /><br />I'm Moving On - starts off weaker with acoustic guitars, but soon rocks; nice rock guitar build<br /><br />Beautiful Boy - more prominent vocal<br /><br />Watching The Wheels - piano and drums<br /><br />I'm Your Angel - acoustic guitar and keyboards<br /><br />Woman - John's incredible rhythm playing on 12-string acoustic guitar (I didn't know it was 12-sting until now)<br /><br />Beautiful Boys - Haunting acoustic guitars, now a powerful song<br /><br />Dear Yoko - nice harmonica, lots of punch; probably the least noticeable change of any of the songs<br /><br />Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him - very different version with lots of smooth synthesizers; totally different feel<br /><br />Hard Times Are Over - nice lead guitar throughout<br /><br />Keep in mind these are \\"remixes,\\" so much of it sounds different based on the new mix compared to the old.  In other words, the same instruments are in the original, but they have been processed and placed in the mix differently.  Sometimes, though, parts are just left out.<br /><br />Overall, the vocals really stand out and are much clearer.  The drums have more punch and sound more like drums!  The bass is more powerful without being over the top.  And the guitars!!!  Much more of a raw guitar feel on many of the tracks.  Not Badfinger raw, but still a great sound.<br /><br />It's not that artists don't ever want to change art they've created, it's just usually not practical.  Even Rembrandt might want to change things in his paintings after revisiting them later.  Karen Carpenter did go back and re-record some of her vocals on some of the Carpenters' earlier recordings, and that's a woman with a perfect voice!<br /><br />I usually don't like change like this, but in this case, it makes me wonder why they didn't do it like this the first time.  I guess that's just the way it was back then.  Of course, I liked it back then, but I like these new versions, too.<br /><br />I bought this CD because I just had to have it for the collection.  I wasn't expecting much AT ALL.  What a surprise.  I was even able to listen to Yoko's songs without passing them by because there was so much more to them than just her singing.  I'm actually listening to it with the headphones on as I'm writing this.  I never thought I'd be saying this, but, \\"Good job, Yoko.\\"<br /><br />One more these recordings show - what a true genius John Lennon was.  Thanks...again...John!y listening to it with the headphones on as I'm writing this.  I never thought I'd be saying this, but, \\"Good job, Yoko.\\"    One more these recordings show - what a true genius John Lennon was.  Thanks...again...John!
B001VNB54A|2.0|I know Tom Hanks worked on this, and that Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece, but this was just not that good. I know that there are time constraints when it comes to film making, but the way they glossed over  the battle for Guadalcanal was disservice not only to all who fought there, but also to the true telling of the story. The US Marines started the battle on August 7th 1942, and the Japanese didn't finally leave until  February 7th of 1943. To watch the battle in the HBO special, you might think it was over in few days and not all that bad. And Tarawa was even worse. The Pacific Theater was a horrible dirty war. If we want to try to never have war again, maybe our \\"specials\\" on WWII should be more accurate. They should show just how bad it really was.
142311339X|5.0|[[ASIN:1935563327 Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire Story]]  My son loved the movie so I picked up the book for him. Only thing is I never gave it to him- I was too busy reading it myself. The momentum is unbelievable and can't wait until they bring this one to film. If you found the Harry Potter books a bit slow, then you will love this.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|If you do not have this dvd in your horror library, you are not a true fan of horror!  John Carpenter is a master. This is one of my favorite Carpenter classics. The whole idea surrounding the plot is great. Being from New England, I could just imagine something like this being an urban legend.  Definitely pick up this dvd to add to your horror or John Carpenter collection!
B0015DYIH2|3.0|[[ASIN:B003Y74M2S Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire Story]]  I confess, I didn't like this book beginning with the pregnancy. Poor Bella- denied any real physical contact with the love of her life and the one time she finally gets lucky, she ends up pregnant. And not just pregnant, but pregnant with a baby bent on killing her off. I'll try not to read too much into the meaning. And the ending for me was very anti-climatic-- lots of build-up but no fireworks. I wish we could call a do-over.
6305558167|4.0|This movie is great when you are stuck inside on a rainy or snowy day and have nothing else to do. You can spend a couple hours getting lost in the story of Arthur, Merlin and the sword in the stone.  There are a number of great actors in the movie- most in the early days of their careers.  If you like the Arthurian legend...then I believe you will truly like this movie!
1601251505|4.0|This book is a new path for the old Dungeons & Dragons rpg system, and, in my opinion, preserve the best features form the 3,5 rules.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I was always interested in the series, but it conflicted with another show that i was faithful to.  So i was extremely excited to get the full season 1.  I look forward to purchasing every season as it comes out.  You will not be dissapointed should you make this purchase.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|I received my dvd the day before it came out. I love the movie having seen it 4 times at the theater. I already had Ironman and am looking forward to Ironman 3 in the spring of 2011!  I love shopping with Amazon because you can always count on them for such prompt service.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|You know how you go back and watch shows and movies that you loved as a child and now they're terrible and/or stupid?  I gambled that Street Hawk would not fall into that category and won.  I have a television station in my city called MyTV and it shows things like the A-Team and Kojak and the like, and I realized that, when I watch Knight Rider, I am still never exactly sure who he's supposed to be or what he's supposed to be doing, and it leaves me a little nonplussed.  Like the A-Team, Street Hawk is simple and formulaic; I don't have to work to understand it.  Often I don't want that, but when I was a kid, it was all I wanted.  Watching those shows now take me back to that time.  I also recommend Misfits of Science, if you can get hold of it.  Same deal.  Radical, awesome, and whatever else we said when we were 12.

B00008973A|4.0|Really enjoyed this film.  Not so much interested in the Cassie part, but loved the music, staging, dancing.  The final scene/closing credits are truly memorable.  Loved this show on stage and love it on film!
0316098337|5.0|Really well done book. Written from the perspective of the five year old; one of the main characters.  Highly recommend. Best book since reading the Steig Larsson trilogy this summer.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|As the father of an Autistic boy, this movie was close to my heart, I could see him in her behaviour as potrayed as a young girl. It illustrates her struggle better I felt than her own books where Temple does not dwell on the difficulties she faced.  Above all the movie is the story of a modern day hero.  Highly recommended for all ages, my 9yr old daughter has watched it of her own volition 4 times.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|An absolutely marvelous film! Not only did I enjoy seeing this glimpse of  traditional Japanese culture, but I liked and cared about the main characters. The photography was stunning and the cello music delightful. A real winner.
B002ZG997M|4.0|This is one of best movie I've seen in a long time. Great story line loved all the action Denzel was great and so where the others. This is something that could come to past.
B003WTE886|4.0|There is no doubt about it - Taylor Swift is a talented songwriter and a pure artist.  I enjoyed this CD and the CD packaging (I bought the deluxe version).   However, I do wish that Taylor would stray, just a little, from the formula of boy meets girl storyline.  With her songwriter capabilities it just seems to me that she could write about other topics instead of \\"picking\\" on past loves.  Another nitpick that I have is that I wish Taylor would experiment with her vocal range.  At times, I  thought she was out of tune.  When she carries a note she likes to mix it up instead of holding a note like Carrie Underwood does.  Don't get me wrong, I like Taylor and I am giving the CD 4 Stars but I would like to see her next CD push the limit.  I would recommend this CD to anyone but as always - Listen to the samples first before buying to draw your own conclusions.
B002N5N5LG|4.0|There is rarely TV viewing that make me (literally) laugh out loud while watching by myself, this show has already done it twice and I'm barely on the first disc.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I was very satisfied with the product that I recieved.  It was practically brand new.      SUGGECTION FOR AMAZON:  Could there be a place for the seller to give a little more detail about the product that they are selling?  I noticed that the seller only has OPTIONS to choose from to explain what the condition is in of the product.  I think it would be more productive if they could put into their own words the condition of the product.  Also, is there some way that there could be a description of what the seller is selling?    I REALY LOVED MY PRODUCT ALL TOGETHER
0525423842|1.0|The main character was a loser. \\"I'm thinking about taking law classes online\\" SO SAD. John Grisham needs to get a life and write a REAL book.
0316067938|5.0|I <3 this book. I could not put it down. I've read it several times now. The entire series is great!!
0312600844|3.0|I really thought this was going to be a great book after all the gushing on Oprah, what a disappointment!  I paid good money for a hard cover book so I did finish it but I don't understand why this on the best seller list, I guess because Oprah backed it.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is one of the most visually stunning movies that was made for Blue-Ray. The sound and the imagery are intense from the first few moments of the story. The story is that for the ages. At a time when man is looking at his affects on the environment, this movie takes an outside in look. The war in the movie can easily be a war within oneself. How much is too much? Where is the connecting point? I enjoyed watching the warrior connect to his inner self for the first time. He went through a true transformation. Great movie, great visuals, great sound, great story...
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|My son could not decide between the Iron Man 2 Movie on Blue Ray or DVD.  I came across the combo pack at Amazon and was so excited.  It also comes with a Digital copy.  All this for only 24.99 It is a great deal!  Good movie and now he has three forms of it.  We are very pleased with this purchase.
B0045LK31Q|3.0|Yea, I was a bit dissapointed. It was like a 40 minute intro to a song that never really started. I love Gilmour and have cherrished his every note, but after 40 minutes it leaves you dying for an actual song to actually start. The fading little notes get old after awhile. Crap, where's my animals CD.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Love Bones - the series was greatly enhanced with arrival of the psychologist.  Great service
B003KRJNBW|4.0|The Book of Eli is a good movie, but not a great one. Overall, I would probably give it closer to a 3.5/5, but I chose to round upwards. It has an interesting plotline, but they do not delve into the backstory (what caused the 'war'?). It moves slow - too slow in parts for an action flick, but makes a decent drama feel, except it has too much action for a drama. It was worth the two hours of my time, but I am glad I redboxed it and didn't buy it or rent it on amazon. Worth a watch, but not a purchase.
B004097IKW|4.0|My first Puritani was in 1953 (if my date is wrong, please correct me) when Angel released the Callas recording. Of this Bellini opera I was woefully ignorant. I knew the famous arias from Sonnambula and Norma, but I knew nothing from Puritani, not even Qui la voce. A more knowledgeable friend advised me to fast forward to this aria. I had not heard Callas, only heard of her. The performance was revelatory; the timbre, the color, the care given the words, in short I was hooked not so much on the opera but on Callas. The recording certainly didn't boast anyone outside of Callas who knew how to sing this music. The wonderful DiStefano (in a different fach) was certainly not a model of bel canot artistry. Rossi-Lemeni was \\"woofy\\" and the baritone (again wonderful but not in this rep) was Panerai if I recall. The score was heavily cut. Other than Callas the set boast of a great conductor, Serafin. Over the years I did return to the set, but only to hear Qui la voce; I did not replace my LP set when it was issued iin a CD format.     I had not intended to add a Puritani to my DVD collection until I saw a notice advising of a taping from Bologna with Juan Diego Florez. The Elvira was to be sung by Nino Machaidze, D'arcangelo the bass and the baritone, Gabriele Viviani--a name totally unfamiliar to me. The conductor, Michele Mariiotti--quite young, photogenic was unfamiliar as well.    I would love to write that the performance was an unqualified success; it wasn't even close. Other than JDF and Arcangelo, the singing was just adequate and in the case of the Elvira it wasn't even that. Ms. Machaidze had made a surprise debut in Salzburg replacing a pregnant Netrebko in Gounod's Romeo and Juliet. Other engagements followed. To my ears she is a lyric soprano with some agility, but the sound is a trifle generic and she does not have the requisite high notes in her arsenal. What she resorts to sounds more like a scream as there is no resonance to the tone. She was unable to bring to the Qui la voce the pathos, the sadness and the ethereal aura that Callas possessed. She certainly did not have the top notes that Sutherland had and her coloratura was lacking in the joy that Sills had. It should be noted that the latter two divas also had a lot more experience in singing this kind of music. I suppose there is a certain irony in all this. Callas was never surrounded by singers who shared her talents or sensibilities for bel canto style so there was always a compromise that had to be made if one wanted to hear the music. Today we have the tenors who know their way around this music, but I can't think of one soprano who is qualified to sing this music. I have not heard the Netrebko performance, but her Lucia was such that I couldn't imagine her bringing to Elvira what is so sorely missed in these operas, a sense of how the music should go, and the technique to make it work.    JDF does not disappoint and as such he remains the reason to acquire the set. Thank God he eschews the highest notes (surely sung as \\"voix mixte\\" in Bellini's time); check out YouTube for some clips. He has the charisma and the personality and most important the voice to engage even the most blase opera lover.    The production is conservative and minimalist. It is also dimly lit with a pervasive blue-grey cast to the proceedings. One has the feeling that the opera takes place in the middle of the night! Italy has resisted any hint of regie but surely some imagination would not be out of place in new stagings. Fortunately there was not attempt to \\"update\\" the action, but the moving of characters and the chorus was very old fashioned; the chorus enters then assumes a blocked position much like a choral group. There surely is a better way.
B004132HZS|5.0|...when I got tired of watching Bret Favre throw one interception after another; started flipping channels and landed on \\"Sherlock.\\" I was at the scene where Moriarty was trying to recruit Watson. Had no idea what I was watching, but I couldn't stop. When I finally realized it was Dr. Watson, I was like \\"whaaaaa?\\" Forgot about the game.     The whole \\"I spoke and the people killed themselves\\" thing and the \\"which pill is the poison pill\\" thing was awesome; the single most awesome display of television villainy ever (probably). I actually found myself struggling with the decision--would I sit there and try to figure it out, or just leave? Ahhhh! Frustrating!    This is what television is supposed to be like!(I'm looking at you CSI/Law & Order/NCIS.)I have held out on buying a Blu-ray player, but now I have an excuse to start my Blu-ray library. I hope BBC keeps this series going as long as possible.
B001DPC4R8|5.0|If you still love your vinyl this is a must have! I put it on and smiled from the first note till the last. nice heavy vinyl great pressing.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Really good album. There are a lot of good songs, and none of them are \\"skip\\" songs as I like to call them. It is also absent of filler songs, and is pretty great from beginning to end.     I am just annoyed about one thing. I bought this on 10/25/2010 around 12/1pm for $7.99. Within 6-8 hours the price had been dropped to $3.99. If I had known it was going to be knocked down I would have waited.     Other than that Speak Now is a great album, and it's been on replay all day. Hope you'll all enjoy it too!
B002GY9F9K|1.0|This series was supposed to be based on the first book in the Sword of Truth series. Everyone who was involved in this travesty should not be allowed into the entertainment industry ever again. The show branches so far away from the first book to make it unidentifiable by any of the fans of the series. If I'm getting this correct Darken Rahl doesn't die, Richard never ascends to take over Dahara as the next of the Rahl bloodline, completely negating anything past the first two books, where it became necessary for Richard to lead.   I would be surprised if Goodkind let this go on any longer than two seasons.  Don't buy this and support this travesty, buy the books instead they are much better.
B003XKPPOU|2.0|I really don't enjoy posting reviews lambasting movies that most people appear to enjoy. You spend a lot of time trying to justify your stance, to be replied with vitriol and insults: it really isn't worth it. But believe it or not, some of us really didn't enjoy the movie, so this time I thought I'd spend 'a little' time and take a stance :0)    I'm a fan of most of the Pixar movies, I think the Incredibles is a masterpiece, capturing the essence of the comic book genre as Ratatiolle understood the obession that cooks have with food, and Toy Story is one of the great buddy movies in any form. However, Toy Story 3, imho, ended up being a bad chase movie with a yawn ending, Cars was 'nice but dim' and I won't even start on how much I disliked Wall-E.    Where I felt that Pixar used to research and understand the structure within which their movies stood, now I feel they have substituted substance for style. Yes they look good and are well made, but compared to Pixar at their best, I feel that their recent movies are shallow and lacking the inventiveness of their earlier work. Now they still have their moments: the first 20 minutes of Wall-E is great as are the first 30 or so of Toy Story 3, and I loved the idea of the Spanish speaking Buzz, but these are just a few good moments.    Pixar are very good at what they do, i.e that generally get great reviews and make lots of money (which appears to be most peoples criteria), on the other hand the Shawshank Redemption was pretty much ignored when it came out and made very little money!    I was really hoping that after Cars and Wall-E, with Toy Story 3 Pixar were going to get back to what they used to do; 'intelligent' well made movies, that are fun and still cater for young and old alike. Sadly for me Toy Story 3 ain't it!    Now it may be true that I'm 'too old' to appreciate the movie and that 'it's basically for children!', but I recently watched Pinocchio and loved every moment.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I've been listening to this album  all over this 2 months and this is certainly one of the best rock albuns in this year.    Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa are very good musicians with a lot of feeling to put on their music, and the others, Derek Sherinian and Jason Bonham are good musicians too. Their influences goes from Led Zeppelin to Deep Purple, an authentic 70th album released in present.    A great buy for sure!
B003EYVXSW|2.0|this movie is a big disappointment partly because the science is bad, and partly because the fiction is bad. So these two young scientists who happen to also be lovers, played by Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley, head up a team trying to create new species by spicing together DNA code from unrelated species, with the ostensible aim of \\"sequencing\\" some DNA that could help cure millions of people from awful diseases, but, in reality because they just like creating monsters. Especially Elsa, the Sarah Polley character. Early on they create a pair of giant writhing maggot-creatures, whom Elsa, whilst filming them calls, \\"cute\\". The investors/board of directors are getting skeptical about the value of the project, so the geneticists put on a presentation for them, however the maggot-creatures go berserk. Not going to spoil that big surprise, though.    Meanwhile, an even bigger, yet clandestine project is being nursed to fruition by the mad scientists. Because this organism had human DNA spliced in it, it wasn't supposed to go \\"that far\\" (ethical considerations), but they, especially Elsa just can't resist just finding out \\"what if...\\"  The humanish creature ends up to be a much bigger project than even Elsa planned, and, in the process, much about her maternal neurosis is revealed. Many of the scenes and sequences seem to borrow from better science fiction, all the way from \\"Alien\\", to \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", but this movie itself has no really satisfying horror or fiction. Sadly, besides the lack of interesting story, many things were poorly or not at all explained, or were explained in ways that made no sense at all. Like when Clive tries to end the experiment, yet instead of the female spliced creature drowning, she comes to life by \\"using her amphibian lungs\\"!
B002N5N5LG|4.0|I saw this season as it originally aired.  It was hilarious.  I've watched the first disk again so far.  I think it's even funnier the second time around.  My favorite episodes are the Paint Ball, Halloween and Christmas episodes.  The disk arrived in good time and condition.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Some of the disc's were scratched and I received new ones with days of reporting the problem. This season was awesome.
0451228375|1.0|after reading - and enjoying - pillars of the earth this book was disappointing.  pretty much the same story, just different time and different names.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Having never read the book that this movie was based on, I went into it not knowing what to expect. I found it thoroughly enjoyable! The acting was quite good, the story pacing was dead on, and it had both action and comedy. I watched it three times and then decided it was time I read the books.<br /><br />I just finished the second book in the series about ten minutes ago, and now I understand why so many fans of the books are upset at the movie adaptation of their beloved story. Aside from the VERY basics (i.e. who Percy is, who the Gods are, the lightning bolt being stolen, and the quest) the movie doesn't stay true to the book at all. While everyone knows book adaptations are not going to be 100% accurate, I think most fans hope for at least 80-90%. This movie is closer to 50%, if that.<br /><br />Percy's best friend is characterized completely differently in the movie than in the book. Rather than an awkward teenager who is unsure of himself we're given a smooth-talking lady's man. The character who turns out to be the major villan of the book is completely left out of the movie - which then makes someone else the villan for the movie's purposes. The screenplay writer left out major plots, I'm assuming because he felt it wouldn't make for a good movie. My issue with this is that if the story wouldn't make a good movie, why did Disney go forward with it, other than to make a buck?<br /><br />In the end, though, I still enjoy the movie. Just be aware that if you're looking for it to be true to the books, it's not and you'll likely come away hating it. If you just want to enjoy a movie and can overlook it's adaptation flaws you'll probably enjoy it very much.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|I bought this CD this summer. I'm not a Talking Heads mega-fan by any means, but this CD transformed me. It became almost an addiction; I kept the CD in my car, and I found myself coming up with excuses to drive around and immerse myself in Talking-Heads-land whenever I felt pangs of Byrne-withdrawl. It was my own personal religious service, basically.<br />Let's talk about a few of the tracks.<br /><br />2. Psycho Killer. Why is a song about a psycho killer so much fun? David Byrne has shown us convincing snippets of a killer's inner dialog... why am I not terrified? Why do I enjoy it so much? Why does Byrne seem to channel Kip from Napoleon Dynamite in the line, \\"Say something once -- why say it again?\\" So many questions.<br /><br />3. Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town. So, there are a bajillion songs in the world about the agonizing experience of falling in love. But can the Talking Heads write one that manages to be zany and unique? Um, yes they can. Here's a hint: whenever the Talking Heads mention stockbrokers in their lyrics, the song is gonna be great. David Byrne doesn't have time to explain the banality of life in the professional/business/moneyish world. He just inserts the word \\"stockbroker\\" into songs whenever he wants to infuse us, the listeners, with the feeling of \\"ugh! banality!\\" -- and then he promptly subverts it -- because, hey, even stockbrokers fall in love. See also: Track 16, Wild Wild Life \\"Check out Mr. Businessman. . . on his way to the stock exchange...\\"<br /><br />5. Found A Job. Many songs on this album are actually intense stories that deserve to be turned into full-length movies or novels. Instead, they are condensed into a few minutes of song. This song is about a couple who, after bickering over what to watch on TV, decide that they should make their own TV shows. Doing so saves their marriage. A lesson about creativity. There are not a ton of songs in the world that fall into the bickering-couple-makes-homemade-TV-shows genre.<br /><br />6. Life During Wartime. Definitely one of those \\"should be a full-length movie\\" songs. Apart from the obviously catchy chorus, what I love most about this song are the lines at the end: \\"Don't get exhausted. I'll do some driving. You ought to get you some sleep.\\" When you place them within the song's bizarre dystopian setting, they have to be some of the tenderest, kindest words ever sung.<br /><br />9. Once In A Lifetime. Remember when I said that David Byrne doesn't have time to reflect on a life of banality? Just kidding! I actually don't know how to explain my love for this song. If I go ahead and say that I view it as a monumental achievement of humankind -- one that tens of thousands of years of human evolution have been leading up to, so that David Byrne might, miraculously, be born and raised and taught English, so that he might one day form the question, in an exasperatedly baffled voice, \\"Well, how did I get here?\\" -- if I say all that, you'd think I was going a little over the top. But this song is just... too... great. Also, you should watch the music video on youtube as often as possible.<br /><br />11. This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody). For me, this song is less about the lyrics and more about the, well, melody, which leaves me feeling both eerie and contented. It's one of my favorites. It doesn't quite stand out among the giants of the CD like Life During Wartime or Once In A Lifetime, but it is nevertheless an integral part of the CD's tapestry.<br /><br />14. Road To Nowhere. See, here's the thing. The Talking Heads are SO zany, SO kooky, and SO much fun, that they can manage to be intensely profound at the same time. And it's cool. It's not whiny or depressing. They pull it off. In this song especially, David Byrne holds our hand and walks us right to the cliff's edge of complete and utter nihilism... but it's ok, it's fun! And he lets out these raspy little whoops at the end of the song -- tiny, terrorized screams of alarm, addressed to LIFE ITSELF. But it's all in fun!<br /><br />15. And She Was. I had heard this on the radio a billion times, of course, but when I listened to it on this CD, I finally LISTENED to it. And let me just have a moment of feminism, here. When was the last time you heard a song about a woman, sung by a man, and it WASN'T romantic/sexual? (OK, maybe Elton John's \\"Candle In The Wind,\\" but that's all I can come up with.) David Byrne is not in love here. He's not particularly attracted to the subject of the song. He's singing about a person, who happens to be a woman, and he's putting himself in her head for a moment. Yes, \\"she's taking off her dress\\" -- but she's doing it for herself. I think it's about a woman tripping or something.

I get the feeling that the Talking Heads approach every song from a place of being ABSOLUTELY STARTLED TO BE ALIVE. In some cases, this leads to semi-depressing conclusions.

But once again, they've condensed a complex sci-fi scenario that should be a full-length movie into a tiny song. I guess you can call it a high-concept song. The civilized world as we know it has ended, and all the hallmarks of modern suburbia (Dairy Queens, Pizza Huts, etc.) have become overgrown with wildlife. And the narrator MISSES the old ways, even though there are flowers everywhere. My favorite lines come when he's reminiscing about the old ways, and he says, \\"Years ago, I was an angry young man/ And I'd pretend that I was a billboard/ Standing tall by the side of the road/ I fell in love with the beautiful highway.\\" Um, awesome. You get to question what beauty is, where it comes from, what is actually preventing us from experiencing beauty, etc., etc. You get the idea.

So... yeah. 5 stars.his on the radio a billion times, of course, but when I listened to it on this CD, I finally LISTENED to it. And let me just have a moment of feminism, here. When was the last time you heard a song about a woman, sung by a man, and it WASN'T romantic/sexual? (OK, maybe Elton John's \\"Candle In The Wind,\\" but that's all I can come up with.) David Byrne is not in love here. He's not particularly attracted to the subject of the song. He's singing about a person, who happens to be a woman, and he's putting himself in her head for a moment. Yes, \\"she's taking off her dress\\" -- but she's doing it for herself. I think it's about a woman tripping or something. But it passes my own personal song-version of the Bechdel Movie Test, and that's pretty cool.    16. Wild Wild Life. My theme song (or what I like to hope my theme song is).

B000E6EJAC|5.0|This is such a well produced album. I agree with all those 4 and 5 star reviews. The Bowie/Ronson production team is almost akin to some the great writing teams of the past. Whatever they put their hands to worked out well. And with Mott the Hoople having fully developed their art this is one of the top LP's. There should be no music collection without it.
B003WTE886|4.0|With \\"Speak Now\\" Taylor Swift ups the singer/songwriter aspect of her art and turns down the radio-ready emphasis a notch. It is a little less calculated and a little more comfortable than her last two, especially 2008's non-stop hit factory \\"Fearless.\\"<br /><br />It is also less focused and tight, but since this is Swift's debut effort without any co-writers, her melodies and lyrics composed independently, this was inevitable. The result is akin to comfort food - unpretentious, honest and warm. She has the natural talent and flair for catchy song craft to make a less precious recording - which \\"Speak Now\\" certainly is - work especially well.<br /><br />Because Swift was clearly given more leeway to do as she pleases both her strengths and excesses are more prominently on display than previously. A few of her melodies sound simple and similar to one another, and she is often bursting with lyrics, with every other tune or so a bit overwritten. However, this is also one of the strengths of \\"Speak Now.\\" It shows that Swift is the real deal - an artist from whom strong songs flow naturally.<br /><br />Much has been made of the men whom Swift has written songs about, and that transparency shows her age, but \\"Speak Now\\" proves she does not need the controversy to validate the music. From the inventive, shrewd, near power-pop of \\"The Story of Us\\" and \\"Enchanted\\" to the elegant, apologetic \\"Back to December,\\" these songs stand on their own.<br /><br />Accents of country remain, but Swift is transitioning into pop/rock territory, and she cannot be blamed for it - at 20, she is, in spite of her major success, still finding her voice. \\"Mean\\" with its cheeky, smartly executed humor, is the only outright country tune.<br /><br />\\"Someday I'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean,\\" she forecasts.<br /><br />Her eye for detail and sense of levity are prominent. In the classy, tuneful title song she paints the picture of a wedding - which she hopes to put a stop to - in delightful detail:<br /><br />\\"...and she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside her room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry.\\"<br /><br />She also plays the role of big sister on \\"Innocent\\" and \\"Never Grow Up,\\" affectionate odes to the importance of childhood. The latter especially demonstrates her depth as she sings of the importance of love, family and innocence.<br /><br />\\"But don't make her drop you off around the block,\\" she affectionately sings to her younger listeners about their mothers. \\"Remember that she's getting older too, and don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJs getting ready for school.\\"<br /><br />In an industry with plenty of flesh and flash and little substance, Taylor Swift remains refreshing and real, and \\"Speak Now\\" is just the right record for her to be releasing now - a collection of songs that proves the validity - and sincerity - of her still-burgeoning talent.he is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside her room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry.\\"    She also plays the role of big sister on \\"Innocent\\" and \\"Never Grow Up,\\" affectionate odes to the importance of childhood.

B0021L8V1Q|2.0|The first Iron Man movie was the best comic book rendition ever done.  The characters were right out of the comic books and the story left me wanting more (really cool).   This second attempt was very disappointing and did not follow any of the iron man comic books.  Revealing the real identity of Iron man painted a target on Tony Stark forever.   In  the first movie, Tony grows up and starts taking responsibility for his company.  In the second movie Tony is less responsibile than he started out in the first movie and more after selfish glory.   He turns over his responsibilities to others or they take them from him, and he pursues a life of selfish carelessness.   The plot is not plausable or fun.  I wouldn't know how to fix this series going forward.  It is as if the writer was trying to end it here.  It's really too bad because they had a great start in Iron Man 1.
B004132HZS|5.0|This short but sweet series is a BBC update of the venerable Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, starting with an adaptation of \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" titled \\"A Study in Pink.\\" The characters and the action are moved from gaslight London to present-day London, and the change in period works very well. The story opens on Watson, recently returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan, being advised by his doctor to try blogging as a method of easing his malaise. Watson doesn't think blogging is the best solution for his problems. He is right.    Introducing Martin Freeman's Watson as the viewpoint character was a smart move, since this Sherlock is very much the Sherlock of the first book, contrary-natured and given to offering the sharp side of his tongue, but so brilliant that the police can't ignore his advice. Far from being a second fiddle, this Watson humanizes Sherlock.    That's not to speak ill of Sherlock, far from it. A tall drink of water with a rich, deep voice, Benedict Cumberbatch imbues Sherlock with an appealing pugnacity. Even when the character is being a perfect ass, you still want to keep watching him. That's no small feat.    The two of them create a great odd couple chemistry as they solve some pretty heinous crimes, all while dodging the machinations of Sherlock's brother, a sometimes-hostile police department, and the mysterious Moriarty. I hear there's a second series in the works, and I can't wait.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I have said it before and I will say it again. This series is the best fantasy series in years.   Great stories and you just want more!  It's awesome that the women are strong and fearful, always fun to see.    The second season is a bit better and more interesting than the first, much depending on the beautiful actress, Tabrett Bethell, and the character Cara.    To bad it seems like this was the ending season because it's so much more to tell.  But its absolutely worth seeing! And you can read the books after;)
1439163146|2.0|I'm pretending hunkosaurus Franco didn't write this. Moving on.<br /><br />This is the stuff of every Creative Writing class you took as an undergrad. It's all Holden Caulfield crabby and Bret Easton Ellis name-droppy; gruesome with those obnoxious one-liner sentences that are meant to be profound in their brevity. The racial issues are slapped on strangely, and the tone is mushy oatmeal bland. \\"Killing Animals\\" was worth reading, but even then, it feels like Ellis fan fiction.<br /><br />Now I'm pretending Franco did write them. Look my man, you have many rich and successful friends. Many of whom are writers who like you because you're a cool dude. You're also a hunk. This is working against you. If my mom wrote a book called \\"imma Real Gud Mama\\", I'd tell her she was the next Faulkner.<br /><br />Get some unbiased advice, sweetheart. And call me.

0525951652|5.0|Mr. Follett combines actual history of World War I and the events leading up to it with fictional characters from the elite to bluecollar workers to explain the mentality of the time.  His characters bring that time in history to life.  It wasn't keeping my interest at first but about the first couple hundred pages I couldn't put it down.  I learned more about World War I from this book than from my high school classes.
B00192IV0O|4.0|I really like the Black Eyed Peas. I own every CD of theirs (even the ones without Fergie, which I don't really like as much). I was glad to hear they were releasing a new CD and it has some really good tracks on it. I personally like Boom Boom Pow, Imma Be, Meet Me Halfway, and Rock that Body. The CD is good, but it really different compared to their other releases. I think this one is a good one and one you should buy.<br />Deluxe Edition includes a Bonus CD with 10 bonus tracks.
0756405890|2.0|This book isn't bad, but I don't believe its even close to deserving all the hype and praise its been given. The Name of the Wind is a story that I think will appeal to some people, but I honestly don't see why its become so popular. Aside from a few lines here and there, the writing is generally bland. The characterization is terrible, especially the main character. In fact, Kvothe doesn't really seem to have a personality at all- aside from being obnoxiously smart for a child. He's also poor, which constitutes as his only real flaw.  Some parts were enjoyable, but the book itself was mostly underwhelming. I would recommend that anyone interested in this novel check it out in the library rather than purchase it. Other than that, don't get your hopes up. This novel isn't all its hyped up to be.

B00371QQ0M|5.0|DUNE was a major curiosity when it first came out. The unfilmable book - according to its fans/adherents - became yet another sky-fy in the wake of STAR WARS.  Years later and in this superior BD release, we can see just what it was we were looking at. Why, a science fiction film made by David Lynch, that's what. The fact it is more Lynch than Herbert should surprise no one, and yet it remains one of the most remarkable of science fiction films, blessed with stunning and fascinating production and costume design that looks like no other SF film. Telescoping Herbert's novel into 150-odd minutes (and they are very odd minutes at times) left mainstream film-goers scratching their heads, but only if they weren't paying attention.  So much is right about DUNE, that to carp about what's wrong seems mean.  Now we are more familiar with the way David Lynch makes films, take a look at DUNE, again or anew. It's something of a surprise if you haven't seen it since it first came out, and if you have never seen it, then you should if you are even remotely interested in Lynch's films, science fiction or simply a one-of-a-kind film experience.  Absolutely avoid the doctored long SPECIAL EDITION with Alan Smithee's name as director. It simply stinks at all levels. And absolutely watch the BD if you can. It is the best the film has looked and sounded since it was first released.
0316098337|5.0|Told entirely through the voice of a five-year-old boy, this spellbinding novel succeeds on many levels: it's a riveting, suspenseful story, a deep psychological portrait of two people with very different agendas, a total immersion in one child's extremely alien universe, an intense portrayal of love between parent and child, and an examination of our culture and socialization.<br /><br />It's also a beautifully written novel from the Irish-born author of Slammerkin, which will haunt you long after the last page is turned.<br /><br />The novel opens with Jack's birthday: \\"Today I'm five. I was four last night going to sleep in Wardrobe, but when I wake up in Bed in the dark I'm changed to five, abracadabra. Before that I was three, then two, then one, then zero. `Was I minus numbers?' ....<br />`Nah, the numbers didn't start till you zoomed down.'<br />\\"Through Skylight. You were all sad till I happened in your tummy.' \\"<br /><br />Jack and his 26-year-old mother, we soon realize, live entirely in one room, which Jack calls Room. To his mother, it's a prison, their life a perilous nightmare. To Jack it's the only world he has ever known. \\"I jump onto Rocker to look at Watch, he says 07:14. I can skateboard on Rocker without holding on to her, then I whee back onto Duvet and I'm snowboarding instead.\\"<br /><br />He is an active, imaginative child who personalizes all the objects in Room. And requires his mother's undivided attention. Even though she has no distractions (or maybe especially because she has no distractions), we wonder how she copes.<br /><br />After receiving his present - a pencil portrait his Ma did while he was asleep, which disturbs him since he doesn't like the idea that she was studying him while he was \\"switched off\\" rather than being asleep herself - Jack goes to pin the picture above Ma's bed.<br /><br />\\"She shakes her head. `Not there.'<br />She doesn't want Old Nick to see.\\"<br /><br />\\"Old Nick\\" is the shadowy man who visits Ma at night and is mostly important for bringing stuff from Outside, like food and Sundaytreats. Jack goes into Wardrobe every night at nine to keep out of his way and when Old Nick goes, his mother carries him, usually asleep, into Bed.<br /><br />Jack lovingly describes the rituals of their day, from breakfast at which he counts his cereal and \\"waterfalls\\" his milk, through his one TV show (he'd like more but \\"it rots our brains\\"), Bath, Phys Ed, Stories, Orchestra and in the afternoon Scream, for which they climb on Table under Skylight, every weekday but not Saturday and Sunday. Each day has its own rituals, in addition to the everyday things. And there's one Ma does by herself, flashing Lamp on and off. \\"She does this in the night, I think it helps her get to sleep again.\\"<br /><br />The room is full of toys he and his mother have made out of whatever comes to hand; the \\"masterworks\\" on the walls, for instance, come from their oatmeal boxes and Eggsnake, longer around than Room, is made from shells of the eggs Jack has been blowing out since he was three. They play word games and sing songs and read their few books.<br /><br />Jack counts his teeth with his tongue when he feels anxious - when Old Nick comes in before he's asleep, say, or when Ma has one of her \\"off\\" days when she stays in bed all day, passive and uncommunicative.<br /><br />But mostly life is good in Room with Ma. Though TV has given Jack pictures of much of the outside, he conceives the medium as a fantasy world that exists only inside the TV. How does he explain Old Nick and the things he brings? He doesn't. He doesn't need to.<br /><br />But the logic of Jack's neatly packaged universe is beginning to grow ever so faintly shaky, and his mother's increasing agitation is speeding the process.<br /><br />Though plot is secondary to (though also integral to) character in the novel, if you don't already know what happens next I'm not going to spoil it for you.<br /><br />Suffice to say, Jack's voice is as unique as his experience. He is wholly endearing, though no saint, and Ma's many struggles, failures and most especially her absolute love for Jack come through even when he hasn't a clue.<br /><br />Full of imagination, love, horror and humor, Room is a novel that captivates, entertains and will make you look at the world a bit differently.solute love for Jack come through even when he hasn't a clue.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are by far the best headphones I have ever used. Insanely nice but not overwhelming bass, clarity, soundstage, depth... all beyond reproach. Hearing things I've never heard before in music with which I have intimate familiarity. It's like I need to re-listen to my entire (500GB+, mostly flac) collection just to assess recording quality. Seriously, if you are reading this review, just stop and order these immediately. It's impossible to find words to adequately convey just how great these are. As far as comfort goes, these are just fabulous... I have large ears and they surround and pamper like no other. The leather carrying case is a nice bonus. Just a 10 out of 10... not many things in life about which that can be said. BUY NOW!!!
031603438X|5.0|This memoir, written with the help of writer James Fox, is an intricately detailed account of Keith Richards life, both in and out of music-but mostly in.  All the stories are here-the funny, the touching, the horrendous, and the amazing.  Some are well known, some weren't even known to Richards-he only hears later, from others who were with him, what went on.  And he's put it all in this book.  Included are 32 pages of b&w and color photographs (including one of the band, with Jagger driving, in a vintage red convertible, across the Brooklyn Bridge) in two groups, plus photos throughout the book itself chronicling Richards' life.  Also of interest is an early diary that Richards kept detailing the bands early gigs and impressions of the music the band played.<br /><br />Richards has been known as many things-\\"the human riff\\", as some kind of prince of a dark underworld filled with drugs, booze, and skull rings, as \\"Keef\\", a rock 'n' roll pirate, as someone who should be dead (several times over) from massive drug use and other lifestyle choices, and as someone hounded by law enforcement-looking to incarcerate this bad example to all the kids.  But Richards is also known as a settled (for him) family man.  But somehow he's survived it all.  And now, with this autobiography, he's letting us into his life.  This book looks back at all the times-good, bad, and just plain strange.<br /><br />Beginning with Richards' boyhood in post-war England, no stone is left unturned in detailing his young life.  A life which changed forever with his discovery of American blues.  From that era the book details the formation of THE ROLLING STONES (I would like to have learned more about Brian Jones' in relation to the formation of the group), which changed his life again-a life he continues to the present.<br /><br />This book is important, interesting, and at times, harrowing, with a myriad of details surrounding Richards, his band, and anyone caught up in their universe of music, good times, misery, drugs, violence, and just plain weirdness.  But the book also shows another side of Keith Richards.  The pain he felt (and still feels) when his young son Tara, died while Richards was on tour.  The loss of musician and friend/band hanger-on, Gram Parsons.  Looking back with regret as people close to him sunk into a hellish pit of drug addiction.  And Richards' own account of his years of drug use-especially heroin and the misery he brought on himself, even while he was careful not to go to far over the edge.<br /><br />Of course no memoir concerning Richards would be complete without accounts of the ups and downs, over many years, with Mick Jagger.  There's a number of fascinating asides and insights concerning their ideas of what direction the band should follow.  Unfortunately, but not surprising, Jagger (and the other band members) are not heard from.  That's unfortunate because of all the valuable insight concerning Richards' life on and off the stage, and the inner workings of one of the world's greatest rock 'n' roll bands, that his long time band mates could bring to the story.  But others who have known Richards over the course of many years were interviewed.  People like Ronnie Spector, Jim Dickinson, Andrew Oldham, Bobby Keys, and a number of fellow musicians and friends, all have telling bits and pieces to add to the overall picture of just who Richards is.<br /><br />The detail Richards and Fox have put into this well written memoir is almost staggering.  Reading about the early days of the band is exciting and fascinating, if for no other reason the era they came up in is long since vanished.  The discovery and idolization of musicians like Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed, Slim Harpo, and other blues greats, trying to emulate the hard scrabble lifestyles of American blues artists, the small scruffy clubs the band played in the beginning, living in abject poverty and squalor, the large concerts in later years, the songs, the albums, the drugs, and the many fascinating (and sometimes disgusting) characters that drift in and out of Richards' life-it's all here.  And taken together, this is a story only Keith Richards could live (and survive) to write about in such detail.<br /><br />While there have been other decent books on Richards and/or the Stones, for the straight, unvarnished truth, as he sees it and lived it, this is the book that matters.  This memoir, written in a Richards-to-you conversational style, is interesting, exciting, gritty, informative, harrowing, and important.  And with this book, written in his own words, we can't get much closer to the man and his life than that.and sometimes disgusting) characters that drift in and out of Richards' life-it's all here.

B0040HJNKC|5.0|Though Buddy dedicates this CD to the fact that he's *SEVENTY-FOUR-YEARS-OLD*... his one of a kind electric blues performance says more than words can ever hope to... that he is absolutely ageless. His emanating power... song selection... which melds lyrics... voice... and mind boggling electrical guitar dominance... speaks of a man one-third his age with blues talent that has to come straight from the Lord. Way before you've even finished listening to this instant electric blues classic for the first time... a true lover of electric blues is thinking and praying way past the obvious next move of playing it again... you're selfishly dreaming of his next CD.<br /><br />His voice and enthusiasm are a marvel  unto itself... and as a lifetime electric blues lover I can wholeheartedly say that the way he bends the strings and squeezes out a sound... that one can easily imagine being similar to a muscular blacksmith or iron worker reshaping steel girders into musical electric blues with the mere strength of his hands.<br /><br />1) 74 YEARS YOUNG - Buddy tells you \\"WHEN IT COMES TO LOVIN I AIN'T EVER DONE. I'M SEVENTY-FOUR-YEARS-YOUNG\\". His power will make anyone a believer.<br /><br />2) THANK ME SOMEDAY - This has a John Lee Hooker \\"Boom-Boom\\" beat and Buddy proceeds to tell you the story of his youth in Louisiana.<br /><br />3) ON THE ROAD - Foot tapping-guitar snapping. *CARS/MY BABY/THUNDER & LIGHTNING-UNDER-THE-HOOD* on the road. Coincidentally there's *THUNDER & LIGHTNING* in Buddy's guitar.<br /><br />4) STAY AROUND A LITTLE LONGER - Soft, sweet and mellow. Buddy and B.B. King. Reminiscent of B.B.'s CD \\"Blues On The Bayou\\". Note: the video (not part of this CD package) is priceless with the body language and expressions of these two blues titans. Telling each other that they both sound good and they're buddies.<br /><br />5) KEY DON'T FIT - Electric blues power at full throttle! Buddy's voice has been to the fountain of youth, and he must have super human strength... because he snaps those guitar strings like they're molten steel girders.<br /><br />6) LIVING PROOF - Roadhouse-stomping-blues. *SNARLING GUITAR* with background chorus reminiscent of Ray Charles's Raeletts. You could bottle up the kinetic energy in this song and light an entire city!<br /><br />7) WHERE THE BLUES BEGINS - With Carlos Santana. A straight blues ballad.<br /><br />8) TOO SOON - Back to foot stomping. Almost like the sound Jerry Lee Lewis would make if he played a guitar instead of a piano.<br /><br />9) EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GO - A ballad very similar to *SKIN DEEP*. A very good searing guitar.<br /><br />10) LET THE DOOR KNOB HIT YA - Rockin' blues with Buddy telling you like only Buddy can... TO GET OUT! \\"LET THE DOOR KNOB HIT YA... MY DAMx DOG SHOULDA BIT YA!\\"<br /><br />11) GUESS WHAT - Want to know what blues guitar **SHOULD-SOUND LIKE?** Then listen to this. \\"SMELL LIKE A RAT\\" \\"GUESS WHAT? YOUR LITTLE SISTER WANTS TO TRY ME ON!\\" Buddy is an unleashed electric blues dynamo!<br /><br />12) SKANKY - If you doubt anything I've said about Buddy's string bending guitar PREEMINENCE  listen to this instrumental. Three sounds to keep in your soul whenever you dream of the way an electric blues guitar should sound: **ALBERT KING** - **STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN** - **BUDDY GUY**they're molten steel girders.     6) LIVING PROOF - Roadhouse-stomping-blues. *SNARLING GUITAR* with background chorus reminiscent of Ray Charles's Raeletts.

B0048IMZMG|5.0|I have been a fan of her music since the first time I heard her voice, and had been anxiously waiting for her new songs to come out. Finally they're here and I've already fallen in love with this new album by simply listening to the previews. What I love more is the price! I guess I was lucky when I didn't have the app to download it directly to my phone this morning at the time the price was still $8.00. Now I finally got home and ready to do so with the computer, the price has dropped to $3.99!! Such a price for such a great album, NO KIDDING!! What are you waiting for??

1742140610|4.0|This is a teenage coming of age book with all the silliness that goes along with teenagers.  I loved the reader (Edwina Wren) because she nailed the differences between an   Oklahoma and a Texan accent and you could tell by her voice inflection who was speaking.  The boy characters sounded different than the girls, which doesn't happen in books 4 or 6. Marked, Betrayed and Chosen are all read by Edwina Wren and delightful because she reads it.  The next audio books aren't worth it and should definitely be read instead of listened to.  I returned the audio books for Book 4 and 6 to the library and went and got the actual books instead.  Tempted sounds like it's being read by a 10 year old which really isn't appropriate when the book talks about juggling 3 boyfriends. Not really something you want to hear a 10 year old discuss.  Anyway, I have enjoyed the books even though I'm now on the paperbacks instead of the audio.
1416589473|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Guild Wars series ever since the release of the first game. The part I liked most about the games where they actually had a set story you had to follow. With all the hype of Guild Wars 2 coming out I stumbled upon this book and pre-ordered it. The book sat in my room for a while and I finally decided to read it.    I loved story of this book. Learning about the new Sylvari race and what happened to some of the heros you ran into in the original games was very fulfilling. I loved how the different races lived up to their hatred and towards the end of the story overcame it. To me the book ended too early. From reading some other reviews and a google search showed me this is supposed to be a series of books. I'm not sure if the next is actually supposed to pick up where this one left off, or if we will learn more in Guild Wars 2. I just hope we hear about how their journey back goes and the outcome of Ascalon City. Plus what the outcome of their achievement brings.    Now I can't wait for Guild Wars 2 to come out even more!

B001B7CNY2|1.0|In my opinion, the film disrespects the REAL man and women involved. USA love to change history to please its own people even its its to change heros and make them American. Ok alot of British have complained about the facts but concider this: if a worldwide release of a historical movie was made making George Washington an evil man or having japanese play the roles of the men that landed on the moon giving pride to be japanese or events at pearl harbour being british and not american. Do you think you would like it? enough said!  I am American and love History but find it upsetting when hollywood makes films but dosent give the credit to anyone other that the Americans. Americans helped alot in WWII but actually it was the joint efforts of most nations hench it was called world war?!? the unsung heros are actually the russians, they fought the nazi hard,if they didnt fight the nazis we'd be screwed, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\" is billed as a vampire horror film and I am not a horror movie fan. Even so, this is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  There is some blood and gore, but much of the gore is off camera and the blood seems only that which is necessary to support the story line.  In the end, the \\"horror\\" aspects of this film are subsidiary to the main theme, which centers on the relationship between the two main characters: Oskar and Eli.    Oskar is a 12 year old boy, whose parents are separated.  He lives with his mother in an apartment complex in a town in Sweden and also makes occasional visits to his father.  For the most part, he is ignored by his parents.  He has limited social skills and no friends at school, where he is bullied by several male classmates.  All of this leaves Oskar feeling very isolated.    One cold winter night in the yard outside his apartment, Oskar meets Eli, who has recently moved into the apartment next door and appears to be a girl about Oskar's age.  There is something not quite right about Eli and the viewer soon learns that she is a vampire, a fact that is not apparent to Oskar until much later in the film.  Eli lives with a caretaker, a man who appears to be about a generation and one-half older than she.  His main function is to provide Eli with what any vampire needs to survive - a supply of human blood.  The film does not explain the background of the relationship between Eli and her caretaker, but, in any event, the caretaker is out of the story midway through the film, which means that Eli is then as alone and isolated as Oskar.    Initially, Eli tells Oskar that she cannot be his friend, but, as the movie progresses, these two lonely souls form a friendship which steadily grows.  By the end, there is a bond of devoted friendship and love between the two.  The love is not sexual in nature, but love nevertheless because any truly loving relationship is built on friendship.  The film demonstrates in no uncertain terms what real friendship and love mean: never doing anything to harm one another; doing whatever is necessary to assure that a friend is safe and secure; and, if necessary, being willing to give up everything, if that what the friend needs for his or her survival.  Can any movie convey a message that is as sweet and poignant as this?    The cinematography is excellent, beautifully displaying the cold Swedish winter, with stark white landscapes.  This seems to emphasize Oskar's and Eli's isolation.  Also, the musical score is great -- a rich and wonderful compliment to the story.        I recently acquired my copy of this DVD by buying it at a nearby Blockbuster store that was closing and liquidating its inventory.  I learned, after my purchase, that I have the earlier version of the DVD that does not have the \\"theatrical\\" subtitles.  I have watched the movie twice - once with English subtitles and once with the dubbed English audio.  If you do find yourself with the earlier version of this disk and are watching the dubbed audio, also turn on the \\"English Narrative Subtitles,\\" which give subtitled translations to various notes and other written matter which is not orally translated by the dubbed voices.

0767802470|5.0|I had never seen the original, so I rented this movie from Netflix and halfway through the first viewing I decided I had to have my own copy of it.  You quickly forget that these submariners are German and become involved in the drama of life aboard a U-boat and the personal relationships between the characters.  The Captain, excellently portrayed by Jurgen Prochnow, realizes early on in their mission that his superiors, supposedly in charge, have little idea of what they're doing; resulting in confused orders, orders that never arrive or arrive too late, and tragic consequences for the soldiers and submariners caught in the middle. The dedication of the crew in keeping their \\"Boot\\" in working condition, and the mind-numbing boredom during the intervals between battles, are vividly brought to life.  I won't spoil the ending, only to say that after all the effort expended by these young men (the average age is 18 and the Captain himself was only 30) to get their crippled ship home, the result is a heartbreaking tragedy.  The English dubbing is very well-done, although I recommend watching the movie in German with English subtitles--there are a lot of subtleties and nuances that are lost in the translation.  Five Stars and more!

B00009W0U4|4.0|The brutality in this movie begins almost from the start. It is in the form of revenge. The reason for the revenge is a rape; brutal and violent in itself. Neither episodes are for the visually faint-hearted. Yet the innovation in this film is to reverse the entire sequence of events in this short period of life (assumed to be a day or two). There are vignettes; like the scene on the metro-train when 'she' is explaining to a friend what a woman sometimes likes in love-making from her man. This has nothing to do with violence. In short, the film is not for the squeamish, it is disturbing at times and yet, sometimes, this is what cinema should be.    Ian Hunter.  Author of [[ASIN:1618976222 The Early Years]]

B003WTE886|5.0|After reading about all of the speculation regarding the songs on this album, I was eager to hear what all the fuss was about. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Mine\\". Admittedly, the first time that I heard it, I figured that this album was going to be very similar to Fearless. \\"Sparks Fly\\" didn't shake my opinion, as it is one of her older songs. With \\"Back to December\\", however, Swift started to exceed my expectations with a song that is apologetic rather than self-righteous or lovestruck, showing her maturation both personally and musically. This same depth is reflected in the lyrics for \\"Haunted\\" and \\"Last Kiss\\", which will probably get a fair amount of play in the car.<br /><br />For those expecting the standard country-pop fare, you may or not be happy with Swift's new sound. One online reviewer compared the style of \\"Haunted\\" to Evanescence, and on some level, I have to agree. \\"Dear John\\" pokes fun at *someone's* usual guitar riffs, \\"Speak Now\\" is reminiscent of Feist, while \\"Innocent\\" makes me think of Imogen Heap for some odd reason. Swift is clearly experimenting, which makes sense as her wider range of emotions require a music that matches the words. Throughout, however, she maintains the honesty that won her her original following.<br /><br />I love this album. It is by far her best, personal drama notwithstanding. (She's still a bit pitchy, but noticeably less so than before.)
1567184855|5.0|The answers to the universe inside one book cover?  Yes.  Yes.  YES.<br /><br />I have studied all types of spiritual works over the years, all religions, all pathways to more or less degree. To read something this new, with insights so fresh, yet so intrinsically right is beyond refreshing. In fact, it is staggering. This book is so intriguing and then it simply \\"snaps\\" all of the pieces into place.  The entire time I read it, I looked forward to ordering his next book, \\"Destiny of Souls\\", yet when the time came, I could not leave this book behind.  I simply had to read it again.<br /><br />Are these new ideas, or are they memories? Could it feel so \\"right\\" because we all have these memories in our souls?  Find out for yourself.<br /><br />It feels like you know the secret when things come up in life that others just do not know.  I now have a framework to fill in the gaps of previously incomprehensible notions like violence, or the makeup of the universe, even death of the young or the things neither science nor religion fully explain.  I urge you to read this book, as I have done my personal friends.  It may bring you peace.

Everyone makes nothing but stupid mistakes at every turn and then cries that they messed up. In this book alone he steals from Darth Bane, The Dragon lance Chronicles, Lord of the Rings, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and others that I can't remember off the top of my head. The only reason I read this one was to get it off my list of unread books. It was flat out terrible. If you liked it, try reading one of the books he stole from and you will realize just how bad of a job he did.<br />SPOILERS!!!!!<br />Ok, these are some of my major complaints about stupid people in the book, but I don't want to give it away if you have yet to read it.<br />Brom is his dad, like no one saw that comming.<br />His old teacher guy kills himself by going to battle when he was incapable.<br />The Varden leader almost dies from like half a dozen cuts.<br />Eragon magically gets a new sword and it is the best one ever made, what a happy coincidence.<br />Roran getting in touble, he knocks up Katryena before the wedding.<br />And every body casts really pitiful spells and are astounded that they do nothing of value.<br />Seriously, Eragon is nearly bested by like five dwarf assassins even though he noticed them before they attacked.<br />This book makes me lose faith in humanity.
B003WTE886|4.0|On its surface, not much about Speak Now is that different from Fearless. Swift still prefers to write about her own broken love stories, the production is still a glossy pop-rock with only the faintest of country tinge to harken back to her roots, and Swift herself is still as dead-to-rights honest as she's always been. But this isn't the Taylor Swift of Fearless; millions of record sales and high-profile hook-ups have hardened Swift from the effervescent free spirit of \\"You Belong With Me\\" to the regret-filled apology that is \\"Back to December\\" and the raw heart and feeling behind \\"Last Kiss,\\" a song that would've been impossible on a record like Fearless. It's hard to imagine that this is a girl who has yet to even turn 21, but already has the experience and self-confidence to pen a firebreather like \\"Dear John\\" and not sound utterly contrived. These aren't the musings of an invisible Swedish svengali looking to find some choice lyrics to match to his next chart-topping hit - Swift has seen the world that comes with superstardom, and for all those who complained that Fearless was a one-dimensional teenage love affair, Speak Now takes that experience and wallops the critics with it. Swift can write, and perhaps no song signifies that more than \\"Dear John,\\" evidently directed after that man-whore of the female singer/songwriter world, John Mayer. Swift beats the heartbreaker at his own game, throwing darts like \\"all the girls that you've run dry with tired, lifeless eyes `cuz you burned them out / but I took your matches before fire could catch me so don't look now / I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town\\" while a bluesy electric guitar swells underneath in a ironic parody of Mayer's own genre of choice.<br /><br />No longer is Swift rushing blindly into love or advising other girls to look to their futures - heck, it's hard to believe that Taylor Swift has become jaded enough to pen a song like \\"Never Grow Up.\\" It's the antithesis to Fearless' maturity anthem \\"Fifteen,\\" and it makes a line like \\"wish I'd never grown up\\" not the whining of a coddled pop star but the distress of any college-age kid whose realizing that yes, this is real life and they'd better find a plan for it quick before it comes to kick them in the ass. This is Swift's truest accomplishment, finding that chord in a lyric or hook that strikes a universal note, and pairing it to some of the most gorgeous, effortless arrangements around. Arrangements that, let it be said, stretch Swift's boundaries more than would seem to even be necessary, but nevertheless succeed in framing Swift's voice with a punk rock vibe here (\\"Better Than Revenge\\") or a dash of chamber pop there (\\"Haunted\\"). And that voice? It just might be the unsung hero behind everything here, showing a remarkably improved power and versatility that many thought lacking in her previous releases. I'm not sure the Taylor Swift of Fearless could pull off a slow burning blues kiss off like \\"Dear John;\\" here, she does it like she belongs, standing up in a backwoods bar telling off a dirtbag lover to a sweaty crowd. That signature lilt of hers, meanwhile, that cutesy up-and-down accompanied no doubt by a flicker of the lashes, has never been better, and it takes only perfunctory listens to songs like the title track or \\"Mine\\" to verify that this is Swift at the peak of her abilities.<br /><br />This so easily could have been just more of the same. Small-town pop star makes good, follows up with a safe album to satisfy her legion of fans and critics. Indeed, Speak Now is not something out of the ordinary for Swift, not so out of her comfort zone as to applaud her as a visionary pop artist in the Gaga vein. But will I ever know what is going on behind an artist like Gaga's façade, or what the hell she's even thinking at any given moment? This is Swift's trump card over any pop artist in the new decade, and it's one that Speak Now uses like a pro. No one has been able to replicate the personal experience so well and so universally as Swift, translating her celebrity loves and fears into the everyman's experience with the ease of a songwriter with decades of experience on her belt. Swift isn't able to even legally buy a drink in her home country yet, but I'll be damned if she isn't already shaping up as the voice of her generation.well and so universally as Swift, translating her celebrity loves and fears into the everyman's experience with the ease of a songwriter with decades of experience on her belt.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Ironman 2 is a great sequel to the original 2008 film. Rarely do sequel's equal or even come close to being as successful as their predecesor, but in this case Ironman 2 lived up to the hype. The introduction of new characters was well done, too. The sequel is basically set around the idea that Tony Stark's Ironman suit is slowly killing him due to the elements that comprise it. Robert Downey Jr's character, Tony Stark is in a fight against time to try and find a replacement element, which initially doesn't exist. The backdrop to this is that Mickey Rourke's character, Ivan Vanko, a Russian physicist has developed his own suit of destruction. The goverment is also after Tony wanting him to hand over the Ironman suit. Gary Shandling plays Sen. Stern who is leading the investigation into trying to claim the suit.<br />  I haven't see Gary Shandling in a movie or on TV in a very long time, and I can say I didn't miss him. The guy has spent too much time and money on botox or some other facial surgery because he actually looks plastic. Very scary, his face alone could have been a villian.<br />  It was nice seeing John Favreau gave Gwyneth Paltrow's characer, Pepper Potts a lot more freedom in this film as well. Her character is given the keys to the Stark Industries kingdom by Tony himself, temporarily of course. It was also nice to see the director in more scenes that involved dialogue, John Favreau was a great actor before becoming a great director. Other actors who include Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell and Samual Jackson round out this great cast of quality actors.<br />  I enjoyed seeing Scarlett Johansson in a tight body suit as the very hot, and very sexy spy, Black Widow aka, Natalie Rushman. She is a great actress and really brought a lot to the movie, besides playing a spy who works for Samual Jackson's character, Nick Fury, she handled the action/fight scenes with ease. I'm sure the lovely Scarlett spent many hours at a gym working on kung fu/karate moves for the part.<br />  The only real gripe I had were two separate issues. The first being the lack of fight scenes with Rourke's character. Robert Donwey Jr. and Mickey Rourke only share the screen for a small amount of time. The race car scene with Tony was good, as he was inroduced to Vank's character, their fight is brief, but some what exciting. At the end of the movie, Ironman and War Machine are in a fight with Vanko. There is a lot of down time in between, in which I felt more fight scenes could have been possible. Speaking of War Machine, Cheadle's character was excellent, there was no drop off with the absense of Terrence Howard, as Don Cheadle himself is a great actor.<br />  The other issue I had was the prolonged and somewhat unnecessary fight scene between Ironman and War Machine at Tony's casa. A scene which escalated out of conrol over Cheadle's insistance that Downey's Ironaman suit needs to be turned over to the goverment. I don't mind a good fight, even at the expense of some damage, but this was totally over board. It got kind of stupid quick.<br />  Overall, I would highly recommend the movie. The film ends well too, there were two possible scenarios that Marvel can go with character development after this 2nd installment of Ironman. I think a 3rd Ironman is very possible, I think Marvel needs to act on it quick as Downey isn't getting any younger. Both my kids loved this movie, as did my wife and I. On a scale of 1-10, I would give this movie a solid 9.<br />  Hope this review helps.the part.       The only real gripe I had were two separate issues.

B002VECM72|5.0|If we saw a movie with this story from an original screenplay, critics and the more cynical movie fans would bombard it with comments about how sappy and unbelievable it was. Sorry, you cynical lot, that just can't happen here because this is a true story, and from what I've read of the actual people involved, told rather forthrightly for a Hollywood biopic.<br /><br />Here a wealthy family in Memphis, through an unlikely series of circumstance and happenstance, meet and befriend a very large teenager from the mean side of town. His family history a chaotic mess, his life a series of guest appearances in other people's homes, Michael Oher finds the first stability and real love he's ever experienced with the family who took him in. The story of their acceptance and his, and his success in his new environment, is nothing short of motivational.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Both Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw (yes, Tim McGraw ... the scene where he talks about The Charge of the Light Brigade is inspired) give strong performances as the well to do couple. The script plays on the feisty element of Mrs. Touhy's character for both dramatic effect and laughs, and pulls both sides off very successfully. If the real lady is half of what the film portrayed, she's still a force of nature. :-) My guess is that she is more than what the film portrayed, as the film can only show the highlights of what was certainly a tough road to travel for quite a while.<br /><br />After getting to know the family thru the performances of the cast, the real family photos shown in the closing credits are quite a treat, and all alone give you a sense of the accuracy of the movie you just witnessed. The Touhy's give a great example of how families should deal with each other, and how they can make a difference when they reach out to help others with selflessness and true compassion. It is a great and true example that we should all take to heart.

The thing is though is that somehow his life with his wife (now dead) is somehow involved in the missing patient, Ashcliffe, Shutter Island and more...<br /><br />This book kept me guessing...and as soon as I thought I had it all figured out it threw me a curve ball. I couldn't put this one down! During the middle of the book I got a little restless with it just because it was a little confusing and a little crazy, but it picked back up soon enough! This was a great scary story read for Halloween...now I can't wait to see the movie!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I have read a lot of the reviews that gave this product 3 or less stars.  I have to say I haven't really had any of their problems.      The system was very easy to set up. Once set up it was simply pushing the power button on headset and I was in business.  I have had these headphones for a little over 7 months and have never had a synchronizing issue.  I did have an issue with occasional Pops when I first got them. The issue resolved when I switched rooms and I'm further from my router now. I have not had any pops or crackles in my headset in the 2 months I've been in my new room.  I use rechargeable batteries and they last me about 10 hours of playtime.  I usually just have one set charging and one in the set and I put in the freshly charged set before I sit down to play so I don't have to worry about them cutting out. They are also very very comfortable for long gaming sessions.    I have the X11's as well and I have to say I can't use them after using the x41's. The sound is muffled in comparison and the chat hiss on the x11s gets very annoying to me after having virtually no hiss on the x41s (only time I hear a hiss is if I have the chat volume on max and the game volume turned down, if you find the perfect balance you won't notice any hiss).    The sound is incredible and you do get a sense of surround sound.  I have (to my embarrasement) turned my head to investigate a sound behind me on several occasions while using these.

B002ZG98LO|3.0|Eight toughs of different nationalities (including one woman) are dropped from the sky into a strange jungle.  They quickly discover that apart from the fact that none of them have any idea where they are they also have a few other things in common.  They are all being hunted, by a seemingly unstoppable menace.  Plus, they are no longer on Earth.<br /><br />Each of them is ruthless, each a hunter - except for an apparently hapless and helpless doctor who just seems out of place.  The toughest and smartest of them all is the guy played by a muscled up Adrian Brody, who thinks like the predators because he is one: a special-ops assassin who's gone off the grid and loves what he does.  The film makes a big deal of the analogy between the men and the alien predators who've abducted them and placed them in what amounts to a massive hunting ground.<br /><br />It's what you expect.  Kind of scary, a bit kookie, but intense.  The acting is fine, and the cleverest bit is a cameo by a seriously messed up Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  The planet doesn't feel entirely real: apart from the jungle, that looks just like an Earth jungle, and the CGI sky, there are about 3 settings that all feel like sets.  As a whole, too, the movie doesn't quite make much sense - of course it doesn't really need to since it's supposed to be an escapist thriller about alien killers - but ... if they are the ultimate killing machines they are supposed to be, how come they aren't all that smart when it comes to strategy?  The thing about the predators is that they are a perfect combination of utterly primitive and technologically advanced.  They are a brutal race, who like to display the dismembered corpses of their victims as trophies, but at the same time have managed to create amazing technology.  Still, this is not bad as a reboot of the series, and the idea of strange beasts from all over the cosmos being adducted as prey and brought to their jungle is pretty intriguing.  It's nearly enough to take you back to the original intrigue of the concept and erase the memories of the downright wasted celluloid of [[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2]], and the [[ASIN:B0015OLMH0 Alien Versus Predator]] series (all of which this film works to ignore - wisely making reference only to the original [[ASIN:B00005221L film]]).  Nothing profound here, but it kept me watching.back to the original intrigue of the concept and erase the memories of the downright wasted celluloid of [[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2]], and the [[ASIN:B0015OLMH0 Alien Versus Predator]] series (all of which this film works to ignore - wisely making reference only to the original [[ASIN:B00005221L film]]).

B001AQO3QA|5.0|For the first time, the contact time of the film is shaped in the cable channel HBO. Was the feeling that the original horror film can also be loaded onto the space! This film in terms of picture and sound created by the indignant on all created scientific films past precedent! to-market when the second episode, of course I went to see it the first time, after reading, I feel only a surprise! shaped this second episode I saw a total of four times in the theater, and the remaining is to bring friends to see it three times, each time to the end of the film, the cinema's audience, like me, the excitement, applaud! So when VIDEO launch comes, of course, not running out of my collection of it! However, in the third, released in Episode IV, I felt a little disappointed! turned out to be for the director! so this whole story coherence, and coordination is not always felt this is the only fly in the ointment place! but Finally, the heroine finally returned to Earth! can be considered for this story painted on a perfect symbol!!   Now, the film has finally launched the BLU-RAY version! I was looking forward to!

B003WTE886|5.0|I already know Speak Now is going to be a big seller. Taylor has done it again for round three. I've already played this album in the car, and even my grandma likes it. It's great that Taylor wrote all the songs on this album, because not many in her age range can. I think she is one of the most talented artists out there right now. This album is one of my favorites of 2010. My favorite songs on Speak Now are:<br />1. Mine<br />2. Back To December<br />3. Enchanted<br />4. Innocent<br />5. Mean<br />6. Haunted<br />7. Long Live<br />I also like all the bonus songs on the Target Deluxe Edition. I think you should buy the Target version, if you can. The extra songs are worth the cost. I wouldn't be surprised if Speak Now would debut on the Billboard 200 with the most copies sold in 2010 the first week out.

B0000025D0|5.0|Over the years Bruce Springsteen's reasoning for following up his street survivor classic (and breakthrough) album [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]] with this have been speculated on again and again. Whether or not it had to do with the well known legal battles or self reflection or a combination of the two this album couldn't be anymore different an album than the three who came before it. Of course I personally could understand how Bruce might've been feeling around this time. As a young up and commer in the early 70's he was all of a sudden on the cover of national magazines,called \\"the next Bob Dylan\\" and whatnot was not only a lot of undue pressue but was likely pretty annoying when you're trying to stake out a place in the music business. On this fourth album the E Street Band and their sound is still firing on all cylinders just as before while it's interesting to note how they are not emphasized on either the album cover in either name or person. That's interesting because \\"Badlands\\",\\"Candy Room\\",\\"The Promised Land\\" and \\"Prove It All Night\\" all showcase that distinctive, bombastic wall-of-sound heartland arena rock style Bruce patented in the era even though this is often described as a harder rocking album. The only song that musically would fit that description is the edgier \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\". Musically speaking the album is actually given over to slower epics such as \\"Rancing In The Street\\",\\"Factory\\" and the closing title song. What really makes the difference here is not so much the music but the lyrical,vocal and melodic focus. All of the songs regardless of sound and tempo all have a shocked and somewhat downbeat melodic emphasis and Bruce's gruff,defiant voice has a far more disappointed and reflective tone. In these songs we find the same set of characters off roading away on the previous album,both literally and figuratively in a very real situation-forced to merely make a living in rather pointless working class lives rather than working to chase a dream. Not only was it somewhat of a new topical ground for Springsteen but also gave him a new focus for his persona: a working class bard. In his poetic style as well as the highly R&B/soul influenced style of rock n roll music he and the E Street Band made this album is very likely one of the best manifestations of his general vision and,while being every bit the flipside of what came before in many ways was easily as influential and creatively significant as his previous triumph.n working to chase a dream.

B00003CXCW|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever made, this is what film making can be like all the time if only Hollywood could get over this strange need to pump out \\"cookie cutter\\" movie A, B, or C. This film has no high speed car chases, boobs, or explosions. This films beauty and strenght comes from great writting,directing,casting and acting. The film compells you to continue watching, it has everything any \\"modern\\" movie has, love and manipulation, co-dependant relasionships, jelousy, deception, dreams, dispare, and more. I hope this film is transfered on to blu-ray it can only make watching even better.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is so epic. Its like the best gore of any show and its more provocative than any skinamax show, and 300 is it's b&*%&
0525951652|3.0|I enjoyed the book but felt like too many names were introduced in the book.  I never knew if this was going to be a significant character later on or if the name was just being mentioned.  It was hard to get to know the characters because the scenes changed so quickly from one person to the next.  I learned more about World War I but felt the author spent too much time on the events of the war rather than telling an interesting story.  I was glad when the book was over because it was so long.  I don't know if the next book will have all the same characters but I am not sure I will remember them anyway.
8862933851|5.0|I've been using the annual versions of this calendar/diary/notebook for five years.  A good size for a shirt pocket, it is flexible so it stands up to a year's worth of being stuffed into pockets, bags, other carry-all's.  The construction seems sturdy.  The design and lay-out are good.  The built-in bookmark and elastic closure are very useful.  It has enough daily entry space for my not-so-busy life.  If you assign your time in 10-minute slices you should seek another (Moleskine) product.
B003WTE886|5.0|Let me start with this...I became an admirer of Taylor's work begrudgingly, via a friend who said she was really powerpop, not country...and I was hesitant at first because she got popular on country radio and had country hits, and her first single was called \\"Tim McGraw\\"...and I HATE Tim McGraw, the epitome of bad radio-oriented cookiecutter country slop.  BUT when I heard Taylor's debut album, I was utterly charmed, and yeah, I would call her music \\"country powerpop\\" because she has that GOOD country charm (I love alt-country and good pop tunefulness and Taylor merges the two very well) and a great pop sensibility that cannot be denied...there is also a natural brightness to her tunes...so her self-titled debut album was quite impressive and charmed the pants off of me and proved herself as an artist to watch...I landed up getting the Target deluxe CD/DVD edition, which even had a fun radio conversation between Taylor and Tim McGraw himself.<br /><br />Then the Walmart \\"Beautiful Eyes\\" EP/DVD which is a nice piece and the Target Christmas EP which is pretty cool.  THEN the real step 2, \\"Fearless\\", comes out next and it was a nice artistic progression from album #1...\\"Love Story\\" knocked my socks off completely as that is one killer powerpop gem...it's not a 100% PERFECT album, but it's a great step forward with some real gems as singles...\\"You Belong With Me\\" is a charming powerpoppy number which did not hit me at first (I was shocked it got picked as a single, really) but grew on me and utterly got killed on the radio but survived in the end...it was even performed on Idol Season 8 semifinal rounds before it was a single too, again, surprised how the song's status turned out.  THEN, she did CMT Crossroads with Def Leppard, one of my (and Taylor's) fave bands, and the DVD from the show was pretty awesome...then the Deluxe Platinum Edition comes out with many new songs...all good if not her best work, nice to add to her catalogue.  Then all the awards came flowing in and the Kanye dis...which Taylor survived with dignity and grace.<br /><br />Now, just out this week, after fans like me were clamoring at the bit, is Taylor's 3rd opus, \\"Speak Now\\"...aside from the cover which rips off the debut EP by young US girlgroup trio The Clique Girlz...who only achieved success in Japan...BUT the Target edition cover is better because the dress is strawberry jam red and not purple like the Clique Girlz EP cover...compare it...similar design and layout, same scripted font...but Taylor's cover (which she clearly designed...she got the credit) is better anyway, takes it to the final conclusion...aside from that, Taylor evolves even further as she wrote all 14 tracks...and I think the 3 extra outtakes on the bonus disc...no cowriters, no covers, no corporate intrusion...the way all records should be...Taylor even coproduced the album as well...which is also impressive...she was 100% hands on this baby, and man, the results are totally impressive...<br /><br />This record PROVES Taylor Swift is here to stay, and I hate to compare, but she is clearly this generation's equivalent of Bob Dylan, or at least Kurt Cobain...she is not at his place yet BUT she is getting there by leaps and bounds...so far she is easily THE voice of her generation and her younger fans are growing with Taylor and view her as their best friend, their voicebox, their spokesperson...and her writing on this record endears her even more to them...it doesn't hurt that this is, BY FAR, Taylor's best record yet...the songs are all exceptionally catchy and charming (not annoying), the styles diverse, her writing growing and expanding, her voice maturing, everything is right on this record, and the fact she was 100% behind it...her label Big Machine might as well hand over all operations and office keys to Taylor too, or at least make her a partner...she knows EXACTLY what she is doing and who she is as an artist, and the label clearly has 100% trust in her too because they werehands off.<br /><br />Now the songs...wow...some are reminiscent of past works in a good way, not like she was relying on a formula or anything...but then again, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, just build on it...catchy gems like \\"Mine\\", \\"Sparks Fly\\" and \\"Speak Now\\" sound like radio hits but are impressive as songs themselves.  BUT she expands her artistic range on songs like the utterly beautiful \\"Back To December\\" (supposedly for Taylor Lautner), the catchy and fun powerpop rockers \\"The Story Of Us\\" (a BIG favourite here) and \\"Better Than Revenge\\", the adorable poppy bluegrassy \\"Mean\\", and the parodic acousticky bluesy \\"Dear John\\" (which is supposedly about John Mayer...whom I HAVE met outside the Union Square Virgin Megastore in NYC when it was around...he was shopping...he was cool to me but apparently NOT cool with poor Taylor's heart), and the moving forgiveness note for Kanye West \\"Innocent\\"...but what's remarkable about Taylor's songwriting is that they MAY be about specific people and events in her life, but she makes them sound universal and that they can be applied to other people and times, like her fans and their lives...not an easy feat, and the songs are so well written, and there is zero filler, and not one song is a highlight over another, and there are no skippable tracks!!!  NONE!!  It's like, I played the record, top to bottom, and I couldn't just go back to specific songs...I would have had to play the whole thing over again, all 67+ minutes!!!  The sequence is perfect as well.  My only minor quibble is that her 2010 soundtrack single \\"Today Was A Fairytale\\" from her movie \\"Valentine's Day\\" was not included, not even as a bonus track on the Target edition (many soundtrack cuts are included on artist's later-released works, and there was no way to know then if it would have been on \\"Speak Now\\", if I had the answer then, I would have bought the soundtrack back in February), but I'll just have to buy the soundtrack and many fans have that song and soundtrack anyway...so no biggie, more room for more fresh Taylor tunes...and after hearing \\"Speak Now\\" top-to-bottom, it may not have fit artistically anyway.<br /><br />And ya know what's scary??  This is only album #3 and it may not even be her best-ever work!!  Taylor could easily progress even more and put out even BETTER stuff!!!  Count on this possibly selling 1 million copies in week 1 and winning some more Grammys!!!  The next record she might even land up playing all the instruments on it, engineering it herself, being the sole producer...she could be like Prince even.<br /><br />Taylor, all I say is Bravo and \\"Speak Now\\" is a contender for best album of 2010...impressed completely.<br /><br />WOW!!ongs...wow...some are reminiscent of past works in a good way, not like she was relying on a formula or anything...but then again, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, just build on it...catchy gems like \\"Mine\\", \\"Sparks Fly\\" and \\"Speak Now\\" sound like radio hits but are impressive as songs themselves.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|The \\"1\\" collection simply does not cover this period well. If you need a collection for the car, this will work fine and price is now right. Never mind that it all fits on one 80 minute CD. I changed my mind in favor of it once I had it.<br /><br />NOTE: The first four tracks are in Mono. The Please Please Me is off the mono 2009 remastered set.
0061433047|5.0|First off, I'm a huge Pratchett fan; he's got to be in at least in the top three when it comes to my favorite authors. But of his books, the Tiffany Aching series wasn't my favorite, until now. It's like this story is the point Tiffany, and the reader, were being prepared for throughout the series. It's more mature, Tiffany is considered an adult witch, and being the witch of the Chalk isn't pretty. It's messy, and confusing, and just plain difficult. But for those like Tiffany, it's worth it. I wouldn't have thought TP's books could deliver deeper insights and wisdom than they already have, but this is in a class by itself (or with Nation).  The messages about death, gossip, hate, love, and following your dreams are just incredible. Yes, this is the last book in the series, at least it's written like it is; everything is wrapped up very nicely, very believably, but also leaves enough to the imagination. I liked Tiffany a lot better now that she's an older teen/adult (in the Chalk, a medieval-like town, those are pretty much the same thing) because she was easier to relate to. All the characters are well-developed, including two who at first seem very weak and become very powerful in their own way. Many characters have small parts, including Angua, Carrot, Vimes, Eskarina (Equal Rites), and of course, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. Even Oats (Carpe Jugulum) is mentioned.  This is a stunning, amazing book, and whether Pratchett fan or not, you should read it, because if you don't, you're missing something that's at the least very enjoyable, and at the most life changing.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have not field tested the durability of the bag in adverse conditions, but it is holding up very well under the mediocre conditions I have exposed it to. The zippers continue work great, the adjustable straps that I use to carry my tripod, snap and un-snap with relative ease. In my opinion, one of the most attractive features about this bag is the padded storage compartments inside of it. The compartments are not predetermined and are easily reconfigured using its padded Velcro dividers. In addition, the bag offers generous zippered compartments both inside and out that can be used to neatly store other essentials. This is a very well designed bag that I would certainly recommend to others.

0671449028|5.0|This book is one of our favorites. I think we read it to our 2 boys every night for about 3 years. They absolutely LOVED it. We've gone through 2 copies and I am about to order a 3rd because our 3rd son is ready for it now. I'm sure it will be a favorite of his also!!!
031603438X|5.0|The other reviewers have already done an excellent job of summarizing the topics he speaks of in the book, so I won't pile on that. I just wanted to emphasize the quality and openness and candor of this memoir.<br /><br />Many mocked his quote in the beginning that he truly remembers all of it, but it's abundantly clear that not only does he remember, but he's willing and eager to share it.<br /><br />Sure, the $7mm advance helps, but we've all read much-hyped bios that turned out to be self-congratulatory, unimpressive paper weights.<br /><br />This is not that. You will learn more about Keith than the most die hard fans do, and learn that he's far more than the caricature of a drug-abusing burned out rock star that the media often paints him out to be.<br /><br />I'm blown away.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|The story is loosely based on the novel... for anyone who have read the novel / manga, can expect a few different plot twist here and there. Still entertaining thought it's better if they can produce the movie into a trilogy so they can show more of the character's past history.    Overall, this is a must have version for fan of Kinji Fukasaku's film.

142311339X|5.0|While I was skeptical because I liked the Percy Jackson series so much and I really didn't want this to taint the fondess I developed with the characters and stories this blew my mind away!  Rick Riordan has done it again and this is his best book so far in my opinion!  It's apparent on how much research he did before/while writing this story with legends and myths coming together in an adventure that keeps you wanting more and more.  I found my self saying \\"one more chapter\\" until about 2am.  You will love how characters from the Percy Jackson series make their appearences in this book while the new set of heroes are introduced.  The story is compelling, action packed, and mysterious at the same time.  If you liked the previous series you will definately like this book and won't be able to put it down!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Harry Bosch is almost a minor character here, but his bulldog grip on digging out the facts and people behind a dangerous man is very much in evidence. He appears and disappears from the story, reappearing with witnesses no one else could find or other proofs that drive the story along. A real page-turner.
B0015DROBO|3.0|The first chapters were worth getting through, albeit a bit cumbersome, to a mystery with good plot twists.  It's sexually graphic and heinous violence prevents me from giving it five stars.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was so glad to get this.  People who complain about the music being gone aren't true fans. You don't watch the show so you can hear J Lo's latest hit in the background, you watch the show because you love Daria and she's got something meaningful to say.  I loved it and watched the whole box set in like a week. And having the movies is a nice touch.  The one thing you should watch out for is skipping on your disc; on a couple of my discs an episode would stop randomly as if on pause and after a few seconds would resume play. Also the video countdown thing hosted by Daria and Jane is dumb because it doesn't include the music videos.  I will watch the series again soon.
B002PLALCO|5.0|I am a huge P!NK fan who was devastated not to be able to take part personally in the live Funhouse Tour.  The album is one of my all-time favorites.    P!NK is a world-class entertainer, and this DVD did not disappoint.  It was a blast to watch her perform the songs from Funhouse, and of course a variety of beloved others.    If you like P!NK, you will love this DVD...
1400064287|5.0|The authors Chip Heath and Dan Heath were inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's book \\"The Tipping Point\\". After their extensive researches, they found that the ideas that \\"stick\\" all share with the six principles: Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotions and Stories. The book is an easy-to-absorb reading and entertaining at the same time. The premise of the book is that we can learn to create sticky ideas. Several examples of case studies and researches were mentioned in the book to support each author's principle.   I loved the example of the tapping exercise; you pick a song and have someone try to guess what it is through you tapping it onto a tabletop. The imbalance information made communication so frustrated. The tapper and listeners are CEOs and frontline employee, teachers and students, marketer and customers and so on.   The book is useful for those who need to communicate their idea. As someone who wants to get my point across and want to create sticky ideas, I really find the principles in the book constructive and useful. If you like Malcolm Gladwell's or Seth Godin's books, you need to read this one.

Zac Brown and company are great players - - their strength lies in the fact that they are an actual BAND, not some manufactured music machine.  Upon first listen, the album seemed a bit \\"light\\" to me. Further listens, however, have revealed some very good songs (Cold Hearted, Quiet Your Mind, Colder Weather, Who Knows & Martin) among one stunning clunker (Knee Deep - featuring Jimmy Buffett. Buffett's appeal completely escapes me. I guess you have to be real drunk to appreciate his brand of \\"music\\").  I Play The Road, Let It Go, Whiskey's Gone and Make This Day are good tunes. This is a very enjoyable album, I just wish it had a few more \\"deep\\" songs - because these guys shine best when they play it serious.  Some of the yelling is not necessary. Yelling may work when you are playing live - but it does not translate well on a studio recording.  Also, I scratched my head as to why Colder Weather and Who Knows are on this album.  They were on ZBB's previous album \\"Pass The Jar\\" - so I'm not sure why they are again featured here.  If you are a ZBB fan, you'll like this album!
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|This film has a brilliant concept. However, the writers failed to convert the concept into a viable plot.<br /><br />The plot when examined is really a contradiction of itself. The inventor of the surrogate technology, decides that it should no longer be used, because humanity is losing its soul.<br /><br />But at the same time he makes use of the very technology to champion the cause to terminate the use of the technology. Eventually, in some irrational thinking, he decides that every one that is hooked into a surrogate should be killed when he shuts down the system that manages the link-up of the surrogates. Is this the salvation that 'the Prophet' is offerring?<br /><br />There are too many loose ends and story is really a no-brainer. In my opinion, the producers made a good film at the expense to making a great film.<br /><br />The special effects are far and few, but well done, most of the time it is just very well made up persons pretending to be robots. Bruce Willis was really the only shining light in this film.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|The guy above did a wonderful job reviewing the film.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the second Noe film I've seen (the first being Irreversible).<br /><br />I just watched it 30 minutes ago in the theater and I can't sleep now.<br /><br />It's 1:58 a.m. and I have film school tomorrow at 7.<br /><br />I felt literally electrified when I walked out of the theater, my feet were jittery...<br /><br />Only way I can even try to explain the film:<br /><br />Imagine Eraserhead, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Requiem For A Dream, and Irreversible smashed together with a lot of POV shots.<br /><br />Watch this, please.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Don't let the exciting ads on television for the \\"Hereafter\\" trick you into thinking this movie is anything close to an enjoyable, interesting film, this movie is a worse disaster than the tsunami depicted in the opening scenes. To be honest, this is one the worst films I have ever seen and it was torture for me to sit through it for over two hours reading subtitles and trying to understand heavy British accents, along with other negative aspects of this film too numerous to mention.  You have already viewed the best scenes of this film (the tsunami) on the tv promos, the rest of this film belongs on the Warner Bros. garbage heap.
0307454541|3.0|I picked this book up at the local Target because I enjoy mystery and intrigue and it sounded interesting on the back cover. I read the book while commuting on the bus back and forth to work. The first couple of chapters were just too complicated and I wasn't really engaged with the characters yet. If you are going to regale me with a long history of the main family in this story, make me care about them in the first place. I gave the book a chance and continued to read (I was really close to putting the book down for good)<br /><br />The book does get interesting in parts. I won't spoil it but there are some sections that I enjoyed. In general though the book was just ok. I didn't really like the ending :(<br /><br />A disappointment but I gave it 3 stars because it did have some potential and some chapters were good. I'm not sure I'll get the next book in the trilogy.
1416550534|3.0|This novel is grammatically correct - the plot just happens to be an overused one.  It is not a memorable read!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Crowe makes a great Robin. Handsome in that commoner look before he gets drunk. The merry men were wonderful. I really wish they were making a sequel or two.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|If you are like me and grew up watching a myriad of Robin Hood shows, I can guarantee that this one is definately different. Traditional Robin Hood shows and movies usually reserve King Richard the Lionheart as the one to eventually return and restore justice to Robin Hood and his band of merry men. In this movie in an opening battle in France, King Richard is quickly dispensed with. Reminds me of the way that the old Roman King the movie Gladiator was killed off. In a similar fashion Russell Crowe's character eventually becomes a victim of a new self-centered young king.<br /><br />Also, don't look for a band of men running around in the forest robbing the rich, Robin Longstride is only declared to be an outlaw in the closing 5-10 minutes of the film. But this sets the stage for a sequel quite nicely.<br /><br />What the viewers instead are treated to are two large scale fight scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end. And as you may now know, Mr. Scott is quite good at presenting these types to fighting sequences. In between, the viewers get an insight into the life, politics and times in the 12th century, which seem to be accurately portrayed.<br /><br />Apart from Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett (Marion) a stellar performance is given by Mark Strong(Godfrey) the bad guy in the last Sherlock Holmes movie. His screen presence comes across like 'Darth Maul' all be it without the make-up.<br /><br />The movie starts with a bang and ends with an even bigger bang, in between it slows a bit on the action, but builds on the storyline, overall it is quite enjoyable.
0312600844|1.0|I thought this book was a complete waste of time. I read it because it was selected by one of the members of an all male book group (9 individuals) to which I belong. The characters were boring and stiff. The story really had no point whatsoever.I could not relate to anything in the book. If you can avoid this book, do so.
B0033BWBOQ|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and have not looked back since. It really is a masterpiece, well written and wonderfully told. The book came in amazing time and came in wonderful condition!!
B001QERPDO|5.0|I like this band! At first I heard it on the Morning News Show On ABC. It is a great alternative rock sound. Very good lyrics and the harmony is great. Recommendable!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|LOST is a complex soap opera with a science fiction, fantasy and philosophical framework. But for most people, it's a show about compelling characters in very strange and mysterious circumstances. The show is accessible on many levels, but to fully appreciate it, one might consider reading all the books that pop up in the hands of characters throughout the show. The show is chock full of symbolic, psychological, philosophical, religious and human speculations. I watched the show, missed probably 12 episodes during its run and was quite lost. I have just completed watching the entire show and think I now  \\"get it.\\" It's a masterpiece of story telling and exploration. Its six seasons cannot be causally absorbed and appreciated, so the show is perfect as a DVD collectible.
014241543X|5.0|Last Friday, as I was walking past a teen display in Barnes and Noble, chasing my daughters down the aisle to check out, I literally stuck my hand out and grabbed a paperback copy of Gayle Forman's IF I STAY. The name sounded familiar, but more than anything, the hauntingly beautiful cover mesmerized me. After getting the girls buckled in, I flipped the book over to read the back synopsis and couldn't wait to read this gem of a lucky find.<br /><br />IF I STAY follows a day in the life of seventeen-year-old Mia, but it is a pretty significant one. It is the story about a girl who has a beautiful family, amazing rocker-boyfriend, snarky best friend and a promising future, and how it all can change in a single moment.<br /><br />The story draws you in from the very beginning with possibly the best opening to a story ever:<br /><br />Everyone thinks it was because of the snow. And in a way, I suppose that's true.<br /><br />And it never lets up.  In fact, there are no clear chapters in the book; rather a ticking clock and memories separate the story into sizable chunks.  We live a day in Mia's shoes as she comes to grips with the horrible accident that steals away her family and is faced with a life or death decision beyond her years.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. In fact, I read it through two football games! There was so much to love about it. The poetic prose searing images and word pictures into my mind. The carefully created family relationships radiating love and acceptance. The variety of music underscoring the story and becoming a character in itself.<br /><br />I totally respect Forman for not shying away from the tough questions or shocking parts of a tragedy like the one Mia experiences. In fact, throughout the book, she raises interesting questions for both Mia and the reader: What defines a family? When faced with two unthinkable choices, how do you choose? What are you willing to sacrifice for your loved ones? and What inspires you?<br /><br />While this book pays homage to the bonds of family and friends and their profound influence on us, it is also a tribute to the affect music has on our souls. Mia is a cello player, raised by rockers, dating a punk. While they clearly all have different musical tastes, the characters are united in their passion for music. The resulting effect on the reader is you walk away with a greater appreciation for the musical styles showcased and somehow feel as though you experienced a concert along the way.<br /><br />All these bits and pieces add up to a beautiful book, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the romance. The relationship between Mia and Adam was a breath of fresh air. A realistic portrayal of a teenage couple, who have problems, seem incompatible, and are moving in different directions, yet manage to focus on what brought them together to begin with--their passion for music and each other. Reading Adam's anguish over Mia's condition was heartbreaking, but I smiled through the tears. I swooned during the flashback scenes, showing them fall in love, and I cheered at the end when Adam found the one thing that truly spoke to Mia's soul and brought her back to him.<br /><br />I highly recommend picking up this book if you haven't yet.  The paperback copy I purchased comes with author information, discussion guide, a Behind the Music special segment, and Author Q&A.  I am also EXTREMELY excited about the sequel to this beautiful story, WHERE SHE WENT, which is told from Adam's POV.ly and friends and their profound influence on us, it is also a tribute to the affect music has on our souls.

B000RW3VD4|4.0|...I had never seen it before, so I bought it before I went to see Wall Street, Part II.  I think there could have been a little more action, a little more of something to make you think and guess.  It just seemed to missing something.  But what do you expect?  It was in the 80's.  LOL.
0375703764|5.0|A very good freind of mine recommended this book to me. Since we have similar tastes, and he has introduced me to some of my favorites (i.e. Chuck Palahniuk), I took a chance and bought this. Let me tell you, I am very pleased. This is exactly the kind of book I want on my shelf. When I was finished reading this, I got the sort of warm, fuzzy feeling I haven't gotten since I finished Fight Club.     Pros: An extremely well written, engaging novel that will keep you interested, spooked and satisfied. It's a big book too, much larger than the pictures let on. It took me almost a week just to finish the main book, and an additional weekend to finish the side story.     Cons: This is a very difficult book to read. Lots of footnotes and the side story from the authors viewpoint to distract you from the main point, as well as lots of complex wording and ideas. Not to mention as you get farther in the book, the format starts to go crazy. This book is definitly for the avid to advanced reader.    Bottom line: If you like to read a good novel, you should get this. Many sources recommend skipping all of the side notes (with the exception of the translations) and Johnny's side story until you finish the main story. I did this, and I agree. It made the book more enjoyable and a lot easier on the eyes (and brain).
B0000640SA|5.0|First off, I have to say that this edition is only intended for hardcore fans of the film.  Casual fans that really don't want to delve into the story and find the whole truth shouldn't buy this.  The DVD Menus are cumbersome at times, but discovering all the features the DVD has to offer is part of the fun for me.  The film is amazing, and if you've never seen it before, I highly recommend it.  This DVD case is great, the menus are engaging, and the special features will probably add a new level to the film that you never noticed before.  I'd seen this film once, and I've watched it about 4 or 5 times, backwards and forwards, in the past week.  A great piece of cinema, a great addition to any DVD collection.  5 stars.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|i can't believe this low budget horror film turned in to the best horror movie of all time, the first time i watched this movie i was sweating in my bed when i was sleeping. to me what makes this the greatest horror film of all time is the fact it looks like the most real life movie i ever saw in my life no special effect. that is why to me this is the scariest movie ever made because it looks so real like you are in the film as well.

0194715094|1.0|It's about time men spoke openly about the male-bashing sexism of the Headway books. It seems the Soars hired a 80s-style Gender mainstreaming consultant to bring these books in line with what was popular at the time, bashing or putting men down at all opportunities and boosting women whenever possible. There is not time for me to highlight all the cases of sexism in these books, but just one will show what I mean. Intended to 'put men in their place', this sexism would be better if it kept to facts, but unfortunately these books spread rumours long-since shown to be untrue, or invent or twist facts when they don't promote women or knock men. On page 57 of the Upper Intermediate book there is an exercise on radio advertisements. One of them is advertising car insurance, and points out that men are responsible for 81% of parking offenses. No arguments there. Most (nearly 100%) of delivery drivers are men, and double parking is a necessary evil of inner city deliveries. Also consider the number of men on the roads. In Germany, 75% of all drivers are men. If Britain has similar statistics, then suddenly the 81% figure doesn't look so bad! But Headway twists this statistic even more. What we hear on the radio is two men trying to park while criticizing a woman, before crashing. Yet this not a parking offense! Parking illegally, overstaying your meter time, double parking, those are parking offenses. Why do woman pay less insurance? NOT because they're better drivers, but because their crashes are cheaper! In Germany 25% of the drivers are women and they're responsible for 31% of all crashes. But because they drive more slowly and carefully, stay off the freeways and in the suburbs, don't work as delivery drivers, and don't drive while intoxicated their many crashes don't cost as much as the fewer accidents that men cause. What is really amazing is that with all their recklessness, speeding, drinking and driving and delivery work men still have fewer accidents than women! Any chance of Headway doing an article using real objective statistics? Not a chance!<br /><br />But it gets worse. On page 11 exercise 7 number 5 of the B1.2 students book we learn that 'women earn on average 17% less than men for full-time work'. Do a little internet searching for objective information and what we find out is that: 'The sinister male conspiracy insinuated by feminism that keeps women's wages low is revealed to be a fantasy, as what we are looking at is simply a case of economic cause and effect. Don't study those fun and fulfilling courses like History of Art or French Lit. Everyone would love to do a 'hobby degree', especially if you have a partner to pay the bills, but you'll never get one of those jobs which require a real degree, like in Engineering, Science, Architecture or Medicine, which men don't do more often because they enjoy it, but because they know they're not going to find a woman to fund their needs if they do a hobby degree. Work as much overtime as a man. Commute as far as he does. Do a job as dirty, stressful, or dangerous. Do a job with uncomfortable working conditions, preferably working 12 hour shifts outside in winter. Be prepared to face mutilation and permanent disfigurement on a daily basis. Work 84 hour weeks. Then you'll be earning 98% of a man's salary.'<br />False statistics like Headway is helping spread only causes anger and frustration amongst women, and guilt amongst men, and certainly works against harmonious relations within a mixed gender class. Motherhood certainly is a hindrance against climbing the career ladder. However, this only applies to a minority of people in the world. Motherhood also prevents women from going down coalmines, etc, thus helping to give them longer lives. You can't have it all unfortunately...<br /><br />As a final example, I take again the B1.2 students book, page 89 exercise 1 number 3, where students have to comment on a number of statements on daily life. Once again Headway throws in an old feminist chestnut: 'Women have a higher pain threshold than men', and in the teacher's book an 'answer' along the following lines is given (quoting from memory as the book is at work): 'Although some research seems to show that men have a higher pain threshold, many people believe that childbirth has endowed women with a higher pain threshold. We don't know how men would handle childbirth.' What Headway is recommending here is that we ignore scientific research and stick with hearsay, if it's in favour of women. Incredible! I invite all to do a bit of internet searching, and see what research has been carried out in the last years. We now know that women have two-thirds the pain threshold of men. And they make much louder noises when they feel pain. The discussion in the scietific world has now moved on to what we can do to help women to cope with higher pain levels they feel. (While men were believed to have lower pain thresholds this was just seen as a joke. But as soon as it is observed that, as all men already knew, women are the ones with lower pain thresholds, there is a sudden panic to reduce these poor women's pain. These double standards are sexist in the extreme.) The reason why women don't get Singaporean floggings is that their bodies cannot handle the level of neurogens that men's bodies can, just as men handle alcohol and drugs better. In the women's concentration camp Ravensbr&uuml;ck, women used to die from heart failure during floggings which were far milder than what the men were receiving in their camps. All of what I have written can be confirmed by anyone doing a bit of internet research using objective (not feminist) sources.<br /><br />Another feature common to all the Headway books is their choice of men to illustrate negative adjectives and women the positive ones. In Headway's world, women are perfect and never make mistakes, always the innocent victims who have to put up with silly men. I open the workbook at random, page 8. I see 3 negative comments about men here: (1)He was sarcastic about my house. (2) His comments really hurt my feelings. (3) Q: Why is Terence always so horrible to poor Janine? A: I don't know. But I could see in her face that his criticism really hit home. Perhaps she'll finally leave him this time.<br />The rest is gender neutral, with nothing criticizing women, who as we know are perfect...<br /><br />Wake up Headway, and Liz and John Soars! The world has moved on since the male-bashing 80s and 90s. Heard about Warren Farrell? Because of him, books like yours are already under the spotlight as being sexist and misandronistic in the 21st century gender equality scene. Your constant male-bashing and female-boosting smacks of a collective female inferiority complex which is not healthy. REMOVE the bigotry and sexism and stop bashing my male students, and some may come back to using your books. Others like myself consider that the damage you're done is far too great to ever be forgiven, and even a collective apology to all the male students in the world who've used your books.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|The first season of this show is just absolutely fantastic. The DVD is loaded with extras, which are almost as good as the episodes themselves. Get this now.
B0037AGASG|5.0|This CD is great. The music backing his vocals sounds amazing. His voice is new and refreshing.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|to me this movie was way better than toy story 2. the plot was great and had the best ending out of all toy story movies made.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|The DVDs are packed well, and you get all the series' episodes plus the two Dr. Quinn movies.  I was only slightly disappointed that these DVDs don't have Closed Captions on them.  They may have subtitles, I didn't check.  But sometimes at night I prefer to have CC on so I don't have to have the volume up so loud.  Again, mild inconvenience at best, and not uncommon for DVDs these days.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|The series I ordered was great and came fairly quickly; however, when I ordered the product it was supposed to include a promotional item. I ordered it directly from the company website, which sent me to Amazon and I never got the promotional item. When I attempted to contact customer service, they were not helpful and I still did not receive the item.
1453624910|5.0|Thank you, Thank you Ms. Flewewlling for writing these short stories to deepen the world of the Nightrunner Series.  If you've already read Stalking Darkenss, then to read \\"The Bond\\" from Glimpses in the best treat imaginable.    While I've been perfectly happy to experience the romantic relationhip between Alec and Seregil as it's been presented in this series, to now  have \\"The Bond\\" to flesh out (no pun intended) their relationship is perfect.  Yes, this story and some of the others in Glimpses are erotica, and they are beautifully written, but even more than the enjoying a great sex scene is the fact that \\"The Bond\\" really is all about love.  It hardly even seems like erotica.  The amount of love these 2 characters are written with, and to experience the amount of love they show each other is truly touching.  It was exactly as  I had hoped it would be for Alec and Seregil.  Ms. Flewelling, you got it just right.    The other short stories are also immensely enjoyable and you learn more about Seregil when he first came to Rhiminee, when he first met Micum, and about Alec and his parents.    If you enjoy the Nightrunner Series, this collection is a must have.
0743270754|2.0|This book gets bogged down with insignificant facts about insignificant people and redundancy about the significant ones. The author could have finished this book in half the amount of pages. It's a pretty tough read if you prefer a more streamlined approach to history e.g., Joseph Ellis's books. You've got to really plough through it to read it all. It does have some interesting material in it but it's a really slow read.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|the 70's 80's 90's horror movies were just so good, now in this germination horror is now only blood blood and torture like this movie i just cant watch blood blood and  torture it's just so pointless.
0385737424|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in my life. I really like it because it's very suspenseful.  This book doesn't make sense until you get to a certain part in the book. Once you get there you will be so surprised and then the book will make sense!  When You Reach Me By Rebecca Stead is a great book.    In this book a girl gets suspicious notes from some random person.  Her best friend left her and now they're not friends anymore. On her street corner there is a homeless person who lives under a mailbox. This homeless person is crazy and then he happens to be a very important character in the book. Someone breaks into her house and she gets strange notes, much more strange things happen.  You may not understand why these things are happening but they all connect later and make sense.     This book has many themes. The one main theme that I noticed was that everything isn't as it seems. As I said before many weird things happen to the girl. She doesn't know what to do with all these things but then she figures it out and solves the problem.      My opinion on the book was that it was a great book. I loved this book because it's very suspenseful and has a great ending. I would give this 9 1/2 out of 10. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes syfy books or like books of the future. This is my favorite book that I have read in my life. It is a great book for young readers, and adults.

One more thing: We were planning to buy the Noble's map for around $35. By just buying this book, we now own a Marauder's Map and other props.
B003PIUC02|5.0|When I watched the 1st episode of SBS I thought here is an action series that might be ok! Well it wasnt just ok it was awesome!! The series just kept on getting better and better! The fight scenes alone make this a show worth watching but its more then just that! The acting is first rate and the story line is just amazing! I dont normally buy dvds of movies/tv series but when SBS came out on blue ray I just had to have it so I can watch It over and over again! Will be looking forward to the next season but it wont be the same without Spartacus (Andy Whitfield). Best wishes to you mate!

031603438X|5.0|This is a very interesting and enjoyable read. Some of the stories you'll be familiar with but others truly reveal a talented, humorous, real and pretty  much an appreciative man. He makes no excuses or apologies for himself, but he has the ability to accept his imperfections. Though he experienced his substance hell, he directly states that he doesn't recommend drugs to anyone. However, he doesn't feel that they hindered his musical creativity too negatively either. His most inspired and moving life's history is his struggle in coming to grips with his second son's (Tara's) death and how he still lives inside of him to this day. Also his recounting of Gram Parsons, Ian Stewart and John Phillips is profound. Friendship is vital to him and the impact of the losses of those he valued is keenly felt. He doesn't elaborate too much on the death of Brian Jones, but he acknowledges that his relationship with him was patchy. This book will lay to rest many of the misconceptions and typecasts that one might have of him. Any other biographies can be donated to your local library. This is the keeper. He's proven himself as much more than the rhythmic engine of the Rolling Stones. Life has delivered him a series of punches but he's still standing. Here's to \\"Life\\".
0439023521|5.0|From adult to teenagers to kids and older people any person would be found reading the hunger games by Suzanne Collins. Where ever I go I find people reading the hunger games or the other two books in this amazing trilogy. If you are the reader who will enjoy a sci-fi/adventure and a romance, much more all in 300 pages of true suspense then Hunger games is for you.  In this amazing story that takes place in the future America that is split up in thirteen districts and is completely corrupted was a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lived with her mother and younger sister. Since her dad, that meant the world to her, died she has to step up and be the man and the one who does everything to keep her family alive. Katniss hunted every day with her love gale. But when the day that the capitol decides two kids that are twelve to eight teen from each of the 12 districts ( I told you there was a thirteen but the capitol bombed it, in the other books there is a lot more about it) the boy that was decided was katniss's age though she really did not know him that much but she had one special memory about him and how he gave bread to Katniss when she was looking in his garbage, his families bakery, and though he did this he got really hurt by his mom. What do 24 kids do at the hunger games you still is wondering, they fight and kill one and other. And why. The last person standing gets food, water, oil, shelter and more for his/her district. Guess who was chosen for the girl was chosen....not Katniss.... Prim Katniss's sister. Katniss knew she would die easily so she takes her little sisters place in the hunger games. Watch Katniss as she survive the hunger games and works together with others as she falls in love. Something you can learn from the book is how to fight for what you really think is right. It is mainly about the whole series.  I feel that the fun part of the book of the book is one the idea of the story, how kids compete and they need to survive to get food for their district, is really a smart idea. Then the characters are fascinating. Katniss is a girl who is the man of the house and is so outgoing and is dedicated to save her family, and then you have gale who loves Katniss and Peeta who loves Katniss and then Katniss needs to decide who to love throughout the whole series.         If you're looking for an action-packed book filled with adventure, deception, and combat, The Hunger Games is the book for you. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic North America, where 12 districts surround a magnificently built Capitol. The Capitol is cruel, corrupt, and heartless, and each year orders one boy and one girl from each district to fight in the Hunger Games, a competition that forces the players to battle to the death until there is someone left standing... just to remind the districts that the Capitol is more powerful than then and that if they tried to rebel, they would be destroyed just like the players in the Games.The last person standing's district will be showered with food and gifts for the rest of the year.   Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, an extremely poor district that is always struggling with starvation. Nobody has won the games for the past 14 years there, and as a result it is completely ignored by the Capitol. Katniss feeds her family by hunting in the woods that surrounds her home, and is very skilled in hunting. So when her name is drawn to compete in the Hunger Games, she is ready to kill. At first, she slowly dispatches her enemies, but as the Games progress, she begins to realize her real enemy isn't any of the players, but the Capitol itself. She then devises a plan to prove that she is something more than a pawn in the Capitol's Games and that she doesn't have to kill everyone to be a victor.  The entire book has an amazing plot and describes the landscapes that Katniss encounters perfectly. In the first person and in present tense, the book also beautifully captures Katniss's emotions, and you caneasily understand what she's feeling and why. The book has many themes, from action to romance to betrayal, but all of them find a way to fit in too a magnificently sculpted book. In addition, the sequels Catching Fire and Mockingjay are even better than the first book, so if you like The Hunger Games, you'll love those titles.  Overall, The Hunger Games is one of the best books for young adults I've ever read, and I'm certain that any reader will love it.            Another review of the hunger games by John feffert      The Hunger Games  This book is a MUST read book. What Suzanne Collins has put into this jewel is amazing. I think it is a perfect young adult read for ages 12-18 for those looking for a great book.    This book takes place in the future, where North America is in ruins. A dreadful dark period started, known as the dark days, where the citizens of the 13 districts revolted and started a war. In the end, the Capitol (the government's only city) won and took over power. To punish the districts, the Capitol created an annual event called, the hunger games, where children fight to the death. Every district sends in 2 tributes into the hunger games. One male and one female.   Kattniss Everdeen lives in district 12. This year, she was going to the games, as a tribute. Soon Peeta, her partner tribute, reports to the public that he is in love with her. Now she has to play a lover role. Now that the games have begun, she is forced to give up that role. Will she have to kill him? Will she die? Only one person will come out alive.   \\"Let the 74th annual hunger games begin!\\"  Next to Percy Jackson and Diary Of a Wimpy Kid this is one of my favorite books. It is truly well written and is just such an amazing book.  READ IT!!!!!    By John Feffert        another review by john smith    The Hunger Games  The book the hunger games is a great book by Suzanne Collins. It has lots of action and breath taking cliff hangers. If you are in the mood for some action go andget yourself the hunger games.   The book is about a girl named katniss who lives with her younger sister named prim and her mom. They live in district 12 out of the 12 districts and every year they have the hunger games. 2 people from each district get picked to be in the games. The hunger games are a fight to the death in an arena between the tributes. The last person alive in the arena is the winner.    My opinion on this book is that it is great. I think it is one of the best books. I like it because it has a lot of action and I am a big fan of action. Also the author makes you feel like you're actually there inside the story. I was just so attached to the book and could not put it down. So if you like action, go out and get yourself the hunger games!

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Finally a great,accurate film about the war in the pacific.I think Band of brothers was a little better,but this was awesome.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|We love Castle.  My husband and I are not big TV watchers, but Castle is one of the few shows we love.  The wacky characters are so funny, but they don't go so far as to get annoyingly stupid and they are balanced with more \\"sedate\\" characters.  I actually bought this DVD for my mom, who is also a big fan and I am ordering it for my husband and I.  This show would amuse a wide variety of viewer and would be a good family show for those with kids middle school or older.
0060254920|5.0|In the book Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak The main character Max is a very curious boy who has a short temper and gets sent up to his room without supper because he hit his mother. Max was thinking about how great it would be to leave his house. So slowly his room turns into a forest with water. When max sees a big sailboat in the water he decides to go on it and sail away into the distance. In the fog he sees these big strange creatures that look like monsters. Maxes body is full of fear as he lands on the island. The wild things pull him back into their tent area and sit him down on this thrown looking seat. The wild things were screaming and finally they put this wooden crown on the very top of his head and named him king of the wild things. Unfortunately Max realizes that what he has done is wrong and that he needs to go apologize to his mother and go back home. So that is exactly what he did he said goodbye to his new friends and told them that he needed to go back to his family. The wild things were so disappointed to say goodbye to there king ad friend, but they understood like a friend would do and watched Max sail away home. When Max gets home his room goes back to there is supper sitting down on his desk and away Max goes to sleep. That is a basic summary of the book.   This is my favorite book because Maurice Sendak uses such great details and the illustrations include such rich and vibrant colors and are so imaginative and unique. Therefore, Where The Wild Things Are is my favorite book of all time because of the two things I mentioned makes this book so well balanced for a picture book between writing and art.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I wish I could rate Amazon... I was very disapointed that they did not have any comments on the fact the chip came with a fan. I would have seen how well it worked before I bought another one. I tried to add a comment to the site but it gave some weird reason I could not. Anyway its a great Chip and I would recommend it to anyone.    I did a build and a lot of home work. Chose this chip and everything went well.  Its working and seems to be preforming as advertised.
B003XU7VM4|3.0|I was disapointed in the book. I guess I expected it to be more like the program Castle. It lacked that \\"okay, one more chapter & I'll put it down\\" quality.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I've recently been introduced to Joe Bonamassa and have now purchased several of his CD's... consider me a fan! Joe demonstrates on this album why he's one of the top guitarist's out there today.    Make no mistake Black Country Communion is old school rock n roll and it proves without a shadow of a doubt that '70's style rock is alive and well endowed. The influences are easy to spot including Black Sabbath, Zeppelin, Deep Purple and others, but I think the band has a voice of its own, which is important if they want to sustain themselves moving forward.      I will disagree with one reviewer who thinks this new band is better than Chickenfoot. First of all you can't really compare the two bands, because the influences and style of music they play are very different even though they both fit within the genre of rock. I hope both bands continue to make music, because they're both very good.
014241011X|5.0|When you turn the first page of this book, you are already convinced that it's the best!  This is probably the greatest fantasy fiction book I've ever read in my whole life- and I read a lot of them. Roald Dahl did such a great job writing this book, I couldn't stop reading it!  If you are a big time fantasy fiction reader like me, go immediately to the bookstore NOW and buy your self this book, it's a classic!       The main character of this book (name unknown) is a boy who nearly died in a car crash when he was little.  He had lost both his parents in this accident and was to live with his amazing story- teller grandmother in Norway. She tells him many stories about witches and children who were eaten up by them, but before he knew it, he was face to face with the Grand High Witch who was the leader of all the witches in the whole world. The boy sneaks into the witches meeting located inside his building and finds out about their next evil plan, a formula that turns children into mice.  The witches would hide their evil formula in chocolate bars to disguise it and sell to children.  Now the heroic boy will have to save all of the children of the world by outsmarting the witches and getting them to drink the formula instead, and turn them into mice.  On the way, the boy goes through the challenge of becoming a mouse himself but by accident and reveals his new small, hairy self.         One theme in The Witches that I would like to talk about was the humor Roald Dahl included. He makes up these hilarious short songs in his books along with made up words he uses in almost every sentence, which is something very unique to books, and I really love it in this type of book.  One of my favorite things is when authors crack me up, and this book definitely did the job.       I truly enjoyed this book and I hope everybody does too when they read it.  Who cares if the witches have no toes or are bald or have blue saliva, it's a great book!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely love Nicholas Sparks and once again he did a fantastic job on this book, I could not put it down!!
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  It was an easy read that was simultaneously funny and sad, and ten pages in you really feel it was written by a dog.  If you love to see a dog riding in a car with his head sticking out the window and a big smile on his face, read this book.  If you like twists and turns in a story about intertwined relationships, read the book.  And if you want to know what a race car driver is thinking about while racing, you guessed it.  Read the book.
B000002UB5|1.0|I was looking forward to receiving this item until I found it in my mailbox. I ordered this item thinking it was a VINYL record like it says, but it was just a cd. I already have the cd so I just gave it away.

B001YV504U|3.0|Spoiler alert.  The reality of this movie is that is simply that, a movie.  It does not materialize into anything believable, nor credible.  The acting was as good as this script could hope for.  OK, so we get some ghosts coming back to create some nostolgia but to what purpose?  This movie tries to build on the mystical assumption of a dual world where characters seem trapped in a purgatory of thier own interest and worldy failures.  The movie Ghost had this story as well.  It means to hit an emotional reaction based on pure unrelateable fiction.  Is it a bad movie, absolutely not.  Is it a great movie, hardly.  This movie is like a childhood Stephen King attempt at a sport story about the game he loves so much.  No, King did not write this and I believe if he did it would have been halted at the editor's table until the 3rd revision built the characters and plot into something intriguing.    Can relationships be rebuilt in an instant on fantasy, maybe, probably not.  Especially not if you ruin your farm, do not pay your bills, drive your wife to the point of divorce, and talk to ghosts hitting real baseballs.  Whatever turns you on.  Movies like Nobody's Fool, Hurt Locker, Deer Hunter, provide a real statement on relationships.  This is weak, ethereal, and fails to hit it out of the field.  How many times have we seen baseball movies that try to materialize into something with real meaning?  When you build the foundation for your movie on assumption that your audience must care about baseball, you are bound to see it become predicatable and like a child's story, limited.    If you love this movie, that is wonderful.  It's subjective.  I did not have a \\"wow\\" moment even once in this movie and I doubt anyone was truly surprised or learned anything from this.    This is a dollar rental, not a Blu-Ray investment.

I did it all the way through. At first I had to pause all of the time and do all of the modified moves but by the end I was keeping up and seeing amazing definition in my abs, quads and definitely arms.  I have moved on to doing other programs (mostly Jillian's other- longer workouts) but still mix in different levels of the shred because it's just such a good combo of all the things you want- cardio and conditioning!  Perfect! I love her and her motivational attitude!

1579128149|5.0|I ordered this for my son when he was 10 and a half because it sounded cool and he's always interested in science. (He had done a 5th grade project on nuclear energy, and loves Mythbusters, and I thought Theo Gray sounded sort of like them.) I had no idea it would be such a big hit - he read it through within a couple of days, has re-read it more than once since, and often mentions facts he learned from it. The tone of the writing, which is both funny and informative, is just right, and the images are spectacular. I highly recommend it for bright, science-y kids, and curious people of all ages.
0811870413|5.0|first of all, the book is gorgeous, and has all sorts of wonderful recipes involving bread.  secondly, chad robertson is one of those bakers who have achieved almost cult status because of the quality of their bread, and when i saw that chad had written a book i was delighted.  i am a professional baker at an artisan bakery, and i have always held Tartine bread in the highest esteem.  and yet, i had never made bread that good until i got this book.  i was thrilled with the simplicity of the method, and i have been pulling loaves of bread out of my home oven that are more beautiful than any loaves i have ever baked.  the color of the crust is rich and shiny and rustic, the crumb is tender, moist, and full of those wispy holes we love so much, and the flavor is divine.  now i bake bread at home much more frequently than i did before.  in fact, i have some in the oven right now!  get this book.  it could change your life.
B00076NYFU|5.0|quo was at this point a rock band , not a heavy rock band. ALthough they have the classic hard rocker 'roll over lay down' on here the rest of the album is well crafted and sung rock songs.  Some hard rock fan on here obviously misunderstood this bands mission statement because he gave it two stars because it's not a hard rock cd. Well this isn't a hard rock band , they are a rock n roll band. Although I do agree that 'ma kellys greasy spoon' and 'dog of two head' are great cds though.<br />The songs flow here with great lyrics and good song writing throughout.  It's one of their best cds period for sure.

B00004X01U|1.0|This might have been Madonna's worst CD if she hadn't followed it with American Life (her rap cd!). Coming afer Ray of Light it's below average. Everything about this set of songs is gloomy, defeated, downbeat and low-rent. They seem to be written for someone with a three-note range. Most of the songs are slow, dirges. Madonna attempts to inveigle her way back onto dance floors with some regrettable (now hysterical) autotuning. She learned to play guitar for this cds appearances and thankfully Madonna's guitar playing career is now finished. The songs reflect the sort of lifeless strumming she could be entrusted to master in the short schedule between two cd releases. Worst of all is the song 'Music.' A feebler, more embarassing single has never been released.
B003JZCVR8|4.0|I enjoyed Roman Polanski's adaptation of Robert Harris' novel [[ASIN:B000XTGFTS The Ghost: A Novel (HARDCOVER)]], renamed 'The Ghost Writer' for US release.  The movie, too, takes the name of the US book release.  Shame that, because 'The Ghost' is a more apt title - Harris' trick is to never provide a name to the Ewan McGregor writer character...a feat Polanski pulls off as well.  The Ghost role was originally supposed to go to Nicolas Cage, but passed to McGregor.  That was a major upgrade - Cage has become a cartoon.  Harris' protagonist is short on ego and confidence and has a bit of marketing and Fleet Street in him.  McGregor is perfect.<br /><br />Harris' book is a thinly veiled broadside at Tony Blair.  Harris had been a supporter of Blair's, but soured on him over Iraq.  Here's where the movie excels over the book: Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang is positively Blair-ian down to his fiber.  No less subtle is Harris' depiction of Lang's wife, Ruth, as shrewish and scheming (and more), pretty much hitting and playing up the worst rumors of Cherie Blair's behind-the-scenes role at 10 Downing St.  The Blairs can't be at all happy with this portrayal, most notably with Harris' denouement as it comes to the Adam Lang character.  And, if anything, Polanski's version is even more shocking as it comes to its treatment of Lang in the end.  It seems almost incendiary.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film a bit less than the book.  The book's tone is superb.  I was hooked right from the first line - \\"The moment I heard how McAra died, I should have walked away.\\"  That's one of the best opening lines ever for a novel.  I have to admit I was fairly obsessed with cataloging the differences between book and film, mostly those due to what I'll call \\"Polanski-induced restrictions.\\"  The book takes place mostly in three locales: London; Martha's Vineyard and New York City.  Polanski can travel to none of those places.  So, Berlin serves as London.  A bleak island in the North Sea serves as gray, wintertime Martha's Vineyard.  And Harris and Polanski - as adapters of the novel into a screenplay - conspire to write NYC out of the plot all together.time Martha's Vineyard.

B000002OMN|4.0|There's only one thing I'd like to say about this excellent album (although I could say plenty). The lyrics to \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\\" are perhaps the best lyrics EVER for any rock song which is specifically written about rock and roll. The music couldn't suit it any more perfectly.
0061433047|4.0|One of my favorite things about Terry Pratchett's novels is that he takes the most unpromising characters--in the case of \\"I Shall Wear Midnight, it is a pregnant-out-of-wedlock 14-year-old--and gives them dignity, originality, and sometimes even a dose of that sacred fire, magic.<br /><br />In this fourth Tiffany Aching adventure, Pratchett also scrags a character and a relationship that he had been carefully building through the previous three novels, then blames the resulting casualties on witchcraft.<br /><br />Tiffany survives this book intact, and stronger than ever.  Much of her energy is directed toward tasks that in our nonmagical world, would be palmed off on social workers.  Even so, people are turning against witches, again.  There is even talk of burning them.<br /><br />\\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" doesn't have a strong plot to glue together the separate stories, and although the villain gets a tremendous build-up, he didn't quite live up to his bad PR, so the story's end seemed anticlimactic.  This is a Discworld book with lots of talk but little action.  Even the Feegles, who tend to act without much preliminary discussion, reveal a tendency toward wordiness, especially after their showdown with Wee Mad Arthur.<br /><br />Nevertheless, we Discworld fanatics get to interact with lots of our favorite characters, most of them in cameo roles, and the Feegle unleash mayhem where ever they butt heads (their mayhem is on a very short leash).<br /><br />I enjoyed this further adventure of Tiffany Aching, although 'Midnight' is the least of the four books about this young witch and her little blue 'helpers.'  Her character isn't so much further developed as it is hardened along lines suggested in previous novels.  However, I'll still look forward to a fifth installation in this Discworld subseries.
B003CN5SAY|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing how they would wrap up the sixth and final season of Nip/Tuck.  I had watched the previous 5 seasons and enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, the last season was kind of a let down.<br /><br />Many parts of the last season seemed like they did not try very hard to end the series.  Everyone knew the series was ending, but it was almost as though the sixth season was unrelated to the previous 5.  The ending developments of characters was annoying and seemed like it was thrown together.<br /><br />While I still enjoyed watching the last 19 episodes, it did not do the series justice.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|...and while I write this review, you hold it, just in case something weird happens. Okay?  Great.  So, this movie, Paranormal Activity, some people have compared to the Blair Witch Project, because of the hand-held camera work and the fact that not much BANG!<br /><br />....what was that?  Did you hear that?....okay, just a noise, no need to worry, back to the review.  As I was saying, it's kind of like the Blair Witch Project because you don't actually see much or know what's reallySLAM!  OMG!  The door--it just closed--ALL BY ITSELF!<br /><br />Huh, that was weird, wasn't it?  Oh well.  But, see, the Blair Witch Project had SOME scary things things in it--remember the bloody teeth, and the weird stick figures?  But this movie--hey, wait---FOOTPRINTS IN TALCUM POWDER!  Oh NO!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />BLAM!<br /><br />And some people are reminded of Hitchcock, and how he created suspense...WHAT ARE YOU DOING JUST SITTING THERE READING THIS REVIEW?

B004132HZS|5.0|It is clear that the authors of this series and the actors who act it out want to show Holmes in a strange light, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the films are interesting and worth watching.<br /><br />For example, in the first film, there are several references to Holmes being homosexual - for instance, his landlady suggests that he and Watson may not need a second bed, and Holmes seems, but it is unclear, to deny it. There is nothing wrong with he being homosexual, but it is introduced into the story in a way that makes it appear that Holmes is strange. Holmes is depicted with psychological problems, perhaps even being a sociopath - he even says so himself. Police officers call him a psychopath and justify their claim with examples of his weird behavior. One suggests that he will soon fall apart completely. Two of his family members are very concerned about him and feel strongly that he needs a watchman. They are willing to pay a person to watch him. Holmes is obsessed with the need to solve crimes. He takes no money for doing so. He calls out in delight at the complexity of a case even though his delight involves the death of four people - he likes that they are dead. He is unable to get along with people and has no friends, not one. People who like him, like him because he helped them with a case, such as his landlady who is thankful for his involvement in a case concerning her husband. His behavior is asocial: he ignores people, walks out on them, and even insults them. We hear him calling Watson a name. We see him insult a girl twice who seemingly put on lipstick to impress him and then takes it off when he says he does not like it.<br /><br />Watson is also shown to have a psychological problem in this episode. His therapist says that he is depressed because he was shot during the Afghanistan War. She is wrong. It is worse. He has a need for action; he does not need to get away from action. He limps, not because of his wound, but because of his boredom. As soon as he has a chance to act, he looses his limp.<br /><br />The first episode ends with no explanation of how the criminal was successful in inducing his victims to commit suicide while he was unhurt. This is not a fault. Many films and books end in this kind of obscure manner, leaving it to the watcher or reader to decide the ending. What is significant is that Holmes puts himself in danger because of his compulsion to solve the case.oredom.

B0040HJNKC|5.0|Wow!  If you like the blues and Buddy Guys version of them you will like this album.  He can still shred a fret with the best of them.  Introspective at times, (and who wouldnt be at 74) the songs are well done and yet Buddy can still crank it up.  If he does this at 74, what will he be doin at 80.  Buy this album!
B003WTE886|1.0|Taylor Swift has released another \\"country\\" cd (masquerading as a tween pop marketing ploy).  Again, we get a batch of formulaic songs that sound all the same, simple, sing-song lyrics, and the same Taylor overproduced/slick vocals.  Carrie Underwood, Jessica Harp, and even Diana Degarmo's Nashvillle acoustic ep blow this away.  Yes, she can flip her fair, pretend to sing, and strum the same one note during 3 minutes song (can she really play that guitar that the industry has bestowed so many awards?).  I don't think so... I bought all 3 of Taylor's cds and they are a guilty pleasure, but when compared to Carrie's vocals, energy, songwriting skills, and humility - Taylor just pales in comparison.
B000055ZB8|5.0|I love this movie. So cheesy but still creepy. I am glad I finally own a copy of this film.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|Ok, So I have tried the whole brand offerings that would be considered tri watches as I have competed in the sport for about 13 years now.  I have to say when I bought the watch I was skeptical that it would be any better than the others but hopeful. Man was I surprised, a great watch all around and well above expectations.  My last watch was the Polar RS 800. That watch although really attractive and technically sound was a piece of junk from a durability standpoint. The battery life was very poor  ( about 3 months of Ironman training use) and add to the fact you have to turn it in to Polar to get it replaced ( the best way Vs trying it yourself) and the fact the wrist strap broke 2 times on me in one year you end up wasting a lot of time looking for another watch while yours is getting repaired. And get this when I needed an upgrade to the new Windows operating system Polar sent me a 7 page email on how to do it myself or of course I could buy the upgrade software for $99, The watch was less than a year old. So rather than do that I gave up on my second attempt at a polar watch ( the first watch strap broke as well and the battery had the same short life). I can go into to the pother watches as well but lets just stick with the review here on the Garmin.  My one and only complaint is the battery life after charging when using GPS. I am seeing that it only last about 4 hours while using GPS lately. Other than that I use the foot pod and bike cyclometer that I bought in addition to get by that. I wish I did not have to but a small problem for an otherwise amazing watch.  Pros\\"  Well built solid and feels solid around your wrist  Amazing software  Lost of display options  Cool Looking but could use more color options  Great interface with garmin connect   I love seeing my routes and runs around town and also seeing others in the community. Actually met a friend that lived around the corner from me by noticing his training run posts originated from just around the block  Bezel sweet issue no problem for me and I use it on long runs, long bikes and for 12 hours oin my last Ironman and had no issue with its sensitivity especially after fooling with the adjustments you can make  Love the display speed options  Very bright light  Easy to use and set up very intuitive    Cons:  Battery life when using GPS    Bottom line if you are serious about finding the right watch look no further than this watch. I think you can see from previous posts of mine on I think runners world that I liked other watches but this by far beats them all, nike, timex ironman, Polar, Suunto (was probably second) this was a surprise because they were not a sport specific watch but in the end they nailed it

B000021Y77|5.0|I love this movie I just wanted a copy of it so I could watch it. I'm glad I own this.
B003XHLIUS|5.0|If you saw Predators (a.k.a. Predator 3), or at least know stuff about it, you should know that their are new Predators introduced called the Black Super Predators. These Predators are bigger, stronger, more aggressive, and go about the hunt differently than the Predators we are all used to seeing. As said in the film, they have a \\"blood feud\\" against the other Predator tribes and are at war with them and prove to be more powerful. These new Predators are like Predators on steroids. So now that you know about the character back ground, lets get into the figure. This is the Falconer Predator. One of the three super Predators. This Predator is the more high-tech Predator and uses a mechanical Falcon-like device to spot humans from above besides using his regular Predator vision and other hunting strategies like the other Predators. The falconer Predator is definitely by far my favorite out of the new group besides the only other Super Predator I like which is the Tracker Predator from series 2. He looks the best, and has the best characteristics in my opinion. He also had an epic battle with the Japanese character in a Japan field type setting. He looks like a Predator that would fight a Samurai warrior. As far as the figure goes, it's durable. well sculpted, painted, looks just like the look from the film. It doesn't come with any accessories except for a removable wrist blade. Based on video reviews he's considered on of the top favorites and a good figure. I figured I should mention other peoples thoughts on it besides just mine. So if you like Predators and love the Falconer one, I suggest you buy it. The deals are great.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This product had all the disks and arrived in good condition, there was a slight tear in the packaging but I think it happened in the mail.  There was no damage and everything was there.  The features of this film are great, there is a lot of information and even a digital copy!<br />It also arrived here on time, perhaps earlier.

B00004X10B|5.0|Great camera bag.  Allows me to carry two camera bodies with grips, wide assortment of lenses, filters and stuff all in one bag.  Of course it gets heavy, but if you need to carry a bunch of equipment, this is a great camera bag.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|A super combination of talents! The recording is a bit unpolished, like taken from rehearsals. Which I like! Fantastic guitar, quite heavy sounding, the classic Bonham drum drive... The singing is not fantastic, but fits with the music. Buy if you like modern bluesrock.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Taylor Swift has a gift and it shows in this album.  Her writing and singing compliment each other in a way that isn't heard often anymore in music.  She pours her heart into your music and it pays off.<br /><br />Buy this album now before the introduction price ends because for the price of three songs, you'll get the entire album.  You won't be disappointed.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Some bad choices for songs . Can't stand many of the guests. Combine bad guests with some bad songs you get a poor CD. Santana's guitar is fine but not enough to bring this to mediocre.  I kind of like the end of While My Guitar Gentley Weeps and I guess my favorite would be Under The Bridge done with the original singer from The Red Hot Chili Peppers . Other than that pretty much unlistenable.Wasted a nice car ride on a beautiful autumn day in Connecticut. Save your money.

Makes me want to read it again... This book made me think of things I hadn't really considered before & I found myself discussing it with friends who don't read Sparks' books. It followed the regular formula but had some juicy twists and turns. LOVED it!
0316098337|5.0|I hesitated to read this because I don't like to read anything with graphic violence. The author used only suggestions of violence with the captor.

0143116177|4.0|Previous works from Feguson I have read include Empire and The War of the World but it took me two years after The Ascent of Money was published to get to it. Having now experienced the greatest financial crisis since The Great Depression, I was struck by how prescient Ferguson was when he penned and published this work as the extent of the damage was unimaginable. The line, \\"Perhaps, too, it will be a financial crisis that signals the twilight of American global primacy.\\" produces chills given the now known historical context.<br /><br />In his foreward he explains, \\"As I completed my research for this book in the early months of 2008, it was already a distinct possibility that the US economy might suffer a recession. Was this because American companies had gotten worse at designing new products? Had the pace of technological innovation suddenly slackened? No. The proximate cause of the economic uncertainty of 2008 was financial: to be precise, a spasm in the credit markets caused by mounting defaults on a species of debt known euphemistically as subprime mortgages.\\" He provides entertaining (yet scary) observations of the \\"ubiquity and proximity of both easy credit and easy bankruptcy\\" in the US.<br /><br />The book is divided into money and banking, bond and stock markets, insurance, and property. It is highly readable and would be a great substitute to the dry tomes that are often used in secondary and post-secondary economics and finance classes (the accompanying DVD would make another great teaching aid). Ferguson makes a strong argument for his central thesis: \\"the ascent of money has been essential to the ascent of man\\" and that we humans are largely woefully ignorant of finance. And he does this through entertaining tales of our economic history, by bringing clarity to the complex, and by sharing a laugh with us in terms of our economic foibles that are tied more to our humanity than to our financial acumen.<br /><br />Ferguson call financial markets \\"the mirror of mankind\\", and as such, the entire financial system is so complex that he describes it as \\"non-linear, even chaotic.\\" The book is valuable because it brings a bit of order to that chaos or at least an opportunity for greater understanding.irror of mankind\\", and as such, the entire financial system is so complex that he describes it as \\"non-linear, even chaotic.\\" The book is valuable because it brings a bit of order to that chaos or at least an opportunity for greater understanding.
0525951652|4.0|This book gives a simple history lesson about the 1st World War. It would be easier to read if you knew some history first of how the 1st World war started and its allies.<br /><br />After the Balkans war of 1912 -1913 there remained tension and unhappiness over the division of the Balkans in which Serbia had grown. Austria thought they would need to weaken Serbia.Tension built up and then their was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serb called Gavrilo Princip.<br /><br />The Germans said that if the Austrians were forced to fight then Germany would support the Austrians.On the other hand the Russians were in support of the Serbians and started to build up their military power. The British stated if the Germans attacked France(as the French would not give free passage across France so the Germans could attack Russia) they would allie with the French and Russians. Germany invades Belgium(which was to remain neutral) and as such the British fight the Reich.<br /><br />America at that stage was only a new country and had not yet built up a military but eventually did and attacked the Germans as they started to bomb their submarines.Also the Japanese joined in to fight the Germans.<br /><br />During the war Lenin and the Bolsheviks rebel against the Tsar and take control of Russia.<br /><br />With this background in mind it is easier and more enjoyable to read.<br /><br />With regard to the characters there are five famililies from American,Welsh,Russian,German and British.<br /><br />Earl Fitz Herbert(English man who owns the coal mines and becomes an army Major) married Princess Bea (Russian) and Lady Maud (Earl Fritz sister) who falls in love with Walter Von Ulrich (A spy in the German Emabassy in London)<br />Walter Von Ulrich (German agent) married Maud(Fitz sister) secretly a day before war is declared.<br /><br />Gus Dewar (American aide for the president of USA who becomes a soldier) and marries Rosa.<br /><br />Billy (Who works in the Welsh coal mines for Fitz and is sent to battle under Fitz who hates him) and marries Mildred.<br />Ethel(Billys sister who was Fitz maid and has his illegitamete son called Lloyd) who marrys Bernie and they both enter British politics during the war.<br /><br />The brothers Lev and Gigori who are both Orphans.<br />Gigori (Poor Russian who supports Lenin into power) married to Katrina(She has Gigoris brothers illegitamete child).<br />Lev(Gigoris brother ,father to Katrinas child) who runs off to live in America and marries Olga Vyalov whos father is an American with money and clout. Olgas father gets Lev enlisted to fight as he knows he has another illegitamete child to a singer. Lev had to marry Olga as he got her pregnant and has a daughter called Daisy.<br /><br />All the men end up in the war and cross paths somewhere on the way and have siblings which will probably be in the next book(Looking forward to it)<br /><br />The book is fast moving but i did not expect so much history.It is a good history lesson but if i knew before i started reading i would have read up the history above.This will help you enjoy the book.

B0000012ZQ|5.0|Although my admiration for Brendel's versions of Schubert's piano sonatas remains unassailed, there is no doubt that Wilhelm Kempff's classic versions are essential for any Schubert admirer as well. There is something almost magical about the glow and sheen of the very sound Kempff creates in these works without compromising spirit or flair - there were apparently, at the time, some concerns that Kempff's playing lacked robustness and projection in the concert hall, but even if that is so, there is nothing weak or insubstantial about his recordings; they are intimate but not anemic, introspective but not self-centered. If there is one word that should sum up these performances, however, I suggest `airy' - Kempff uses the pedal sparingly (but subtly) and his in itself miraculous attention to detail never jeopardizes his grasp of the overall form or structure of the music. His technical mastery is never in doubt, of course, but it never draws attention to itself either.    Unusually for Kempff, he actually assumes a relatively brisk pace for the opening movement of the D959, though not at the expense of poetry. Elsewhere in the fast movements he is more restrained though never plodding. In the slow movements of both works, however, he is a little quicker than most alternatives - rather than searching for profundity, he appears to let the depth and insights emerge from the flow of the music. He is stricter about keeping a constant pace than Brendel, and I find both approaches equally rewarding in these works. The short story, however, is that this is marvelous playing that remains essential listening regardless of the number of alternative performances you may be in possession of. The sound does show its age and sometimes seems a little cushioned, but it is clear throughout and allows the music to glow and sparkle appropriately. An immensely rewarding release and an extremely strong recommendation.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|This movie is basically a bunch of CGI catastrophic disaster sequences with just enough of a story wrapped around it to commercially release it as a film. The director seems to have wanted to do a modern noah's ark story. But rather than anything biblical, we get Mayan prophecy, a pseudoscience driven collapse of the earth's crust and arks built by the rich/powerful for themselves.    The film features bad acting, unlikeable characters and a plot that only serves as filler between CGI disaster sequences. Oh. And if the world ever looks like its going to end, just head for Africa. Even Mayan prophecy doesn't apply to Africa.

Why they give the extended version for 1 and 2, but not  3 and 4 is beyond me. Almost seems like a trick with 1 and 2 to get you to buy 3 and 4.  No matter what the reason, bad show WB for treating your customers this way.  I only hope I can still return them after I broke the seal wrapping.    If you want the extended versions --- do NOT buy these, you will only get the original version.
B000002O05|5.0|Following their landmark debut album didn't seem like an easy task for the Lynyrd Skynyrd band though the first record was not a big seller upon its initial release. `Second Helping' may be seen by many as Skynyrd's best or second best LP (I prefer `Pronounced' myself) but either record would prove to stand the test of time as shining examples of the genre known as Southern Rock. In fact many critics feel that these records were the best that the South had to offer and I would be inclined to agree no disrespect to the Allmans but Lynyrd Skynyrd were the ultimate southern rock band. On the road they were a monster who toured with hardest rocking and hardest living bands of the age and stood toe-to-toe with the best of `em!  `Second Helping' contained Skynyrd's first big hit; a song that needs no introduction (just the brief 1, 2, 3 count in), \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" - a great rock anthem as any band created in the mid-70's.  The boys were proud Southerners and wanted to stand up for the people of Alabama that weren't racist rednecks but painted with the same brush. Deeper into the record one finds classics such as \\"Working for MCA\\", \\"The Needle and the Spoon\\" and \\"Call Me the Breeze\\"- all making classic rock playlists for decades to come. \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\" was a tribute to the black bluesmen that inspired bands like Skynyrd and \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\" was Ronnie saying back off to fellers who wanted to badger him about touring.  The first record that Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded as a true three-guitar player disc; Ed King's contributions are prodigious to say the least while Allen Collins plays mostly rhythm parts and of course Gary Rossington doing what he does best, blasting away on his Les Paul.  Again any fan of Skynyrd's may have this as a favorite and for me it comes pretty close but unfortunately the quality of later recordings would always be measured against the first two LPs.  Want you to sign a contract...want you to sign today....
031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards. Right, he's the Rolling Stone you notice when Mick Jagger's not shaking and singing. The one who kicked his heroin addiction by having all his blood transfused in Switzerland. Who was --- for ten years in a row --- chosen by a music magazine as the rocker \\"most likely to die.\\" Whose solution to spilling a bit of his father's ashes was to grab a straw and snort. Whose most recent revelation is about the size of Mick's equipment.<br /><br />Yeah, that's the guy. Wild man. Broken tooth, skull ring, earring, kohl eyes --- he's Cpt. Jack Sparrow's father, lurching though life as if it's a pirate movie, ready to unsheathe his knife for any reason, or none. Got some blow, some smack, a case of Jack Daniels? Having a party? Dial Keith.<br /><br />When you get a $7 million advance for your memoirs, there's no such thing as a \\"bad\\" image. But the thing about Keith Richards is, he wants to tell the truth. Like: he didn't have his blood transfused. Like: he didn't take heroin for pleasure or to nod out, but so he could tamp his energy down enough to work. Like: he and Jagger may not be friends but they're definitely brothers --- and if you criticize Mick to him, he'll slit your throat.<br /><br />Why does Keith want to undercut his legend?<br /><br />Because he has much better stories to tell.<br /><br />And in the 547-page memoir he wrote with James Fox, he serves them up like his guitar riffs -- in your face, nasty, confrontational, rich, smart, and, in the end, unforgettable.<br /><br />Start with the childhood. Keith grew up in a gray, down-and-out suburb of London. School: \\"I hated it. I'd spend the whole day wondering how to get home without taking a beating.\\" By his teens, he'd figured the system out: \\"There's bigger bullies than just bullies. There's 'them,' the authorities.\\" He adopts \\"a criminal mind.\\" His school record reflects this: \\"'He has maintained a low standard' was the six-word summary of my 1959 school report, suggesting, correctly, that I had put some effort into the enterprise.\\"<br /><br />His mother is his savior. She likes music, and is a \\"master twiddler\\" of the knobs on the radio. When he's 15, she spends ten quid she doesn't have to buy her only child a guitar. (No spoilers here, but much later in the book, you're going to fight tears when he plays a certain song for her.)<br /><br />The rest of the book? Keith Richards and a guitar --- and what a love story: \\"Music was a far bigger drug than smack. I could kick smack; I couldn't quit music. One note leads to another, and you never know what's going to come next, and you don't want to. It's like walking on a beautiful tightrope.\\"<br /><br />What music interests him? Oh, come on: the music of the dispossessed --- black Chicago blues. Mick Jagger, who lives a few blocks away and is prosperous enough to actually buy a few records, also loves this music. To say they bond is to understate: \\"We both knew we were in a process of learning, and it was something you wanted to learn and it was ten times better than school.\\"<br /><br />The Rolling Stones form. The casting is quite funny: \\"Bill Wyman arrived, or, more important, his Vox amplifier arrived and Bill came with it.\\"<br /><br />Today bands dream of getting rich. Not the Stones: \\"We hated money.\\" Their first aim was to be the best rhythm and blues band in London. Their second was to get a record contract. The way to do that was to play.<br /><br />Something happened when the Stones were on stage, something sexy and dangerous and never seen before. The Beatles held your hand. In 18 months, the Stones never finished a show. Keith estimates they played, on average, five to ten minutes before the screaming started, and then the fainting, until the security team was piling unconscious teenage girls on the stage like so much firewood.<br /><br />Fame. When it comes, there's no way out; you need it to do your work. The Stones at least brought a new look to it; they provoked the press, didn't care what therecord company wanted. Only the music mattered. As Berry Gordy liked to say, \\"It's what's in the grooves that counts.\\"<br /><br />\\"The world's greatest rock band\\" --- between 1966 and 1973, it's hard to argue that they weren't. Songs poured out of them: \\"I used to set up the riffs and the titles and the hook, and Mick would fill in. We didn't think much or analyze....Take it away, Mick. Your job now. I've given you the riff, baby.\\"<br /><br />Drugs? Necessary. In the South, a black musician laid it out for Keith: \\"Smoke one of these, take one of these.\\" Keith would move on beyond grass and Benzedrine to cocaine for the blast and focus, heroin for the two or three day work marathon. Engineers would give their all and fall asleep under the console, to be replaced by others. Keith would soldier on. \\"For many years,\\" he says, \\"I slept, on average, twice a week.\\"<br /><br />With money and success, though, there's suddenly time to think --- in Keith's case, about all the things about Mick that drove him nuts. His interest in Society. His egomania. His insecurity. And his promiscuity: \\"Mick never wanted me to talk to his women. They end up crying on my shoulder because they've found out that he has once again philandered. What am I gonna do? The tears that have been on this shoulder from Jerry Hall, from Bianca, from Marianne, Chrissie Shrimpton... They've ruined so many shirts of mine. And they ask me what to do! How should I know? I had Jerry Hall come to me one day with this note from some other chick that was written backwards --- really good code, Mick! --- \\"I'll be your mistress forever.\\" All you had to do was hold it up to a mirror to read it... And I'm in the most unlikely role of counselor, \\"Uncle Keith.\\" It's a side a lot of people don't connect with me.\\"<br /><br />If only it could be so simple as a man and his guitar! But there are other people involved, in close association, with a lot at stake --- and here comes the business story, the drug story, the power story. It's funny and silly. And, after a while, sad. Mick breaks away from the Stones and makes a solo record: \\"It was like 'Mein Kampf.' Everybody had a copy but nobody listened to it.\\" Mick gets grand. Keith's lost in drugs. From 1982 to 1989, the Stones don't tour; from 1985 to 1989, they don't go into the studio.<br /><br />And now they are rich. Beyond rich. Every time they tour or license a song, their wealth mounts -- Keith, by most estimates, is worth at least $250 million. It's ironic, really, for by any creative analysis, the Stones were over after \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" And yet, here they are, almost four decades later, capable of producing the most lucrative tour of any year.<br /><br />Like so many things these days, music is about branding -- and there's no bigger brand than the Rolling Stones. Keith may slag his band mates; he'd never mock the Stones. Because the band is, if his version is accurate, really his triumph. Mick provided the flash, but in rock and roll, a great riff will always trump flash.<br /><br />A great riff will also trump time. We love rock for many reasons, and not the smallest is the way it makes us feel young, as if everything's possible and the road is clear ahead of us. And here is Keith Richards, who never grew up and is now so rich he'll never have to.<br /><br />His story slows as it approaches the present, and you start to wonder if this Peter Pan life can get to its end without real pain. And you think, well, there's another side to this -- if Mick started writing tonight, he could have his book out before he's 70. But mostly, you wish you could go back to the beginning of \\"Life\\" and start again.s that counts.\\"    \\"The world's greatest rock band\\" --- between 1966 and 1973, it's hard to argue that they weren't. Songs poured out of them: \\"I used to set up the riffs and the titles and the hook, and Mick would fill in. We didn't think much or analyze....Take it away, Mick. Your job now. I've given you the riff, baby.\\"    Drugs? Necessary. In the South, a black musician laid it out for Keith: \\"Smoke one of these, take one of these.\\" Keith would move on beyond grass and Benzedrine to cocaine for the blast and focus, heroin for the two or three day work marathon. Engineers would give their all and fall asleep under the console, to be replaced by others. Keith would soldier on. \\"For many years,\\" he says, \\"I slept, on average, twice a week.\\"    With money and success, though, there's suddenly time to think --- in Keith's case, about all the things about Mick that drove him nuts. His interest in Society. His egomania. His insecurity. And his promiscuity: \\"Mick never wanted me to talk to his women. They end up crying on my shoulder because they've found out that he has once again philandered. What am I gonna do? The tears that have been on this shoulder from Jerry Hall, from Bianca, from Marianne, Chrissie Shrimpton... They've ruined so many shirts of mine. And they ask me what to do! How should I know? I had Jerry Hall come to me one day with this note from some other chick that was written backwards --- really good code, Mick! --- \\"I'll be your mistress forever.\\" All you had to do was hold it up to a mirror to read it... And I'm in the most unlikely role of counselor, \\"Uncle Keith.\\" It's a side a lot of people don't connect with me.\\"     If only it could be so simple as a man and his guitar! But there are other people involved, in close association, with a lot at stake --- and here comes the business story, the drug story, the power story. It's funny and silly. And, after a while, sad. Mick breaks away from the Stones and makes a solo record: \\"It was like 'Mein Kampf.' Everybody had a copy but nobody listened to it.\\" Mick gets grand. Keith's lost in drugs. From 1982 to 1989, the Stones don't tour; from 1985 to 1989, they don't go into the studio.    And now they are rich. Beyond rich. Every time they tour or license a song, their wealth mounts -- Keith, by most estimates, is worth at least $250 million. It's ironic, really, for by any creative analysis, the Stones were over after \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" And yet, here they are, almost four decades later, capable of producing the most lucrative tour of any year.    Like so many things these days, music is about branding -- and there's no bigger brand than the Rolling Stones. Keith may slag his band mates; he'd never mock the Stones. Because the band is, if his version is accurate, really his triumph. Mick provided the flash, but in rock and roll, a great riff will always trump flash.    A great riff will also trump time. We love rock for many reasons, and not the smallest is the way it makes us feel young, as if everything's possible and the road is clear ahead of us. And here is Keith Richards, who never grew up and is now so rich he'll never have to.    His story slows as it approaches the present, and you start to wonder if this Peter Pan life can get to its end without real pain. And you think, well, there's another side to this -- if Mick started writing tonight, he could have his book out before he's 70. But mostly, you wish you could go back to the beginning of \\"Life\\" and start again.

0385737955|5.0|I bought this for my son (16) while researching for \\"guy\\" books.  He's not into the Percy-type books.  I had pushed him to read the Hunger Games and he liked it so I felt fairly safe that this was not a bad investment.  Once he read it he declared it was his absolute favorite and he needed to know when the sequel would be available.  He convinced me then to read it and he was not wrong in his assessment.  The action and curiosity (mystery) is immediate and I could not put it down till it was over.  Thank goodness it isn't ACTUALLY over and is the first of a trilogy.  Looking forward to THE SCORCH TRIALS.  Good, that.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Kids, what you have to realize is the Blue (and the Red) albums aren't just more made up compilations from the digital age.  Long ago in a galaxy far far away these albums were stand alone collections.  An awful lot of people who grew up with the Beatles bought these for a variety of reasons, some to replace their worn out albums, others might have just missed the relavance of it all but were old enough in 1973 to want to know what they missed out on.  People loved these two collections just for what they were at the time.  For some, the Blue album was really their Abbey Road, you know?<br /><br />Nobody bitched about length of LP sides, mono vs. stereo or anything else.  You just played the LP's and loved the music completely.  I still think the Blue album is the finest \\"best of\\" collection ever issued, by anybody.<br /><br />So take a deep breath and enjoy this for what it was.....and still is. Bonus tracks would do nothing to improve on this, you really think it would???? If you disagree then by all means burn your CDR's and move on.<br /><br />Thank you.

B00008438V|5.0|I recently saw this film and found it truly hilarious. Great acting and great lines by all the actors many of whom went on to become big stars.  Check out a very young Robert Downey Jr (\\"Ironman\\" star) and a wild Bill Paxton (\\"Twister\\" star), as the evil, older brother. A harsh, military school student.<br /><br />Two teens decide to create their own perfect woman using a computer. She is well rounded, literally, smart, sexy, and always obeys her creator.  You can imagine the wide open story line here.<br /><br />With great lines and scenes, the movie flows quite well, and was very, very fun to watch. Highly recommended! I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
B00415MUWG|5.0|This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review.  I just feel that this album deserves a lot more exposure than it might be seeing.    As the name might imply, this is an album of duets by two amazing singers.  As such, you expect the vocals to be great, and they are.  What I find even more amazing though, is the band.  I expected the music behind the singers to be somewhat bland, but that isn't the case.  The band does not take a back seat to the two singers, they are there to play, and play hard.    All in all, its a great album to listen in every facet.
0763644765|5.0|My son loves this potty book, and so do I.  Unlike everybody poops and similar books this one actually shows the child what needs to be done...sit on the potty and wait!  This was the fist book that my son actually got really engaged in, laughing at funny parts, responding to questions the little kid asks, and best of all asking \\"again?\\" when I get to the end.  We just bought another of Leslie Patricelli's board books (Yummy Yucky) and the same result.  She does really well in targeting the 18+ month super active kids, because the stories aren't too involved language-wise for them to follow, and really comes at it from their point of view.  Will be getting more of her books.
1554072840|5.0|I had this book when I was a child and bought it when I started ECing with my daughter. Since 8 months she has been captivated not so much by the story but rather the pictures. She is in love with the book and spends a lot of time flipping through the pages. I find the book very straight forward and the illustrations clear, unlike some befuddled reviewers.
6305903182|5.0|I try to be as honest as I can when reviewing Movies and I must say that this is a classic.  A \\"must have\\" movie for anyone who likes scary movies.  I will say that Most movies get worse as the sequels come out but this one is just as good as the first one.  I have all of the Scream movies and I would recommend them to anyone who has not seen them or to anyone who does not own them.  One of my favorites.<br /><br />Obviously The plot surrounds Sidney Prescott (Nev Campbell) and the rest of the gang from Scream 1 and 2.  I will say that Randy does make a cameo appearance in this film even though he was butchered pretty badly in the second one by Billies Mother :P  The plot is honestly pretty much the same as the first two with a mysterious ghost face killer wanting to kill Sidney for some crazy unknown reason.  The reason is however ALWAYS made clear at the end.  With Scream 3 though I must say that you will not see this coming if you have never seen it before.  It was a BIG Shock to me when I first saw it.  The rules that applied to Scream 1 do not apply to the Concluding chapter in the Scream Trilogy!  You think you know the facts but the truth is you don't.  The past comes back to bight them in the behind and everything that they thought they knew about the past was WRONG!  That is precisely why I recommend this one to anyone who doesn't own it or has never seen it :) It is just a classic.  So go pick it up on here while there are still some left and please enjoy :)<br /><br />And I would only ask that if you found this review helpful in your decision to purchase this item that you could click the button and let me know.  It really does mean a lot to me to know that you guys think I wrote a good review and to know that it helped you in your decision so if you could just click the button and let me know It would mean A lot to me :) Thanks again friend

6305882592|5.0|For years I heard \\"Harold and Maude\\" was a fantastic movie, but I never got the chance to come across it. Looking it up on various internet sites I discovered the film was put out on DVD in 2000 and is long out-of-print. Luckily, I went to a garage sale recently and found a copy for five dollars!<br /><br /> \\"Harold and Maude\\" is considered by most people as one of the greatest Hollywood films ever making it on the top 10 list of various critics' list, and the movie has been preserved in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.<br /><br /> The film is really a dark comedy that deals with a young boys infatuation with death. Harold (played brilliantly by Bud Cort) constantly thinks of ways in which to die, drives a hearse, and stages different acts of dying, all while attending funerals as if he's going to an opening of a new movie. His mother becomes frustrated as she regards Harold's behavior as odd. It is at one of these funerals where he meets an 80 year old woman named Maude, superbly played by Oscar winner Ruth Gordon (who won the golden statue for her role in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\"). The two form a bond as Harold sees Maude as somewhat of an idol, someone who has lived a long life, but is that much closer to dying, something he strives for. Through Maude the young man soon realizes the importance of staying alive and that search for happiness as life is too short. Like she says in one of the movies best scenes, \\"L I V E.....live!!!!!\\"<br /><br /> Many who haven't seen \\"Harold and Maude\\" are turned off by the subject matter as they don't want to watch a film that deals with death and dying. However, the movie is more than that: it is funny, poignant, well-written, and extremely well-acted. Colin Higgins wrote the screenplay and would go onto to enjoy a successful career as a director, directing Dolly Parton's first two feature-length films, \\"9 to 5\\" and \\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\\", as well as co-writing both movies and writing the huge 1978 Goldie Hawn vehicle \\"Foul Play\\".<br /><br /> The 2000 DVD release was, unfortunately, a barebones edition with no special features, but hopefully Paramount will someday soon give fans a \\"Special DVD Edition\\" this classic so richly deserves.l Play\\".      The 2000 DVD release was, unfortunately, a barebones edition with no special features, but hopefully Paramount will someday soon give fans a \\"Special DVD Edition\\" this classic so richly deserves.

B002ZG98LO|5.0|I enjoyed this film and the DVD has a great commentary track with RR and Nimrod discussing not just the production but good brain candy for any filmmaker.  They made this film for what the first one cost without inflation adjustment.      I've always loved Predator films but this one actually has cool characters and nobody teams up with a Predator to vanquish a common foe.  Seriously?  And then what happens?  She goes back to the Predator's planet to meet his parents?    If you dig the work of the filmmakers, the Predator or fun science-fiction with some good gun-on-alien lifeforms action, this is one to own.
B0009UC810|5.0|Blues Brothers is fun as hell. Really, that's all you need to know (as long as you'll take my word for it.    One of the - if not THE - finest musicals of the 80s, the movie cruises along with never a dull moment and some of the finest choreography, whether we're talking about people dancing or cars dancing in chase and getaway. Funny, actiony, ballsy and beautiful!

This book is an important tool whether you are dealing with personal or organizational challenges that require a change.

B003F3NDOO|5.0|Courtney Cox at her best.   Funnyest comedy since Scrubs.  Great easy to use dvd.  The only problem I had with it is episode 23 and 24 are around the wrong way.  So you have to watch episode 24 first then episode 23.   Not sure how they made that mistake.   Hope they keep the seasons coming!!!
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I saw this when it was a first-run film and liked it even though I was too young to understand everything about it.  I have seen it several times since and was happy to see that it was not only available on DVD but that it had been colorized and that this set included all the songs on a CD.  I have seen several colorized movies and so I approached this with some trepidation but I was pleased to see that the process had worked successfully on this version.  The colors may not be quite as brilliant as if it had originally been shot in Technicolor but they are very good and I am amazed how much it added to the movie experience.  Anyone who has been raised in this overly-sensitized and Politically Correct modern era may have problems with a couple of spots. Yes, as some reviewers have noted, there is segment with everyone in black-face and, yes, Louise Beavers is portrayed in the typical Hollywood way, but, right or wrong, this was the standard way of doing things in those days.  You must remember that if Ms Beavers had not wanted to play the role that way she could have turned the part down.    If you are one of those who are easily offended you may want to skip through the \\"Abraham\\" segment.  If, however, you are smart enough to understand that things concerning race have changed considerably in the last 50 years you will enjoy some good old fashioned singing, dancing and acting.  After the film you can slap the CD on your player and enjoy the songs all over again.  This collection is a winner.
B003FK8V7G|5.0|Once again, The Gaslight Anthem creates a flawless album that begs to be listened to again and again.  The '59 Sound made GA my NEW favorite band and American Slang made them my favorite band period.  Admittedly, I held off on doing a review b/c after my first listen to the album, I was slightly disappointed.  The '59 Sound caught my attention and heart strings immediately.  But I held off b/c I had a feeling that my great expectations (pun intended) were getting in the way of how the album truly was.  And after repeated listens, I am hooked.  Going away from the 50's inspired sound that weaved together punk and Americana, American Slang weaves motown with punk and Americana.  It makes for an interesting hybrid and GA pulls it off to perfection.  The storytelling and big choruses abound and one immediately relates to the tales of heartbreak, growing up, redemption, and love and lost love.  Fallon has the gift for pulling you into the song and feeling what he is feeling.  American Slang is just another example that there is still hope for American music.  For me, standout tracks include American Slang, Bring It On, The Diamond Church Street Choir, The Queen Of Lower Chelsea, Orphans, and Old Haunts.  But as usual with GA, there are no bad tracks.  This is a great step forward for Gaslight Anthem and I am anxiously awaiting whatever they do next.
1442135034|1.0|My issue is not with Virginia Woolf -- it is with publisher, Classic House Books. Among this book's many problems:  - It's riddled with typographical errors and plain old spelling mistakes (\\"furtile\\"???)  - No section/chapter breaks (as in the much, much better Penguin edition) -- which, given the denseness of Woolf's writing, actively impairs reading comprehension  - It's terribly designed: Random words in all caps (\\"BOEUF EN DAUBE\\"), awful typography: en dashes (-) rendered as double hyphens (--), dumb quotes (inch marks) instead of proper \\"educated\\" or \\"curly\\" quotation marks. I can't bring myself to look at the text closely, but it appears to be at least partially set in Times New Roman.  - Cheap paper stock  - Awful cover design and amateurish description on the back cover (\\"beautifully produced by Classic House Books\\" - Ha!)    Don't waste your time with this edition and encourage the proliferation of such sloppy hack jobs. Look for the Penguin edition, which is professionally put together, and features both an enlightening introduction and helpful end notes. Shame on you, Classic House Books!
0316098337|4.0|It's not often that one finds an adult novel narrated by a five-year-old boy. Emma Donoghue pulls off that feat with great skill in her novel, Room. Young Jack has spent all five years of his life living with his mother in an 11x11 space he calls \\"room\\" and which has been the totality of his world view. The slow disclosure of how they ended up in this situation and the depth of love that sustained them becomes the core of the novel. Donoghue's writing kept me engaged from beginning to end, and in some respects, I was reminded of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, in how well Donoghue explores parental love and the ways in which love overcomes any obstacle or limitation. Book clubs will likely enjoy this selection, and any reader looking for an unusual novel with fine writing will likely enjoy this book.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
0618918248|4.0|I enjoyed the read but Dawkins spent too much time putting others down in my opinion.  The idea isn't always being right as much as it is putting the facts out there for people to recognize.  Unfortunately nothing gets done without being a little eccentric.  Other than that the book makes some VERY good points and kills a lot of the arguments for religion.

B000025H0Q|5.0|I have only recently become aware of Nick Drake's music, but now I know all his albums pretty well. They all provide very fine songs and great music, though some of the posthumously released albums are somewhat uneven.<br /><br />Among his three original albums, I have come to the conclusion that his second, \\"Bryter Later\\",  is his most successful and in any case the album I would only recommend a friend.<br /><br />It is his most \\"produced\\" album with musical assistance from the three members of Fairport Convention Richard Thompson, Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks. Furthermore contributing John Cale on a few numbers.<br /><br />Several tracks have tasteful stringsarrangements written by Nick's good friend Robert Kirby.<br /><br />All the songs are good, but you obviously get your favorites.<br /><br />\\"One of These Things First\\" is a quiet and very beautiful song with nice accompaniment by Paul Harris, Ed Carter and Mike Kowalski.<br /><br />\\"Fly\\" with nice contributions from John Cale at the harpsichord and viola is number seems to be better every time you hear it. Perhaps most moving on the album, if that title does not go to the album's second track with significant contributions from John Cale - \\"Northern Sky\\". This was the song I fell for the first: there's something magnificent about this beautiful and airy number.<br /><br />\\"Poor Boy\\" is almost a little jazzy, with strong vocal backing from PP Arnold and Doris Troy. There's something very liberating unpretentious over both lyrics and music. The same can be said about \\"Hazey Jane II\\", which also has fine lead guitar from Richard Thompson.<br /><br />\\"Hazey Jane I\\" is a totally different song - as I hear it, they have only the title in common. Also a nice song with backing from Mattacks, and Pegg.<br /><br />There are three instrumental tracks - are all fine and well distributed across the album as 1, 6 and 10th tracks<br /><br />On all tracks you have Drake's acoustic guitar, which he mastered to almost perfection.<br /><br />A strong album that  deservedly has become a classic, albeit pretty long after its release in 1970, where it was almost unnoticed.after its release in 1970, where it was almost unnoticed.

0767812166|5.0|Starman is the great lost classic film of the 1980's. I still remember seeing this in late 1984 at the movies. So, why have many people never even heard of it or seen it? I'm of the opinion that the title 'Starman' either turned off many moviegoers as too science-fiction or too much for the kids. The movie did not do well in the theater, but was reviewed very well upon release. This movie serves as almost a time capsule of the early to mid-80's, as it's a road trip from Wisconsin to Arizona, and meeting all of the different people and characters throughout the journey. Carpenter really worked magic here in making an improbably storyline seem believable, and both Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen's performances are Oscar worthy. This updated release, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, is bare-bones. Hopefully, it will be re-released with all of the extras it deserves.
B00000264F|5.0|What an arragant response from Graboidz. Hey buddy if you didnt like this album and with a response as smug as that why did you bother leaving a review you jerk!    Apart from that this album is really great. Its consistent all the way through and doesnt loose its energy at all throughout the album. The guitar playing is great and the vocals are really top notch. To most people Europe is just another hair rock/metal band with the song 'The Final Countdown', but this album proves that theyr're more than that. This album isnt commercial, it is more melodic in that sense. It has no keyboard drowning guitars out or has filler songs. It also has some really heavy stuff in here which I was really surprised about. Each song is perfect and makes the album even better as a new listener. This album is propper rockin' with great metal songs that could fit in with any NWOBHM band. If your a fan of 80s splitting rock/metal with a nice edge then this album is worth buying!  5/5

B0038YWPZS|1.0|I received my Dirty Dancing Keepsake edition DVD in a timely manner.  Since I was busy with my job, I didn't get to view it right away.  When I did play it on my laptop, only the 2nd DVD would play, the one with all the interviews and information on how they made the movie, etc.  I then went to play the actual movie and it would not play on my laptop.  When I got home that night, I put the DVD in my TV/DVD player.  Sure enough it would not play in that machine either.    As of this writing, this issue has not yet been resolved with Amazon.  I have purchased many movies through Amazon and this is the first time I've ever run into a problem like this.  Hopefully my Keepsake edition will be replaced soon and at no cost to me.  Time will tell whether I purchase future movies at Amazon.

B0047SF41G|1.0|Another great opportunity at \\"finally\\" making a decent sequel to the original Predator gone to waste... Talentless, boring and borderline stupid, Nimrod Antal and Robert Rodriguez deliver a disappointing movie. There's not a shred of originality in this frantic sci-fi sequel.<br /><br />Oh and that shot in the trailer of multiple laser sights trained on Brody is a cheat!

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I have read (I believe) all of Ken Follett's books and was looking forward to reading this one on my Kindle, so I could avoid lugging around such a sizable book.  However, I'll have to wait for it to come out in paperback because I refuse to pay more for an e-book than for a hardbound.  To add insult to injury, I saw it listed in a competing e-book format for about half the price on the Kindle. With such a large part of the market couldn't Amazon negotiate a better price with the publisher than the brick-and-mortar store's?  It's a shame.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|While social networking may not seem like much, it actually seems to be a big deal to people these days and Facebook is without a doubt the most popular of these social networking websites. That's why it makes sense to have a movie based on the whole social network phenomenon that's been occurring since the 2000's; people are attracted and interested in it. The Social Network is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires and does rely on some facts that did happen. The Social Network does a good job at going into the story of the cultural phenomenon that is the website Facebook. It goes into the whom /how/when and where elements of the story that will interest the concerned Facebookers around the world, plus the story is well executed on film and much more entertaining than it suggests.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg is a student at Harvard University who creates a website which allows users to judge which girls are better looking.Zuckerberg's website is so popular that it overflows Harvard's internet. Zuckerbeg then gets approached by the Winklevoss twins in order to create a social website for them that would connect every Harvard student. Mark Agrees but turns them down progressively as he builds \\"his\\" website, \\"The Facebook\\", using the Winklevoss' ideas or as he said it \\"just made them better\\". Zuckerberg is helped by a small team, including financial partner Edouardo Saverin who plays a big role in the making of Facebook.One of the best parts of the movie was when Mark and Eduardo met the inventor of Napster, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), Parker who becomes co-owner of Facebook appears as an eccentric young and successful \\"businessman\\". Justin Timberlake plays the role of Parker brilliantly; he gave a solid performance in the film. Parker's involvement in Facebook creates between Mark and Edourado. The events happening in the movie happened prior to the lawsuit that's the focus of the movie.

1439181780|1.0|Rhonda Byrne is the epitome of New Age Nihilism. Was her first project ('The Secret') an exploration of boundless materialism and individualism (the icons of our time), in her second book she takes these concepts beyond the boundaries of utter madness. Everything in Byrne's work evolves around feeding the ego in its limitless clinging to Matter and People for the glorification of itself.     Instead of necessary lessons in moderation and humility in today's overpopulated and increasingly polluted world, filled with increasing numbers of individuals who don't mind going over corpses to feed their hunger for 'things', Byrne adds fuel to a fire raging on our planet. Instead of asking whether or not the limitless faith in 'the pursuit of happiness through material means' is actually beneficial to humanity and to Earth, Byrne is like a pusher giving heroine to addicts.     Of course, none of her 'laws' have a leg to stand on, and are but the fruits of her own imagination. And - apart from a handful of believers - none of her readers will actually experience any improvement in life-as-they-know-it. Byrne offers her audience a few minutes of Hope; that they too can get on the roller coaster of material prosperity. As if that's where true happiness lies...     Byrne offers Supermarket Spirituality, to be bought in between muscle powders and slimming tablets. It's a spirituality that's supposed to work miracles in the supermarket, is easily digestible, doesn't take any effort or inward contemplation, and claims to be harmless to the environment.     The moment the visions on a 'vision board' are of makings to soothe the ego and ignore the soul, one has exchanged one's 'spirituality' for 'superficiality'.     The only person benefiting from 'The Power' is the author, raking in millions through the desperation and emptiness felt by her audience. As is normal on this earthly plane of ours, where it's the providers of a thing called 'Hope' who have access to boundless riches.

0439023521|4.0|After hearing so many people rave about this book, I knew I had to read it.  I had read one of Collins' Gregor books before and enjoyed it so I knew this couldn't be too bad.  Not to mention I absolutely love dystopian novels.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is set in a United States far in the future.  Only it's not the United States anymore, its Panem, a controlling government city surround by twelve districts.  Katniss is a member of district 12, best known for its coal mining and starving citizens.  When her sister is picked as one of the tributes for the Hunger Games (an event put on by the government every year that has a boy and a girl from each district fight to the death until on one is left remaining) she selflessly volunteers to go instead.  With the boy tribute Peeta they head to the Capitol where they will be trained for the event and gussied up for everyone to see and place bets on.<br /><br />Advertised as star-crossed lovers Peeta and Katniss are quick favorites.  They clean up nice and become a quick hit with the sponsors who are allowed to give them gifts during the game.  They are dropped with the other tributes in a field and quickly have to kill, be killed, or get out of there to plan how to survive.  When the games start turning brutal and death seems to be imminent they must stick together in order to survive.  The problem is, the rules say only one of them can win.<br /><br />There's a lot more to this story than I could ever summarize without giving away important plot details.  It is full of depth and frightening, yet intriguing ideas.  Katniss as a character is ok.  She's very standoffish and since the story is told from her in the present tense that can make for hard narrating at times.  Peeta is genuine and you find yourself rooting for him, but Collins does a good job of not making you trust him fully.  The rest of the characters only have small parts so there isn't much detail about a majority of them.  This is probably a positive aspect as you don't care too much when they die.<br /><br />Collins is a pretty good writer.  That being said, I didn't care for the first person present tense in this novel.  Its never one of my favorite tenses because it seems awkward and doesn't lend itself to describing things very well.  While we can get a faint gist of Kat's world from her eyes, it isn't as much as I wanted to see.  She has the makings of a very interesting world and human destiny, loads more information would be appreciated.<br /><br />This is a great book that shouldn't just be limited to juvenile fiction.  I think all ages can enjoy this book; especially those who favor dystopian fiction.  There are a few flaws in the book but not enough to keep it from being a thoroughly enjoyable read.<br /><br />The Hunger Games<br />Copyright 2008<br />374 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

I suppose to do right for this period in history would require perhaps a couple more volumes, but I was still disappoited in the end.    The price of $19.99 for an eBook is exhorbinant.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|I was quite astonished at the sophistication of this film.  It has all the prerequisites of overblown melodrama:  a beautiful proto-feminist heroine, two men in love with her (a slave and an aristocrat), and a reconstituted repository of ancient rational knowledge, in a backdrop of fanatical Christians taking over from declining pagans.  I assumed, wrongly, it was going to be another Prince-of-Persia type reconstruction of hyperbole, muddled facts, and overlooked nuance.  Instead, the film is a wonderfully stimulating portrayal of an intellectual and the end of a tradition - of rationalist philosophy - of nearly 1000 years, to make way for monotheism and soon the collapse of the Roman civilization.<br /><br />The intellectual themes of the film are rather recondite.  On the one hand, Hypatia (who actually is an historical figure) is seeking to explore the validity of the core assumptions in the cosmology of Ptolemy:  that the Earth is the stationary center of the universe around which everything revolves; that circles, the most perfect expression of the principles of Euclidean geometry, must be the form that the motions take.  She starts from the premise that real-life observation should be connected to philosophic ideals (a precursor of modern scientific experimentation).  On the other hand, there are the fundamentalists, that is, the early Christians who are following their consciences and the dictates of the Emperor Constantine to accept Christianity as the religion of the Empire;  their universe is not rational, but based on faith, what is the word of God as written in the Book, and lastly revelation in which God directly offers guidance to the self-appointed leaders of the faithful.  It is simply amazing to me that this clash of world views can be presented with the level of subtlety and sophistication that it is.<br /><br />The plot that frames the story is somewhat less subtle, but the script, the direction, and the acting are so fine that, in my view, none of the characters (save perhaps the brutal, angry, and arrogant Christian leader Cyril) fall into stereotypes.  Hypatia is the daughter of an old-style aristocratic philosopher, who is open-minded enough not to push her into marriage and nurtured her mind to the point that she is a masterful teacher and intellectual.  They maintain what is left of the Alexandrian library, a treasury of ancient knowledge accumulated from the time of Alexander the Great.  Outside their walls, there is a fight for the soul of the city, led by a fanatical Christian, Cyril, about whom I know nothing as to his historical basis.  The pagans feel besieged, the Christians on the ascendant, as backed by the Emperors of West and East Rome.<br /><br />Hypatia is loved by both an aristocratic upstart and one of her slaves.  These two men embody what is happening to the city and indeed to the empire.  Fortunately, the evolution of their characters and their later actions - in spite of Hyaptia's rejection of both of their advances - is completely believable and nuanced.  I do not want to play the spoiler here as it is a big part of the film's value and dramatic tension.  Suffice to say that the Christians win, their appetite for power and domination ever expanding and sweeping away anything and everyone in its wake:  as fundamentalists with a monopoly on the truth, they are portrayed as nascent totalitarians though not as simple brutes.<br /><br />As a history buff who has long studied the elucidation of the motion of the planets - the greatest early achievement of what became modern science - I did feel that too much license was taken with what Hypatia did and thought.  Indeed, she is portrayed as first discovering what Johannes Kepler finally proved in the late Renaissance:  that the Earth moved in an elliptical orbit around the sun, which occupied one of its foci.  There is no evidence that she did, so far as I know.  Nonetheless, that the film brings these issues to a popular audience with thesophistication that it does, and without  2-dimensional characters, is a first-rate achievement.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.  If  Christian fundamentalists denounce the existential perspective of the film, this would be a regrettable missed chance for dialogue.  No one, save the brilliant Hypatia, looks good in this rich film.s, and without  2-dimensional characters, is a first-rate achievement.      Recommended with enthusiasm.

1563894696|3.0|Right off let me say I'm not a fan of Tim Sale's illustration. Every man's face is drawn to resemble a dog and every woman is grotesquely disfigured. Batman himself is drawn to have what looks like a rat face in this book, and the Joker has a mouth full of piano key length teeth. The story itself is fine, though it is stretched out unnecessarily since the artwork doesn't provide any additional info or clues to who is the killer. Overall it's an adequate work, but I cannot recommend it.

1439156816|5.0|The immediate impression I had upon finishing this fun and informative memoir from renowned novelist Stephen King was that this was largely a cathartic effort, one which I felt he needed to finish following his horrific roadside near death accident in 1999. True, the bulk of this comparatively short work deals with his thoughts and lessons learned on writing as a craft, but the, ironically, best writing here is when he describes his accident and subsequent recovery. I was overtaken with King's spirit and his seemingly underlying drive to recover that made his chapter on the accident marvelous reading and, thus, made this book another in the long line of King &quot;must reads.&quot;<br /><br />Beginning with a biography that extols his surprisingly (at least to me) destitute life as a young teacher and writer, we learn indirectly about his talent and, importantly, his cavernous and macabre imagination. Seeming to take stories out of this struggling life, King shares how rejection after rejection only fortified his resolve...justified with the &quot;Carrie&quot; novel as his breakthrough. Bouts with drugs and alcohol are, again, revelatory especially with the story of how he remembers little of his work on &quot;Cujo&quot;, being &quot;drunk throughout the writing of it.&quot;<br /><br />The chapters where King essentially teaches the &quot;class&quot; on creative writing are helpful, but, I felt that the important points are the seemingly common sense attributes...write constantly, write what you know, stay true to yourself...etc. All these things seem to me to be common knowledge, but the notion that &quot;to write well, one must read a lot&quot; was, although again common sense, revelatory nonetheless. Giving many examples of expanding rough drafts into literarily useable works, it was his example of how he &quot;cut&quot; much out of the initial draft of his short story &quot;1408&quot; that really shows his expertise and, humbly, how far someone like me has to goto approach that level.<br /><br />Fans of King may be turned off by a short non-fiction work as this, but &quot;On Writing&quot; reveals a lot of how King formulates his stories and does the most, I feel, to get to the core of the &quot;mind of the master.&quot; And, as with virtually all King works, this one is also fun and easy to read. Highest recommendation.
0316098337|5.0|A novel narrated by a five-year-old boy with the title water-colored on the cover? Awww, how precious, right? Not so. Not by a long shot. Emma Donoghue's Room is one of the most fresh, terrifyingly good novels I've read this year, but it's anything but precious. Room works for three reasons: 1) The originality of five-year-old Jack's voice. 2) The originality of the story itself. 3) How these two combine to create a work of fiction that leaves its readers absolutely floored.<br /><br />First, Jack's voice: He narrates the story as any normal five-year-old would. He's curious. He's unintentionally funny. And he negotiates some pretty tricky existential questions. (Is Room still there if we're not in it?) But my favorite part of Jack's voice is how he points out the absurdity of things we often take for granted. For instance, Jack hits his head, an adult says \\"careful,\\" and Jack wonders, \\"Why do persons only say that after the hurt?\\" Also, Jack explaining lottery tickets: \\"The little cards with numbers all over are called a lottery, idiots buy them hoping to get magicked into millionaires.\\" That one slayed me!<br /><br />Secondly, Donoghue's plot is bold. A woman is kidnapped and forced to live in a shed in the backyard of the kidnapper's house. She has a son by her kidnapper. The son lives the first five years of his life in captivity with his mother. Donoghue says the plot was inspired by real-world events. But imagining what that ordeal must have been like to someone who doesn't consider it an ordeal but as simple reality, and then telling it as realistically as it seems, is a tremendous literary feat. The only thing I'll say about the rest of the plot -- and normally I hate when reviewers do this, but I can't think of a book for which this is more true -- is that the less you know about it, the more rewarding your reading experience. That's how it was for me. But know this: It's not always smooth emotional sailing. It can be dark, it can be incredibly sad, and it can be frightening, in the sense of getting a glimpse at humanity's worst. That's really what I mean by \\"terrifyingly good.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the combination of Jack's voice and the creativity of the plot make for a novel that unpacks in such a way that we, as adults, learn about the world along with Jack. Inasmuch as any five-year-old can come of age, we practically come of age with him. It takes Jack's innocent perspective for us to see things like evil, celebrity, family and friendship in new and interesting lights. Additionally, the strength of the mother-son bond in the worst of circumstances comes through extraordinarily clearly as the plot unfolds. The connection could not possibly have been so strongly rendered with an omniscient narrator, or really even if the mother had been telling the story.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book more highly. Because Room was on the Man Booker Prize shortlist, I took a flier on it and am absolutely delighted I did. Simply put, Room's one of the best novels of 2010.<br /><br />(The title quote is from a TS Eliot poem. It is quoted by a character in Room, and is a near-perfect seven-word representation of the book.)ng, in the sense of getting a glimpse at humanity's worst.

B003KVNV4S|1.0|OK, bought this at a spur of the moment believing all the prior reviews were to be trusted.  The short song previews seemed promising, but I was forcing myself to listen to this album; not the way music should be enjoyed.  It was painful and tedious, not my cup of tea.  I am currently listening to Nite Jewel (want you back EP), Sufjan Stevens (the age of adz), Crystal Fighters (star of love) all bought in a similar fashion (spur of the moment).  So, the slow tempo of High Violet seems to contrast my current taste in music.  Maybe this review is harsh but I can't find myself listening to this album.  I will give it a few days and come back to it and then edit this review, but I suggest listening to a few complete tracks prior to purchasing this album.     Hope this helps.

1607886278|4.0|This is longest 300 pages of mostly-dialog I've ever read. I think it literally took me six weeks to work my way through this one. I actually considered putting it away without finishing, something I almost never do.<br /><br />Not because it isn't good. It's actually pretty amazing--creative, insightful, revelatory in this incredibly sneaky, deceptively simplistic way, an incredible piece of craftsmanship. It's good the way Schindler's List is good; well done, but mostly not enjoyable.<br /><br />The story is narrated in the first person by five-year-old Jack, a child raised entirely in Room, an 11x11 foot backyard shed where he and his mother are held prisoner by a man Jack knows only as Old Nick. At the beginning of the story, Jack feels safe and comfortable in Room--his daily routine includes meals and exercise, reading and chores, play time and no more than two television shows. But the realities of his situation are beginning to show through the safe world his Ma has created for him. At night, after Jack has gone to sleep in Wardrobe, Old Nick comes. Some days Ma is \\"switched off\\"--she stays in bed all day, and Jack is allowed to watch all the T.V. he wants. When Old Nick begins experiencing financial difficulties and providing fewer supplies, their situation becomes even more desperate.<br /><br />In constructing Jack's voice, the author gives herself some latitude, but her characterization is true to the narrator's age overall. Like most five-year-olds Jack argues with his mother and has occasional tantrums. He experiences and expresses curiosity, anxiety and fear in authentic and believable ways. His constant one-on-one time with his mother has given him an advanced vocabulary as well as reading and math skills several years ahead of his real age. His emotional development, however, is complicated by the fact that he's only really ever known one other person. This makes for an interesting juxtaposition and leaves plenty of room for growth later in the novel. My only complaint is that Jack always seems to know why he does things. In my experience, this is not the case with most children--or many adults for that matter. His capacity for self-consciousness and analysis is probably pretty unrealistic.<br /><br />This is a well written, thoughtfully constructed book well worth reading. It's harrowing and difficult, but it does end on a hopeful note.<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />A QUICK NOTE ON THE AUDIO VERSION: The book may be great but the audio book is incredibly, horribly annoying.

B001EOOQEC|4.0|Although I still own the original CD release of \\"Dehumanizer\\", there's a new remastered version of it that is probably better sounding, so I'd recommend the new release.  However, since the sad passing of Ronnie James Dio, a metal master vocalist if ever there was one, interest in his work has naturally increased, which is kind of sad, because we shouldn't wait for death to renew our interest in a band or individual musician.<br />  Released in 1992 amid the explosion of grunge and all things flannel, \\"Dehumanizer\\" didn't receive the attention it deserved and sank quickly even though it's a fine record and showed the second classic Sabbath lineup in fine form.  Rarely has a band endured a personnel change as dramatic as Black Sabbath, the lords of all things metal, from stoner rock (\\"Masters Of Reality\\") to doom (\\"Black Sabbath\\") and just plain heavy as hell (\\"Paranoid\\").  Sabbath pioneered every aspect of metal, and while they weren't huge as far as thrash was concerned, the chopping rhythms of songs like \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Children Of The Grave\\" have to be regarded as important stepping stones toward that genre, not to mention the guitar tone, which nobody has ever duplicated.<br />  The eerie alienated voice of a much younger Ozzy Osbourne fit the bleak dark world of Black Sabbath, so when he departed the metal world held its breath waiting to see what would happen.  Fortunately, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward spared no expense and recruited former Elf and Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio to fill the Oz's shoes.  So successful was this choice that Sabbath indeed have a part one/part two career with metal classics representing both the oldest and newer material.  Dio's first outing with \\"Heaven and Hell\\" resulted in a metal classic, showing a sleeker but no less bone crunching Sabbath taking on all comers.  The following, \\"Mob Rules\\" doesn't receive the accolades of \\"Heaven and Hell\\", and that's too bad because in this reviewer's opinion, \\"Mob Rules\\" is the best Dio-era Sabbath album ever.  Sabbath was never harder or more sinister, especially the first four tracks and \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" from the original vinyl side two.<br />  After a live album, Dio departed for solo work, leaving Tony and Company to slog through several vocalists, including Ian Gillan for \\"Born Again\\", a terribly produced album that would have been another monster had it been recorded properly.  In 1992, Dio rejoined for the \\"Mob Rules\\" line-up with \\"Dehumanizer\\".  This CD could easily have been released right after \\"Mob Rules\\", with the expert vocals of Dio and some fine riffing from Tony.  A few cuts are standouts, including the thrashy \\"TV Crimes\\" and \\"Time Machine\\", and mid-paced bruisers \\"Master Of Insanity\\" and \\"Sins of the Father\\".<br />  Overall, this CD bridges the gap between \\"Mob Rules\\" and Dio's final album as a member of Heaven and Hell, same line-up, different moniker.  As with his swan song, the two albums are quite similar, with H & H's \\"The Devil You Know\\" much better produced.  For those completists looking for all of Dio's work, don't miss this one, and for those Sabbath fans who just want another slab of metal from the underlords of metal, \\"Dehumanizer\\" also belongs in your collection.es\\" is the best Dio-era Sabbath album ever.

B003Q6D2B4|2.0|In matters of taste there is no dispute and by giving this abomination a 2 star rating I'm bound to arouse the ire of those who love Bruce Willis, Action-Adventure etc.  Nevertheless, I personally think this film stinks.  In many ways the plot is a rip-off of the equally lousy 'Shooter'.  In both films impossible violence against the CIA and the U.S. Government is justified by the slaughter of vative villages--in Ethiopia ['Shooter'] and in Guatemala ['Red'].<br /><br />Anyway, it seems that Willis, Freeman etc. [senior citizens all] are more lethal, dangerous and well-armed than were 50 Clint Eastwoods.  These guys are real terrors.  They mow down equally well-armed and far more numerous CIA men without getting hit themselves [of course].  Standard Action-Adventure fare, if you think about it.  Shell casings pile up in their thousands and the dead in their hundreds.  Willis is the 'most interesting man alive.' to quote a well-known commercial.<br /><br />To make the Hollywood point even further, a Russian agent/KGB is a terrific guy who helps our guys against the evil U.S.  Drip, drip, drip.  He always shows up where he isn't expected and just in the nick of time.  Amazing.<br /><br />Obviously this dreck cost quite a lot of money to make--well-known actors and plenty of special effects.  The film's lack of any real quality must rest directly on the shoulders of brain-dead writers and their director/producer promoters.  Then again, maybe they aren't that brain dead.  Some kids, who claimed this movie was 'great', got me to buy their tickets.  I was an unwitting accomplice to the subversion of our youth.  Shame on me.
B0032JTV6U|4.0|obviously i love glee, or i wouldn't have ordered this set...the episodes are hilarious, touching, and as provocative as a satirical musical dramedy can be! the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is because i really would have liked to have the episodes either listed on the discs or have some sort of list somewhere in the set so i could tell which episodes were on which disc. i guess i'll just have to memorize it :)
B003WTE886|4.0|Amazon, R U kidding me?  At $3.99, this album is a steal.  I dont know how Amazon makes money on these deals, but we thank u.<br /><br />I am not into country music or much pop as I usually only listen to R & B & hip hop, but Taylor just has a voice that grabs me, & I also bought her last album which also grabbed me which is odd, cause generally, I have no interest in this type of music but I must say I love this album.  Her voice just uplifts your spirit, she has a beautiful sound, & I recommend this to anyone who even remotely likes to have their spirit lifted.  Her presentation is almost flawless, & her voice just softly flows from your speakers.
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann has of late been a sensation in the operatic world. The frenzy actually got its momentum from his Grammophone Award recording of Strauss's lieder.<br />I have got most, if not all, of Kaufmann's DVDs and vocal albums. Like most German tenors, he started out as a 'lyrical tenor' singing Mozart and Schubert and some baroque roles. Indeed, he has been a strikingly good interpretor even in his earlier years.<br />His debut album for Decca was 'Romantic Arias' for tenor. That album contained mostly Italian (and a number of French) operatic arias, and he struck me as being better in the French stuff than the Italian.<br />Hence it is not without trepidation that I approached his recent solo release on Italian 'verismo' opera arias.<br />An instant relief was gained when I finished off the second track and approahced the third. Yes - the album is a consistently high-standard performance of some of the most dramatically intense operatic arias.<br />Kaufmann is never 'Italianate' in the same way as Corelli or del Monaco, nor Placido Domingo. However, he is nonetheless an exceptionally intelligent interpretor, and actually succeeds admirably in forming his own verismo style with a wonderful deployment of his unique timbre.<br />No - his is NOT the 'successor' of Placido Domingo, nor Jon Vickers, nor of any one, in fact. With his ravishingly expressive voice and wonderful characterisations, he IS a new phenomenon - the 'Kaufmann Phenomenon'.<br />Indeed, his performance in this album is nowhere short of being phenomenal. His former slight restrictions in Italian repertoire have become 'former' - one immediately senses a big step forward both in terms of vocal production and musical style. The arias from 'Andrea Chenier', 'Cavaliar Rusticana', 'Francesca di Rimini' and 'Adriana Lecouvreur' are familiar enough for the listeners to draw immediate comparisons with the past top interpretors. One would not need to hesitate, upon listening to Kaufmann, to warm up to the luscious singing and wonderful new interpretations.d wonderful new interpretations.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Robert de Nero in a dual role: one being his usual self as in his other movies, and the other becoming a Priest at The Mission in the jungles of South America. His conversion comes when he begins to side with jungle Natives in their struggles against colonialism by Europeans and church leaders. His self penance was to painfully lug, without help, all his heavy colonial war armor up the high steep side of a mountain over which dropped a wide jungle river. This verticle climb next to the waterfall was the only way to get to The Mission. He battles against the colonialists as he helps the Natives to defend The Mission and their jungle and their way of life. A movie that is a prelude to what is happening today to the Natives in the jungles and to their spiritual way of life.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Yeah, I know it's been over a decade since this was released...but it's still GREAT!  For those who thought the price was too high back in 1994, I have good news.  The price is now right!  A steal, really.      The level of musicianship displayed in this video is over-the-top.  But, that's what it took to create hit music back when the Eagles led the way.  More than a beat.  More than shock-type lyrics.  More than hype.    If you love music that's sophisticated, yet communicative...lyrics that are honest, emotional and relevant--even today...this is a musical experience you must have!  If you are amazed at vocal harmonies that are smooth and creamy, rich and powerful, this is a musical experience you owe yourself.  If you demand honest lyrics sung with power and passion, you've hit the mother-lode!    I'm not sure now many copies of this DVD are still in existence, but someday you'll wish you owned one of them.  I now do.

B000VBJEFK|3.0|Much has been written on Pixar's wonderful movie, Ratatouille.  I'll restrict my comments to the blu-ray.<br /><br />The picture, like all Pixar transfers, is pristine -- absolutely unbelievable.  The Uncompressed LPCM audio is also amazing.<br /><br />HOWEVER, you must dive into the menus in order to select the Uncompress LPCM audio track.  By default, you only get plain, old Dolby Digital.  Given that the main menu doesn't even offer access to the Audio Options, I would guess 90% of the people out there have never really heard the brilliant hi-fidelity soundtrack on this Blu-ray.  And that's a shame.  I understand the technical reasons for making Dolby Digital the default.  However, that decision, in combination with burying the audio options so far down is not cool.  Since hi-fi audio is such an important aspect in home theater, I dock this blu-ray two stars.
B000P5FH3K|1.0|Since I cannot figure out how to complain about an item, I'm contacting you this way.  The Rainmaker was inhcluded in an order of several other DVD's.  The first time it was used, it started stalling over and over again.  This has happened with other items you've sent me including John Grisham's courtroom slections, and The Sting.  These are just examples since there are others.      I am concerned about the quality of your DVD products, and it is questionable whether I would use Amazon again.
B00005JOA0|3.0|This was an acceptable movie production, accurate with regard to period and costume and manner, as so many BBC productions are -- but in many bothersome respects unfaithful to the original book.  Also, the movie simply failed to capture the profound and deeply personal insights and reflections that comprised so much of the book, so character- and relationship- development faltered.  Toby Stephens was excellent in the role of Gilbert Markham, but the other two main characters left something to be desired.  The villain Huntingdon, played by Rupert Graves, was neither handsome enough nor wicked enough to portray the tempting, devilish, malicious and utterly evil fiend described in the book.  Similarly, Tara Fitzgerald was neither beautiful enough, nor multi-facted enough to portray the complex female lead of Mrs. Graham, who must be reserved yet warm, controlled yet fierce, pious yet forgiving, pitiable yet strong, and ultimately someone we come to love.  The actress did not inspire that, nor did the script.  If you've never read the book but enjoy BBC productions, you'll probably enjoy this one just as well as any other.  However, I found it disappointing compared with the Anne Bronte novel.  The BBC production of Jane Eyre for Masterpiece Theatre (also starring Toby Stephens)was much more faithful to its book, and far superior in casting, writing, and direction.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|An absolute must-have for every Glee fan, of which I am not ashamed to admit being one. I especially liked the Jukebox extras so I could rewatch some of my favorite song performances.  The auditions were immensely entertaining,as well as the interviews with some of the actors. This collection was worth the wait. I would have liked to see interviews with Madonna and other icons who inspired some of the episodes to get their take on what the show has, or has not, done for their careers, as I understand Madonna's record sales took off again after the episode that featured her music and the wildly entertaining re-make of Vogue, featuring Sue Sylvester.
030745455X|2.0|But this book is really bad.  Really, really bad.<br /><br />What happens when you die before your book is finished?  The answer?  Your editor doesn't edit it for you the way Jane Austen's did, that's what.  To begin with - and I don't really expect a Swede to know this - hurricanes need warm water to form.  The whole freezing rain hurricane scene in the beginning of the book just doesn't work.  And, it just keeps on getting better ...<br /><br />What was enjoyable about the first book in this series is lost in this book.  There is no suspense, there is no drama, there's just a lot of bad writing and unbelievable scenes.  If you don't believe me, go ahead and read it.  If you'd like to save yourself some time, just rent the movie.
1400079144|5.0|It's funny how a lot of people complain about Dan Brown's book, yet they still read all of them. Anyway, in my opinion it was a very entertaining book. Suspense builds up real fast and doesn't let go. A very good follow up to DVC and A&D.
1419553429|3.0|I bought this book to supplement my core preparation materials, namely The Official Guide, some Manhattan books and the Kaplan Premier Program book. To give some relevant background, my initial diagnostic score was approx. 600, and my latest practice score is 750: Quantitative 77th percentile, Verbal 98th percentile. The 750 was an unexpected surprise, but since I wasn't happy with my Quant percentile I referred to Kaplan 800.     There are some good time-saving techniques in this book, but overall an advanced student won't find every page challenging or even useful. Most, if not all, of the \\"challenging\\" Quant questions are covered in the Official Guide. From my experience, you will face a greater depth and breadth of challenging questions by practicing the last third of the questions in the Official Guide, and most importantly reviewing your mistakes diligently. With a 77th Quant percentile in a practice test, I'm obviously not a genius in Math who would find most concepts super-simple; like most students, I'm someone who needed a lot of basic practice to get to where I am now. Given that similarity, I think most fellow test-takers won't benefit immensely from Kaplan 800.     However, it is possible that students will find the Verbal section useful. My verbal score was already at an advanced level before picking up this book, but I still found some of its techniques noteworthy. This book doesn't offer a large number of practice questions, rather it focuses on theory, which it then exemplifies through a couple of questions following each theoretical concept. The concepts, as I mentioned, can be useful, but as the book itself states they are not comprehensive. If you want comprehensive, go Manhattan.     Overall, my recommendation is to focus instead on the Official Guide, Manhattan books depending on the areas you need to focus on the most, and the main Kaplan book (especially the Kaplan practice tests). This set of materials was recommended to me by someone who got a 760, and I know others who've used the same; their scores were 740 and 710. Save your money and (more importantly?) your time instead of perusing this book. Good luck!

044654759X|3.0|Cannot understand why this book is getting so many good reviews. The beginning of the book was really good and could not put it down, but then it started to go downhill from there. The book really is like watching \\"Sleeping with the Emeny\\". My biggest complaint was how the ex-husband just keeps doing and saying the same things over and over. Its like reading the same paragraph a thousand times and also the ending was really like it was just tacked on with no connection to the book.
B001GH1ZQE|3.0|The unique quality of Winehouse's voice pulls me in to want to hear more. There are a few songs that you want to listen to again and again (like Back to Black), but like most albums there are other songs that should not have made the grade. But this does not stop me from wanting to put on the CD. The Dap Kings do a tremendous job of rounding out Winehouse's voice to its best advantage.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Since other people already said all the positives I can think of... I'll list a negative that hasn't been mentioned.    The US version comes with disc's in a cardboard sleeve.

Given the angle that these discs slide in and out they wear on the cardboard sleeve. I would recommend getting some cases for your discs unless you do not plan on watching these movies 3+ times a year.    Check your discs when you get them for scratches.

0312600844|3.0|Another title for Franzen's book might be:  Freedom Run Amuck    Franzen disses all Republicans and then gives Democrates a hard time for their liberal views:  The author very early writes all conservatives off as anti freedom.  Then he illustrates the dire consequences that happen to liberals who never say no, take all conservation ideas at face value and despise companies that make money.    The glaring question here seems to be:  Because you can, should you?    It is a question we all wish Hollywood would take to heart.  The movies they produce in the name of free speech are often grotesque.  Unfortunately, they have the money to spread them all around the world creating enemies for western democracy.  They portray America as a society that has truly run amuck.    Unfortunately, they are most likely to only make a movie of this book, not absorb any of its lessons.

0525951652|2.0|I looked forward to the first of this trilogy after loving pretty much everything Follett's ever done.  But this effort was sub-par and tedious.  I became quite anxious for the last page, realizing that there would be no payoff to the terrifically long book.  The characters are thin.  The Socialism is over-arching and tiresome as well as unbelievably uneven.  I won't read the next, and that' saying a lot, considering I heretofore considered myself a devoted follower.  He's really squandered his talent.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Somehow, Sylvester Stallone directed this epic fable around a group of outlaws who under his command will have to make the hazardous journey for an island ruled by the corrupt General Garza, who works in favor of a dark dealer.<br /><br />To my mind, this film constitutes not only a nostalgic gaze but also, a respectful homage respect three memorable films of the past: The wild bunch, The seven magnificent and Dirty dozen.<br /><br />Of course the film has heavy weight chases, spectacular sequences, unstoppable action and graphic violence, filmed in documental style. The nervous camera accents still more the dynamic pulse and unstoppable adrenaline.<br /><br />On the other hand, the music from the seventies (Mountain's Mississippi Queen, and Credence Clearwater Revival) hovers the film like an invisible curtain in order to link the entire filmic corpus.<br /><br />Nevertheless the film retains and keeps a close resemblance with Once upon a time in Mexico, where the elemental script works out with the required volatility according with the rules of game. Particularly effective is the encounter in the church where Sylvester, Bruce and Arnold shake hands.<br /><br />The smart idea to join part of the screen's heroes of the eighties was perhaps the most remarkable hook, although we miss three names: Jean Claude van Damme, Chuck Norris and Jean Reno.<br /><br />An entertained experience that encloses a watchable film.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I've been a Final Fantasy fan for quite a while now and FFVII has been the best by my opinion so far.  The storyline is based on life and captures the essence of living, death, and how to cherish what you have in life exceptionally well.  The animation of the Square Enix team is fantastic and never seizes to amaze.  Also, the movie lines up with the game perfectly, capturing each individual character dead accurately,  5 stars for this movie.  And 5 stars to the packaging and shipping also!

His characters are absorbing and as the book progresses they become so real that the reader feels their thoughts and lifestyles a true reality.    The era he has written about has been neglected for so many years, that readers of younger generations could be educated with this novel.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|BURIED<br /><br />STARRING: Ryan Reynolds<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Chris Sparling<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Rodrigo Cortes<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Thriller<br />Release Date: 24 September 2010<br />Review Date: 25 October 2010<br /><br />VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE FILM TAKES PLACE INSIDE A COFFIN! There - this is vital information to know upfront when deciding if you want to spend the seven bucks, and the 94 minutes to see Buried.<br /><br />This information came to my girlfriend and me via my mother over the phone, as we were literally in the car on our way to the theater, when she asked what our evening plans entailed. While this was neither what we were expecting, nor what we were in the mood for - Ryan Reynolds was the sole reason that kept our car heading toward the theater. \\"Ryan has never let me down, Mom.\\" - I explained, praying that history wasn't about to be made. It wasn't.<br /><br />Buried is obviously not a movie for everyone, and I would never have guessed it would be one for me, let alone one of the best films of the year. How could it be? What could possibly happen to a guy in a coffin over the course of 94 minutes that would generate a riveting and flawless film?<br /><br />Well, of course I can't explain that to you. I'll offer you a few minor details, but aside from those and the mention of an Oscar worthy performance from Ryan Reynolds, you'll have to find the rest out for yourself.<br /><br />Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, an independent contractor. We meet him in complete darkness, and after several exasperated shrieks of terror, we get a flicker from his zip lighter and see: Ryan Reynolds, locked in a slightly over-sized coffin. With him, he has a cell phone and a few other items that will also go unmentioned. Paul uses the cell phone to find out why he is in there, to communicate with his loved ones, his captors, people who may be able to help, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />It's wickedly entertaining seeing Paul communicate with people, who spoon-feed us tiny clues about who he is and why this is happening to him, and what will likely become of him. From start to finish, we are with him every step of the way, in real time. We never cut to the FBI or to his wife or his captors. This holds us in a miserable state of claustrophobic suspense, with the character. Oh, and I will tell you, that a critter makes its way into Paul's coffin at one point.<br /><br />The shattering ending blew me away and the film is cleverly written and directed. It has a bunch of well timed comedic elements to it as well, and Reynolds is as brilliant and hilarious as ever. If I had to spend 94 minutes in a cinematic coffin, I can't think of a better actor I'd want to be stuck with.g to him, and what will likely become of him.

1904633021|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness.

Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash.

1904633293|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was &#34;Mansfield Park&#34; -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with &#34;Mansfield Park&#34; is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris &#34;consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him&#34;), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />&#34;Mansfield Park&#34; suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.Norris &#34;consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him&#34;), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B0041X90ZS|5.0|This 2DVD/3CD set is awesome! The DVD picture, filming, overall quality, and audio are stunning. The setting is fantastic and the set list: Unbelievable... So much value for the money here! 3 CDs of the entire DVD set, 2 DVDs- one of the show and one of the encore, plus almost 3 hours of bonus footage (interviews, documentary, High Voltage festival), plus 2 booklets of photos and writings. Wow! Did I mention the concert is 3 and a half hours long (including encore)?!?!    The packaging is nicely designed with the Whirlwind motif. The Digipaks in the slipcase are a misstep. Mine came with the cd holders upside down ( or is it the printing?)and one of the center locks broken. Anyways, the discs are almost impossible to get out of the holders, so difficult that I thought I might break a disc before I even got to watch or listen to it.    Aside from this, all love here!
B002BZOVLG|5.0|... probably the best opera blu-ray I own. Great cast, great production - and an orchestra to match. Ivan Fischer is an exciting Mozart conductor.  From the first bars of the overture, you know you are in for a treat.  The music is played with energy and enthusiasm.  The two finales truly shake the house.  Fischer and Hytner also have a few interesting things to say about the opera in the bonus interviews.  The ending is ambiguous - as Hytner claims, every audience has to decide itself whether all's well or not by the end.    Not much more to add. It's a treasure.
B003TML0VO|1.0|I dislike this work because;<br /><br />1) What makes many of these songs great, besides the obvious iconic melodies (for most of the songs), is their organic, primal nature. These songs epitomized the power of the raw power chords, blistering distortion, and smoking tone. This work has reduced these songs to being overproduced, all very similar sounding and with vocalists,  rather than reworking or re-interpreting the songs, just appearing to be bland, inferior imitaions to the originals.<br /><br />2) The idea of a legendary guitarist, who has such a distinguishable voicing with his instrument, shedding what makes him great in order to imitate other guitarists is ridiculous. He has his own style, which is great, but when it comes to playing Page, Blackmore, Clapton, Harrison, Van Halen, Hendrix, Beck, ...his style does those styles a diservice (Personally, I believe that Santana is not even close to being in the same league as those others).<br /><br />I understand that a professional musician is entitled to make money but Santana is too respected of an artist to be involved with this. If he wanted to do a covers work, he should have explored different types of works and music ( ie. pay homage to what he grew up on, garage bands, world music etc).<br /><br />With due respect to anybody that reads this, this can only appeal to a very casual, American Idol type music fan who lacks familiarity with music history and the iconic importance of these songs.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Told in documentary style, Katie and Micah are a young couple living together for the first time. Katie has kept a secret from Micah--that since the age of eight, she has been followed by a malevolent entity, an entity that their psychic [Mark Friedrichs] believes to be demon, rather than the much less dangerous form of haunting, that by a ghost. He warns them not to do anything to anger or confront the demon, but Micah is convinced he can take care of Katie and keep his home safe without outside help. As events escalate, it becomes clear that they are out of their depth, but their options are dwindling quickly. The demon wants Katie, is jealous of Micah, and neither will leave intact. A truly creepy movie that uses the mockumentary style of filmmaking very effectively to play on our fears of losing control of our lives to something unfathomable and infintely more ruthless and cunning.<br /><br />Note: Do not confuse this movie with \\"Paranormal Entity,\\" another mockumentary with much the same premise that came out two years later. It is not nearly as good as this one.

B0001I561E|1.0|After ordering two dvd's through this seller I recieved two dvd's both of which were very clearly bootlegged.  I know the tell tale signs of bootlegs personally but after showing them to several people they all came to the same conclusion.  With the pixelated images on the dvd, the cheap case, and the sticker stuck onto the dvd's themselves it's kind of hard not to see that.  Upon requesting a refund I was told that I could only exchange my bootleg for another copy of the same bootleg.    WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER
B003XRDYX2|5.0|The mono recordings: If you're a Dylan fan, these mono recordings are essential, absolutely.  Dylan's early \\"solo\\" albums always sounded pretty awkward in stereo, the only available format when i was \\"coming up\\" ten years removed from the 1960's Dylan.  Not until i started finding mono records in used bins did i really begin to appreciate early Dylan.  Jazz and rock mono recordings from the 50s and the 60s have a wholly different sound and present a wholly different aural vision, so to speak, than stereo.  The best examples i can think of to illustrate this point are mono editions of Coleman's \\"Shape of Jazz To Come\\" in which, without stereo separation, you can really get a sense of the sonic sculptures Coleman was creating with his music, or Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears\\", Jefferson Airplane's \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", \\"Paperback Writer\\", and the Stones' early singles and the mono edition of \\"Let It Bleed\\", in each of which the music is, compared to their stereo counterparts, much more forcefully propelled from the speakers because of the monolithic assault perpetrated by the unseparated sound: cutting guitars, booming basses, thundering drums all competing against each other to be heard, and the listener often gets an image of almost violent pushing and shoving to be heard bordering on chaos, but--in the hands of capable engineers--so properly balanced that something greater than the sum of its parts erupts and cascades from the speakers.  And if that ain't rock and roll, what the hell is?!?  Same goes for Dylan's \\"rock\\" albums.  Most simply stated, as Greil Marcus points out in the booklet accompanying the discs, they were recorded to be heard in mono.     Sound quality: Wonderful!  The remastering of the discs never disappoints; Dylan's recordings were generally well produced and mastered in the first place.  The early \\"solo\\" recordings can only be properly heard in mono.  Dylan's rock albums have much more force in mono than in stereo.  Pay attention to \\"Desolation Row\\"and hear the depth, the warmth, and the clarity of guitars, bass, and Dylan's voice.  You can hear the wood of the guitar in the resonance of the lead runs!  And the force of the music is perhaps unique to mono--stereo separation allows too much space, and encourages the sounds of the instruments to spread out and relax.  Not that that's a bad quality by any means, just one the absence of which demands the music to shape itself otherwise, and on these discs that shape is the sound of a freight train.  The beauty and subtlety of the songs on \\"John Wesley Harding\\" absolutely need monophonic reproduction to have the quality of \\"plot unity\\" so essential to great literature and--in this instance--great music.  There is a handful of albums i cannot listen to in stereo since discovering the mono versions: \\"John Wesley Harding\\" is one of them.  (\\"Shape of Jazz\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" are some others, to give an example of the esteem i think \\"John Wesley Harding\\" deserves!)    The sleeves: So many people are commenting on the various permutations of sleeves; here's what's in my box set: \\"Bob Dylan\\" has repro Columbia ad sleeve, \\"Freewheelin'\\" has repro generic Columbia sleeve, \\"The Times\\" has white sleeve and insert with \\"poetry\\", \\"Hwy 61\\" has white sleeve and insert with sketch of Dylan, all other discs have white sleeves and no inserts.  The quality of the reproduction of the jackets is absolutely superlative!      Yup, this box set is worth every penny.  Dylan must be pleased to know that HIS box set beats the hell out of Lennon's!  Now what we need is a Rolling Stones mono box set.
0743550927|5.0|This book is so compelling and so excellently read that you are sad when it is over. It is read by the author and he truly transports you to a different time.  No other audio books even come close to how wonderful this one is. McCourt is mischievous, lively, wicked, kind and human.
B003Y8YXH6|2.0|the \\"stripped down\\" versions definitely benefit from the removal of lots of schlock and kitsch originally overdubbed, and the remastering is beautiful: john's voice is wonderful; instruments clear and sharp; the air around all of it audible.  but i really expected to hear these songs differently than i ever had before, and i don't.  they do indeed sound like \\"stripped down\\" versions that are anticipating the overdubs and production value eventually imposed on them.  they don't sound complete.  they sound like something's missing, even if they benefit from what's missing.      there's a real and clear difference between demo sessions for and outtakes from, say, \\"walls and bridges\\" and those represented on this disc: demos and outtakes convey a sort of coherency and completeness, while the \\"stripped down\\" \\"dbl fantasy\\" songs convey tentativeness.  compare, for instance, the demo of \\"i'm losing you\\" on the lennon anthology box set and the version on \\"dbl fantasy stripped\\", for a clearer sense of what i'm trying to describe: the former sounds like a real and complete song in its own right; the latter, a recording anticipating and awaiting overdubs and production value.  the songs on this \\"stripped down\\" version aren't really songs that can or were meant to exist in their own right in any regard: they were laid down as the basis for the ensuing layers of sonic treatment.    the real flaws of \\"double fantasy\\" cannot be remedied by any sort of remastering, remixing, or any other sort of \\"jiggery pokery\\": whatever kind of songwriter/singer yoko was/wasn't, she was no match for lennon, and really had no business sharing vinyl with him--even ever indulgent mccartney knew to relegate his wife to a subordinate role in the recording studio.    the artwork is unworthy of a john lennon album: the quality of the drawings would earn a high school art class student a \\"B\\".  yeah, sure, fine, sean did it.  so what?  john lennon needn't be turned into some sort of cottage industry.    the box set was a disappointment, and i sort of feel sort of swindled by this final (as of yet) contribution to lennon's musical legacy.
B003IY48PS|2.0|I am going to be very nit-picky but it needs to be pointed out.<br /><br />First, go get your old Elite DVD or, better yet, your old Thorn/EMI VHS tape and watch it up to the point where Scott, Ash and the girls begin to drive over the bridge. Now, look toward the right of the screen (between the bridge's guard rails) and you will see one of the film's crew members standing there in a big puffy coat.<br /><br />Now, plug in your Blu-ray and watch that same scene. Through the magic of computer wizardry, Sam Raimi pulls a George Lucas and magically removes this endearing film flub.<br /><br />C'mon, Sam! Seriously? For the past thirty years horror fans have rejoiced in seeing that poor slob accidently immortalized in your film AND NOW you decide to take him out??? First George Lucas, then Steven Spielberg and now we add Sam Raimi to the cinema revisionist club?<br /><br />Oh, these are dark days we live in.
030745455X|1.0|I read the first book and thought it was so so. My mother convinced me to try this one and it was horrible. First (and most important) it is unbelievably boring. The first half consists mostly of drinking coffee and shopping lists. The second half is not much better. It is also full of cliches. He also tries to show us all the time what a cool liberal feminist he is all the time which is ironic since the whole book is built around sick revenge, violence and exploitation of women. Avoid at all costs.

0316077054|5.0|Beautiful Creatures was one of my favorite books read last year, so it's no surprise Beautiful Darkness was one of my most anticipated books this year.  Beautiful Darkness was filled with much more mystery and many, many, surprising twists. I actually ended up loving it more than Beautiful Creatures.    It didn't take long to dive back into the Gothic Southern atmosphere  of Gatlin and all the characters I loved from the first book.  Some new characters were brought in which usually I don't like, but Olivia (Liv) was really likable and I was sort of rooting for her a bit after Lena completely closed herself off. There was also a John Breed who was a huge mystery from the beginning. There was very little Lena in this book, but I really didn't like her whole depressing emo-ness. It was understandable why she was like that, but seriously some communication would of helped... There was even more Link in this book, who is my favorite of all the characters, he brought plenty comic relief into the story. Ridley also had plenty more in the story and I actually felt bad for her by the end and I'm surprised her teeth aren't yet filled with cavities from all that lollipop sucking she does. Of course, there was Ethan who didn't really seem all that different to me.    The ending was such a huge cliffhanger, but on the bright side I'm positive there will be plenty more Link in the next book.I really don't want to give away anything from the story. I'll just leave it with, I love this series. It has mystery, romance, action, suspense. It's just perfect! The only downside is that  now I'm going to be waiting in anticipation for the next book in the series.
1595825045|5.0|I became a fan of the show fairly recently, and one of the great things about it was the artwork - character design, animation, and settings that seem right out of a high-budget movie. I really did want to get a good look at how the designs developed, how the show was conceived, and overall just look at some colorful artwork.    There's also some commentary from the show's creators, who explain how they started working for Nick and how they pitched the idea. There's more about how they coordinated the on-screen action and how the interaction with their overseas animation studios shaped the show.    It's a great book if you're interested in cartooning or world-building. Check it out.
B000E5KJFM|4.0|Enjoyed the movie but this (brand new) HD-DVD shows disc reading error midway at 2 to 3 scenes and stops playing. Had to restart & skip pass the error point (slightly ahead) to continue watching. Doesn't happen with any other HD-DVD's in collection except for \\"Unforgiven\\" where it happens many more times - stopping and restarting rendering it unwatchable and had to be exchanged with another new one which exhibited the problem much less often and was able to watch it through! Just mentioning this so buyers should be aware of this possibility and that the problem may not be with their HD-DVD players - our's were updated with most recent firmware as well!
B003FSTN6Q|2.0|Unlike a lot of people here I am not a fan of this series.  I have seen all of them now and really the content is not bad at all.  The Lead Actress Hewitt, I do have issues with.  She can act.  I will give her this credit.  She has issues with dress and character situations.  This whole series is based on a young, \\"gifted\\" woman with paranormal abilities.  Her platform for the series is a small town, simple life of a paranormal person yet her dress reflects bizarre personality which minimizes the premise of the series.  The personality of the actress is NOT in symmetry with the plot of the series.  Not to mention this series is NOT intented for young viewers however they will see them from time to time and quite frankly Hewitt's dress d/o can be unwise for children to be viewing.  We worry about guns, cigarettes and violence in hollywood however neglecting the influence of someone such as Hewitt and how she appears to the audience and how this could influence the society at large.  Do we really NEED this kind of influence?

1400052173|5.0|I read this book after an extended period of reading only fiction and it reminded me why I love nonfiction so much.  Written in the best narrative style, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an amazing and compelling true-life story.  Not only does Rebecca Skloot provide readers with a basic understanding of the history and importance of cell culture to medical research over the past 50 years, but she relays with great compassion the story of the Lacks family.  As other reviewers have said, I was blown away with the level of commitment that Skloot demonstrated in researching and writing this wonderful book.  Highly recommended!

0316098337|5.0|Jack is five years old and all the world he's ever known is Room. He and Ma live there, with Rug and Wardrobe, and Bed, occasionally catching glimpses of the 'planets' Outside in the world on their TV set. Jack also smells the Outside world when Old Nick presses the buttons to open the door at night to visit Ma while Jack is safely hidden away in Wardrobe, counting the squeaks of the Bed until Old Nick leaves again.     Told entirely through the voice of Jack, Room is ingenious. We know what's going on when Ma goes blank some days and can't be talked to, why she's so protective of her son from Old Nick - we understand the screaming game the two play during the day, aiming their voices at the skylight in the ceiling. Jack is confused, but we are not, when Ma wakes him in the night with her turning on and off the Lamp light, over and over. We also know that Ma's concern is coming to a point of desperation as she sees Jack growing larger, and knows the 11 by 11 Room cannot contain them both much longer.      Jack is persuaded to be 'scave' - scared and brave - and follows Ma's instructions in a one-chance-only escape. The two are rescued in a tension filled chapter, and Jack is dumfounded to finally see that the world is REAL, not just planets on the television, but filled with enormous light and noise and people. As the two recover in the hospital, Jack's confusion and behaviors convey his strangeness to others in heartbreaking details. He rebels against shoes, he crawls down stairs like a toddler, he astounds others with his vocabulary and reading skills but cannot understand why he shouldn't continue to nurse at Ma's breast.     Ma's adjustment is also difficult - we see through Jack's eyes how she adapts to her family again, the joy and the pain, and even the desperation she feels when Jack's Outside experiences are things she could not have prepared him for. This is a riveting book, heartbreaking and yet not without hope for Jack and his Ma.

0307593525|5.0|This is the most amazing set of cookbooks ever written. Not only does Julia Child give step by step instructions, she also gives the \\"how to fix it\\" if the recipe does not work out the first time. She warns you before you begin, so if there is a problem, you are already warned about what to look for and how to correct it. Never in all my cooking experience, about 50 years now, have I been given such detailed information. Julia Child wanted us to really get it right and enjoy ourselves in the kitchen. We owe her so much. I also read her book, \\"My Years in France\\" and realized how intelligent this woman was to adapt French recipes to the U.S. market, even changing ingredients and measurements to obtain the same effect, thus giving us her \\"no fail\\" recipes. I just may never turn to another cookbook. This one is definitive.

1400064287|5.0|There is no need to say that this is a sticky book. It is an easy, interesting, and relevant to read.   The authors propose that for any idea to survive, it must be sticky = Understandable, memorable, and effective in changing thought or behavior. For it to be sticky, it must meet the SUCCESs criteria. An Idea must be Simple, it should use the Unexpected as a means to generate attention. It should be Concrete and Credible. Finally, it should get in touch with our Emotional side and have some Stories to back it up.   One of the strongest points of this book it that it is written following its own preach. It is clearly written and backed up with examples that help to illustrate its arguments. In addition the arguments are carried out in an organized and reinforcing manner across the book. Along the book you will see it that the authors reverse-engineered ideas, brilliant ideas such as the \\"ulcers are caused by bacteria\\" as well as preposterous ones  such as the \\"kidney thieves and their ice-filled bathtub \\". Moreover on the book you will also see interesting ideas made boring or common boring ideas made interesting like the \\"flight-safety announcement\\". All of them are examined on the context of the SUCCES criteria.        But finally and more importantly the writers focused on the relevancy and practicality of the book. You will find that the book provides practical advice on how to implement its message and use it for your advantage.   One of the messages that I found most useful was the Curse of Knowledge one. When communicating information to the general public the originator has an insider's knowledge that allows him to see and talk in abstract terms such as plain indicators that may mean little to his audience. Want an illustration, tap the rhythm of a sing and have a friend to guess the name of the song.
1430300612|4.0|In \\"My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey,\\" Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor describes her experiences as a stroke survivor. After suffering a massive hemorrhage on the left side of her brain, Dr. Taylor provides a step-by-step account of the morning of her stroke. She describes the mental and physical deficits she experienced during the stroke, in addition to the mental and physical processes that remained intact. This book provides a fascinating glimpse into the physiological and psychological processes that were affected by this type of stroke, recounted by a neuroanatomist that remained conscious throughout the entire ordeal. Priceless!     Considering that my grandfather had a massive stroke that left him completely paralyzed on the left side of his body, this book really resonated with me. I wish I would have read this book two years ago when he first had the stroke (especially the section on the things Dr. Taylor needed the most after her stroke). Nevertheless, I would have preferred for Dr. Taylor to provide a more detailed account of her recovery after the neurosurgery, similar to the way she described the stroke itself, her initial time in the hospital, and the two weeks preceding the surgery. Instead, she seemed to skim over her recovery after the brain surgery and focused more on her \\"spiritual recovery\\".     Additionally, a cautionary note: Dr. Taylor states several times throughout the book that she had a \\"complete\\" recovery after her stroke. I find this claim to be potentially misleading because it is almost impossible to completely recover and return to pre-stroke/brain injury functioning after suffering any type of head injury. Statements like this may create false hope in readers whose lives have been recently affected by stroke/brain injury. Additionally, although Dr. Taylor states that she had a complete recovery, she also remarks that the brain injury changed her for the better (and, thus, she didn't actually return to her pre-stroke functioning).     Overall, a great read. Very inspirational!

0312600844|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Jonathon Franzen. His knowledge of topics from global population to billiard playing entwined in the contemporary American family was overwhelming to me and sometimes painful through his realistic, clear writing. Franzen is definitely an author to read to learn something.
B00192IV0O|1.0|This product, The End, by the Black Eyed Peas, came in brand new packaging, but upon inserting it into my cd player, I discovered that none of it played properly.  That is, there was a rhythmic sound coming from the cd that was not the Black Eyed Peas.  It was like a damaged cd.  It was just a sound distortion.  So, my money was totally wasted.  It sure didn't matter whether I had gotten \\"free shipping\\" or not.  I would have been better off with a used cd.

1400079144|2.0|Let's make this clear, I can't write books! I have read all Dan Brown's books now and I have found them all of a diffrent level. This last one was his lowest. The pressure must have been inmense after the davinci code. Maybe it's a good idea to let the Robert Langdon character go because I feel the character has had his best day.  The storyline is weak allthough it has some good turns. The research again is incredible...but the word....weak.  Anyway don't let me stop you from buying this book, just don't expect too much as angels and demons or the davinci code
0374290024|5.0|History is a fascinating subject, if it is told in the right way. To me, the right way means--instead of rotely reciting the facts or twisting them to fit into a narrow thesis--tapping into the big trend, showing the big picture, making connections between seemingly unrelated events and giving objective insights into the multifaceted dynamics of large groups of people interacting with one another. While there have been some great titles available to 21st century readers, none comes close to being as grand, broad, deep and innovative as this book.    The question of why the West rules the world for the past two centuries has always been an intriguing one, at least to people of Chinese descent. In recent years, it has taken on significantly greater urgency and relevance to mainstream Americans. But the various answers to date have been narrow, incomplete analysis like those given by the blind men who tried to describe an elephant. To reach a comprehensive understanding, Ian Morris has had to combine multiple disciplines, including physics, botany, economics, anthropology, paleontology, archaeology and history, and invent his own index of \\"Cultural Development\\". Just this metric is a great contribution to mankind's knowledge base, as it finally gives a concrete, quantitative measure to the general concepts of advanced versus backward and rise versus decline.     To convince the readers of his conclusion, the author retells the entire history of mankind, from ape-men to the year 2010. I am totally amazed by his ability to do so in 645 fun-filled pages and still to cover practically every relevant detail. Even more impressively, he often sheds new light on these familiar facts for me so that I finally can see the history in the right context. For example, who are the Hittites? What is their relevance? Well, not until I read this book did I understand that they represent the infusion into the core of western civilization (Mesopotamia/Egypt) a new weapon (chariot) driven by a new large domesticated mammal (horse) that is the only major natural resource missing in the blessed region militarily, agriculturally and economically since the dawn of history.    What is the author's conclusion after going through the entire human history with his new fine-tooth comb, the index of cultural development? He finds that, although individuals vary from one another greatly, large groups of people are often very much alike. He shows convincingly that this is definitely the case between the west (Europeans and Americans) and the east (Chinese, Japanese and Koreans). Differences exist in styles but not in substance. Whatever causes one to lead the other in cultural development is always exogenous, mainly climatic and geographical factors. He also illustrates clearly that each level of development brings about new challenges, which can be overcome only with the right organization using the right technology under the right circumstances. Those who fail at these challenges either stagnate or sink into dark ages, allowing the \\"advantage of backwardness\\" to be realized.    Extrapolating from recent trends, the author thinks that the east will most likely catch up with the west by the end of this century. This, in itself, is not too surprising, but the stories that leads to this conclusion are full of parallels and lessons for modern societies facing problems originating from their own development process. Anyone who cares about the fate of his nation and/or this earth will surely benefit from this book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|In my bag: Canon 60D, 5 Lenses, shutter release remote, lens cleaning kit, table tripod, filters. This thing is pretty full but it fits all my stuff very nicely, i have room for one more lens if I keep one on the camera body when it's in there. The bag is great, feels really solid, and has tons of space to rearrange for your gear. Love the straps on the side that hold my monopod as well!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|It is a very best series. The price also reasonable as I can also download into my portable device so that I can watch it whenever I want because it also gave me a digital and DVD version. But I hope more action coming from Iron Man 3.

B0040ZA2D6|5.0|This is a great album for kid viewers of the TV show, but not all of the show's songs are on it!  At least four tunes that have been heard on the series aren't here, such as \\"Famous.\\" Why would they release a CD but not include all the songs that people have heard on the show? The only guess is that there must be another CD in the works or they're trying to make more money by selling those as singles. So what's here is good--but it's disappointing that kids that want to hear their favorite Big Time Rush songs won't find them all here!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I have received 50$ voucher as a gift and because I'm from Poland I wanted to have something with small shipment costs. Since my wife loves Glee I picked this product and she loved it, as well I as did. Great first season with some extras. If you are Glee fan, you must have it. If you haven't heard about it, you should consider this - nice collection of 7 DVDs with every episode of first season. And nice extras.  The only downside of this product is that there are no subtitles in extras section of the materials, which would be very appreciated (especially English ones, because those are not only for people having problem with hearing, but also for international people, when their language, like Polish, is not present).

B003QCCS36|5.0|I caught on to Ray Lamontagne after Trouble and Till the Sun Turns Black had been released. I bought Trouble first and instantly fell in love with it. I was eager to get Till the Sun Turns Black and then Gossip in the Grain when it came out. I like both albums, but felt that they were a bit of a disappointment after Trouble. Well, God Willin' & and The Creek Don't Rise is easily his best since Trouble. I think I may even like it better than Trouble. Songs like \\"Beg Steal of Borrow,\\" \\"Old Before Your Time,\\" and \\"Devil's In the Jukebox\\" get back to the raw acoustic energy you got in songs on Trouble like the title track and \\"Forever My Friend.\\" But these songs have a new, decidedly country influence, with a big dose of slide guitar. But for those that liked the slow, dreamy songs on his two previous albums, songs like \\"New York City's Killing Me\\" and \\"Like Rock & Roll on the Radio\\" won't disappoint. Also, \\"Repo Man\\" is another song from an altogether earlier decade, similar to Gossip in the Grain's \\"You Are the Best Thing.\\"     It's an album that simply doesn't disappoint. Somehow I think it manages to be his best album by always surprising. His last two albums got a little too sleepy and predictable at times. This album has tons of energy and soul.

0316010669|4.0|The Book Review: Blink                       Vincent            This book is about those first two seconds. Two seconds does not necessarily mean you have to decide things just in two seconds, it means you have to choose from all the alternatives and make your decision in a short time. The author (Gladwell) expresses the idea that our brain uses two different ways to sense the current situation. The first one is, many of us are familiar with, the conscious strategy. And the second one is the adaptive unconscious. From this book, Gladwell wants to tell us some good points: Sometimes, we should convince ourselves that the adaptive unconscious is way too better than the traditional conscious strategy. Also, we need to know when to use the conscious strategy and when to use the other one. If a person uses the wrong strategy under an unsuitable situation, the outcome may turn out badly. What is more, the snap judgment and first impressions can be trained and controlled (most important point).    In my opinion, what makes Gladwell's books so well-known is that he uses many examples in daily life in order to inform his audiences about his notions. Fortunately, I have met some examples in my life, which related to his ideas.   1 In Gladwell's Nissan case, the dealer is doing a really awesome job because he has two characteristics: He uses the customer-centric method and treats every customer equally. He doesn't judge people by their appearances (fight the Warren Harding error). When I was in China one year ago, I saw a man wearing shabby clothes went into a BWM store. It seemed that he was poor and could not afford even the cheapest BMW in that shop. When he laid his fingers on a BMW X5, one salesman forbade him to do so and said some unrespectable words to him. However, a female saleswoman came out and treat this man like a potential buyer. She gave the man a cup of coffee and introduced all the detailed information about that BWM with smile on her face. The man thought for a while, and then he made a call. After ten minutes, his son came in with two huge briefcases. When his son opened these two briefcases, what were inside made me surprised: they were about three million cash (RMB). His father bought two BMW X5 by cash and this activity made the female saleswoman gain a lot of commission. From this case, I get to know that \\"Warren Harding error\\" is common and it is especially harmful for a salesman/saleswoman.    2 Around two years ago, the luxury brand - Louis Vuitton wanted to open a shop in Nanjing (my hometown city). However, the marketing people in Louis Vuitton were not sure about whether citizens in Nanjing could afford this expensive bag. One top manager, who was in charge of affairs in China, arrived in Nanjing. He didn't bring with him a professional team and order them to do analyses that would last several months like many other managers. He just stood near Xin Jiekou (a famous business circle in Nanjing), felt the surroundings, and counted the amount of luxury cars like BMW, Benz, Lexus, and so on. He finished counting after several minutes. After five months, Louis Vuitton opened its Nanjing store. You know what? The first year's revenue of this store was about 100,000,000 RMB and it meant this store sold nearly 30 bags in each day (this is amazing in China). In my opinion, this was a \\"blink\\" method although it took several minutes. The manager used his initial feelings about Nanjing and made a successful decision.    After reading this book, I will consider the incoming problems from a different angle. I always hear the saying \\"haste makes waste\\" and think it is true. However, I will use the \\"blink\\" method to solve some problems when circumstances permit in future.
0525951652|2.0|*Warning* MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!    Like many who have given this book a poor review I was very excited at the prospect of Ken Follett making a trilogy of the 20th century. However, some 400 pages in this book has fallen flat. Unlike KF's past books, from his thrillers to \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World \\", which were charecter driven, this book seemed to exist for KF to give himself the opportunity to share his liberal, socialist attitudes at every turn. The Peer is of course a clueless, entitled jerk, his wife a 20th century Marie Antionette archetype, and his sister, the suffragette and women's rights activist, would have worn out her welcome in early 20th century England long before this book starts. The German has world views I would deem impossible for the son of an early 20th century Prussian aristocrat. His cousin, for example, a minor Austrian charecter, is gay, which the German charecter accepts without the bat of an eyelash. Sorry KF, but there was no Rainbow Coalition back then. Then there is the uneducated Welsh miners kids who are, of course, the smaretst people in whatever room they happen to be in. Of the Russian brothers, one is as tiresome in his simpering lack of backbone as Hamlet, and the other is just plain loathsome. The actions of the charecters are improbable, and the coincidences difficult to swallow. For example, the German charecter starts out as Ludendorf's aide-de-camp at Tannenberg, but 5 months later is inexplicably on the Western Front in time for the Christmas Truce. This is where, of course, he stumbles upon his freind the Peer, who has gone from French Liason to skulking about in the trenches, all in the course of the same 5 months. I wanted to scream!! This is where I couldn't take this book anymore and stopped reading it.    I love Ken Follet's books and it pains me to have to give this one a poor review. But I'm afraid he trotted out a clunker this time.
B003VIW8DK|3.0|It's amazing how much Bryan Ferry borrows from other sources -mainly his own- on this record. The opening strains of \\"You Can Dance\\", the album's first song, are appropriated directly from \\"True to Life\\" the last track on Roxy Music's 1982 album \\"Avalon\\". On \\"Me Oh My\\" Ferry borrows from his own lyrical and vocal stylization catalogue, directly nipping pieces of \\"Chain Reaction\\" from 1995's \\"Mamouna\\" (\\"...in and out of time...\\"). This is not to say any of this borrowing is bad in any way, it just makes you wonder if Mr. Ferry has run out of ideas now that he's in his 60's.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a strong album, and it's full of traditional Roxy/Ferryisms, right down to the guest players, which include Brian Eno, Phil Manzanera, Andy Newmark, David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) and Nile Rogers. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a mostly original album from Ferry, and that's a good thing. The obsessive Ferry has been spinning his wheels on cover-heavy albums since \\"Mamouna\\", so to hear an almost all-original album from him is refreshing and overdue. Even the covers are well chosen, especially \\"Song To The Siren\\".<br /><br />The first four tracks are the best on the album (including \\"Alphaville\\" and \\"Heartache By Numbers\\") and set the bar much higher than the original tracks on 2002's \\"Frantic\\", which only featured four original Ferry tracks.<br /><br />All in all a good effort. - db

6305090564|2.0|When you thought it was safe to check out horror/sci-fi films from the 90s boy were you wrong. The 90s was probably the worse era for horror and sci-fi films easily. A lot of those kind of movies from that era lack creativity and originality in a big way. This movie really has nothing to offer rather than a big caboom a very digitalized and cheesy looking monster; and a boring cast. Hard to believe there is an actor in this movie that made an appearence in last of the mohegans.
0060512806|5.0|One of the best sci fi novels of all time! Thanks for suggesting it Tom!
0061433047|5.0|Wow.  That's all I can say.  Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching novels have been the best of the bunch so far, and this is the best of them yet!  It has some of his patented absurdity (esp in the form of little blue men wearing kilts!), but also with real meaning, and characters of real depth.  Right up there with the Fifth Elephant as my favorite Discworld novel.<br /><br />I hope his health continues, because I would love to see more from him!  If this unfortunately turns out to be his last book, it's one he can be very proud of.

B001I5M9SC|4.0|We bought our first 5.1 home theater a couple of weeks ago. At same time, we started collecting blu-ray discs and \\"Andrea Bocelli: Vivere - Live in Tuscany [Blu-ray]\\" is highly recommended in quite many sites. So I grabbed one yesterday and truly enjoyed it with my wife. We're not Andrea Bocelli fans but the music here is just heavenly. Audio is excellent especially that our subwoofer gets to do some bit of exercise. As for video, it would have been excellent too if not for that badly-focused center camera used during the concert. Blur is simply too obvious in a 32-inch LCD TV. Overall, 4 out of 5 and still money well spent! Highly recommended!
B002ZG9788|4.0|When I saw preview for Clash of the Titans in theaters I could not wait to see it...  ended up not seeing it in theaters and actually didnt end up seeing it until 2 days ago... i definitely was not disappointed witht the movie... a lot of action, great special effects, o.k. acting, and a good general story (maybe i thought the story was good because i could fill in the gaps with knowledge of the previous clash of the titans/greek mythology)...  The blu-ray also looked AMAZING on my 42\\" 1080p LCD TV... a very good example of what HD can do... overall it is at least worth a rental... ill probably end up buying it... pretty decent movie!
B003WTE886|4.0|I have loves Taylor Swift's lyrics from her first album. She captures the essence of her age - when she was young, her songs reflect that \\"teenage experience.\\" Fearless matured from her first album, explored some new themes, but still reflected where she was in life. Speak Now does this again, and I would say that it is her best work yet!<br />It is a long album - many tracks are over 5 minutes. But the lyrics are haunting. Swift is learning how to write for her voice. Instead of many shrieky, scream-talk songs, Swift has learned to write dynamically in a way that fits her voice and style.<br />\\"Speak Now\\" is a cute, \\"typical\\" Taylor Swift song, but one that will be beloved by fans.<br />\\"Dear John\\" is a haunting, emotional, heartbreaking song that delves into the hearts of listeners. No matter who she wrote it about, it is one of those songs that connects. Swift masterfully connected lyrics and instrumentation, creating a lingering melody that sticks with listeners. The chorus is beautiful, fits Swift's voice seamlessly. It is beautiful and probably my favorite track.<br />\\"Enchanted\\" is another song that reflects its lyrics. She eloquently tells the story, giving the wistfulness, the uncertainty, the intrigue, the hope of what is to come, all the emotions that arise at first attraction to someone.<br />Of course, there are the usual revenge songs that are part of Swift's trademark but that everyone relates to. Swift acknowledges in the songs that she will write songs about people who hurt her, and she references that in a few songs, such as \\"Better than Revenge.\\"<br />One of the most beautiful parts of the album are Swift's own liner notes. She writes a \\"prologue\\" of sorts to listeners, and she explains  that these songs say what she would have said had she chosen to \\"speak now.\\" She encourages readers to speak when they know what they want to say, when they feel led to say something but fear. I, reading the note, was chanllenged and the words hit home. Reading the note before listening to her songs makes them all the more poignant and meaningful.<br />For listeners about Swift's same age, this album is meaningful, relatable, and very timely. I always respect artists who write what they know, whose songs reflect their lives. I appreciate Swift's honesty, volunerability, and genuine lyrics.g to her songs makes them all the more poignant and meaningful.

0525951652|4.0|This nearly 1000 page book is not for the faint of heart.  However, it is for those who know that history teaches us about the present and future.  The author weaves true historical events into the lives of fictional characters, showing how historical events can change the person and how people determine the events of their world.  The time is pre-World War I through the early years following that War.  Each of the characters is well enough developed that they become very real and the reader must remain aware they are representative of the culture of the time, and their respective \\"stations\\" in life.  While the characters are fictional, the events surrounding them are either very real or powerfully representative of what could/might have occurred at various stages.  As the book ends it was interesting to note that the name calling and duplicitous nature of politics today was very much a part of that period of time although for the most part slightly more genteel.    The book can hold the interest of one who cares for history.  It will not do so for those whose interest is not piqued by earlier times.  As these characters are developed it becomes too obvious where the next in the series will take the characters and how the lives which began to intertwine in this book will become even more so in the next.  I cannot say the ending left me wanting for more but there was enough interest generated I might read the next in the series.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|As a person who has seen this movie, the recent remake, and actually read the book, I can say that this was a good attempt to bring the novel to life, but it falls short.  There are so many events and characters that are left out of the movie.  It really only focuses on Eli and Oskar ( Abby and Owen ) just like the remake.   Most of the disturbing content has been removed (the pedophilia , the flashbacks to Eli's childhood, Virginia's dilemma, the hunt for Harkan (spelling), etc... )       However, I must confess that I am not a fan of most foreign films, as the lighting, actors, and all the minor details that make a movie come to life as usually of lesser quality.  I found this to be the case once again.  If you liked the 2010 remake, which I loved, then this movie is a little closer to the book, but not enough to make me want to watch it again.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|If you're looking at this adapter, it's probably because of two reasons: You need to make a connection in a tight space, possibly a 90 degree angle. Or, you have an HDMI port that is constantly having HDMI cables connected to and disconnected from it. This is a well-built adapter with excellent video and audio pass-through.  It makes connections more convenient since it swivels and can allow you to connect cables at a 90-degree angle.  Perfect for those tight spots. Recommended.     MORE DETAILS:  Due to the adapter's design which allows swivelling, the wiring inside has to curve and then straighten out again in the casing. Despite the curve, the audio and video signals were not affected in my tests.    CONNECTORS: The connectors on both ends are gold plated, as are the pins inside the connectors.  Both HDMI cables I tested slid in easily and held tightly.  The connection is strong, and the video and audio pass-through is also excellent. The first HDMI cable I used was an Amazon Basics HDMI cable which is a thinner cable.  The other HDMI cable was a thicker Belkin cable.    SWIVEL: When laying the adapter flat, the head of the adapter can swivel/move almost 90 degrees to the left or right.  The middle of the adapter is on a hinge that allows the adapter to swivel up or down vertically in a 90 degree position.    QUALITY: High quality hard plastic with gold connectors.      This is a useful adapter for either making connections in tight spaces and limited areas.  It also serves the purpose of providing an endpoint where HDMI cables can be connected/disconnected multiple times without causing damage to the main connector on your equipment.  Most people probably won't remove HDMI connections once they are connected, but if necessary, this is a great adapter.  If I have any issues with the pass-through signal, I will update this review.
0061733199|5.0|well worth the knolledge, to a beginner camper -pricless info. Has sort of a brittish slang to it in some parts. For those asking: beta lights listed in the book are tritium crystal lights. Includes many good pictures and plants in color.
0525951652|5.0|I don't know what it is about Ken Folletts writing style but he manages to keep my interest throughout the story. I often get bored or bogged down with big books but all of his historical novels have been excellent. I love the story and the history lesson as well. If you are a history buff or teacher, this may seem a little boring but for me it was extreemly informative.By following the insight of the first world war and the \\"Soap Opera\\" with the characters involved; I finished the book in record time and enjoyed all of it. Not as good as Pillars but a very close second.
030726999X|4.0|I've marveled at Stieg Larrson's work since I picked up the first two volumes in this series and this final book is a very enjoyable conclusion to the Millennium trilogy. This is crime novel rich in political intrigue and illuminating of social ills.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is one of the most unique, complex and remarkable, albeit deeply flawed, character who fascinates the reader throughout the story. Mikael Blomkvist is one of the most believable and unique of heroes.<br /><br />Larsson leaves you on the edge of your seat and at the same time seamlessly connect with the original characters and ties the loose ends together. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest is a brilliant ending to this stellar trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As long as I don't spend too much time typing, this should be review #1347.  I haven't read through all the reviews, but I'm pretty sure that anything I might say has already been said.    This book and the rest of the trilogy is one of my all time favorites and I think it'll probably remain near the top of the list, no matter how many books I read.    I remember reading Lord of the Rings back in high school (a long time ago), sitting in the hall upgainst somebody's locker, trying to get in a little more reading in between classes.    This is like that; something that sticks with you for a lifetime.
B00005MP58|5.0|I purchased Pride and Prejudice after seeing the movie at school. I purchased it used. It was delivered to me extremely fast and I watched the entire movie immediately (It's over 5 hours long). It was in absolutely PERFECT condition, like brand new. I will definitely be ordering from Amazon again.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I really liked this book a LOT.  The characters are very endearing, even though the main male character has some serious flaws.  The plot device used throughout this book was really, very clever.  The book begins on July 15 and each chapter begins on July 15th of a different year.  The book then picks up with the 2 main characters and where their lives have led them.  Two really great things about the way the author does this is how he just jumps right into the new year/phase in the characters' lives.  At the beginning of every chapter, you are wondering just who exactly you are reading about and a lot of the fun of this book is figuring that out.  Another thing I liked about this device was how realistic it was.  How these two people were involved in each other's lives for so long, but for many chapters, they hardly even spoke to each other.  In other words, at each different July 15th, the author does not give us the happy couple, reunited once again, he more often than not shows a fragmented relationship, and at times, complete disregard for one another.  This book wraps up with one of the most touching moments I've ever read.  I was moved to serious weeping which rarely happens to me while reading.  I think this book has very wide appeal and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Nick Hornby - they have quite similar writing styles.
B000001C6M|5.0|Most hardcore and casual fans and critics will speak of Reign In Blood and/or Seasons In the Abyss when talking about Slayer's best album(s).  But, as a fan of all of their music, from Show No Mercy through World Painted Blood, this one is my favorite.  Sure, Slayer made better songs after this; starting with a couple of classics on the Haunting The Chapel EP that came out the year after Show No Mercy.  But, on every Slayer album or ep that came after this; including Reign In Blood, I can cherrypick between 1 and 5 highlights.  Show No Mercy, on the other hand, is a set I listen to from front to back; no skipping and no cherrypicking, from Evil Has No Boundaries through Show No Mercy.  Everything that Slayer would do to greater depths on future releases is here in one place; from lyrics obsessed with the devil and war, that are, at some times, serious commentary, and others, fantasy, cartoonish or even campy, to music that ranges from New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Speed Metal, Thrash, Black Metal, Progressive Metal, Death Metal and Punk Metal.  In a sound-alike world, Show No Mercy stands on its own, and I must add that it is the album where 4 of the best musicians in the world, who collectively and individually, do not get near the praise they deserve, introduced themselves to the world.  If I made a personal list of best and/or favorite albums, this would rank near the top.
B003YK42LQ|2.0|Kings should have stuck with a theme on this album.  It would have been cool if they would have stuck with the southern roots theme with songs like \\"Back down south\\", \\"Radioactive\\" and \\"Pick up truck.\\"  Songs like \\"Mary\\" and random anthems make it sound like a random mix of songs.  Now that they are too huge to care about sales, this was KOL's chance get experimental. Give us something unexpected ie: Radiohead's Kid A, MGMT congratulations.  Even if it was an experimental failure, they could have expanded their sound. It is all the same here. They played it too safe with this album and now I have little faith they will have the balls to put out another classic like Aha Shake.\\"  Another downer is that the songs are too slow-a big reason I was dissapointed with their last album.  Give us some uptempo songs!    I enjoy \\"Radioactive\\" a lot and I like the southern hick themes in songs like \\"Pick up truck\\", but overall, this is a big disapointment.  Especially since now they have room to put out whatever they want.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Wonderful conception of an old theme!  Russell Crowe makes a perfect Robin, and Cate Blanchette finally portrays Marion as a woman who is mature and capable.  The whole supporting ensemble just adds to the flavor.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|A great movie. The reviews here on Amazon include some older (and helpful) ones that note problems with the translation and format. These kinds of problems have been resolved in this blu-ray. Anyone reading my thoughts probably realizes already that this is the original Swedish version of a film that was recently remade in Hollywood as \\"Let Me In.\\" If you liked either version, it is well worth seeing the other. The two versions are close, but the subtle differences are intriguing, and the story is so good. For my taste, I give the American version a slight edge. It is darker, scarier, and I think deeper, in the sense of presenting the vampire as truly monstrous despite her pretty packaging. The Swedish version is more sympathetic to the vampire.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This movie was a great ending to the Toy Story Movies. It is a must own. My kids loved it and so did the rest of our family. It took me through so many different emotions. Very well done!
B0012GMZA4|3.0|Had the original vinyl, also a 1991 release CD of 'Against the Grain'. Those two were the original versions, this has a different cover and different takes of the same songs(plus the xtra trax). Couple other folks commented on this as well and they are right. It is interesting in that it is different versions of the familiar tunes, but I don't think it should be marketed as the 'original remastered/reissued' or whatever. There should be some notation/clarification about this. Truth in advertising . . . ? Basically, not what I thought I was buying.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This is my all time favorite Disney movie and watching it in high definition is amazing. I have been waiting as long as everyone else for this movie to come to blu ray. Love it!
0307476154|5.0|Hi,<br />I usually try not to write spoilers. After reading the first book. I decided not to follow this one while noting every little inconsistency or problem. I enjoyed this second book even more than the first from Herr Larsson. I am sometimes too [...]for my own good. There was only one major plot oopie in the first book (Old man Vanger would have known to look for the archival pix from the newspaper. He was an old newspaperman himself. The detective certainly would have as well.). Plus the minor fact that Mr.Larsson wasn't very knowledgeable about Glocks (Salander flicked the safety on a Glock. There is no manual safety on a Glock. That's one of their strong points.).<br /><br />The biggest problem I found in the second book? Salander's prints on the gun. Neanderthal man (Niedermann, in German) had huge hands. His gloves would have smudged any prints on that gun (including the cylinder) so much as to make them useless. It is highly unlikely that a viable print would have survived all the handling required to do his travels & murders. As an aside. I looked it up out of curiosity. There is a genetic disorder like what he had. It's acronym is CIPA (Congenital Insensitivity to Pain disorder w/Anhidrosis). Happily, that disorder is incredibly rare in real life.<br /><br />Now to be a bit of a wanker... As it turns out w/the second installment. He wasn't very knowledgeable about firearms, period. There is no such thing as a 45 Colt Magnum. Carbon did offer some highly specialized ammo w/this designation printed on the box. It wasn't true magnum ammo, though. It was only +P, & only meant for guns like the 454 Cassull. His continual references to special \\"Hunting ammo\\" must be unique to restrictive Swedish gun laws. A hollow point is a hollow point. Carry ammo, or hard ball, it's as simple as that. He didn't cite which Browning pistol in 22 caliber. So, I'll leave probable wound realities out of it. Did I mention I'm sometimes too [...]? Sorry... His cardiac information is off, too (washed-out cop w/slight hole in pericardium).<br /><br />The part about Salander being willing to lie down & die. While Zalachenko was still breathing? It was certainly out of character for her. Personally, I'd find her collapsing, unable to make it back to the shed due to her wounds, much more believable. The thing is. In real life, people do do things like that. However paradoxical their actions may seem. So, I can't fault it for that. I enjoyed this book a lot, & am looking forward to starting the third :-). I deeply hope Herr Larsson lived long enough to realize how successful his work would be.hed-out cop w/slight hole in pericardium).     The part about Salander being willing to lie down & die.

B003WTE886|5.0|No need for a lengthy review.  This young ladies talent as a singer song-writer is simply remarkable.  From ballads to country to rock, it is all riveting.  She continues to pursue her craft with artistry and class.      Taylor Swift has quickly joined the ranks of the greatest singer song writers.  Her talent grows with each new release.   It is hardly a stretch to mention her name in the same category as artists like Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, John Lennon, etc.      A++++
6305537321|3.0|This is a sort of good rendition of Truman Capote's book.  I was chagrined to see that the ending is not the same as the book.  I suppose that it made for better popularity, but I liked the independent, liberated Holly, which this ending takes away.  It also does not address the incipient homosexuality of the writer, making him 'safe' for her in the story.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|First off let me say \\"reimagining\\" an artist's original vision especially when that artist had no say in it can be considered sacrilegious.  I get that.<br />But having grown up a Beatles fan and absolutely loving John Lennon's voice, I never really appreciated his post Beatle's over produced vocal tracks. Maybe some of you feel that way too, I don't know.  But to hear these new remixes where you can actually hear John's 'real' voice is an unbounded pleasure.  I also love hearing all the instruments without that processed sound.  I similarly enjoyed the remixed 'Let It Be' without the 'wall of sound'. I guess I really enjoy the music...just the music.<br />I'm sorry but I had to knock off a star for the Yoko tracks. They're still crap. omg.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This device is simple to use and works on slightly dull blades.  A few passes through the carbide followed by a few passes through the ceramic provided accectable results on a slightly dull knife.  On a really dull knife it was completely useless.<br /><br />The diamond serrated blade sharpener is nice.  I prefer ceramic for this purpose since it lasts longer.  The case is clealy hollow and has a cheap feel.  It's very OK.
0061537969|5.0|This was another book that had been recommended and I dragged my feet about reading it thinking that it was probably going to be a disappointment. I was certainly wrong ! It was an \\"on target\\" book that brought forth all sorts of empathy for the characters portrayed in the book. I laughed out loud, became angry with the circumstances that happened to the characters, and wanted things to be different or at least have a different ending. Of course, that would have defeated the purpose of the story which clearly showed how to honorably deal with the cards that are dealt to you, good or bad, fair or unjust ! Everytime I read a book with this type of plot, I question myself and ask: How would I deal with the circumstances ? How could I handle the tragedy ? How would I relish the success ? I only hope that I could deal with the matters as well as the characters in the book. I also wish that I had the introspection and vision of the dog narrating the story ! This was a spot on good book ! Highly recommend !
B001GQ2BNQ|3.0|It has taken some getting used to.  I think it could be a little stiffer and not swivel quite so easily, but it may be my stroke or positioning in the water.  I seem to be always trying to clear a little water out of it.  My teammates say it flattens my stroke out so there is that to work around (moving the head any can result in a mouthful of water), but using it does achieve the intended purpose of working your lungs!
1427210497|5.0|Concentric overlapping circles of personalities and lives are the focus of Jonathan Franzen's \\"Freedom.\\"  We follow the prime \\"autobiographer,\\" Patty Berglund from her childhood days as a star basketball player from a wealthy Westchester County (NY) family where she feels undervalued and unsupported by her family following her rape.  She untimely settles down with Walter Berglund, a Minnesotan, whose father was an alcoholic, all the while sexually desiring Walter's college roommate Richard, a musician.  Walter has very strong opinions about right and wrong and good and bad. Walter and Patty have two children and Patty remains alienated from her New York family.  We hear the voices and thoughts of all the characters in this novel in which Franzen tackles some really heady environmental and ethical issues.  It is an engrossing work and deals with our freedom of life choices, sometimes good and sometimes chancy.  The novel is beautifully read and performed by David Ledoux.  The audio book contains 19 CDs.

0763619612|5.0|Behind every artist is a great teacher. THE DOT is a simple and inspirational story: Vashti is intimidated by an art project and believes that she can't draw. The teacher's timely and sensitive advice to \\"just make a mark and see where it takes you.\\" opens the door to all possibilities of making the dot a perfect art for Vashti. Awarded for her creative endeavors, she is also able to pass her teacher's encouragement to another child who is filled with self-doubt that he can't even draw a straight line. My 6-years old made her own \\"dots\\" collection after reading the book and I truly appreciate a book that honors teacher's influence and reminds young readers to take the first faithful step which may be the beginning of a great journey.

B0041VV03A|5.0|Splice gave so much more than I expected from it. This will achieve cult status while on DVD and there's good reason for it. The story, the characters, the morality, filming, score, all feel very much like david chronenberg without ever feeling like he's being ripped off. This is one of the darkest films I've seen lately and one of the most original.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had read the first 2 books in the series and enjoyed them. Then I questioned whether or not to download the last book due to quite a few negative reviews.  Well, the critical people need to back up and relax. The last book is written well and the author stays true to her writing style. I feel the characters stay true to themselves and true to how a post war and trauma ridden survivor would act. I have to say I loved Buttercup..he and Catnip finally had me chocked up at the end. Well worth the read.
1427210497|4.0|The audio version of FREEDOM, narrated by David LeDoux is terrific. His voice had a way of immediately drawing you into the world of The Berglund family: Patty, Walter, Jessica and Joey. The Berglunds are part of the baby-boomer generation, and the first third of the book is narrated by Patty as the third person autobiographer (her therapist thought this would be good for her).<br /><br />Patty and Walter met in college where Patty was a basketball star. Her career ended when she injured her knee. She wanted to marry, have two children and be a stay at home mother. Her life goal was to do a better job raising her children than her mother had done. Patty has had a long time attraction to her husband's college roommate Richard Katz, a former rock star.  In addition, Patty has what seems like an unhealthy obsession with her son Joey. Although, early on, Joey's actions disappoint Patty and Walter, beginning in high school when he sleeps with the trashy neighbor's daughter, and then later moves in with the family. However, this will not be the only incident that causes stress in the lives of the Berglunds. Patty's depression is an issue throughout most of the novel.<br /><br />Walter is very low key, and at least initially puts his needs aside, taking a job in the corporate world, to ensure that his wife and family are provided for. A lawyer and environmentalist, Walter too struggles with life issues, and a case of the \\"Is this all there is syndrome\\". An executive for a Nature Conservatory, he sees his home life crumbling around him, but doesn't seem to know what to do to make things better.  Walter's issues with son Joey, are not all that different from some of the issues both Walter, and Patty experienced with their own parents.<br /><br />Without sharing too much of the plot, FREEDOM is a multi-layered story, about FREEDOM: the \\"freedom\\" and consequences of ones personal life choices, whether it be: relationships, careers, child rearing, or life choices in general.  The lives of the Berglund's seemed very realistic. The family was not always likable, but flaws and all they could be most any of our neighbors.  I thought it was very interesting to see how although both Patty and Walter shunned the parenting style of their own mother and father, in the end their own lives, and issues were very similar, reinforcing the fact that we cannot always escape our past.<br /><br />The audio book was great, but one complaint was that it seemed longer than necessary at times. The writing was terrific though, and at times, laugh-out-loud funny as well. If you enjoyed The Corrections (2001) by Franzen, then I think you will enjoy this novel as well. Both novels take place at least partially in the mid-west, and the Lambert's and their three children (Corrections), and the Berglund's, Freedom, certainly have some similar dysfunction issues at the heart of each story.

0439023491|5.0|I thought this book was amazing! At first I didn't think I would like it, because the first book didn't leave a cliffhanger or opening for a sequel. I was wrong; it is just as good as the first book.  There was moment I actually liked it more than the first book. For example, I liked how the districts are rebellious, this makes me think that they are tuff and brutal,, but at the same time the districts have hope and have a dream, this makes me think that they want to get somewhere and that this is there way, so they have hope. I like how Suzanne Collins puts these emotions together and make it one and to me it just is hard to explain how she does it so well. I also liked the irony in it, like when the main character thinks she will never have to go back in the games, but for the 75th Hunger games she has to go back in the arena. I like her use of foreshadowing when she had the Hunger games director show a main character a watch, which represents the upcoming arena. I like her way of foreshadowing because you didn't realize she used it unless you looked closely or once the main character gets to the arena. I thought it was cool how she came up with the setting of the arena being a clock. I also liked how she kept the setting simple, so it was easy to remember which part was which when she was talking about a character in a part of the setting. There was one thing I did not like about the book, and that was how she brought out the character. I thought the author should have put more detail about all the rest of the character. She seems to just talk about few characters in depth, like Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch, even though Gale is a big part of the novel, she does not talk about him in depth like she should.<br /><br /> Like I said I loved it and excited to read the last book in the series. I would recommend this to anybody who read the Hunger Games, and if you were like me trust me it is a good sequel. If haven't read the series at all if advise you to read the first book. i hope everyone likes as much as I did.st book. i hope everyone likes as much as I did.
031236198X|2.0|Die Idee, Change Management als Fable zu erklären, fand ich witzig und habe deshalb das englische Original gekauft (leider nicht für den Kindle verfügbar - dann halt als Printbook). Hatte vermutet, dass es auch ein bißchen lustig zugehen würde und man trotzdem etwas lernt. Bin aber ziemlich enttäuscht, auch wenn es viele gute Kritiken gibt. Demnach können offenbar viele etwas mit dieser amerikanischen soft lecture Art anfangen, ich gehöre allerdings nicht dazu. Die Konflikte und Handlungsweisen der Pinguine erscheinen mir doch sehr eindimensional und aufgesetzt. Wenn es in der Praxis so einfach wäre, dann bräuchte man nicht so viele Bücher über Change Management. Jetzt soll eine Fabel natürlich gerade vereinfachen und auf's Wesentliche reduzieren, bloß tut sie das für mich nicht. Mein Fazit: Entweder mit Tiefgang oder aber richtig einfach und lustig. Aber so ein Mittelding ist mein Ding zumindest nicht...
0061997811|2.0|I love the books and films, but really thought this book would go more in-depth on the art of the film franchise. It was very disappointing to see only small thumbnail-sized images of the art, and for a book covering 8 films, this one could easily have been 300 pages. The art of Adam Brockbank and Andrew Williamson alone are certainly deserving of full-page spreads, and even production designer Stuart Craig- who's equally talented- had only a few sketches included in the book.<br />Although this book has great pull-outs that any fan would love to put up on their walls, I'll still be waiting for a book that properly showcases the works of the talented conceptual artists who worked on these classic films. If anyone wants to see a great example of a book that excellently shows the art of film, check out \\"The Art of Pirates of the Caribbean,\\"[[ASIN:1423103181 The Art of Pirates of the Caribbean]]. The \\"Harry Potter\\" artists are worthy to have their work shown in a similar manner.
B000GPIPTW|5.0|There is some controversy about which is the best MONO version of this album.  This one (40 Anniversary) is clearly the best.  It's an unfussed-with old digital copy of a then-twenty-year-old original master (digitized in the late eighties).  So it has all the charms and warts of a 16bit 44.1 Hz (CD standard) clean copy of a 2-decade old magnetic tape.  Other versions are either noise-reduced (the 1990 issue), based on a later digital copy of a by-then-25-year old tape (DCC, Audio Fidelity), or based on a by-then-30-year-old digital copy (1997 reissue).  The two gold CDs out there (DCC and Audio Fidelity) get a lot of press from some people who identify as \\"audiophiles\\" (who tend to sink a lot of money into things like 24 carat gold CDs and gold cables and thus have to justify the all the extra money they have spent on what they perceive as quality) but I'm afraid that this version is simply better than even the much-lauded DCC edition.  Magnetic tape does not age like wine.  That's an inevitable law of audio.  The songs on this first-digitization-based MONO version (40th anniversary) have noticeably livelier transients, perkier dynamics (mostly as a result of the aforementioned transients), a more life-like and focused bottom (again, transients) and a little more life in the highest frequencies.  The mids are a little harsh, but show me an (unmessed-with) Pets Sounds where that's not the case.  It's an inherently harsh-sounding album (at points).  Some stuff from the 60s was just made that way.  We don't go back to the 80s to remove peoples' mullets, do we?  The gold CDs (both of them) are murkier and duller, as is the 1997 reissue.  The gold CDs might sound \\"smoother\\" in some ways -- which could be mistaken for \\"better quality\\" -- especially with an album which was mixed with an inherently somewhat harsh sound.  Part of that \\"smoothness\\" (or more accurately \\"blurriness\\") is surely due to the greater age of the tape.  Or maybe the signal chain used on the way to the AD converter was murkier and gobbled up some transients.  Anyway.  The gold CDs are like day old bakery on fancy china.  The 1997 version is like day old bakery at a reasonable price and served with a smile.  The 1990 version is like day old bakery microwaved to seem fake-fresh.  This 40th anniv edition is like a piece of bakery you bought this AM and didn't get a chance to eat until 5pm.  Not perfectly fresh, but the closest you can get until time-travel is perfected.
B003WTE886|5.0|It's Taylor Swift. We all know what we're getting with her albums. She delivers with exactly what I wanted to hear. More of the same, a little more grown up. She does not have the best voice, that's understood, but she has a great storytelling ability with her songs and they are fun to listen to and sing along to.
0756405890|5.0|I just finished reading this for the second time. I was hard pressed to put it down both times and I am eagerly awaiting the next book.
0446613444|4.0|\\"The Black Ice,\\" (1993) is the powerful second novel, following on [[ASIN:0446612731 The Black Echo (Harry Bosch)]], in Michael Connelly's best-selling Harry Bosch series of mystery novels. The series, Los Angeles-set police procedurals, looks at life on the \\"noir\\" side; Connelly is a former journalist, a crime beat writer for the Los Angeles Times, who certainly earned his spurs in murder while earning his daily bread. His recent standalones, [[ASIN:044640120X The Scarecrow]], [[ASIN:0446583936 The Brass Verdict]],and [[ASIN:B002MAQSAM The Lincoln Lawyer]], have all been #1 New York Times Bestsellers; as has  [[ASIN:0316012793 Crime Beat: A Decade of Covering Cops and Killers]], a non-fiction collection of his journalism.<br /><br />Anyone who lives in relatively northern climes knows what \\"black ice\\" means to us: if snow has melted during a sunny day, then refreezes in the colder night, it will constitute black ice: hard to see, and dangerous.  This meaning of the term certainly informs the book.  But Connelly here gives another meaning to black ice.  It is apparently the street name given by Mexican cartels to a powerful combination of cocaine, heroin, and PCP dust that was, at one time, supposed to be the next big thing in the drug world.  Whether it ever was or not, I've no idea.  At any rate, Connelly posits a world in which Hawaiian drug cartels, which invented the product and called it \\"glass,\\" are fighting the Mexican cartels for control of the LA market in it.  This has apparently resulted in four murders; one Hawaiian drug mule, one Mexican laborer, and two LA cops.<br /><br />The book boasts riveting, tight relatively fresh plots, though we have seen a lot of the same elsewhere; excellent narrative and descriptive writing, and snappy dialogue. It is informed by Connelly's deep, accurate knowledge of police work, after several years' experience on the cop shop beat. And, it is written with great knowledge of, and love for, Los Angeles, the author's adopted home town. It clearly follows in the footsteps of earlier outstanding hardboiled LA authors Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald, but adds the further ingredients of a police procedural, as it charts the early career of Connelly's creation, LAPD Detective Bosch, now assigned to Hollywood Homicide, still fighting the Vietnam War in his nightmares.  It also introduces many characters we will come to know better in later Bosch novels - Connelly must really be a whiz at pre-planning his work.  At any rate, mention is made of Bosch's partner on the force, Jerry Edgar, and two of the force's superior officers, Irvin Irving and Harvey Pounds.  Also Bremmer, crime reporter of the LA Times.  And Bosch's mother, a murdered LA prostitute.  And the father he never knew, prominent defense attorney Jerry Haller.  And, accordingly, Bosch's half-brother, prominent defense attorney Mickey Haller.  And, perhaps most resonant to me, the coyote that lives in the gully below Bosch's house, whom he's named \\"Timido.\\"<br /><br />Connelly is a wonderful writer, my favorite among American mystery authors, and I've read all his books save \\"Scarecrow.\\" (Like many other readers, I imagine, I prefer his series works to his standalones: like many other writers, his mysteries seem more powerful if they are filtered through the sensibilities of his detective protagonist.) At any rate, Connelly's plots drive like Mack trucks; furthermore, they are complex, and resonant. He explicates his love of jazz as he goes. And his descriptive writing: well, it's heartfelt, written by a man in love with a city, and it's so precise that a stranger could find his way around LA with a few of his books as guides. If you've come to Connelly through his newer books, you really owe yourself the two earliest novels. They set a benchmark he -- or anyone else-- would have trouble reaching.clearly follows in the footsteps of earlier outstanding hardboiled LA authors Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald, but adds the further ingredients of a police procedural, as it charts the early career of Connelly's creation, LAPD Detective Bosch, now assigned to Hollywood Homicide, still fighting the Vietnam War in his nightmares.

B003SOMYNQ|5.0|All critics have to sit around and pat each other on the back for having read this novel. There is something so timeless and simply outstanding about this novel that even the most harsh critic will praise it.  All ages, all generations what's not to love?
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Have seen it before so it came as no surprise. Big Fish is an excellent film, appropriate for all members of the family. The script well written teaches important values missing in so many movies today such as courage, loyalty, and family. I would recomment Big Fish to anyone looking for these things in a movie. Thanks. C.R.Hopper
B0044430H8|5.0|I got a taste of the music from The Social Network when I downloaded 5 tracks that Reznor made available for free before the release of the album. The five tracks became a staple on my iTunes for days on end! As a longtime fan of Nine Inch Nails, I couldn't get enough of it, so getting the entire album was an easy decision and one I am happy I made.<br /><br />The music for this movie will probably be one of the best albums to come out this year. It exposes classic Reznor style to audiences that may have not been paying as much attention (or even had a chance to listen to him) in the nineties, when he started gaining notoriety through Nine Inch Nails. If you wonder what this sounds like, take a bit of Depeche Mode (Ultra period) and mix it up with touches of VNV Nation and the music of Erasure (though not quite). OR... get yourself the MP3 album and thank me later!
B00006WKY9|4.0|I bought this album to see how Uli Roth sounded in the Scorpions.  I like it a lot, and I can see how it influenced other players for sure.  I've not been a huge Scorpions fan, but if this was the first album I'd heard I think I might have been.

B002ZG98LO|4.0|Predator is one of two classic Sci-fi movies along with Aliens that cemented itself in the 80s. Ever since Predator 2, fans have been clamoring for a 3rd installment, but have not found their fix. With the release of AVP and AVP2, Predator fans have been left out in the wind, with two horrible attempts. This all changed with Predators. The movie pulls no punches and wastes no time. A group of soldiers from different backgrounds (Mercenary, Israeli Sniper, Yakuza, Russian Spetnaz, Mexican Mafia, African Warlord, Death Row Inmate, and a weakling Doctor) all free fall into a strange planet, non of which can remember how they got there, or why they are there. These become meek points as they find themselves trapped on an Alien planet. Once this point is realized, they ban together to get the hell out of there. This of course becomes a moot point as they are meticulously hunted by a new breed of Predator. That's right, a new Predator. The new Predator, of a different tribe then the one we have come to know, not only hunts humans, but other aliens, and even our familiar predators as well. With drones, and hunting \\"dogs\\" the new Predator is smarter, badder, and meaner than the original. After locating the people, the hunt begins, and the humans are on the run. Eventually running into another human survivor (Fishburn) who has survived, but lost his mind in the process. The humans fight on, taking on what they have to to kill the new Predators, but can they survive? Can they escape the planet in one piece?
0307454541|5.0|This book starts out slow and you will want to put it down after a few chapters until you hit the aha moment of the book that sparks interest, intrigue and chaos.  You don't need to be up on your Swedish however the towns and streets can become quite fun to pronounce.  Halfway through this book, I needed to make sure I had the second, now I am on my way to ordering the 3rd.  I really hope there are more stories buried on Stieg's computer that are going to be coming to light, if you don't know, the author is deceased and never saw his work come to life in the world.  From:  [...]<br />Stieg Larsson (1954-2004) was a Swedish writer and journalist.<br />Prior to his sudden death of a heart attack in November 2004 he finished three detective novels in his trilogy \\"The Millenium-series\\" which were published posthumously; \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\". Altogether, his trilogy has sold more than 20 million copies in 41 countries (spring of 2010), and he was the second bestselling author in the world 2008.<br />When you first start reading it starts out with statistics that don't make sense something like; \\"40% of the women in Sweden don't report domestic abuse\\"<br />Those statistics go back to the original title: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (original title in Swedish: M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor - \\"Men Who Hate Women\\") - From Wikipedia.<br />Make sure you read the books in order I had to search by copywright dates because I saw the first two on the shelf - the cover got me, I admit it.<br />1) The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo<br />2) The Girl Who Played With Fire<br />3) The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest<br />If you like Mystery/Crime/Suspense I think you will thoroughly enjoy the first 2, can't speak for the third, if it follows the same trends I'm sure it will be a great read.  There is a lot of underlying sub plots but the author made sure he brought you right back into it if he left it earlier in the series, book, or chapter.  Enjoyable read that you won't want to put down and beg for the release of more - rumor has it there is a 4th, and Stieg was working on 10 books for the series.er.

144471032X|5.0|Don't buy this book if:<br />- you like to delude yourself that you can lose weight without changing your eating habits (e.g. no potatoes means NO potatoes)<br />- you think real food can be bought cheaply (lean beef DOES cost a lot and anything you buy ready for microwave is NOT real food)<br />- you think \\"perseverance\\" means \\"lasting no more than five minutes (with a three minute break in the middle)\\"<br />- you like to diet but you never read the instructions (you like to improvise your diets)<br />- you have perfect weight but some dieting wouldn't do you much harm<br />- your cooking skills are limited to boiling an egg (as you will eat boiled eggs only for the next few months...)<br />This diet works only if you take it seriously and follow the instructions. It takes time and the included cook-book is meant to help and make it a little more pleasant and varied. For some this \\"more\\" will not be enough but it's life, honey. No pain, no gain.<br />If you stick to it - there is a sweet reward in the end. And by sweet reward I mean also the return of cookies. Obviously, if you like them in the first place ;)<br />PS If you are in two minds still - don't let those who gave up after a day or two discourage you. Do you seriously think that a day of dieting can have lasting results? Do you seriously think that losing fat you have amassed over years can happen painlessly and without any effort? If you do, well, you can't be helped.

0143116738|1.0|The idea that one should pursue one's passion is neither new nor, in and of itself, particularly profound. We've all heard stories about people who have pulled themselves up by their boot straps and become amazingly successful and fulfilled. Nothing new here. So what's good about this book? What's new? What's useful?<br /><br />The burning question for almost everyone not lucky enough to have their passion thrust upon them is How Do I Discover MY Passion?<br /><br />That's the real question.<br /><br />And when I ask that question, I'm not looking for vague, general guidelines, I'm looking for a process that will lead to the discovery of my passion. Do I even have one? Does everyone have a passion?<br /><br />The people profiled in the book are all very remarkable, very unusual people. We're not all like them. How do WE discover our passion? I've already heard about the lucky ones; I want to know about the rest of us.<br /><br />The book doesn't even come close to addressing this question in a meaningful way. And, of course, it could be argued that that is not its purpose. But then, what is its purpose: capitalizing on fame, name dropping, rehashing? Whatever else it might be, it's also an opportunity lost.<br /><br />In the end, this is a book directed at an elitist audience, like the author and the friends he mentions. More than a disappointment, this book is a disservice to readers serious about making a difference in their lives.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Enjoying this CD a lot. The bonuses on the edition I bought are a welcome touch (the Alicia Keys cover, the acoustic versions) Very nice...
B001HN694K|5.0|I bought this dvd just to introduce grandchildren to the world of imagination and wonder after having read to them the original story. They and I enjoyed it very much, and found it dealt with the many scenes in the book very well and was quite faithful to it. Imagination and not push buttons is still the best form of entertainment. Well done to all who made the film.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|NOTE: Some Sony, Oppo, Panasonic and Samsung players may have a problem with the Disc Unbound or Mother Mode settings with this set. I would suggest making sure you have the latest firmware prior to playing these.<br /><br />Not counting the individual title releases (or VHS), this is the third go round for the \\"Aliens\\" films on disc but first on Blu-ray. After all of that experience you'd expect Fox to turn out a perfect product. While not exactly perhaps, it's very very close.<br /><br />The first two films \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" receive top notch brand new HD transfers. A lot of folks were afraid that these films would turn out looking like the recent reissue of \\"Predator\\" with the overuse of digital noise reduction which actually REDUCES fine detail in pursuit of reducing grain. The grain management used here is subtle and improves the image quality.<br /><br />Both the original theatrical version of \\"Alien\\" and the \\"Extended Cut\\" from 2003 look exceptionally good here. There are some minor variations in some of the material due to some minor differences in color timing from what I can tell but overall both versions look amazingly consistent with a richer, darker image but plenty of detail reflecting an experience closer to the theatrical showing for the original film.<br /><br />\\"Aliens\\" always the film with the most grain (which James Cameron didn't like at the time but they were working with a new type of film stock)doesn't lose its film-like look, retains much of its grain but looks the best it ever has on home video. Each disc features seamless branched editions of the original theatrical versions and the extended cuts. For \\"Aliens\\" the two versions look slightly different at times (to my eyes) but are surprisingly consistent given the source material.<br /><br />\\"Alien 3\\" and \\"Alien Resurrection\\" both look quite good although they are clearly from older HD masters with a bit more heavy handed use of DNR and detail not quite as sharp. Still, both look very good indeed and are a step up compared to the original DVDs. There was also some redubbing of dialogue for a couple of scenes for \\"Alien 3\\" with the original cast brought back in to provide clearer sound compared to the production sound on the \\"Workprint\\" version.<br /><br />We get both the original theatrical cuts and extended editons prepared in 2003.<br /><br />Folks who purchased the previous set will enjoy the fact that all of the extras from the previous editions have been ported over (at least I couldn't find any missing off the top of my head). Unfortuantely the new commentary tracks that star Sigorney Weaver was supposed to record didn't happen for reasons of logicistics. Likewise missing (at the request of James Cameron's Lightstorm)is the originally promised outtakes which featured actor James Remar in the role of Hicks. That's unfortunate but not a deal breaker.<br /><br />We get isolated scores, commentary tracks, behind-the-scenes footage, interviews new and old and the uncut documentary made on the debacle that occurred with \\"Alien 3\\" (the previous version was edited due to some negative comments about Fox).<br /><br />The Bad: The packaging while innovative in design and handsome looking isn't the best place to store these discs. Housed in a hardback Blu-ray sized case, the films come in a heavy cardboard book with spots to slip the discs in and out. The only concern I would have is wear and tear and possible scratching although it should be noted that generally Blu-ray can withstand more wear and tear than normal DVDs. I personally would have preferred the option of purchasing this in a standard Blu-ray case with a booklet featuring the photos inside the hardback book.<br /><br />There is also a small booklet detailing the contents of the discs and how to navigate the interactive features. There is a really cool new interactive feature which allows you as you go from one disc to the next to skip all the annoying FBI and logos that act as introductionsto the discs taking you directly to the feature film or special features. It's a nice innovative touch that ALL studios should apply to their Blu-ray boxed sets. When you take the disc out and are loading the next disc in the logo of the \\"Company\\" that is also a character in the films stays on your screen.<br /><br />Over all this is an outstanding set and worth the upgrade for fans of the films who want these in high def. Is this upgrade worthwhile? That will depend on you and how important these films and new extras are to you. I realize that there are those that are upset with the price on these and the best I can suggest is to buy it while it is low priced or wait until they come down in price during the Christmas season.

0312600844|5.0|I read a review that complained that none of the characters in Freedom were likeable. Well, maybe so, but they were human. I couldn't help but laugh during some of the sexual passages - especially when thinking that this is in Oprah's book club. I think Franzen is a GREAT author, and can't wait to read The Corrections.

0525951652|5.0|This book is honestly one of my favorites of all time.  The painstaking historical accuracy is impressive and very educational.  Ken Follett does very well at creating a fantastic, gripping narrative involving 5 different families and how they are affected by the moves towards war, the bloodshed and chaos of war, and the struggle for peace and a return to normalcy which follows.      Some attempts to put characters in important historical scenes can seem a bit contrived, but they provide the fly-on-the-wall information required to keep the reader educated and moving through real-world events.    A fascinating read and I can't wait for the 2nd installment based in World War II which follows these same families.    Yet another must-read novel by Ken Follett!

B003VIW8DK|4.0|i am so glad to see a new cd. the only thing i dont like ,is that bryan ferry vocals seem very low, like the music and his voice are at the same level. It is just so great to see eno, phil and andy all together, but where is the sax? Heartache by number is the best song, it should have been the single, I love the first six songs, I wish they would have done a whole cd of new songs. I really love it. I would love to hear them do another cd, but as Roxy Music. Eno is such a driving force, as well as phil and andy.....guys can you do a follow up as Roxy? It would be great. But please turn up Bryan vocals. they are alillte dull, and the music is kinda over powering on many tracks. but all and all. I LOVE IT. And its so good to hear some real music. not cookie cutter stuff. Cheers to you guys, well done.....so can we get a Roxy Music cd next?????? you guys have it, share it with your fans and the world. life is too short......as a fan and as others who you love you guys...Please guy us more . For all the would U.S and U.K to enjoy all our days. thanks guys for comming together agian, we wand more. thanks.
B003062NG0|5.0|This is a collection of B sides cut off the Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun albums, but don't let that diminish your appreciation for this absolutely fabulous and top-notch album. The songs here are every bit as high quality as anything on their studio releases. PT have not disappointed me yet. Through all their eras (the early psychedelic stuff, the pop-infused Radiohead-ish stuff, and the prog metal era), they have successfully pushed musical boundaries, and managed to not lose most of their fanbase in the process.     Recordings is comprised of several songs interspersed with soundscapes. It is an album which gives you greater rewards with each successive listen. 'Buying New Soul' may be one of the finest songs in their discography, and is one of the highlights here. Colin Edwin's double bass work, and Barbieri's keyboard soundscapes really stand out here. 'Access Denied' is a very different song for PT, it sounds very catchy and Beatles-esque. And the full 14 minute version of 'Even Less' is massively better than the cut down version which appeared on the Stupid Dream record. Not sure why Wilson compromised on that one. PT's B sides are always every bit as good as their album cuts. In fact, I'd go as far to say their rejected B side tracks are often better than some band's best songs!     Amazing album from an amazing band. Get it now!
B003YOZNBU|1.0|A disappointing film that ruins the meaning of a film adaptation!  While Josh Brolin is normally a great actor, he could not provide convincing acting when he played Jonah Hex.  Also, this film has poor makeup because Jonah Hex's scars are supposed to be more extensive while in this film, they toned down the scarring too much.  They could have at least used CGI to extend the scarring instead of trying to mess it up with old-fashioned makeup.  Another issue that came up in this film is the fact that Megan Fox and John Malkovich use the same acting style they use in all of their movies instead of altering their acting so that they seem more convincing and they would not look like emotionless robots trying to preach their lines.  In conclusion, this film is a complete disappointment to audiences everywhere.  [[ASIN:1432743821 The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell]]
0312600844|3.0|After hundreds of reviews here, I just wanted to add my own thoughts. I bought into the hype and fanatically ecstatic reviews of this overstuffed work, and so sat down for three weeks to read it in between working moments. It's been a month now since I turned the last page. All I can remember is Walter and Patty, their kids, that rock star guy, and a lot of dislike of just about everyone for hundreds of pages. The writing itself didn't knock me over like Checkhov's or Norman Mailer's or anyone justifiably iconic. I felt as if someone were drilling on my teeth for almost three straight weeks, but then he stopped, and I was pleased to feel redemption at the end of it all.<br /><br />Lots of contemporary issues were dragged into the book to make it \\"relevant\\" and give it a feel of the Great American Novel. Franzen must feel that America is a pretty unhappy place, or maybe life itself is an unhappy scene (first principle of Buddhism: All life is suffering). But even today, the book feels dated because a novelist writing about the latest hideous headlines is going to fall into the trap of being about as interesting as yesterday's newspapers.<br /><br />So the setup is to give us a fairly rotten, transparent, self-pitying hypocritical bunch of people who are doing their damndest to be unaware of what's really going on inside of themselves. And then circumstances bring them into the light, more or less, and miraculously they somehow heal their inner angst.<br /><br />I think one of these contrivances is about enough for my reading lifespan, which is definitely limited, much like coal and birds and Franzen's vision of the world.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This was the worst waste of film ever created!  It completely tarnished the original story because it changed the plot of the book, resulting in an absolute horrific abomination that will stain the reputation of the film industry forever.  The script was very poorly edited and did not stick to the book's plot.  The overall film was way too short and did not give the audience a prolonged sense of excitement that an average film would give.  Also, John Malkovich did not give the best impression of being Galbatorix, who was considered to be the greatest evil in the whole series while the guy who played Durza gave a more convincing evil demeanor.  The acting was also terrible despite the fact that the film had an all-star cast.  They should completely redo the movie so that they get it right next time, but Mr. Paolini does not lift a finger to make the movie as it should have been.  I would highly recommend the books, but not this movie.  [[ASIN:1432743821 The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell]]

0385504225|1.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS    **********    I was a huge fan of Angels and Demons and thought The Da Vinci Code was pretty good, so I was really excited for this book. I never should have opened it.    Dan Brown spends 400 pages building up to this special thing and it's...The Bible. That's it. The Bible. I mean REALLY?! The murderer is caught and there is like...50 pages of him preaching about how we need to look deeper into THE BIBLE? I was so pissed. The twists were ridiculous. The drowning thing was a JOKE. I was so disappointed. I never start these novels thinking I'm going to read remarkable writing, but I do expect a good plot. This one was just too jumbled and had way too much going on. Also...I agree with another reviewer. He stole Sato from The Incredibles.     A very sad showing from Mr. Brown. I don't think I'll be reading one of his books again.

This movie has a strong message that we all have something to contribute and it is done in a most elagant way.  I take my hat off.
B000002KDI|5.0|Love the CD and I think this is the best live recording from Neil Young.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the ultimate place to begin listening to the Beatles (or music in general). Easily the finest collection of pop/rock songs yet recorded. Several songs (e.g. \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\", \\"All You Need Is Love\\", etc.) would be in the running for greatest song ever recorded. Great sound and packaging. The only possible quibble with the track listing is that too many awesome songs like \\"Golden Slumbers/The End\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" were excluded due to limited space on the original vinyl records. However, although some great songs could have been added, tampering with the track listing is almost as likely to result in a less listenable album as a more valuable one.     One real oddity is that they changed the color of the \\"Blue Album\\" from light blue to blue. Maybe this version should be called the \\"Darker Than Royal Blue Album\\". (The pictures are all darker too, which doesn't seem to be an advantage. And what happened to poor Martha - why only show her paws?)     I would highly recommend this album as a compilation over the Beatles 1 because the non-singles were often as good as (or better than) the singles.    So buy the Blue and Red albums with the understanding that, while they contain a great wealth of incredible music, they still only represent a fraction of the Beatles essential songs.

0547258305|4.0|Graceling is the debut novel by Kristin Cashore. It tells the story of Katsa, Lady from the Middluns, who is one of a handful of Graced human beings. A Grace is an enhanced ability that only a few people have, and Katsa's Grace is fighting. At the beginning of the book, Katsa is kept under the thunb of the cruel king Randa to do his bidding, until she finally breaks free from his rule. Katsa begins the novel by resucing a Lienid man, kidnapped from his city and held prisoner. Katsa has to figure out who kidnapped the Lienid man and why, and this journey takes her through the rest of he novel, where we meet the Lienid Prince Po, and the Monsean Princess Bitterblue.     Kristin Cashore writes an enchanting first novel, yet it still reads a bit roughly. Some of the plot points of the novel wrapped up too easily, and some of the dialogue seemed silly and contrite. The final \\"battle\\" if you will, with the main villain, seemed entirely too easy. However, it was still a delightful read, and I really enjoyed it. It was very easy to read, and I liked the characters very much, especially little Bitterblue. Cashore has written a prequel, named \\"Fire\\" that I plan to pick up as well.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|WINTER'S BONE is as quiet and insidious as a stem cell carcinoma. Based on the successful novel by author Daniel Woodrell who explains the choice of title explain at the back of his book: \\"The `Winter's' part of the title is obvious, and the `Bone' part comes from slang. It can be stated wryly, sarcastically, even tenderly, when throwing a sop to someone, `Oh, give him a bone.' In this case, it is winter itself giving a gift, a bone, to Ree Dolly. The season knows she has earned it, and the term suggests the double-edged aspect of the gesture and is suited to the novel,\\"  writer Anne Rosellini and writer/director Debra Granik have adapted this story for film and in doing so have presented one of the finest artistic successes of the year.<br /><br />The setting is contemporary Missouri Ozarks where people barely survive, especially during the winter.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in a stunningly sophisticated  performance) is seventeen years old, living in a shack with her clinically depressed mother and her brother and sister: her father Jessup is missing, having been arrested for his dealings in making Crank (crystal meth) - the only source of income for many of the folk in the area, folk who also are users - and posted bail using his house and land as collateral.  Ree has a tough time as the only responsible person for her family and when the local sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) visits to inform Ree that Jessup has skipped town and that if he doesn't show up for his court date, Ree's home and land will be absconded, Ree is devastated.  Ree seeks advice from her many relatives who adamantly refuse to help her out of fear of discovery of involvement in the drug business: Ree sets out to find her father.  She turns to every member of her family (it would seem that most everyone in this pitiful area is blood) she is turned down for help - especially from her father's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) who hesitantly warns her that her father is dead.  She finally gains some assistance through her perseverance only to discover that that Jessup is dead and she is forced to dredge his body from the river to cut off his hands to prove to the court that her father is dead and the threat of evacuation is nullified.<br /><br />The casting of this film is a little miracle: down to the smallest role each actor is exactly right in creating the sullen and desperate atmosphere of this story.  There are rare moments when the tale is not grim, moments such as the gathering of banjo and guitar players in a Pickin' Session to accompanying the singing of a Marideth Sisco.  The cinematography by Michael McDonough  and the musical choices made by Dickon Hinchliffe  recreate the desolation of this pitiful community of people living on the edge in the Ozarks.  But towering above all of this is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence who will undoubtedly now rise to prominence.

The casting of this film is a little miracle: down to the smallest role each actor is exactly right in creating the sullen and desperate atmosphere of this story.  There are rare moments when the tale is not grim, moments such as the gathering of banjo and guitar players in a Pickin' Session to accompanying the singing of a Marideth Sisco.  The cinematography by Michael McDonough  and the musical choices made by Dickon Hinchliffe  recreate the desolation of this pitiful community of people living on the edge in the Ozarks.  But towering above all of this is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence who will undoubtedly now rise to prominence. Grady Harp, October 10
0385738757|4.0|The Scorch Trials, the second installment of James Dashner's Maze Runner Trilogy, comes back strong with lots more action and a lot more questions as to just who the people of WICKED really are and why they are putting teams of teenagers through horrific trials of survival. The players started out in Maze Runner, hightailing it for their lives as they ran the moving walled Maze every day looking for escape while battling deadly monsters with rotating blades that slice and dice called Grievers. After making it through their first session of survival in the Maze, and with most of them getting out alive, they learn they are part of a devious experiment that chooses them for their survival skills for an unknown government mission ahead. Thinking that they were in the clear and counting their chickens before they were hatched, the organization of WICKED immediately throws them into the second round of tests called the Scorch Trials.<br /><br />This is where book two opens. Thomas, Theresa, Minho and the other surviving Gladers are informed they are to be tossed out into an infernal world of desert like landscapes, no plant or animal life, temperatures as hot as the sun. They are told that the earth has been in crisis, that years ago solar flares ravaged the earth suddenly with no time to escape. Millions died, few survived, the remaining people world around have banded together to find a cure for a disease called the Flare that the Solar crisis enabled. Leper like people, suffering from the Flare, are crazy and violent, and the Gladers must fight them off, travel for two weeks across barren hot land, to reach a safe haven where they are told, is a cure for them all if they make it.<br /><br />Dashner throws all kinds of catastrophes and variables at the teens as they once again battle for their lives against many obstacles threatening to kill them, most of which is another team of kids just like them.<br /><br />Leaders, followers, friends, betrayers, killers and mad scientists, leave the reader never really knowing what is happening and who is who while racing their way through a riveting adventure story full of action, humor, romance, cool sci-fi effects, hi tech wizardry and many emotional rollercoaster scenarios that have these kids hearts and minds in turmoil, never knowing if they will wake up the next day alive.<br /><br />For parents deciding on whether to purchase this book I would just mention a warning that here is HEAVY violence and killing here for younger teens to read. Perhaps 12 and up would be a safe bet as a caution.<br /><br />And about WICKED, well, I have my own ideas of what this story is about and where it will go in the finale, but honestly, I'm still not too sure. The author does a bang up job keeping readers curious and anxious to find out what is real, what is not, what happened in the beginning, and why. I guess we don't find out for another year but I have to say, these first two books were outstanding, well written, clever and fun. Loved both books so far and can't wait for book three!entists, leave the reader never really knowing what is happening and who is who while racing their way through a riveting adventure story full of action, humor, romance, cool sci-fi effects, hi tech wizardry and many emotional rollercoaster scenarios that have these kids hearts and minds in turmoil, never knowing if they will wake up the next day alive.<br /><br />For parents deciding on whether to purchase this book I would just mention a warning that here is HEAVY violence and killing here for younger teens to read.

B002N1RM5A|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann continues to impress with every performance and recording he delivers. For those who have been collecting the CDs and DVDs of his forays into Wagner, Mozart, Beethoven operas as well as his recently successful step into the verismo Italian realm it will be doubly rewarding to know that this dynamic, burnished, intelligent voice inside Kaufmann's commanding physical presence is not only comfortable in the genre of lieder, he just may be the most successful of the newcomers in this challenging realm.<br /><br />'Die Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin' by Franz Schubert is not only compelling  as a series of songs that tell a story, it is also a tremendous challenge to the singer.  Kaufmann's glorious tenor (leaning a bit toward the baritone coloring) fits this music perfectly. He is able to change his approach with the changes in the tone of each song.  His diction is impeccable and the voice never sounds the least bit strained. Listen to the control of his pianissimos in 'Morgengruss' as an example of the sensitivity of this artist's approach. For once the travails of the young man in love make complete sense and encourages the listener to follow the poetry along with the music. This is lieder singing at its zenith and Kaufmann is beautifully partnered with Helmut Deutsch at the piano.  We can only hope that he will elect to record the 'Winterreise' soon.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 10
0143118420|2.0|Eat Pray Love is a memoir of Gilbert's self-indulgent journey to Italy, India, and Indonesia after divorcing her husband and splitting from her younger boyfriend.    Italy was by far my favorite, India my least favorite, and Indonesia just okay.    India was full of Gilbert's sarcasm, with lines like: \\"Of course, we all inevitably work too hard, then we get burned out and have to spend the whole weekend in our pajamas, eating cereal straight out of the box and staring at the TV in a mild coma(which is the opposite of working, yes, but not exactly the same thing as pleasure). Americans don't really know how to do nothing\\" (p. 61). I also enjoyed her translation of an Italian man cheering for his favorite soccer player, while yelling obscenities.     In Book One: Italy, I can relate to Gilbert's character, from her views on antidepressants, to her selfless nature when in a relationship, and what she calls her \\"guilt alarm\\". Disappointingly, in Book Two: India, Gilbert's novel becomes rather dry and cryptic.     While in India, Gilbert is focusing on her relationship with God and finding contentment. I can relate to her search for a better relationship with God and contentment, but the way she describes it is boring. I did not want to read about her daily meditations and her advice for how to be closer to God. With even just a sprinkle of her sarcasm from Book One, Book Two could have been more enjoyable. The only reason I kept reading was in hope that Book Three: Indonesia would be better and worth my wait.    Unfortunately, Book Three was only slightly better than Book Two while still falling short of Book One. Fortunately for the reader, we are introduced to Ketut Liyer, Bali's medicine man and Gilbert's reason for coming back to Bali (based on a previous palm reading). As I read Gilbert's description of Ketut, I could envision his almost toothless smile and Balinese accent. Further, I appreciated Gilbert's returning sarcasm, especially when she describes the politeway to tell a Balinese person you are not married. She writes, \\"Even if you are eighty years old, or a lesbian, or a strident feminist, or a nun...\\" or all of those things (as Gilbert points out), you politely say, \\"Not yet\\" (pp. 228-229).     Just as the title hints, Book Three is also where Gilbert finds love. Of course, while this may capture a majority of the audience's heart, this love story was unable to save the book for me. With only a 33% approval rating (1 of 3 books), Eat Pray Love was a huge disappointment. This is probably one of the only times I will suggest seeing the movie over reading the book.

159448385X|4.0|You must have a strong stomach and heart to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. The scenes of physical and verbal abuse and pure torment are extremely bothersome, especially for anyone with children. In this story, you will learn much about polygynous husbands, domesticated women forced to marry older men, and the burden put on women who do not bear males-- even worse, who do not bear children at all.     A Thousand Splendid Suns is a must read. It will definitely spark your interest in Middle-Eastern culture, its practices, its wars, its triumphs, and its current endeavors.
B003WTE886|5.0|When Taylor first hit the music scene, I'll admit I was not a big fan of her. Then 'Love Story'  and 'You Belong with Me' came on the radio and I decided to purchase 'Fearless' and give it a try. I ended up loving it so much that I went out and purchased her debut album as well, and love it just as much as Fearless. The reason why I (and so many other fans) am charmed by her is because her lyrics are sweet, innocent, spoken from the heart, and women of all ages can relate to them. She also doesn't need to act promiscuous or throw fancy editing and auto-tuned tricks into her albums to be successful. She's just simply Taylor - raw and beautiful. This girl truly has talent.<br /><br />So when I found out earlier this month that she was releasing her 3rd album, I was very excited. I went out and bought the Target edition yesterday and have listened to it three times since. And while 'Taylor Swift' and 'Fearless' are both remarkable, 'Speak Now' is clearly Taylor's best work so far. As many people here have already stated, her music has matured lyrically and vocally, and she is branching out and trying new sounds. For some artists this doesn't work out so well, but Taylor seems to have hit the nail on the head. I can't really see any of her hardcore fans not liking this stuff, and her new sound will surely bring in a new fanbase as well.<br /><br />All of the songs on this album stand out and are absolutely delightful. As with her previous two albums, I can't bear to skip over any songs. However, to save some time, I'll just point out a few songs that were definite highlights for me.<br /><br />1. Mine. The first single off of this album, I was listening to this song long before 'Speak Now' was released. After hearing the album in its entirety, Mine still continues to be one of my favorites. It's an uplifting and powerful about love gone right. And while this song sounds more like something off of 'Fearless', this certainly doesn't detract from its value. You can still sense and feel the maturity in Taylor, especially in the lyrics--they are well-written and catchy.<br /><br />2. Back to December. A song supposedly about Taylor Lautner, Back to December is a wistful and haunting song about Taylor letting go of someone she wished she didn't. It's essentially the first 'apology' song written by Taylor, and she pulls it off well. Her voice really shines in this one.<br /><br />3. Enchanted. This is by far my favorite song on this album. To me it's got everything: music that touches your soul, emotional, well-written lyrics from the heart (classic Taylor), and beautifully sung. This song really makes you feel like you're in a fairytale, and not in the fluffy, sugar-coated way that many songs on 'Fearless' and 'Taylor Swift' portray. Again, there is maturity and depth there that is more or less absent from her first two albums.<br /><br />4. Haunted. This song is the epitome of Taylor branching off into new territory and a new sound. A lot of people have compared this song to Evanescence; to me it sounds like a cross between Evanescence and Paramore. And while I'm not really a huge fan of either, this song works for me mainly because it is so different from anything else Taylor has done before. The music is more loud, dark and rock-like, while the lyrics and the vocals still contain Taylor's old charm. And the song definitely lives up to its name; the atmosphere and story behind the lyrics definitely leave you feeling alone, emotional, and haunted. In a way, I don't like this song because it brings back old memories of things I don't want to feel again. It's that powerful.<br /><br />The weakest track on the album may be 'Last Kiss.' It's just a little too slow and forgettable for me. However, by no means does that mean I skip over it when I listen to 'Speak Now'; I'm hoping that it will eventually grow on me.<br /><br />Update 10-28-10: It's only a day later since I wrote this, but already 'Last Kiss' is growing on me like I knew it would. :)<br /><br />All in all, 'Speak Now' is beautiful and simply outstanding. Taylor's maturity shows in her lyrics, topics and her vocals. While 'Fearless' and 'Taylor Swift' may leave doubt in your mind about Taylor's longevity, I think 'Speak Now's' diversity and the fact that Taylor is a driving force behind a lot of things on this album (She wrote all the songs by herself with no co-writers, and she even co-produced the album) proves that she's made a lasting impact on today's music industry and that she's here to stay for a long while.tanding.

0316069485|3.0|I have been reading Michael Connelly for over a decade and have been fortunate enough to have read his classic Harry Bosch series.<br /><br />I got his latest book The Reversal this week and must admit that I was sorely disappointed. I will confess to not enjoying courtroom dramas so that would be swaying my review a lot but I found this book to be quite weak.<br /><br />The story is that a man has been in jail for 24 years for the killing of a girl but now due to modern forensic methods, the main clue that he was the killer has been quashed. He is going to be released.<br /><br />Mickey Haller the defence attorney is approached to be the prosecutor of the new trial as they have decided to have a retrial. Supposedly the best person to help Mickey is his ex-wife Maggie and his cousin Harry Bosch. This point is something I find difficult to grasp and is one of the weaker plotlines as surely there were more experienced prosecutors than Haller. His ex-wife would be a good addition to the team but why would you be distracted by his ex being around you daily when there is an important trial taking place?<br /><br />This is the start of a series of events which I found implausible and not very interesting at all. I won't give any spoilers but I just found the book to be a bit long-winded and having too much of the courtroom drama that a John Grisham would be better suited for.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|In this third book of the Salander series, this deliciously interesting character is unfortunately subjugated to an excessive amount of pages detailing Swedish political intrigue. It's only at the end of the book that her character becomes more fully developed, but it's presented almost in a last minute of afterthought. All in all, this is a wonderful series with a fabulously intriguing character that has unfortunately been less than fully realized.

Let's see how many Avatar Burger King Toys and action figures are filling up landfills 1000 years from now. It's losers like this that make a crappy retold story and package/market it like nothing we've ever seen before and then make it seem like he did it to help humanity. Don't fall for this. Buy a Classic Sci-Fi Movie like Blade Runner...something with a truly original story and Idea. james Cameron Wishes he was Ridley Scott, but he doesn't even come close.

0316067938|1.0|This was weird and disappointing.  I hated Jacob's POV.  What is the author's objection to using Edward's POV?  Anyway, I felt like the characters were different from the previous books.  They seemed distant.  I was also disappointed when Bella became pregnant.  I couldn't get into this book.  I would go back to it at times, but finally just peeked at the end.  There could have been more sacrifice.  It was too sugary sweet, enough to make one sick.  I'm all for happy endings, but sometimes it can be overdone in a book.

B003WTE886|4.0|With third effort [[ASIN:B003WTE886 Speak Now]], Taylor Swift delivers an album that finds her further evolving her honest songwriting style and cultivating her artistry.  Given my past criticisms of Swift, I should probably have several songs on this album directed towards my criticism of her (would \\"Mean\\" be appropriate?).  Prior to purchasing and listening to Speak Now, I had predicted it would be an album that would pale in comparison to the Grammy-winning [[ASIN:B001EYGOEM Fearless]] by miles and would be less successful on pop radio.  However, Ms. Swift should probably pen one of her `honest' songs directed towards me for wrongfully pre-judging her third album, which is overall very strong and one of 2010's best.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Taylor Swift sound so fresh and writing songs that are much more mature than her nearly twenty-one years.  Sure, it does pale slightly in comparison to the more commercially-driven Fearless, but this album marks an artist truly \\"coming into her own\\" and taking her artistry `to the next level' and extending upon what she has already accomplished.  There are no misses on Speak Now, even when the `hits' outshine secondary cuts.<br /><br />The album opens with the superb \\"Mine,\\" which upon an initial listen when it was released as a promo single, I found to be ok, but not earth-shattering or Swift's best.  However, listening more intently, this is a fine cut with nice simple production work and grand songwriting.  The refrain (hook) may not be the catchiest of Swift's career - that's arguable \\"You Belong With Me\\" from 'Fearless' - but it solid and shows off here consummate songwriting chops: \\"do you remember we were sitting there by the water? you put your arm around me for the first time, you made a reel of a careless man's careful daughter, you are the best thing's that's ever been mine...\\"  Follow-up track \\"Sparks Fly\\" continues the wave of refreshing lyrics, with great lines such as \\"the way you move is like a full-on rainstorm/and I'm a house of cards...\\"  The refrain is superb as any, where Swifts urges her lover to \\"drop everything now/meet me in the pouring rain/kiss me on the sidewalk/take away all the pain/cause I see sparks fly...\\"  On the bridge in particularly, Swift sounds as if she has improved vocally, which is great.<br /><br />\\"Back to December\\" opts for a slower tempo, which is a nice contrast here.  Again, the songwriting never sags, making up for any improprieties that have had critics criticizing Swift (vocally).  This track is superb because it is `country-enough' for true country fans but `crossover-enough' to suit pop/rock fans.  \\"Speak Now,\\" the exceptional title track features nice, light production work (particularly on the verses) which allow every vocal nuance by Swift to shine.  What makes \\"Speak Now\\" stand out is its overall catchiness, solidified by another golden hook.  I personally love the line \\"I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace...\\"<br /><br />\\"Dear John\\" is a masterpiece, finding he disgruntled Swift pointing the finger at John Mayer.  Everything about the track is \\"programmed\\" to give this effect - the six-eight feel, the bluesy-laziness of the production, and the `organic' nature that is given off here.  The track is lengthy at 6:45, but it feels like Swift is on `autopilot' and the time passes by easily.  \\"Mean\\" is equally credible, though it contrasts the slower, more solemn nature of \\"Dear John\\" in favor of a faster cut that begins abruptly.  Here, Swift takes on the critics who have chastised her live performances by calling them, well, `mean': \\"Someday I'll be living in a big ole city/and all you're ever gonna be is mean/someday I'll be big enough so you can `t hit me.\\"  Swift is on a roll.<br /><br />\\"The Story of Us\\" and \\"Never Grow Up\\" are both great cuts, if less distinctive than the accusatory \\"Dear John\\" or \\"Mean.\\" \\"The Story Of Us\\" features more superb songwriting, with my favorite line being \\"I've neverheard silence quite this loud...\\"  \\"Never Give Up\\" is very beautiful with its low-key vibe (strummed acoustic guitars with no percussion), but it is a bit long.  \\"Enchanted\\" is another solid cut, though it also suffers from being a bit too long (nearly six minutes). As far as production work, the use of an eery synth pad adds to the tone of the track and again, the songwriting is great.  \\"Better than Revenge\\" is a better cut,  with Swift reigning herself in at 3:39 and delivering great one liners such as \\"She took him faster than you could say sabotage.\\"<br /><br />\\"Innocent\\" did not appeal to me upon hearing its premiere at the VMAs, but here in its studio incarnation, it is a standout.  The songwriting is focused and I have a new appreciation after hearing it on the album.  \\"Haunted\\" is solid, though not the highlight of Speak Now.  \\"Last Kiss,\\" another expansive, lengthy cut is one of the better extended cuts where Ms. Swift sounds incredibly genuine.  \\"Long Live\\" closes the album solidly, but is not `the cream of the crop' per say.<br /><br />Taylor, I apologize for being \\"mean\\" and pre-judging 'Speak Now.'  I have no doubt we can expect to see this album nominated for multiple Grammys when it is eligible to be nominated in 2011 for the 2012 Grammy ceremony.  I have no major reservations with this album save for it has moments where the songs and the album itself go too long.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|I'm amazed at a lot of the negative here. What were they expecting? Bergman? A romantic comedy? Everyone should know just by looking at the poster what this film is, to save themselves from looking like an idiot. Furthermore, even more baffling is how my local newspaper  gave this film one star out of five. But then again, they gave that \\"Funny Games\\" garbage a 4/5 rating, so... what do you expect?<br /><br />This film is THE one chance to see your favorite childhood action heroes on the big screen for a fun ol' time. Of course the story is cliche and stupid (overthrowing a South American dictator, which has been seen in HOW many movies?), but that's the point- just to be a ridiculous fun action movie with tonnes of violence and humour. As much as I liked Rambo IV, I feel it got a little too carried away in its anti-war message, so I was hoping Sly would give us a bit more of a fun outing this time, and he did not disappoint.<br /><br />Sly, Statham, Li, Crews, Lundgren and more all give great performances in this flick. We're not seeking anything De Niroesque in this film, but they do give good performances indeed. This film is the ultimate in action fun, and if you love a good ol' time, this is definitely a must see for sure.
B0040JHNZ2|3.0|This is not a review of the book, but of the Kindle version itself. The place, Ty Gwyn is mentioned many times. In each case the first word Ty appears to be a graphic rather than letters in a font. As such, every time it appears in the text there is a large gap between the line above and the line on which the word appears. This is very distracting while trying to read the book. In praising the Kindle, Amazon's CEO Mr Bezos said, \\"The key feature of a book is that it disappears\\". That is not true in this case.    Amazon's response:     \\"since the y with a ^ accent mark on top of it is not supported by the Kindle, the publisher has  inserted this character as an image. Because of this is it displays about twice as big as the rest of the text size.    Unfortunately, until the Kindle supports more accented characters, there is nothing to be done about this. Images don't change size when the font does, and leaving the image large means that readers who need larger font sizes are able to read the symbol.    I hope you'll accept is as device limitation. Thank you for your understanding.\\"

There's been no bigger band than the Stones over the past almost 50 years.  And Keith is the heart and soul of the Stones.

And this book fills you in.  Definitely a good read............

However, what makes it so incredibly unique and thought provoking is the way the story is told through the narrarator,Jack. I was so consumed by this book that after I had to put it down at night I would lie awake in bed and just think about what I had just read. This has not happened to me in a very long time. I highly recommend this novel to anyone. Emma Donoghue is an immensely talented author and I look forward to reading more of her work in the future.

There are so many derivations and differences between the anime and the movie that you most likely wont be able to stomach more than a half-hour of it. If you have no awareness of the anime the story WILL be confusing and many of the plot elements won't add up at all.   So this puts Dragonball Evolution between a rock and a hard place. It can't appeal to its fan base because it doesn't even try to match things up very well, which it technically doesn't ever intend to being a outspoken \\"evolution\\"(derivation) movie, and it can't appeal to newcomers because it simply wont make sense.    So does it have any appeal at all? It you are under 12 yes! Seriously this is a movie that a kid can really enjoy. Its PG rating has kept it almost completely free of language, blood, and innuendo and the action is steady throughout. Most kids (especially boys) will get a kick out of the ki-balls being shot around and the crazy choreography. Will it appeal to anyone else? If you can tap into the 12 year old inside, reduce your expectations of oscar winning performances and strict Dragonball cannon adherence, and just enjoy a silly, fun, action movie, than heck yes.       So, 2.5 stars for me. oh, and the fact that I grabbed it for 5 bucks from wally world didn't hurt either.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|A great show, and a season I am enjoying catching up on! Good price off amazon, was $10 more in the stores I looked at.
B0043X7WLA|2.0|I have just listened to The Age of Adz (pronounced `crappy songwriting').  All I can say is I can't believe that this is what you get after 5 years. This album is appalling. Have you ever listened to new music by an artist you have always liked and thought to yourself, \\"Wow. This sucks. They tried waaaay too hard\\" That is my reaction.    I firmly believe that anyone who says they honestly \\"love\\" this album is merely in love with their own solipsistic notions of Mr. Stevens. There is nothing wrong with electronic or experimental music. The problem is that there is no feeling in this new album when his previous material was full of feeling and all of the sounds here feel clumped together rather than working together. Something is very wrong. A burned out hipster from Austin could do this. At least I only paid $3.99 for it (though I still want it back).    \\"Futile Devices\\" and \\"Vesuvius\\" are about the only decent things about this album (and select fragments of \\"Impossible Soul\\"). Though, there is not one song that is fun to listen to. It feels like work to listen to these. Track 9 is titled \\"All for Myself\\". That seems to be a good description of how Mr. Stevens has written this self gratifying mix of sounds.  Towards the end of track 10, \\"I Want To Be Well\\", Mr. Stevens repeats over and over, \\"I'm not f***ing around.\\" Yes, you are, Mr. Stevens. Yes, you are.
0374158460|2.0|Jonathan Franzen's novels are not the kind I really like-I think he's overrated as a novelist. His characters are not likeable and have major flaws that are hard to overcome as a reader. I was happy that the book ended like it did but other than that not so great.
B001CNFZGI|5.0|Adding to my CD collection, for a group I love.  And music that takes me \\"lands away\\".    JRM
B0042OZDQG|4.0|There are some tracks that don't need to be here and should be replaced by much better tracks. Songs like \\"Clouds Race Across The Sky\\" and \\"Borg Sex\\", while they may be a couple of the better tracks off \\"Engines Of Creation\\", they aren't so much \\"Essential\\". Only, \\"Until We Say Goodbye\\" is a must off that disc. Same goes for \\"SMF\\" off the self titled disc, in which only \\"Cool #9\\" is a must. \\"Is There Love In Space\\" should have been replaced by \\"Searching\\", the most epic Satch tune ever. The inclusion of \\"A Robots Dream\\" is baffling as well. However for the most part, this is a solid collection for those new to Satch, which is almost unheard of.

031603438X|5.0|At last the man speaks.Archetypal rock star, contemporary outlaw and the world's most elegantly wasted man, Keith spills the beans in this blockbuster of a rock bio.<br />Keith recounts his life to the present day with brutal honesty, an amazing journey which over the course of nearly half a century transformed him from a no-hope deliquent teenager into an iconic rock god, and more latterly an rich old roue who nevertheless remains the idol of lesser rock heroes and wannabe bad boys. (Think Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.).<br />In between were the highs-- the hits, the adulation, the rock'n'roll lifestyle( which The Stones invented!) the chicks--and the lows--the drug busts, prison, the descent into oblivion, the death of too many friends, the loss of a child. Keith shares these moments with us in uncompromising detail.<br />The examination of his relationship with Mick Jagger is illuminating and sometimes suprising,and left me with the feeling that The Glimmer Twins should have been more than just a nickname for two men who sometimes seemed to understand each other so little.<br />Throughout it all Keith's wit and commonsense shines through, and I sometimes felt it difficult to reconcile the easy-going philosopher of the book with the Satanic Majesty whose jagged and sinister guitar riffs and breaks imbue songs such as \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" with such malevolent power.<br />I've been a fan since I was a very young teenager, and The Rolling Stones provided the soundtrack to most of my early adult life. I suppose you could say I'm a little biased but neverthless I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in an extraordinary life<br />One last thought.The very title is typical Keith Richard. Life. A splendid single-fingered rebuke to all those over the years who have marked him down as a rock'n'roll suicide-in-waiting.

0646497855|3.0|I found the book usefull, it seems clear with the information you need to practise. Althought I thought it had more pages and tests to practise with.  Marisa
1416589473|5.0|So I finished the book and was pleasantly surprised with the end. The book seemed to drag on at times, but moved VERY quickly toward the end. It helps tremendously to have played GW1, especially Eye of the North, to understand and visualize what the objects/characters are, although I'm sure if you're buying this book it is because you have played GW1.    As for connecting GW1 to GW2, this book is not necessary! You will not miss out on information occurring between the two games, although the lore may be referenced as an easter egg in GW2. If you wanted to know what happens in between, you could easily find the information on the wiki page or just googling. I know there are 2 more books coming out (3 total for series), but only 1 elder dragon was referenced (Crystal Dragon). Other than that, the vast majority of the book was simply completing their quest. Maybe more info will be held in the coming books, but more info is available now on the internet than in this book.    HOWEVER, do not hesitate to read this book!!! It is a GREAT read and will totally keep you hooked with all the GW references. There is a twist at the end that may make you upset, but it honestly makes for a great ending. Having played GW from day 1 (and even open beta months before!), I can truly say this was an enjoyable read. I haven't read for pleasure EVER and haven't completed a full book since I was in 4th grade (mind you I'm now a senior in college, no one ever fully reads the book in HS and college...) but knew I had to give this a try because of my passion for GW. I'm sure glad I did because I will definitely continue the entire series and hope for a TRUE connection between GW1 and GW2!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I couldn't hold off watching one episode a night.  When I finished downloading season 4, I had to sit through all 12 episodes.  Man is it good.  Keeps you wanting more and more.  Such a GREAT series.  I watched season one on Showtime when I had subscription, Season 2 on regular public channel, Season 3 here and there, Season 4 from Amazon, and now have a subscription again to Showtime just to watch season 5.  Can't wait till each Sunday.  It's just too far/long away.  It is a really good show.  I love Dexter.  My all time favorite series.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Updated 10/28/10.  After a couple of listens, boy does this one grow on you.  Wow.<br /><br />You heard it here first:<br /><br />1) Both \\"COUNTRY STRONG\\" and \\"ME & TENNESEE\\" will be nominated for Best Song when Oscar comes a callin' this year.<br /><br />2) Although Country Strong is beautiful, maybe SUPERB, Me and Tennesee is simply sublime, like no other song you've heard, different, beautiful, soaring, memorable, ONE FOR THE TIME CAPSULE.  The harmonies will just stay with you forever.  THIS SONG WILL WIN.<br /><br />3) The Oscar ceremony MUST include a live duet of Me and T, sung by these 2.  It will be SO POWERFUL, it will be one of the most memorable, electric Oscar performances ever.  So make it happen powers that be.  The people (person) have spoken.<br /><br />Now for my revised and updated original review (increases stars to the max for it really needs a couple listens to fully appreciate, added some more text):<br /><br />I must begin this review by stating that I am a huge fan of Tim Mcgraw, sort of a Faith Hill fan on ocassion, and importantly, a long-standing fan of the BEAUTIFUL, smooth-as-honey singing voice of the supremely talented Gwyneth Paltrow.  Having been BOWLED over by the totally unexpected GP vocal gifts exhibited in DUETS, (out of nowhere at the time), especially Cruisin' and Just My Imagination (both pop classics, those renditions)- I was on the edge of my seat for months anticipating Country Strong.  Then came the titular single last month. EXCELLENT - very strong and catchy.  Great song. Passed my marker which is me singing it constantly in the shower. So, I was first up at Best Buy last night.  Just imagining a duet with Tim McGraw!  Those 2 together! (BTW GP's voice, pure and crystal clear, has an inherent twang to it, PERFECTLY suited for country). Bought the CD last night.  It's a keeper, with some great, some sublime, one so-so track as follows:<br /><br />Track 1: \\"Country Strong\\", the title track, is a winner.  Correct to put that out as the initial single.  Pathos, emotion, strength, a super voice, individual, unique.  Beautiful. Future classic.  Every time the word \\"fragile\\" is uttered I get a little teary eyed.<br /><br />Track 2: \\"Love Don't Let Me Down\\", a cute little ditty from Chris Young and Patty Loveless.  Cute, took a few spins but now can't get it out of my head.<br /><br />Track 3: \\"A Little Bit Stronger\\" Sara Evans.  Lovely voice, powerful.  Great.  For anyone who has ever parted ways with a loved one (the whole human species).<br /><br />Track 4: \\"Chances Are\\".  Garrett Hedlund.  Nice. What an amazing voice.  An actor.  Unforgettable (and really sexy) deep smoky vocals.  Yum.<br /><br />Track 5: \\"Liars Lie\\". Lee Ann Womack.  very catchy, adorable lyrics, from the wonderful Lee Ann Womack.  Strong track. Stays with you.<br /><br />Track 6: \\"She's Actin' Single....\\", Ronnie Dunn.  I'd never heard of him.  Funny, memorable lyrics, great hooks, catchy song.<br /><br />Track 7: \\"Shake That Thing\\" - Gwyneth Paltrow.  My ONLY critique of this set.  She has an amazing voice, this song does not properly showcase her vocal talents in their studio production and arrangements.  Almost spoken, better suited to a less vocally strong singer, not her style.  Sorry.  Kinda trashy song.  I know the lyrics must tie in to the story - but  with all the talented people behind this, a better song could have been chosen.  Song written for a vocally weak singer.  It's almost a spoken timbre, IMHO way beneath Gwyneth's talent.  Note to producers:  YES GP can carry a tune by herself and does not need to be drowned out by studio sonics.  (Also a little on Coming Home but thats a a great song)<br /><br />Track 8:  \\"Thirsty\\". Hank williams, Jr.  A song about getting, um, our thirst quenched.  Not my cuppa tea but in it's endearing way, what country music is all about.<br /><br />Track 9: \\"Give in to Me\\" - Faith Hill.  Sultry, bluesy, sexy, moody song, sung to perfection by FH.  One of the 3 strongest songs, stands on it's own apart from this soundtrack.  As an amateur but well-versed music fan, this seems almost to have been produced separately from the rest.  It kind of stands out as not part of the rest of the album. All great this just stands apart.<br /><br />Track 10: \\"Timing is Everything\\" - Trace Atkins.  Cute song.  Nice strong voice this guy has.  Masterful, great lyrics sung by this beautiful voice.  Sad song kind of, poignant lyrics.<br /><br />Track 11: \\"Words I Couldn't Say\\" - Leighton Meester - Suprisigly clear voice. Nice.  Standard Pop-Country girl song, sort of Taylor Swiftish, - no, I've amended that to Miley-ish; Taylor is a ct above. But nicely done song. Surprisingly catchy and listenable.<br /><br />Track 12: \\"Coming Home\\".  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Slower, mid-tempo half-ballad (or should be, as written). Great Song. Beautiful, soaring, almost symphonic arrangement and vocals.  Teensy bit  too loud on the studio volume, GP gets drowned out at points, but it's such a great song anyway - you get past that and will hum this tune all day long, (especially the anthemic chorus), as I am right now.  Just a beautiful song, about that one place in all of us - HOME.<br /><br />Track 13: \\"Me and Tennessee\\"  Tim Mcgraw and Gwyneth Paltrow, (and Chris Martin?) So they say Chris is in here somewhere.  I can't hear him.  That's OK. (although would've been neat) GREAT SONG. WILL STAY AROUND FOREVER. LOVELY.  BEAUTIFUL BUT FUN duet sung by GP and TMcG both in unison (perfect harmony) and alternating verse.  SUBLIME as far as the singing and the song itself, an up-tempo done-each-other-wrong-but-in-a-happy-song way.  Very catchy.  Humming it all night tonite on train - getting stared at on subway  A KEEPER.  The strongest - should be a single - I think even better than the title track I've loved this past month - those 2 and the Faith Hill and really all of them make this one a classic.<br /><br />Fitting that the CD is bookended by the 2 of the strongest songs.<br /><br />The take home message:  For any type of country fan, for any Tim McGraw, Faith, Gwyneth, it's a MUST-BUY.  All around it's very entertaining.  It's just a super, super great soundtrack.  It is worth buying, and any music or country music listener would be missing out by not doing so.  It's really solid, my only gripe is that I love Gwyneth's singing voice so much, and she does not choose to record a whole lot of music, so ...maybe I wanted to hear a little less studio in the middle GP songs and just hear the singing and the words .....but that may be just me...  Gwyneth, you have a masterpiece ahead of you with your singing, that was shown in DUETS and INFAMOUS.  Please in future give us another opportunity to hear you sing.<br /><br />ps: perspective:  I'm a woman in her 30's, a life-long New Yorker, classic rock, pop, alt-rock (Coldplay!) and classical music (my hubby) are strong influences.have been produced separately from the rest.

I haven't laughed this hard since the \\"hangover\\"  The father daughter scenes are my favorite.  check it out and pass it on, we need more movies like this
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|Wow - what a disappointment! I bought this based on all of the positive reviews - I hate to be the pundit, but the film came across as a very amateur concoction both from the filming and dialog perspectives. It failed to garner our interest or attention. After 30 minutes of dribble we finally shut it off and watched a real movie. Not recommended.
030726999X|5.0|The final book in the series.  I couldn't wait for paperback to come out.  If you liked the others this one is sure to make you happy.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|This is a performance for which superlatives were created. Indeed my only criticism of the production are the penny plain sets for Act I and Act II; however, the singing is so splendid so moving, the dramatic commitment of the singers so compelling that such a criticism is beside the point.     I had seen the performance via my computer, certainly not the most ideal venue, but watch it I did and hoped for the early release of the DVD. Thank you Decca for not dragging your feet with this release. With every release Jonas Kaufmann validates his artistry and musicality (and voice). A tenor who sings softly! A tenor who cares for the text! I suppose the usual criticism of Kaufmann will be evoked, that he is a \\"bari-tenor\\", that he has no \\"squillo\\". He is now 40 or thereabouts and has spent much time in Zurich under the radar; he is incredibly gifted with languages (his spoken English is virtually uninflected, e.g., no German accent); I would hope that he would not contemplate a Tristan or Siegfried in the near or distant future, but on the basis of his Lohengrin I would love to hear a von Stolzing and a Tannhauser. Or even an Aeneas. I have enjoyed his forays into lieder on YouTube, making me regret my decision not to add to my CD collection--actually I no longer have it having disposed of it recently. I was thrilled by his Don Jose and I find this performance equally thrilling. One feels that he has internalized his character, that nothing he does is superficial or simply for an effect. This is true for the \\"big\\" moments but it is also true for everyhing that he does. The dvd is rife with closseups and they are telling both for him as well as this Charlotte, Sophie Koch. Indeed, she rises to great dramatic and vocal heights in the third act. Truly a major performance.    The performance is conducted by Michele Plasson; he is not a young man but he conducts with passion and artistry that can only come with years of living with this music. Along with the remainder of thecast I am unable to find a criticism, a complaint. Simply one of the finest performances to be memorialized in a fitting manner.    Now if Decca would only secure the rights to the Monnaie (sp) performance of Berlioz' Damnation with Kaufmann, Susan Graham and Jose Van Damm and give it a commercial release I could die a happy man. I do have a bootleg performance of it and find that it is far superior to the recent Met investiture.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I have absolutely adored Zep and Plant for so soo sooooo long! I hope he sings forever and we never tire of him. His voice hasn't burned out like so many other older rockers and sounds just as great as always, even if he isn't going to scream alot anymore. Buddy Miller is fantastic and makes you just want to turn up the volume. This album is a huge improvement over Raising Sand, which I felt was more of Alison Krauss than Robert Plant. He said during the awards that Krauss \\"had taught him to sing in a straight line\\", an obvious mistake for our hero in my opinion, I did not like the cd at all. Now, if I have any criticism for \\"Band of Joy\\" it would be that tracks 1 to 4 and track 8 are incredibly beautiful, I can't get enough and reaffirms my love of Plants music. Tracks 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 & 11 I am not so fond of and 12 is simply odd. I would like to see Mr. Plant return to the type of singing that I love him for. Angel Dance, House of Cards, Central two-O-Nine, Silver Rider & Monkey are well worth the price of the CD, and many may enjoy some of the others as well, so I recommend the album for the excellent tracks.
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor Swift suprised me by releasing a CD better than her previous two.  This CD is fabulous!!  There is not one song that I dislike! Love \\"Back to December\\" where is admitting her mistakes and how she treated the guy wrong (Taylor Lautner)...much different view point than she has done in other songs.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater on opening night.  I had never read the comic, and as it turned out I didn't need to.  I think a movie that is based on a book or graphic novel should stand on its own.  You shouldn't have to read the source material to be able to follow the plot of the movie.  Thankfully, this movie does stand on its own.  It is a good movie, and a mostly faithful comic book adaptation.  There are some problems I had with it, however.  It was a little too violent and sexy for my taste.  Some of this could have been toned down.  This movie is much more violent than the comic book.    I'll start with what I liked about the movie.  Nearly all the casting was excellent.  The two characters that would seem to be the hardest to capture on the screen are Rorshach and Doctor Manhattan.  The casting and the performances of these two characters were perfect.  Jackie Earle Haley is Rorschach in every way.  People complain about the raspy voice, but that's how I always imagined Rorschach's voice.  Billy Crudup is great as Doctor Manhattan.  Keanu Reeves was initially considered for the role, and I'm glad they didn't use him.  Doc Manhattan is supposed to be emotionless, not bland.  Crudup actually seems to be putting effort into his performance.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson are both fine, and Matthew Goode is pretty good, although I got a little tired of his silky voice.  The only real complaint that I had was Malin Akerman, who played Silk Spectre II.  She was very wooden and one-dimensional.  But she is my least favorite character in the book anyway, so I really didn't mind.  Some fans of the comic complained that they cut too much out.  The only they left out that I thought they needed was Ozymandias's backstory.  When I saw the movie, I thought he had super powers.  See, I just recently got around to reading the comic.  In the comic, it explains how Adrian traveled the world and learned everything.  It would have been cool to see the street vendor, who does appear at the end, right before New York is destroyed.  The thing is, the movie was already 2 ½ hours.  Other than the Ozymandias stuff, I was happy perfectly fine with everything they ended up cutting out.  I liked the ending, I thought it worked fine.  The squid is cut, obviously.  Some people have actually said they like this ending better than the ending of the comic.  I won't go that far, I will simply say I love both endings equally.    There were some things I did not like about this movie.  One problem was the action scenes.  The action scenes are spectacular, but they are not really supposed to be.  Every action scene from the book is blown up in this movie.  Reference, the fight scene in the jail.  In the book, there is one panel that shows Nite Owl and Silk Spectre each knocking out one guy.  In the movie, they take on about a dozen guys.  But they didn't make this an action movie, primarily, so it is not a huge problem.  I thought they made the movie a little too violent in some scenes.  Some examples are the part where Rorschach kills the pedofile, the mugging scene, or the part where one of the guys working for Big Figure inexplicably has a chain saw and he cuts...yeah.  I wish they hadn't felt the need to put the word F**k in almost every line of dialogue.  And that big sex scene in the ship did absolutely nothing to move the story line along.  This is a great adaptation, but the violence and language could have been toned down a little bit.
014241011X|3.0|A young boy and his spunky grandmother go on vacation and discover that all the witches in England are attending a convention at their hotel. Craziness ensues when the boy comes face to face with the real-life witches.    It's hard not to love Roald Dahl. He was one of my favorite authors growing up. He is witty and tells a fun story. The Witches is no exception. Dahl has a clever imagination and children love him because he is endears children and elderly people, who are often looked over members of society. The Witches is an amusing and fun read. It also contains a sweet story of love between grandson and his grandmother.    Roald Dahl may be pro-children and elderly, but he is somewhat anti-adult. Other than the grandmother, adults in The Witches are portrayed as evil, fat and stupid, ridiculous or dead. There are also some pretty graphic ideas presented- e.g. witches killing children by turning them into creatures and smashing them. I don't remember this greatly affecting me as a child, but I found it a little disturbing now.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|First, I applaud Putumayo for making a recording that exceeds 60 minutes.  \\"Yoga\\" is 71:32 minutes as identified on the back jacket.  I hope this sets a new trend for Putumayo, whose CDs average around 45 minutes.    \\"Yoga\\" is the best compilation of music intended for yoga that I have come across.  It certainly fulfills the function to aid breath with movement.  The repetitive sound (mantra/kirtan chants) is also conducive for meditation.  Unlike other compilations which are a fusion of new age-easy listening-lounge music; this collection retains its purpose of devotional music, creating an ambience that can be appreciated by the practioner.     The musicians are superb.  To Putumayo's credit, they list the albums from which the selections were taken......I will certainly order a couple of those listed.     I spend 20 minutes each morning on my yoga practice and find tracks 1-4, 5-10 and 11-14 are sufficient time for each session.  These tracks are also appropriate for start-up of slower stretching movements.
031603438X|5.0|While Keith's claim that he remembers it ALL may be stretching things a bit, the fact is that he remembers an amazingly diverse amount of information. A special feature of the book? The memories of Tom Waits, Patti Hansen (Keith's wife) and others who have known him through the years. Their insights help give perspective to the book.<br /><br />Along with plenty of details about the various rifts between Richards and (Mick) Jagger, there are odd little bit of info as well as quirky and fun additions- a recipe for sausages and mashed potatoes, lists of books, and authors that Richard likes. He is a voracious reader and has a massive library.<br /><br />In this autobiography, Richards clearly picks what he feels is worth including, leading to some baffling omissions. Chuck Berry is clearly revered by Richards and mentioned regularly, along with plenty of others who have remained his friends or influenced him musically.He also includes recollections of women who have been involved with him (and/or with Mick Jagger) - but Richards also writes very little about Jerry Hall, a woman who had a long-term relationship with Jagger. It is as though she barely existed although I've seen clips of The Rolling Stones in various documentaries and she was clearly on the scene. On the other hand, Marianne Faithful and Patti Hansen get plenty of page time.<br /><br />For those who want the scoop on police altercations and drug busts, admissions of massive drug use, info about Keith's use of heroin and how he quit using this very addictive drug, the truth about his relatively recent accident and brain injury...it is all here. Tour info, song inspirations, plenty of musical trivia...also included. At over 500 pages, this may seem lengthy to some readers but I found it well worth the time. After all, just think of the incredibly long career of The Rolling Stones! It is hard to imagine a short volume which includes information about Keith's involvement with the group as well as his private life.<br /><br />While I'd recommend reading this in chronological order, each chapter contains a brief summary of events covered in that chapter, allowing readers to pick and choose among chapters, if desired.recommend reading this in chronological order, each chapter contains a brief summary of events covered in that chapter, allowing readers to pick and choose among chapters, if desired.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I also do not approve of giving a great author a bad review just because the publisher is striking out against kindle owners, but on the other hand there doesn't seem to be a more effective form of protest at the present.  I loved all the books I have read from Follett, but I guess within a year I will find a copy of this at Goodwill for $2.50.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|Sadly, I have to agree with some other folk on this -- way too expensive. I've got the Quadrilogy on DVD already, and I was THRILLED to pick it up don't get me wrong. But I'd like to see them do something similar to an offer that Disney made for their DVD-to-BluRay customers: get some money back with proof of purchase via a manufacturer coupon. I don't want to pay for copy protection and other 'features' that have no benefits to me as a paying customer. Don't try and play that game with me, and don't tell me you couldn't somehow just negotiate the same fees for the staff and stars you did for the previous boxset. Come on guys, the lower the price, the more you sell. It's a simple equation.

6305558167|4.0|Although this movie can be slow, it is very entertaining to watch. I can't believe that the man behind Zardos (a great smelly stinker) was also behind this piece of magic. The movie is a little dated, but it's very heroic and fanciful as well. If you have three hours to kill, give it a whirl.
B003L77GH4|4.0|I wonder how one can review a show that is not yet in completion but on Amazon apparently one can. So far the show has manage to avoid the sophomore jinks and it still holding good. I do not know if the writers are seasoned or if it is because most of the ensemble is so talented but I have yet to be disappointed. Even though considerable changes have been made in regards to the books; the writers seem to know that these changes have been a benefit not a hinder like Allan Ball created with True Blood.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I will be honest, I had really low hopes for this show. I remember the general theme books, having read them almost two decades ago, but thought nothing of the show because I am an adult and they were teen. There are far too many vampire themed sagas out right night; seeming to cater to every age bracket. I thought how could a show about teenage vampires, on the CW no less, be any good; I was wrong. I rented the first season form Netflix and really enjoyed it. It was fast-paced and I liked how the characters maintain all the traits from the novels even though most do not physically match. I do not mind that some main characters were not introduce or that others have changed genders because the writers have done a wonderful job of making it work. In fact while you know that the main characters are teens; they do not act the way that movies and the CW generally portrays them. The lore is very well placed and there is just enough violence to let you know these are real vampires/supernaturals. I found myself amazed that a network show could actually be better than a premium one. (cough...True Blood)
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I purchased my PX21 headsets a few months ago after researching for hours on the best investment. After only a few days/weeks of owning my headsets, I made a stupid mistake and somehow broke off the shirt clip on the back of the amplifier. I recently contacted Turtle Beach about warrantying the broken piece. They responded quickly and assured me that it wouldn't be a problem to replace the broken piece. I only had to pay for the shipping TO THEM. From the time they received the package to the time they sent it back, less than 2 days had passed. I tracked the package daily until I finally got my headsets back. To my surprise, when I opened the package, sitting in the box was a brand new pair of headsets! Like I mentioned earlier..I was only expecting the broken piece to be repaired and sent back but they took it to the next level by sending me a completely new headset! Customer satisfaction to the MAX! Keep up the great work guys! I'm recommending Turtle Beach to all my friends!

B0044XV3QY|1.0|Simply dumb! Yet again another version not in 3D.  Next to come basic 3D version to be followed by the Special Edition 3D. Then an anniversary edition at some point with things they could put on the disc now.  If you plan to get a 3D set up don't waste your time on this.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I love this show!! I am planning on owning the entire series on DVD. I love the way the characters play off one another. If you enjoy comedies and enjoy laughing then this is the TV show for you. I highly recommend it!!!!!
B000002572|5.0|This album is a great selection. All of the songs are at least noteworthy, but everyone knows the hits from Boston's debut. \\"More Than a Feeling\\" is a good song because of the instruments; I just don't like it being a movie trailer's soundtrack because then it's too popular. \\"Peace of Mind\\" influence logical resistence to competition. \\"Foreplay/long time\\" starts off with a lot of drums, is the longest song on the CD at about 8 minutes long, and is about determination. \\"Rock & Roll Band\\" is about how Boston became successful. \\"Hitch a Ride\\" is the more peaceful of all tracks on the CD; it evokes a dreamy state of mind. \\"Something About You\\" opposes loneliness. \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" starts off slow and then gets faster. It's necessary to have this album, so you better get it; no wasting time.
031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards is in danger of becoming respectable, what with starring interviews on the Andrew Marr show, bit parts in Disney's \\"the Pirates of Caribbean\\" and an emerging status as national treasure. He has even received the ultimate accolade this week namely a vicious attack from the increasingly insane ex Trot and current bigot Peter Hitchens who blamed him for causing more damage than the Iraq War and described him as \\"a debauched, capering streak of living gristle who ought to be exhibited as a warning to the young of what drugs can do to you\\". As usual Hitchens couldn't be more wrong since after reading \\"Life\\" a electrifying autobiography ghost written with James Fox someone ought to work out the physiology of Richards since the man is clearly indestructible despite the most astounding chemical intake and even more remarkable he appears to going as strong as ever. The life of this man who founded the Rolling Stones, invented rock guitar, gave us \\"Honky Tonk Women\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\", the seminal \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and a host of other treasures is something we should warmly celebrate and not carp about.<br /><br />Great rock autobiographies are a rare species but this book by Richards amounting 547 pages ranging from a drug bust in Fordyce, Arkansas to a quick final explanation that he did indeed snort his Dad's ashes (but in a very affectionate way!) and ending the death of his dear old mum Doris is a very intimate, revealing, warts an all account of a fascinating life packed with brilliant photographs and stories to spare. Fox has captured his subject well and you can hear Richards voice loud and clear with its colourful language of \\"cats\\", his love of Shepherd's pie (\\"don't bust the crust\\") and roguish charm. You will not be surprised that a large part of the book deals with Richards copious pharmaceutical use. Indeed with parts of his memory wiped out sections of the text are given over to the first hand remembrances of family members and friends like Waddy Watchel, Don Was and his great mate Bobby Keys which are often very harrowing. The legendary Freddie Sessler \\"Keith's second dad\\" is a key figure here. This is a man who described himself as \\"the worlds oldest groupie\\", got Keith out of \\"scrapes\\" and supplied his drugs including pharmaceutical cocaine graphically described in a passage on page 373. Richards knows that he was lucky to survive all this hedonism and the poignancy of his remarks when he tells us stories about the deaths of fellow travellers like Billy Preston and Gram Parsons are all the more pronounced and sad for it. The fact that his co-conspirator Ronnie Wood navigated this madness particularly with a his own \\"freebasing\\" crack cocaine indulgences which Richards highlights from 1980 onwards is another example of the \\"get out of jail\\" philosophy of life employed by the two most colourful members of the Stones.<br /><br />At the core of the book is the Jagger/Richards relationship which has gone through phases of almost tender brotherly love to intense visceral hatred (listen to \\"Had it with you\\" on Dirty Work which charts the nadir of this phase). The cleaned up Richards circa 1980s \\"Emotional Rescue\\" cannot today forgive Jagger's attitude on \\"his return\\" who had \\"fallen in love with power\\" and whose constant put downs of him are still very raw. As he states \\"the phrase which rings in my ears all these years later is \\"Oh, shut up Keith\\". Things gradually improved over the years and despite Jagger's Knighthood (\\"the Mick I grew up was a guy who'd say shove your little honours up your ar*e\\") by 2004 Richards and Jagger were working a closely as ever and he accepts \\"you've got to go through the bulls**t; its like a marriage\\"<br /><br />The book charts all the great Richards myths, the blood changing, the skull ring, the tax exile in France, the falling out of the tree incident and the Toronto drug bust in huge detail which finally led to him giving up heroin. The part however which I especially enjoyed was his early years around Dartford and Sidcup and his passion for the blues particularly Jack Elliot and the impact of Elvis. The generosity throughout to the great Charlie Watts who clearly is the glue that holds the Stones together, and a great loss to the United Nations Peace Keeping Corps, is genuine and full of love. Watts survival from cancer is emotionally charted by Richards and his relief tangible that Watts came back. And then there is the music not just with the Stones but Keith's side projects like the X-pensive Wino's which is a tale well told; while his relationship with Anita Pallenberg and its impact on the construction of the Stones greatest song \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is fascinatingly unveiled.<br /><br />The life of Keith Richards is a chronicle of the ultimate rock survivor and icon. Frankly he should not be here and the fact that he never sleeps means he has been here \\"longer\\" than the average 66 year old. Despite yourself you can't help but be absorbed by the myth and legend of the man, his bluntness and his often outspoken nonsense. Let us be frank anyone who calls his dog \\"Syphilis\\" must have something going for him. Consequently when in a hundred years time someone sits down and writes the definitive history of rock music it should start with the sentence that \\"In the beginning was the riff and the riff was with Keith\\".around Dartford and Sidcup and his passion for the blues particularly Jack Elliot and the impact of Elvis.

B00288KNJU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much the first time I saw it that I decided to add it to my Blu-ray library.  This director's movies tend to be dark a more than a little strange (see \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\") --- just the sort of theme I enjoy.  I ordered the two-disk set and it came packaged just as pictured, and included four pairs of 3D \\"glasses\\".  The real surprise for me was that the 3D worked!  It uses the old technology of colored glasses, and the effect certainly isn't perfect, but I tried the movie on both my HD computer monitor and LCD TV and the 3D genuinely worked.  As long as you're not expecting Avatar in 3D at an Imax theater I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B003YWUTKM|1.0|Major pazzzz.  With four z's... I expected at the very least for both sides to differ in some way since one side is called metallic and the other is called spheres, but they both sound exactly the same, and I  hate to say it but the guitar did not work.  David Gilmour sounded too Gilmour-esque, and tended to not mesh with the ambience, and neither aspect were very good.  There was no decent manipulation of channels, there was no journey, no inspiration, in fact it was really bad, in fact I sold it back to Amazon  a few days later.<br /><br />David Gilmour has shined on his own in the deep far past, but both bands prove they have what it takes to be tedious with this effort.  Nothing inspires here, nothing moves or stirs the soul, mediocre effort, and an embarrassment.<br /><br />I would say forget this album and go pick up some Shpongle and Tabla Beat Science and some Mike Seeba, but just about anything would be better than this, even white noise.<br /><br />Pink Floyd is like a perfectly mixed drink. Roger Waters is the alcohol and David Gilmour is the club soda... they work beautifully together, but while solo Waters can be slammed, club soda isn't going to taste good by itself and we're seeing that now with Gilmour's latest album with The Orb \\"Metallic Spheres\\".
B0015AARJI|5.0|I have owned Sony gaming consoles since PS1 and it is good to see a company stick true to a design.

B0048IMZMG|5.0|In Taylors third studio album, she seems determined to continue to blur the lines between pop, country and rock. She also pushes her   immense vocal talent to previously un-reached levels of passion. Since each song is so unique, I'll go through them individually.      \\"Mine\\"- The first single off of this album has already seen massive amounts of radio play, and although it's still great, it's one of the   least interesting songs on the album. Telling the story of a girl who's parents divorced, it explores her feelings for her boyfriend, but   with constant fear that their relationship will end like her parents. It ends with her boyfriend telling her that he loves her just as   much as she loves him, and they he'll never leave her. While a charming song, it doesn't have much of a \\"new\\" feel to it, as it would've    fit just as well into her \\"Fearless\\" album.      \\"Sparks Fly\\"- Reminiscent of her previous song \\"The Way I Loved You\\" it deals with a roller-coaster relationship where both parties realize   that it's somewhat dysfunctional but their passion for each other is too great for them to stop being together. It is also the first song   with a taste of Taylors increased maturity and her inclusion of sexuality into her songs. It drops her previous fairy-tale-esque portrayal of   relationships in favor of a more adult and passionate romance.      \\"Back to December\\"- Rumored to be about her short-lived romance with Taylor Lautner, it is a regretful song apologizing for how she behaved at the   end of their relationship. She says she'd go back in time to change it if she could, and hopes that he can forgive her. Probably my least favorite   song on the album, it's pretty repetitive and not exceptionally interesting lyrically, it's one of those songs that you feel like you've heard before.      \\"Speak Now\\"- This song breaks the albums trend of being grounded in reality, it's essentially a musical take the classic wedding interruption   seen in movies like \\"While You Were Sleeping\\". Taylor sings about hiding in a wedding and then coming out at the last second to tell the groom   that the bride is the wrong girl, and he shouldn't marry her.Not the best song on the album, but it's certainly competent.      \\"Dear John\\"- Seemingly doing a complete 360 from \\"Back to December\\" this song appears to be about John Mayer, but instead of apologizing to him   she accuses him of taking advantage of her youthful naivete. The chorus to this song is hauntingly beautiful, and really shows some of her   \\"new\\" voice that she uses on this album, hitting much richer highs than her lighter tones from previous albums. It's actually quite a bit like   Miley Cyrus's voice, albeit with much more lyrical polish.      \\"Mean\\"- Probably Taylors most spiteful song to date, it carries itself with an air of cocky nonchalance. Where it really shines it's   ability to put to music, a theme that everyone has had at sometime in their life. In the lyric \\"Someday I'll be living in a big old city,    and all you're ever gonna be is mean\\" it sums up the feeling of moral superiority we all feel over someone who is being a jerk. It really comes    from the heart, which is where Taylor shines.      \\"The Story Of Us\\"- Starting off with a catchy guitar riff, this song is also a great example of her newer style of singing. Telling the   story of two people who fight, but then proceed to ignore each other rather than work out their problems. \\"This is looking like a contest,   of who can act like they care less, but I liked it better when you were on my side\\" It should really hit home with her teenage crowd, and is   a really well executed song.      \\"Never Grow Up\\"- It starts off seemingly from the perspective of a child's mother, who sings about how she wishes her kid wouldn't grow up   and be hurt by the troubles of adult life. About halfway through the song it switches to the perspective of the child who is feeling lonely   in her apartment in the city, wishing she'd nevergrown up. A really sweet song similar to \\"The Best Day\\" from Fearless.      \\"Enchanted\\"- Not very complicated lyrically, but has a really nice instrumental accompaniment. A showcase for her ability to do haunting, slow songs   so sweet they border on lullaby.       \\"Better Than Revenge\\"- One of the most interesting songs on the album, it has a harder rock feel than anything else she's made. If you didn't know   it was Taylor, you could easily confuse it for Avril Lavigne, and it has a very similar theme to her friend Hayley Williams' song \\"Misery Business\\".   It also has pretty risque lyrics for the typically angelic singer, such as \\"She's not a saint and she's not what you think. She's an actress, whoa,she's better known for the things that she does   on the mattress, whoa.\\" It's nice to see her branching out into other genres, and succeeding.       \\"Innocent\\"- This song came off as fairly pathetic at the VMA's, sort of patronizing Kanye West for what amounted to fairly small incident. Even f you ignore the background to it, it's   not one of her best pieces. Really the only \\"skip\\" song I have on this album.      \\"Haunted\\"- An interesting song, the title and intro to it seem to be on the album mostly to coincide with the nearly-Halloween release date. It's got a lot of electric guitar,   and is sort of Taylors take on a rock power ballad, it stumbles lyrically a few times, but it's a cool song nonetheless.      \\"Last Kiss\\"- I really wish this was the last song on the album, instead of \\"Long Live\\" since it's both a much better song, and gives a much better sense of completion. Similar to \\"Enchanted\\" and her older   \\"Come In With The Rain\\" it's basically Taylor doing what she does best. Slow, crooning, and lyrically beautiful it's one of my favorite songs from her, period.      \\"Long Live\\"- This song seemed kind of weird to me, it seems to be almost like a rapper calling out members of his \\"crew\\" and talking about how they've conquered the \\"the game\\". I came to theconclusion that it's about her struggle to become famous, and how she'll be rembered. The most religious song I've heard her sing, it mentions \\"the kingdom's lights shining just for me and you\\"   it's sort of interesting, but like I said earlier, \\"Last Kiss\\" would've felt better as an ending to me.      Overall, if you're a Taylor Swift fan, you've probably already bought this and you'll like everything on it. If not, buy a few of the singles and let it soak in. If you really like them, buy up the rest of her albums and you won't be dissapointed!
B001HN6940|3.0|I read in an interview that Tim Burton was not pleased with the original Alice in Wonderland book as he never felt a connection with the characters. So with this movie he sets out a clever reimagining of the classic. Alice is shown as a complete opposite of the expectations of women of that period. The book is familiar to most of us however the retelling is what drew me to this movie. Tim Burton does not disappoint in bringing the book to life with vivid scenery and colorful landscapes with colors out of this world with the help of amazing makeup and costumes. I enjoyed this movie for these features and gave it three stars. 10/16/10
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'd love to read Fall of Giants, but will ABSOLUTELY wait until the Kindle price falls.  How ridiculous to charge more on the Kindle version than the hardcover?  I'm all for supporting writers, but $19.99 is CRAZY!
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I was recently introduced to Band of Horses by a friend via this album.  On first listen I was drawn in by the harmonies and the unique voice of Ben Bridwell.  I love the diversity of the songs on \\"Infinite Arms\\".  The changes in tempo, instruments, and lead and backing vocals makes for an interesting listen from front to back.  I highly recommend this album for everyone.  I believe Band of Horses to be in the top three best bands of the last ten years.  Be sure and check out their other two offerings as well.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Greys Anatomy is one of the best shows.  They keep you entertained.  I find it relaxing to watch and rewatch each episode!  Amazon has the best price and quick shipping!
B0000041TD|5.0|Surely the most beautiful vocal music ever recorded.  Pavarotti knew this was his good luck opera, and no one has ever sung it better.  And no one has ever paired with him better than Mirelle Freni== try to think of another soprano who could be heard while singing with that big bear.  She is strong and subtle, with great classic Italian diction and a sense of humor.  She and Pavarotti had the same wet nurse and she said \\"Guess who got all the milk?\\"  Be sure your item has the libretto with it.  It has the full text in Italian, English, French and German so you can find out what a gelida manina is.
044654759X|3.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks but there have been a few books that I found not to my liking and this is one of them, may even top the list.  The Characters did not dance or walk across the pages for me as in most of his previous books and it took some time to read this book as I preferred to do anything else than to read over and over about one of the characters drinking vodka throwing up, and having headaches, just saying was ill with a hangover would have worked for me.      Domestic violence comes in many masks and knowing the signs and what to do and how to help/support is important and just might make the difference in life and death for a person or family.  I think Nicholas Sparks has the right idea the public should be educated and this is a subject that will never be addressed enough.  Education could save someone close to you.    The redeeming part of this book was the ending; it had a nice little twist to it.    I will give it 3 stars because it is Nicholas Sparks and as I said he normally writes a beautiful love stories. I do have all of his books and the dvd's of the movies, and look forward to his newest book \\"The Best if Me\\" that will be out in October 2011.

031603438X|2.0|In essence, the story is there to write but come on Keith! (or Mr. Fox) you guys  miss it....the devil is in the detail and there is NO DETAIL; there is skimming of some events and rumors (Altamont, transfusions, Brian Jones, Ron woods alcohol dependency). But what about everything else?     I dont buy it...there is much more to say and I found the books about the 1972 tour/exile era to be much more honest, informative and frankly more readable. Sorry Keith, I love you and the Stones for what you did represent, for what you have gone through but this book is a let down.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|This is an opinion of the Blu-ray release ONLY. I feel that there are already enough \\"reviews\\" of the film itself without adding my two-cents.    The BD of CREEPSHOW looks excellent to me, especially when I compare it to my DVD version. The images are crisp and the colors are bold. The 2-channel soundtrack in Dolby-TRUE is clean and clear for the presentation. When I added Dolby Pro-Logic II to the mix, I didn't necessarily miss not having 5.1 surround sound.    I agree with others that they should've added some extra features to this BD but considering that I only paid $7.50 for it, I can't complain really. If you can get this BD title at a low price, you'll be happy with it.
B000683VI4|4.0|A lot of friends recommended that I watch this movie.  I've rented it a few times and then returned it never getting around to slipping in the DVD before it was due back.  I finally watched it on Amazon Video on Demand on my computer (nice way to do movies by the way).<br /><br />Anyway, I knew it was about an elderly couple and their memories of the past.  However, I didn't know the twist that the wife had dementia.<br /><br />I found the story familiar and predictable - one that has been told quite a few times in various ways in romance(even I'm guilty of that) - the rich boy/girl falls in love with poor lower class boy/girl causing obstacles.  Those scenes were definitely predictable, however, what kept them on the cutting edge of interesting was the heartbreaking tale of a man who still loved a woman so desperately that he would do anything to help her remember their love.  Do men really love like that?  (Sorry, had to throw that in there.)<br /><br />Not a five-star Hollywood Oscar winner, but an interesting few minutes of watching a story of two people in love.

B001O54NKS|5.0|I recall putting a quarter in the jukebox, and playing \\"In My Dreams\\" from this album.  Sometime in 1985.  Hard to believe it was that long ago.  I had little money, but joined the Columbia House 10 albums, or cassettes, for 1 cent promotion and this one was one of those cassettes.  I was a teenager, and music was my escape from teen issues.  I listened to this album over and over again.  Unchain The Night, Hunter, Don't Lie to Me, and In My Dreams are my favorite Dokken songs of all; they got me into metal music for life.  Now I'm in my late 30's, and those songs still are worthy of my Ipod.  They will never die, along with my youth within.    George Lynch is superb here, and the next album, Back for the Attack, was more heavy songs, and a begining of sound change for Dokken.  This album seemed to give it's audience a versatile look at the band.  I recommend Back for the Attack too.  Excellent.  This record is worth every penny. A+

B0000DEO90|5.0|Wings over America is one of the few albums I bought in the 70s that I still get a thrill just thinking about listening to. Of course I now have the CD as well, and unlike some reviewers, I enjoy the CD sound just as much as the LPs. This live album delivers in an explosion of sound and a well laid out course of music that will satisfy all your desires.<br /><br />It starts out with a hard rock sound with Venus and Mars Rock show and the invigorating Jets. Later the album moves into sentimental ballads like Black Bird, I've Just Seen a Face, and the mega-famous Long and Winding Road. There are folksy selections such as Yesterday and Richard Cory. There is a look into McCartney and Wings future with Silly Love Songs, Let 'em In, and Maybe I'm Amazed. Then we get some more straight rock with Band on the Run, Hi Hi Hi and Soily to finish things off. Wings Over America is an emotional and musical roller coaster ... the kind that when the ride ends, you want to line up and go right back around.

0802136834|3.0|On the one hand I have to agree with those readers who likened this book to a historical text book.  On the other hand I also agree with the opinions of those readers who enjoyed the obviously extensive research and detail.  My biggest complaint overall is the author's constant jumping back and forth in the timeline.  One minute she's writing about Anne Boleyn and something happening in 1535, the next she's going back to something that happened previously in 1532, then jumps around again and then goes on to a pre-description of Jane Seymour's family while still in the Anne Boleyn section with Anne still well alive!!  I find the jumping around to be confusing and distracting.  By way of a brief digression, I grew up near Hever Castle and it has always been one of my favourite haunts.

B00009P1MP|5.0|While the tune American Pie is one of the most renowned, and deservedly so, the song from this album for me is \\"Vincent\\".  Quite simply, it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  It tells the sad story about Vincent Van Gough, the brilliant, but often misunderstood artist who struggled with his own insanity. The lyrics are exquisite...and weave the listener through this sad tale, but ever so beautifully.  A very poignant song, it's the one that's stuck with me all these years...and another that gets to me, each and every time.

B003KWLNKQ|5.0|I'm a fan of Nick Hornby's work and I was taken in by the paperback's prominent People-provided blurb that states \\"there a touch of Nick Hornby in this winning tale.\\"  Having concluded this very enjoyable book, I agree with that assessment.  Hornby's talent (at least in his first three books) was his eerie ability to get inside the head of man-as-still-adolescent.  Jonathan Tropper does the same thing here.  Having experienced the sudden death of his beloved, eleven-years-older wife, Tropper's protagonist Doug Parker is left in the grief-stricken position of being a twenty-something widower.  Not only is he unsure how to handle it, others in his circle are as well.<br /><br />The book picks up one year after Doug's wife's death.  Doug remains mired in his grief.  Family members are trying - one way or another - to get him to move along.  The next few months of Doug's life - the focus of this book - prove to be very messy indeed.  The book is equal parts grief and comedy.<br /><br />I'm surprised that 'Widower' hasn't been made into a movie.  At many points in the novel, it reads more like a screenplay.  I have to think Tropper wrote the book with a screenplay in mind.  Most notably, I imagine every teenage actor in Hollywood itching to play Doug's 16-year-old stepson, Russ.  Of note, is the scene where Russ (gaining courage from some furtively imbibed drinks) lays his heart on the line for Doug's younger sister, Debbie.  It's a page-long toast that Russ gives at a wedding rehearsal dinner.  It'll be the knockout highlight of the film adaptation.<br /><br />I did do some scratching around and found out via IMDB that there's a related film project 'in development' with a 2011 target date called \\"After Hailey.\\"  I won't count my chickens here though: Tropper signed this deal in 2006 and Scott Frank ([[ASIN:B0035WTJFW Minority Report [Blu-ray]]]) mentions it as his 'next project' in a 2009 article.

B000002R48|5.0|I love this band but never heard their first album until I found it here.  The material is different than what they have gone on to do but it is very good none the less.  I can't believe I missed this album when it came out but I am glad I went back and got it all these years later.
B0042FZWC0|3.0|Overall, I really did enjoy this book. Chris provides encouragement and I do like his 'breaking the rules' philosophy (hence the book's title). However there always seems to be this underlying theme that travel, mission work, and writing are the only ways to experience life. Like some of the other reviewers, I thought the author's tone was condescending because he has made the choice to travel the world and do mission work versus buying a house that is only going to accumulate 'stuff.'     This is a good book, but I'd also suggest reading Dan Miller's books. Dan's approach to creating a more meaningful life (through your work) is a bit more flexible and not as one sided.
1402210086|5.0|I always love when I find a wonderful Author, I had never before read! Georgette Heyer, does a beautiful job in this work of hers, Cotillion. Kitty is a young woman, adopted by an eccentric, and ornery man who decided to leave her his fortune, but she must choose a husband from his great nephews. Thus begins a journey full of humor, deception, mis-understanding, and romance akin to a work of Jane Austen. Written beautifully, rich with imagery, and tantalizing with snippets of mystery, I could hardly put this down!
B003E48AYC|5.0|I already knew I loved the movie so getting it for such a good deal was really great!!!
B00003CXIP|3.0|\\"Stand By Me,\\" sometimes confused with \\"Lean On Me,\\" is both a coming of age and nostalgia story. The main characters are 12-year-old boys, but it is rated R so many parents might not want to watch it with their 12-year-old kids.<br /><br />As a coming of age story, it's pretty rough - the school of hard knocks - and I don't say this because of the dead body. All of the adults are seriously dysfunctional, all of the kids are either abused or neglected. Among the four boys, only Gordie and Chris have a solid friendship. Gordie, a thoughtful and understandably insecure boy, is believable, but Chris is too knowing, wise, and supportive for a kid, so at times it seems he is Gordie's adult mentor more than his kid friend. Any kid would benefit from a friend like Chris (indeed, any adult would benefit from a friend like Chris!). I point this out because when I watch a coming of age story, I expect to see kids coming of age rather than acting like wise adults facing tough challenges. I can cheer for kids who act like wise, brave, and strong adults, but I can't quite believe it. Chris and Gordie's superstar brother (John Cusack) seemed a bit too supportive of Gordie's writing to be believable; it's more likely they would have teased him about it. Sure, it made me feel all warm and fuzzy to see that kind of support, but it was overdone and got sappy.<br /><br />It's a movie, so I know that a lot has to happen to keep things interesting. But as a story, it seems a little much. In the space of a couple of days, the boys run into the local gang of violent hoodlums, an attack dog, a train, and a dead body. If such exciting things happened to the average kid, there'd be a lot of great stories to tell. I guess dysfunctional parents and bad childhoods have their benefits, while good, safe childhoods are boring by comparison. :-) Conveniently enough for the story, the feud between the boys and the violent gang is left unresolved. When the leader of the gang told the boys that he would \\"get them,\\" I had no doubt that he would. But somehow he didn't, and I have no idea why.<br /><br />The nostalgia in the film is a mixed bag. The 50's look and feel seem genuine enough, but as I said, all of the adult characters are dysfunctional or abusive, at a time when the victims of such misfortunes were pretty much left to their own devices, which doesn't exactly make me feel nostalgic for the times. I can always feel nostalgic for a true and wise friend like Chris, or a supportive sibling like Gordie's older brother. Those are the kind of people anyone would want to stand by them, in good times or bad.\\" I had no doubt that he would. But somehow he didn't, and I have no idea why.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these originally for practicing bass guitar with a headphone amp; a use that'll push any set of cans to the limit. They work ok for that purpose, but honestly no set of headphones is going to replace a pair of 15\\" speakers for bass response. They're good when I want to practice quietly (emphasis quietly, too much volume and they'll cut to fuzz).<br /><br />I *love* these phones for just about everything else...listening to music, watching movies, playing video games, etc. Sound is just terrific, full and very clear.<br /><br />I'm no audiophile, but I do produce professional sound & video from time to time at work, and I've tried a lot of phones over the years. These stand out for their simple clarity at all frequencies, and I'd say they're known as an industry workhorse for a reason.<br /><br />The coil cable can be a bit of a pain, and after four years the earpads are starting to shred a bit. Very minor complaints given the sound quality.
B00005NB8K|4.0|Oliver Stone is a crazy nutbag and has gotten worse over time but Val Kilmer deserves major reconition for the best preformance he's ever given.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I was delighted with The System Has Failed, the band's tenth studio album which was a step in the right direction as Megadeth altered their direction back to a more thrash sound again. It wasn't just the musical style however, as the songs were great, the musicianship was excellent and the production was punchy again. The next album, United Abominations took that ball and ran with it, mixing the style from their thrash era with the style found on Countdown To Extinction to create a modern sounding album that still had that return to roots feel.<br /><br />The band's twelfth album, Endgame, feels like the next logical step in the new era; getting that next bit heavier and faster than United Abominations but without becoming stale or uninteresting. The album opens up with an enjoyable instrumental speed metal track full of guitar solos. The phrase `start as you mean to continue,' comes to mind as the rest of the album follows that formula, with the exception of `The Hardest Part Of Letting Go...' which is similar in style to `Promises,' from their The World Needs a Hero album, only reworked with some extra speed metal segments.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks, no bad guitar solos and the production is brilliant, really there isn't a lot more you could expect. Dave Mustaine snarls and barks in top form and even lets his singing voice out on some of the more melodic moments, his voice is as good as it ever was, with no slide or decline to be found. Furthermore the drumming is rock solid, with plenty of double kick and inter cymbal fills to accompany the bevy of flawless guitar solos and bouncy bass guitar lines.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the amazing thrash style title track `Endgame,' which is probably the catchiest song on the album, `This Day We Fight,' an awesome straight up thrash number and the interesting closer `The Right To Go Insane,' which has a kind of `Youthanasia,' feel to it.<br /><br />To summarize, Endgame is Megadeth at the peak of their abilities, with top notch production, musicianship and songwriting. If you liked the last two Megadeth albums then you will unquestionably love this well written masterpiece.on, musicianship and songwriting.

This story deverves a 5 star if it wasn't for the VERY long introduction.<br /><br />In TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE,  we become further acquainted with Mma Precious Ramotswe, the owner of a detective agency in Gabarone, Botswana. She is a \\"traditionally built\\" woman with tradional values. At the beginning of the book, she's accepted the marriage proposal of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.  The reader follows her through the ups and downs of her personal and professional life.<br /><br />She investigates cases, a wandering wife,  a  missing child, a grieving mother trying to find out why her son disapeared 10 years ago and a dishonest maid. Two orphaned children (one in a wheelchair) come into their life unexpectantly for fostering.  I highly recommend this book to those readers who like a gentle mystery. Read it and Botswana will become more than a place on a map.

B000092Q4U|4.0|As The Palaces Burn is Lamb of God's second full length studio album. The album is hugely important to the Lamb of God story, spawning crowd favorites `Ruin,' `Vigil,' and the title track. From start to finish there are no weak tracks and every Lamb of God member puts in a top notch performance.<br />This is the album were the Lamb of God sound is properly established, where the lyrical style is properly established and where Randy's Vocals sound right for the first time on this release, with his trademark half Death Growl half metalcore bark making up the majority of the vocal contributions to this album. With Devon Townsend in the Engineer's and Producer's chairs The Lamb of God sound was finally captured on an album. The production is a huge step up from their debut but is still a little raw and noisy by modern standards.<br />The album contains a lot of excellent songs with `11th Hour,' `Purified,' and `In Defense of Our Good Name,' standing out in particular. Guest guitar contributions from Chris Poland on `Purified,' are welcome and don't feel out of place whatsoever.<br />The only downside with the album is that the material is very difficult to become familiar with, and while you will enjoy and be impressed by the technical and heavy music its not the kind of thing you'll have stuck in your head after your first listen.<br />If you like Lamb of God then you simply have to get As The Palaces Burn, it's a Grower but be persistent, its worth it.
0439023513|4.0|I was very anxious to get this book and had to buy it the day it came out. Mockingjay was different then the first two books where Hunger Games and Catching fire were mainly on the games in the arena and everything Katniss went through during those games. This book deals with the aftermath of the Hunger Games and Katniss trying to come to grips with the things she has done to others to stay alive. Mockingjay started right were Catching Fire ended. I love this book but I also have to be honest it was not as good as the first two books but the first two books were perfect so the third is still an awesome book and a must read. Katniss and Gale and Peete were always so strong during the first two books and seeing them cope and deal with everything that has happened it was hard to see them struggling. Everyone in this last book had changed and not for the better. I do like how this book does wrap everything up for you and you know how Katniss and Peete life turns out. I do wish I would have some more information on Gale. Did Gale's life go on to live happy with someone and did he ever come and see Katniss again when she went back to district 12. At the end I did shed some tears and will not give it away as to why but it was a very sad part and one I did not expect. I do feel that the final book completed the story for me. All three books are a journey that I absolutely loved. My nine year old is too young to read these but in a few years I want him to live this journey too. These are a trilogy that is worth reading more than once which I already have read twice and in a year or two I will have to relive them again.

Casey Affleck is a fine actor destine for great things. Keep your eye on him, I know he will continue to get better with age. I am not a hugh crime drama fan but this film makes the cut.

B000OCXFCO|4.0|I was delighted with The System has Failed which was a step in the right direction musically in my opinion, it might have been a little more Youthanasia than Peace Sells but the important point is that the songs were great, the production was punchy again after three flat sounding records, and Dave sounded angry for the first time in years.<br /><br />United Abominations, takes that ball and runs with it, coming across very much as a thrashier, harder and faster version of The System Has Failed. The great thing however, is that even if you forgot that a subgenre called thrash had ever existed, this would still be an absolutely phenomenal record.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks, the guitar solos are good, the production job is good and the album feels more like a cohesive band effort than the previous record did.<br /><br />While the album thankfully got the praise it got, some people remained suspicious. There have been a fair amount of criticisms made on some fairly petty things. So on the album artwork, skeletal-mascot Vic has skin? So the band re-recorded their classic track `A Toute Le Monde,' ? So What ? it was a great song then, and its still the same song, and who really cares about the mascot on the artwork when the music is so great.<br /><br />If you enjoy the music of Megadeth, aren't stuck in the past, can overlook those petty flaws and if you can get over the lyrics then you will surely love United Abominations. Peace Sells, but Buy this instead.

I had a hard time sleeping during reading this because I did not want to put it down. I knew that each page held answers I was seeking. It had adventure and suspense and I just loved it and so happy I waited to read this so that I do not have to wait so long for the next book. I only have to wait a few weeks and after reading the ending of the book I do not think I could wait any longer.

This final book ties everything together, has plenty of battle scenes, and a suprising ending. This book, and the series, somewhat paralells Harry Potter but has Greek Mythology instead of magic.  This series is what got me into Greek Mythology.  I've enjoyed every book so far, but this one is really the best. Really there is nothing to complain about the book in my opinion, very good plot.  The actions scences were cool and the book overall is a classic.  Any Fantasy, Harry Potter fans, or people who really like Greek Mythology should read this.  You will not be dissapointed.  I really like the very ending though.  This book overall deserves 5 stars.
0812973992|2.0|I had high hopes for this book from the rave reviews, but what I got was a writer trying to prove how clever he was. The result was tedious and I have to say slightly insulting.  I got the parody of Whitman and his lists(I am an English teacher after all) but that understanding wasn't necessary for the novel. But the author wanted me to know just how darned clever he was so he put in 2 callouts to Whitman before rubbing my nose in the 2 pages of lists of \\"death by...\\"  However I stopped reading when I got to the chapter about Petit, the tight-rope walker, who was walking on his practice wire in the snow. The simile \\"It seemed to him that it was like stepping along the spine of a horse toward a cool lake\\" stopped me in my tracks - what meaningless nonsense! I like original writing but this is absurd.  Maybe the chapters after this one are wonderful. I don't care. I've given up.

B003YLK2RI|5.0|Most Slipknot fans won't need very much convincing, a new live DVD has been released an you very probably plan t buy it, but for anyone on the fence about whether or not to get it, I highly recommend this package, on is own merits and not just out of blind dedication to the band.<br />`(sic)nesses,' is a pretty great package, documenting their 2009 headline performance at the UK's Download Festival in front of 80,000 excited fans. Also included is a documentary (curiously on disc one, with the concert on disc 2) from Shaun `Clown,' Crahan and all the music videos from the band's `All Hope Is Gone,' album cycle.<br />Performance wise, everything you expect to happen at a Slipknot concert is there, so don't expect to be disappointed in that regard. One can expect to see people hanging off things, jumping off things and throwing things at regular intervals; in addition to a spinning in mid air drum kit, Different band members fretting the notes for the guitarists, different band members hitting a keg with a baseball bat, Clown and Criss's strap-on marching drums during `The Blister Exists,' and `Psycho Social,' and of course Sid getting into the midst of everything, including the crowd whenever possible.<br />Without a doubt the entire concert is made on the strength of the crowds passionate reaction and that undefinable live energy that just makes the concert feel amazing. Seeing 80,000 plus people singing along to very heavy music is almost life affirming.<br />If you were dissapointed by the band's live performances on their live album `9.0 Live,' or the bonus live material from `Voliminal,' specifically the mix, Corey's vocals and the disjointed feeling caused from material being taken from various concerts and are unsure whether or not to buy `(sic)nesses,' then I'd like to reassure you that it is of a much higher quality than the previously mentioned releases, the whole concert is much more impressive and intense, Corey's vocal performance is noticeably stronger and the mix is a lot more suitable.<br />The audiovisual quality of the release is in absolutely no question, the tech crew behind it have done an absolutely sterling job recording, mixing, filming and editing it and the whole viewing experience is of as high a quality as you would expect from a band of Slipknot's size, even considering that this was a festival performance which is where a lot of big bands release their weaker DVDs due to the reduced amount of control available. Put simply this DVD looks and sounds fantastic, better even than you'd expect.<br />The only negative things I have to say are mere nitpicking, such as a perceived shortage of material from the `Iowa,' album and that the documentary is very much in the Shaun Crahan style (as seen on the main Voliminal film and the All Hope is Gone bonus DVD) which I don't personally care for but of course, you could indeed love this style. These minor and circumstantial niggles do nothing to detract from the sheer quality of the release. It may sound cheesy, but `(sic)nesses,' proves why people love Slipknot so much.lot more suitable.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of my favorite books I've read in months. It was my first read on the Kindle and I had it finished within a week (which is extra speedy for me with a fully packed work/family schedule). It has a great love story and a good deal of suspense towards the end.
1439153663|4.0|This was a difficult book for me to \\"rate.\\"  There are so many forms of slavery in this book that I was heartsick by the time I was done reading.<br /><br />The depth of the characters' heartaches and the unending litany of mental, physical, social, emotional and sexual violence perpetrated on, and suffered by, the various characters--whether black/white, free/indentured/slave, male/female--left me absolutely exhausted at various times in my reading of the book.<br /><br />I kept on reading believing that SURELY at least one of these poor souls would catch a break and see a glimmer of joy, hope, freedom, etc.  Other than Lavinia's (the indentured Irish servant girl) brief stay in Williamsburg, there simply wasn't much that wasn't bleak and despairing.  I hope and pray that that this work of fiction portrays the worst of slavery/indentured servitude as opposed to the \\"norm\\" of that unpleasant part of our history.<br /><br />In conclusion: even though the book left me emotionally drained, and the ending seemed to have been hastily written and not fully developed, I believe the author has written a fine book that captures the sense of hopelessness and despair that is the hallmark of slavery.

B002ZFQD0Y|5.0|Serj Tankian's Elect The Dead Symphony is certainly an interesting release. At first, the idea for an artist with just one album releasing a live album seemed like a bad idea, then when you add in the idea of Serj's short three minute songs getting the orchestral treatment the idea seemed even more ill-advised, it led me to make unpleasant assumptions about the man's ego.<br />I'm glad to report however, that the problems I perceived are largely absent and Serj was fully justified in releasing this symphonic live concert.<br />As well as songs from the Elect The Dead album, there are two brand new songs `Gate 21,' and `The Charade,' as well as two more non album tracks `Blue,' and `Falling Stars.'<br />Another reason that this concert works so well is that the songs have been pretty severely rearranged to suit the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, it seems more like an MTV Unplugged version of Elect the Dead was given the symphony treatment than the existing versions. There is no distorted guitar whatsoever, no bass guitar and no drum kit as all percussion is handled by the orchestra.<br />The concert's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. This concert relies a great deal more on the Orchestra than any other Rock/Orchestra cross over I've ever seen, which while making it unique and impressive may alienate some fans who were expecting a mixture of the band and the orchestra more in line with Kiss's Alive 4 or Metallica's S&M orchestral concerts.<br />Some songs suit the style more than others, with the chorus of `Money,' for example, seeming clumsy. Songs like `Elect the Dead,' and `Saving Us,' however are amazing and truly feel grand with the powerful backing of the Orchestra.<br />In terms of the DVD, the visuals, camerawork, direction and editing are spot on, they really couldn't have done a better job its almost worth watching just as a demonstration on how to correctly make a concert DVD. The sound is similarly perfect, the only place where quality comes into play are your individual opinions on the arrangements and how well Serj's voice carries live. In my opinion, Serj nails it here with a faultless performance that in some instances surpasses the original album versions, but a few listeners may not be so convinced.<br />Overall, Elect The Dead Symphony is a very good concert, with top notch sound and visuals. If you feel that a stripped down version of the songs augmented by a huge Orchestra is for you then give it a try.ndividual opinions on the arrangements and how well Serj's voice carries live.

B000RZIGVS|5.0|Of all the Star-Trek series, from original to Enterprise, I think TNG is the best.      Firstly, there is the beautiful and elegant Enterprise spaceship, inside and out, which to this day still looks fresh and new; the crew uniforms which work well with the setting; and various innovative costuming.      The cast is exceptional and the acting first-rate, especially Patrick Stewart and  Brent Spiner.  The female leads are among the most beautiful I've ever seen.    A multitude of well-known actors guest star (some in full character make-up) and unknowns too, all giving excellent performances.     The scripts are intelligent, intriguing, well rounded and well executed, with special effects that are still unequaled.     I recommend the ST-TNG series, and Voyager series which I like for it's ground breaking casting of women in key roles that usually go to men.      * I don't know about the quality of this dvd release though, but it appears to be the only complete set available.  On that alone, I'd say it's worth the price, [the lesser price that is] since you get all 7 seasons; a bargain over buying them individually.

1892005034|3.0|I first came across Rosenberg's book on Nonviolent Communication in the form of its Dutch translation. Because I initially liked it and because I am much more fluent in English, I decided to order the original version in English. My goal was to acquire a manual on how to communicate more effectively in private life. The new copy (second edition, paperback) is full of abbreviations and full of marketing statements about all the wonderful things Nonviolent Communication supposedly does for you. Superficially, the book sounds great. However, applying the technique of Nonviolent Communication day to day is much more difficult than it seems. In hindsight, I got sold on the promise of the book, and I awoke with a much more difficult topic than I thought.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium are a band that have divided the opinions of the metal community since their breakthrough, but even if some people question their style no one can question their talent; Trivium are a true collection of virtuoso musicians who are able to write catchy and enjoyable metal songs.<br />`Shogun,' the Florida Metal band's fourth studio album is a delight for fans of the band's first two albums `Ember to Inferno,' and `Ascendancy,' as it brings a lot of the better elements from those releases back to the forefront, including the screaming Metalcore vocals which divided fan opinion so much.<br />This choice will take some getting used to for fans who preferred the band's third album `The Crusade,' but in the end, it is worth being open minded as `Shogun,' may well be Trivium's best album to date both musically and in all the other areas such as lyrics and production.<br />In my opinion the best songs on the album are the aggressive `Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven,' and the slightly dark `Insurrection,' which borders on extreme metal at times.<br />The album also should get credit for the career highlight drum performances from Travis Smith, who is frankly amazing behind the kit.<br />To some fans, the album may appear off-putting on first listen; as the more commercial tracks appear early on in the album and could make the album seem less than heavy on first listen. As with all of Trivium's releases however, the commercial side is balanced with very heavy and technical metal elsewhere.<br />Whether you are a Trivium fan or a curious outsider you should not be afraid to try Shogun, it contains all the band's various styles distilled on one brutal, thoughtful and fresh album. Highly Recommended.<br />This special edition comes with a DVD and three Bonus tracks, slightly different artwork. It is certainly worth the extra money, as while the Bonus material has a high quality of songwriting and delivery and the DVD is very interesting.<br />The `Making Of Documentary,' is pretty substantial for a bonus feature and offers not only insight in to the recording process, but the economics of Roadrunner Records and the feelings associated with being forced into contractual obligations you'd rather not have to fulfill. As well as this interesting Documentary (albeit, with a silly comedy prologue about Nashville) there is Some instructional footage on how to play the guitar and bass parts, which is a nice addition to the overall package.nus feature and offers not only insight in to the recording process, but the economics of Roadrunner Records and the feelings associated with being forced into contractual obligations you'd rather not have to fulfill.

And I am certain no one would ever try any of the plays in the book they are all very unrealistic. The bro code was written much better and you could see 2 guys going yes this is the code. I was looking so forward to reading this one but the payoff did not equal the build up.

Some may not like that as it departs from old Saxon albums, but I think it rocks.  the tone of the guitars is great and vocals are as good as ever.  If you like Saxon, you'll like this album.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|Dirty Harry is a legend...as much as Clint Eastwood himself...to the point where the two are inseparable! Can you imagine anyone but Clint Eastwood playing Dirty Harry and uttering the famous teeth-clenched line \\"Go ahead...make my day!\\"? Impossible! Not only is Clint Eastwood's portrayal of Dirty Harry some of the most stylistic performances in Hollywood history, the 5 Dirty Harry movies are TOP NOTCH crime thrillers with a great balance of action, suspense, humor and scenery, mostly of the very scenic San Francisco. The characters are colorful and well-acted. My two favorites are Dirty Harry and The Enforcer. The weakest of the 5 is The Dead Pool, but relatively speaking, of course...it's still a fine movie. It actually has quite an original plot, and a young Liam Neeson turns in a fine performance as the main suspect. However, I thought that some parts of it were a tad bit cheesy and \\"slick\\". The other 4, particularly the first 3, had a \\"grittier\\" feel to them--more in line with Dirty Harry's character. In the Dead Pool, his character has seemed to mellow out quite a bit, like he's about ready to retire--lol. Of course, that movie was made in the late 80's, so it makes it a little tougher to compare it with the others...I just love the \\"style\\" of 70's movies.    If you enjoy gritty cop thriller flicks and don't mind the typical R-rated material here and there, then these 5 Dirty Harry movies are an INDISPENSABLE part of your movie collection!!
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Wrath is Lamb of God's sixth full length studio album. Picking up where Sacrament left off and adding a lot more speed, some more acoustic bits here and there and a lot of straight up metal riffs, the album is a triumph from beginning to end.<br />Randy's incredible vocals are particularly strong on this new album, in fact he has never sounded better as he Shouts, Screams or Talks (in that creepy Phil Anselmo way) his way through the album with many more voices and sounds than on previous albums. The lyrics are similarly stronger than on previous releases in addition to the vocal patterns being some of the strongest the band have had to date making this album Randy's tour de force.<br />The production is also superb, the guitar tone is the perfect mixture of clarity and heaviness, the drums are all audible and professional and all the vocals and instruments just gel perfectly.<br />Lamb of God may be espoused by the kind of people who overuse the word `Brutal,' and Journalists who like to uses phrases like `Guitars that melt your face off,' or `Listening to this will ACTUALLY kill your Grandmother,' but that shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of what has to be one of the most exciting and enjoyable Metal bands out there.<br />Their musicianship is of such a high standard, every member is an expert at their instrument and no one feels like a weak link, the bass is better than you would expect, the guitar solos are musical and have a more classic rock feel to them than you'd expect, the riffs are entertaining as hell and the drumming is particularly impressive.<br />The album has a lot of variety from the clean, dual guitar harmony featuring opener, to the super hard and fast `Grace,' and the mixture of twisting build ups and straight metal of `Broken Hands,' to the very diverse album closer `Reclamation,' you'll never be bored by samey songs or one dimensional riffing.<br />Wrath is an excellent mixture of the catchy and politically charged style of Ashes of The Wake and the brooding, dark and ultra professional style of Sacrament; with songs like the unbelievably catchy `Contractor,' discussing the situation in the middle east to the sound of a fast, chuggy verse with groove metal choruses, sitting alongside the dark and atmospheric closer `Reclamation,' with a more biblical/flood theme and a mixture of acoustic guitar interludes, slow building post rock passages and good old fashion metal finishing the album in style.<br />Wrath is an absolute joy to listen to, its one of the best albums of 2009 and its one of the best Lamb of God albums out there. Highly Recommended.rk and ultra professional style of Sacrament; with songs like the unbelievably catchy `Contractor,' discussing the situation in the middle east to the sound of a fast, chuggy verse with groove metal choruses, sitting alongside the dark and atmospheric closer `Reclamation,' with a more biblical/flood theme and a mixture of acoustic guitar interludes, slow building post rock passages and good old fashion metal finishing the album in style.

0553208845|5.0|Love Hermann Hesse, love this book. Probably the 6th copy of this book Ive owned in my life. I often give this as a gift to people who enjoy philosophy, or are making big change in their life (going to college, moving away from home, new career, etc.). Its an inspirational story about finding ones place in the world and a book I personally find a lot of comfort and inspiration in.<br /><br />For those that havent read it, I would certainly recommend this as well as Hesse's other works. Its pretty short and easy to get through as well. You could easily read it in a day or plow through it on a long plane flight.
0525951652|1.0|i like many other persons writing about this book have nothing to about it but that it is toooooooooooooooo expensive for kindle users.  i have been very unhappy since i bought my kindle and prices for our books are now getting out of control and sky high.  i wanted to buy my neighbor a kindle, but she wanted to shop and compare all the different e-books.  we chose the nook for her and what a surprise...there is book sharing, and reading a book for free while in barnes and noble, and coming in november a nook with color ability.  i am very disappointed with amazon as a whole about their pricing.  they are making \\"buckets of money\\" and so are the publishers who don't even need to use ink and paper, but they still insist on being stingy.  when we continue as a public and not buy the book(s), perhaps it will drive the prices down.  for now, i will shop at borders for the book as a member i can get 30% off the hardcover price and an additional discount which comes out to less than the kindle and/or amazon with shipping fees tacked on the hard cover book.  you want our opinion, hope you read it amazon execs
B0002S94OS|5.0|Ashes of The Wake is Lamb of God's Third full length studio album. The album is decidedly more polished and cleaner than its predecessors, with producer Machine (that's his name) taking the helm for the first time and really driving for clarity in a way previously unheard of on a Lamb of God album.<br />Apart from the new cleaner production, the first thing you'll notice about Ashes is the songwriting, Lamb of God hit onto the perfect formula for writing catchy singles and crowd pleasing songs that instantly feel familiar, that have hooks and that most importantly are highly memorable.<br />While the earlier material was awesome, it was harder to familiarize yourself with and songs would take a great many listens before you understood how they worked or remembered what came next, with Ashes everything just clicks.<br />The combination of a less brash production and more accessible songs may be unpalatable to some fans of the earlier output but its hard to deny the sheer quality of music.<br />The musicianship is of the highest standard, head and shoulders above many of their peers both technically and creatively each Lamb of God member seems handpicked because he was the best in his field.<br />The album is chocked full of career highlights from the excellent politically fused `One Gun,' or the introspective `What I've Become,' to singles `Now You've Got Something To Die For,' and `Laid to Rest,' nothing is ever short of excellent.<br />Chris Poland once again returns with guest guitar contributions are once again welcome and don't feel out of place whatsoever on the fantastic instrumental title track.<br />Ashes of the Wake may have a more commercial production but its hard to complain when the music is this good.

B003F3FJQO|4.0|Dashner's second book drags slightly behind the fast pace of the Maze Runner. However, Scorch Trials certainly fills part of the void left by the former's suspense-filled ending and continues the the reader's feeling of anticipation.

Regardless, I still look forward to the next book.
B003WTE886|3.0|I've been playing this over and over really wanting to like it, but with the exception of a couple of songs, something's missing.  I haven't been able to put a finger on it yet, but after going back and listening to Fearless, I'm starting to get some ideas about why Speak Now isn't striking a chord with me.    I'm not finding a \\"Love Story\\" here...or a \\"Fifteen\\"...or a number of other great songs from that album, but the reason is those songs have a lot of dynamic range, stronger melodies, and overall better production.  A lot of songs on this new record are loud, from beginning to end.      I do think the lyrics are very good...very real.  I listen to a variety of styles of music, and the appeal of Taylor Swift for me is that she writes real songs without the need for gimmicks.  The lyrics mean something to her, and they are easy to relate to, whether you're 16 or 45.  But the vehicle for the lyrics is the music, and that's where things fall flat for me here.    Yes, there's more variety in styles, from a decidedly country song with banjos (\\"Mean\\") to an Avril Lavigne-type rock song (\\"Better Than Revenge\\"), and everything in between.  But when she leans too much towards country, it feels a little forced, and \\"Mean\\" has no originality to it whatsoever.  A lot of the songs suffer from a lack of originality musically...they've been written hundreds of times before by many different artists.  What saves them from total disaster are Swift's personal lyrics, so I'm not overly surprised with the positive reviews from fans and critics alike.     Thankfully, there are exceptions to the drop-off in music, melodies and production.  Everyone seems to be talking about \\"Dear John\\", and it is good, mainly because of a passionate vocal performance.  Still, it drags on and doesn't go anywhere musically.  My heart starts to beat a little faster once I get to \\"Enchanted\\", and even though producers use a little auto-tune to spice up the vocal (which normally I would abhor), it works to perfection and the song builds in intensity and has a great melody.  \\"Innocent\\" has a dark, eerie mood with some edge to it...something we haven't heard from Taylor before but suits her vocal tone perfectly.  And on \\"Last Kiss\\", producers finally push the right buttons to help create a ballad that invokes goose bumps.    Overall, this is still a solid album...just not one I'm going to like from start to finish.  I applaud her for writing all of the songs herself, but next time, I hope she gets a little help from her friends.

142311339X|4.0|Rick Riordan's The Lost Hero picks up shortly after his Percy Jackson series ended and continues onward in the same universe with both new and familiar characters. Actually, I should say \\"mostly\\" the same universe, as Riordan has broadened his Greek mythology premise outward to include the Roman gods as well (or as is often the case, the familiar Greek gods in their less-familiar Roman aspects).     Percy literally isn't around for this one (don't worry--he appears to play a major role in the next); he's gone missing and nobody knows what happened to him. Instead, The Lost Hero begins with Jason, a young boy who finds himself on a school bus with his two \\"friends\\" Leo and Piper, save that he has no memory of who they are, how he got there, or who he is. Just as he's piecing together they belong to the Wilderness School--an institution for \\"bad kids\\"--the group is attacked by wind spirits, which Jason mysteriously seems to recognize. In the melee, Jason learns he can fly, has a nifty magical sword, and has pretty good skills. Eventually he and his two friends are rescued by Annabeth (looking for Percy) and brought back to Camp Half-Blood, where they learn who they are:  Jason the son of Zeus, Piper the daughter of Aphrodite, and Leo the son of Hephaestus.   Jason, it appears, has had his memories stolen by one of the gods, though what does leak out is strange in that he seems to be more associated with Rome than Greece. He isn't the only one with issues though. Piper has been asked to betray Camp Half-Blood to save her father. And Leo has a hidden ability somehow connected to his mother's death. Before the friends can fully settle in, they become wrapped up in a quest and a Great Prophecy which will see them travel the country battling monsters, demons, and gods in order to avert disaster.       All of which should sound familiar to readers of the first series, and there is a lot that is familiar here, for both good and bad. As in the earlier series, Riordan does a nice job with the small details that bring the gods to life. This is not a richly detailed world much as one finds in Harry Potter or LOTR; Riordan's books have always been much more about pace and action. But when he does slow a bit to bring the world more fully before us, we get some great quick moments, such as Argos of the many eyes crying or when we're brought into the home of Boreas the god of the North Wind.     The action is fast and nearly omni-present, though there are pacing issues. The book, well over 500 pages, could easily have lost a 100 or so I'd say. Some action scenes are drawn out (either because they move a bit predictably or because they become repetitive) and there are several odd moments where characters recapitulate the action in their heads, action we've already seen so as a reader I was wondering why I was being told this again.     Riordan's trademark humor is here, as is his facile ability to present a realistic teen point of view. A few times the humor might feel a bit forced or the attempt to show the characters as TEENS too obvious, but these moments are rare; mostly this feel to be a book about teens by someone who actually knows teens, rather than by an author who has an \\"idea\\" of teenhood in his/her mind (or worse, memory).     Jason's lost memories are played in too contrived a fashion, welling to the surface at convenient moments, and too many characters have that annoying \\"I know what is going on but for your own good can't tell you\\" sense of knowledge. Finally, the Roman mythology is a truly interesting and relatively original concept, but it feels a bit too shadowy for too much of the book (far less so in the last quarter) and feels therefore also a bit contrived--pieces of information left out by the author so we can get to a big reveal or set scene at the end.     Notwithstanding those problems, the books speeds along, much as the Percy Jackson ones did and it's hard to imagine young readers not jumping aboard and crying out for \\"more, more\\" at the end of this just as they did at the end of The Lightning Thief. Despite the issues mentioned, these books feel more solid, composed by a more confident and assured author. Even better, Riordan aims a bit darker here than in earlier books, dealing with a lot of parental issues of all sorts and personal demons of guilt and despair. This gives the new series the potential to be a bit deeper than the original (the idea of being \\"moved\\" by emotion rather than simply \\"moved along\\" by plot). And the early Percy books had much the same issues and improved.     Riordan may not have the crossover youth-adult appeal that some YA authors manage, his books lacking that richness or depth or subtlety. But one can't argue with his success with the youth market. The Lost Hero I'm sure will be no exception. As such, highly recommended for that group, with hopes he tightens things up for the next.

This is a great follow-up to any workout for 20 minutes.You will sweat and burn in the 20 minutes for each level.     I use this as a mix to my other DVD routines due to my lack of time and do enjoy it. My mother who is nearing 60 and never tried a workout DVD in her life faithfully does it everyday for the last 2 weeks and enjoys it. I'm sure in no time, she will be progressing to level 2.    I would recommend this DVD to others  with a caution that you will be sore, but in a good way. You will see results in a few days. This also means that you have to lay off the carbs, high calorie foods and sugar.

Only briefly interesting beginning about page 250, and towards the very end when the book converted into a conventional, but second-rate Agatha Christie mystery, quickly answered. The novel ended with an unconvincing bedding of the two main characters, followed by an almost as weak second ending. Two weak endings don't provide a strong end. In summary, this was \\"twits and twats, academics all, searching for lives.\\" My rating is actually a 1.5, but I can't in good conscience give it a lenient 2.0.

Yes had previously acheived new and exciting levels of musicianship with \\"Close to the Edge.\\" It presented the title track, which was their first long-form composition, clocking in at over eighteen minutes. It worked because the song was broken into separate movements that were distinct, yet cohesive. As for this album, each of the four songs (ranging from eighteen to twenty minutes plus in length) never reaches that same level of fluidity.     While each song has great moments, there are more over-extended solos and grandiose flourishes to endure. One's musical prowess may be welcome in concert, but on record, buyers want more of what a band says than what they're capable of doing. Even the bulk of the lyrical content, inspired by Paramhansa Yoganada's, \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" seems overblown. The song titles aren't sparse either. You know you're in for more than just a walk in the park with a song called \\"The Revealing Science of God.\\"     Sometimes the music is literally too painful to listen to. The prime example is the album's third and weakest track, \\"The Ancient.\\" If the dissonant rumbling of the bass and keyboards aren't enough of an irritation, the clackity-clack of the drums and buzzy/shrill guitar melody are. Even the promising end of the compostion isn't enough to make up for the beginning mess.    This epic work ends strong with the rousing \\"Ritual.\\" However, after the fourth twenty minute listening session, a period of recovery is needed. This is an exhaustive work, and very important for the band. Yes proved they could go beyond musical boundaries with this album. The question I have with \\"Tales\\" is, did they really need to?
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|Soy gran fan de Clapton y quizá es el hecho de que estamos encantados por sus solos de guitarra, que al escuchar este disco sentimos como si estuviera en hibernación musical, es decir, solamente tocando música sin que sea grandiosa o al menos entretenida.   Solamente lo he escuchado dos o tres veces y no se cuándo lo volveré a escuchar...
0385342039|1.0|I've never read Sophie Kinsella's books before but this was highly recommended to me by a friend.  Generally I don't have a problem with ditzy heroines or ghosts, but I found these characters to be excruciatingly annoying (especially Sadie) and one-dimensional.  The ending was predictable and wrapped up much too neatly; I solved \\"the mystery\\" about halfway through.      There were a couple of issues which really bugged me - primarily when the necklace was finally located, WHY didn't Sadie just \\"yell\\" at the uncle and/or daughter and make them give Lara the necklace?  She did that with everything else she wanted, why not the one thing that was SO important to her?  Oh that's right, then there wouldn't have been a story.    The idea of a month-dead (at least) corpse needing or appreciating the necklace is just preposterous.  A better solution (which was suggested by someone else) would have been for the necklace to be donated to the museum, and Sadie could have continued to haunt the portrait and the necklace together.    And finally, at the end with all the big fuss over Sadie, the tons of folks at her funeral etc, all saying how much they loved her & what a role model she'd been - what was that all about??  Geez people, all she did was POSE FOR A PORTRAIT.  You'd think she found a cure for cancer (or at least the common cold), the way she was so \\"revered\\".  Ok I can see being interested in her to a certain degree, but really that fuss was completely unwarranted since she truly did nothing to deserve it.    I listened to this book (got the books on CD version from the library for free, thank goodness) in the car on my way to & from work but couldn't finish the last disc without fast-forwarding through the too neat \\"happily ever after\\" wrap-up. If I had read the book version I would most likely have quit halfway through, or surely I'd have felt cheated of my time.  Since in a way I was a captive audience, I listened to most of it.      In fairness a lot of the book was tolerable but the glaring plot holes I mentioned above plus the ridiculous happy ending ruined the rest of it for me.

081297381X|5.0|Early this year, I resolved to figure out a little bit about why economic policies and popular stock market commentary never seem to make sense to me.  A Wikipedia binge led me to The Black Swan.  My confirmation bias was pleasantly massaged, as this book gave me quite a few reasons to believe that the economists often have no idea what they're talking about.    The Black Swan is rough around the edges.  Taleb lets generous helpings of arrogance through, and perhaps it's merited, but it's not pleasant.  He also seems to be arguing against theories that economists themselves have moved past (I'm sure he'd argue against the usefulness of the latest theories, like GARCH and friends, but I'd rather he address them more directly).  One of his extended examples of a Black Swan comes with a punchline - he made it up.  Maybe the real punchline lies in how easy the reader is seduced by his narrative, but I didn't entirely appreciate it.  The extended material occasionally seems eccentric for the sake of being eccentric.    Despite all that, this book has made an impact on my behavior.  I'm a little more skeptical of convenient narrative and a little more cautious with my own predictions. I'll forevermore be on guard when I come across a model that assumes a normal distribution.  For that, I have no real reservations with the five star rating.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|When i went to the cinemas i wasnt expecting much from this movie, specially being a remake of sorts. I couldnt be more pleased when i came out of the theater, it was so cool, me and my friend really like it a lot and watched it couple times after wit other friends and family.  The Bluray disc i awesome, the image is crisp and alive, just like i remember from the theather, the audio will know your socks off!  There are plenty of extras about the cast, deleted scenes, etc etc, all pretty much standart by nowdays, but still entertaining and welcome!  Recommended
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Aliens in science fiction movies can act as proxies for some group without offending too many people. The aliens in District 9 can stand in for any citizen in the world that does not have direct connections to those in power.<br /> District 9 is so well shot and acted that you may forget that you are watching a fictional piece of art. Especially if you paid any attention to the victims of Hurricane Katrina or the Haitian Earthquake. The movie gives us the mode of operations of the power structure any time there are refugees from some disaster. First the military confronts those in need. The sufferers are then isolated into camps. After all of that, ordinary people are recruited to manage the refugee camps. The more ordinary the person, the more responsibilities they are given.<br /> District 9 also brings to light a crucial point. That is that corporations lead politicians, not the people who vote for them.<br /> District 9 will entertain you while teaching. Watch this film. You never know when you will find yourself in a relief camp.

B001FB55H6|5.0|I never heard of Watchmen before seeing the movie, but i read it after i saw it, here are some of my thoughts.  This movie is real faithful to the book, even on some key scenes, which comes straight from the books.  The movie is intresting, but not for everyone. This is no spiderman, its all about character development, heroes and their motives that drove them to be heroes, and quit being heroes. This not the typical superheroe movie, because the book is not the typical superheroe comic book.  The picture quality is real good, with lots of detail and special effects, you will wowed by the faint glow that Dr. Manhatan irradiates.  The sounds its real good also, and it sports a DTS HD 5.1 for compatible receivers, and a Dobly Digital track in frech.  Subtitles include english spanish and french.  The extras includes behind the scenes, featuretes, deleted scenes.
0375836675|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak was one of the best books that I read this year, so I purchased I Am the Messenger to discover if Zusak is the real deal. He is! This book is a little less dark and more comical than The Book Thief, but just as good.  I Am the Messenger was selected as a 2005 Michael L. Printz Honor Book.<br /><br />Ed Kennedy is a 20 year old taxi driver whose life is going nowhere.  His three best friends make for an uninspired group and they spend most of their spare time playing cards.  At the beginning of I Am the Messenger, Kennedy stumbles into a bank robbery and is able to break up the attempt.  Soon afterward, a playing card, the Ace of diamonds, is delivered to his home.  On it are three addresses with a time for each.  Kennedy doesn't know what these addresses mean, but he decides to find out.  At each address, he sees what he should do--some are easier than others.  Just when he thinks he's finished, he receives another playing card with more cryptic messages. He has no clue who the messages are coming from, although the men delivering them aren't always gentle.  But as he continues, the messages become more personal and Kennedy must determine what he can do to make things better for those he loves.<br /><br />I Am the Messenger is beautifully but simply written.  One message involves a lonely widow with Alzheimer's.  She thinks that Kennedy is the husband that she lost in World War II. \\"The old lady did something to my heart.  When her hands reached out and poured the tea, it was as if she also poured something into my while I sat there sweating in my cab.  It was like she had a string and pulled on it just slightly to open me up.  She got in, put a piece of herself inside me, and left again.  In there, somewhere, I still feel it.\\"  Perhaps that is why Kennedy was given these tasks as despite all his flaws, he has a tender heart.<br /><br />Kennedy starts out as a reluctant hero and ends as an enthusiastic one.  It's definitely a story about personal growth and development. \\"If a guy like you can stand up and do what you did, then maybe everyone can.  Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.\\"  I'm not sure why Zusak's books are considered books for young adults, but I Am the Messenger has a message for all ages.evelopment. \\"If a guy like you can stand up and do what you did, then maybe everyone can.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games was suggested to me by a young adult and the book is well-suited for that age group.  The strong, female lead character is someone you quickly learn to root for and care about.  The dystopian world of the Games gets explored more in the following books.  The best part of the story is how rebellion can be started by the simplest and most innocent of acts by the most unlikely of persons.  A very simple and quick read that is entertaining and well worth your time.

B001DSNF8C|5.0|When i heard about a new James Bond movie, i was kinda intrested, specially when i heard it was about the only novel of Sir Ian Flemming that wasnt being on the \\"official\\" timeline.  But a new actor performing after Pierce Brosnan(which was the mainstream Bond when i grew up) was a bit hard to swallow.  But the change was a welcome one, this movie is incredible, and Daniel Craig performance is so fresh and brings a new angle to the 007 character, and more realistic one in my opinion.  Craig delivers a cold and tough agent, which just got ascended to \\"00\\". This is the very first mission as 007, and is filled with plot twists and beatiful scenery.  About the Bluray release it include: music video, featurette, behind the scenes, commentaries, as well as many more content dedicated to the Sir Ian Flemming fans.   The picture quality is crisp and clear, the audio is great, this title is recommended to everyone.

0800141660|4.0|This, as another review has remarked, is a serviceable translation of Austen's novel to the screen.<br /><br />It has, on the whole, a wonderful cast doing a pretty good job, and great production values. Though Hugh Grant seems uncomfortable as Elinor's beloved,  I do love the other Hugh, Hugh Laurie, who rather touchingly reveals something that the novel only suggests:  Mr. Palmer gradually falls more than half in love with Elinor.  (The contrast between Elinor and Mrs. Palmer is painful.)  Emma Thompson's Elinor may be a little older than we might have imagine her, but she beautifully conveys Elinor's isolation and stress--she is so often the only  person of sense in the room.  My biggest complaint is that the scene between Elinor and her sister Marianne's faithless lover Willoughby is pretty weak--Elinor is even closer to forgiving that scoundrel here than she is in the novel.  Miss Austen was far too easy on him, and the film is worse.<br /><br />Really, it's not perfect, but it's a very engaging film--you'll enjoy it.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I dont know what to say about this movie that hasnt being said before, its a masterpiece.  Bluray wise, i dare to say its reference material to compare other Bluray disc.  The image is full of life, image is crisp and clean, dark when its meant to, and the IMAX scenes are as impresive as they were on the theater.  Soundwise it include Dolby TruHD 5.1 in english, english spanish and french on 5.1 Dolby Digital, all of them sounds great.  Many features are included as well as some Bluray live extras.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I love the book, the rating is not for the quality of the stories.<br /><br />However this, and many other kindle books, are advertised as \\"free\\" and then when I get to the actual buying page it shows a price - sure, its cheap, $3 or less, but that is not free.<br /><br />One of the reasons I was considering getting a kindle was the huge quantity of \\"free\\" classics, but as it turns out most of them aren't. At least not for international customers.<br /><br />So no kindle for me. If I have to pay for these books, I'll keep buying them in paper.
0525951652|5.0|I too was somewhat overwhelmed by the size of this book.  However, after the first few chapters I could not put it down and SLOWLY finished the last 20 pages as I did not want it to end.  For me, that's the sign of a really good book.  I look forward to the next installment, and highly recommend this book.
0316069485|4.0|In Michael Connelly's THE REVERSAL, the great LAPD Det. Harry Bosch is teamed with his half brother Mickey Haller as they seek justice for a young girl murdered 24 years ago.<br /><br />Jason Jessup has been in jail for 24 years for the murder of Melissa Landy when his conviction is overturned due to new DNA evidence. The DA is convinced he's guilty and wants to retry Jessup. He needs an independent prosecutor and asks Mickey Haller to take up the case. Haller agrees, only if he can do it his way. He brings on Maggie McPherson, his ex-wife, as a second prosecutor, and requests that Harry Bosch be his police investigator.<br /><br />Melissa's sister Jessica originally identified Jessup as the killer, but Jessup has a lot going for him. The new DNA evidence and Jessica's troubled past create problems for the prosecution. As usual, there are several twists and turns. Haller excels in the courtroom and Bosch is at his best when trying to get to the bottom of a case.<br /><br />Bosch now has custody of his daughter after his her mom was killed in 9 DRAGONS. Haller also is juggling a daughter between himself and Maggie, her mother. While the characterizations in the novel are entertaining, the novel works because of the case.<br /><br />Connelly's best novels are usually the ones with the cases that seem simple at the start but soon reveal several layers. This one is no different. If Jessup didn't kill Landy, who did? And what is Jessup doing now that he is a free man?<br /><br />THE REVERSAL had me turning the pages. Connelly's novels are never overwhelming, but subtle in their effectiveness. In THE REVERSAL, Connelly delivers a solid courtroom drama along with compelling investigation by Bosch.
B000094A6A|5.0|You know when people ask that question of what would be the 5 movies you could take on a deserted island? Well this is in my top 5. So funny. So many great lines to quote from the movie. Will Ferrell's best work.
B0047SF41G|4.0|Pros:  Good beginning with good characters.  No toying around. They didn't try to give the Yautja more personality or character development than necessary to differentiate between them.  No shaky camera. It doesn't look like the camera operator had too much caffeine.     Cons:   Point for point it follows the original Predator (Schwarzenegger) very closely, almost too close for comfort. Elements from Predator 2 (Glover) were peppered in as well giving this one a been-there-done-that feel.    Overall I found this more enjoyable than either AvP, but not as entertaining as the original. With a bit more plot development this could have been the best one of the lot. If you're looking for a decent action flick its worth checking out.

B000FC2L1E|1.0|********SPOILERS********<br />  I'm editing this to add a few more thoughts.  Number one, I hate that other people are allowed to \\"grade\\" whether or not they feel I am being helpful.  Of course if you liked the book, you think I'm not being helpful.  At any rate, all this makes me do is skip the reviews on the books I really like and just write the ones I don't.  If I am going to be downgraded for my opinion, then I feel like saying exactly what I think with no sugar coating.<br />  As far as this author goes, I typically love her books.  She has a unique writing style that involves many different lives and times.  Her books are smooth, but sometimes a little too full of historical info.  Her editors are good, and her works are not confusing or boring.  Her books sometimes deal with difficult topics, i.e. Jamie's rape, but as an adult I find the subject matter appropriate.<br />  My opinion on this book is based solely on whether or not I liked the story.  Simply put, I didn't.  Claire repeatedly forgives Jamie for lying to her, with slim to no reaction from her. She comes across as very weak and too naive. If a man who claimed to have loved me later married the woman who tried to kill me, there would be no forgiveness.  And furthermore, he continues to have contact with that woman and her children in subsequent books, if my memory serves me correctly.  That storyline alone affects my opinion of Jamie and Claire.  I continued reading these books, and I intend to get the new one.  I just didn't like this one.
B003WSFXKY|4.0|My first initial listen were to the 30 second clips. That sort of put a bad taste to it in my mind. I immediately thought what a waste of time. Now that I have the CD and can fully listen to it's full blown glory, I think this a great avenue Santana explored. I'll admit, some of the songs I've never really liked, so no great loss. But Santana's perspective give those songs new light and in many ways makes the song so much better.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I caught their Time Machine Tour in Syracuse, New York and saw this DVD for sale at the merchandise counter.  Nobody working the counter could tell me anything about the DVD, what it was or anything so I passed on it.  After the concert (Fantastic!!), I went to the RUSH website and looked into the DVD...then bought it on Amazon.  If you are a RUSH fan you need this video...It provides information about the band's beginnings and each of the members.  Lots of archival footage and interviews with Geddy's, Alex's and Neal's parents.  Contains lots of info about RUSH I hadn't heard elsewhere...Their concept albums, style in clothes (!?) and hobbies...Highly recommended!!!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time in my differential diagnosis class in grad school. The movie perplexed me until the very end when it all became crystal clear. SPOILER ALERT: Throughout the course of the movie, Trevor was suffering from PTSD. Anyone who knows about this disorder can tell you that every symptom: sleeplessness, memory disruption, weight loss, changes in interpersonal relationships, hallucinations, etc., could be explained by PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). In the end, it becomes clear that the accident which he was responsible for, was so psychologically damaging that he lost memory of the event. One could also argue that Trevor suffered from a dissociative disorder as well, which may also help explain how he remained unaware of the incident for so long. Anyways, as a psychologist I found this movie to be very thrilling and full of surprises. While it was personally horrifying seeing Christian Bale in that role, it was a very good movie!

1439133948|4.0|As a Bujold novel, however, this was a disappointment to me. Like most other fans of her writing, I was impatiently waiting for Cryoburn to show up in my mail box. I admit that I read it \\"in one sitting\\" (well, two, actually), but I didn't get another Vorkosigan treat that I was hoping for.  The plot did not grip me as it usually does in Ms. Bujold's books. The characters were not as well written as they usually are. Like other reviewers have said, the usual brilliant, witty Bujold language, a huge part of her appeal, is mostly absent in Cryoburn.  An enjoyable Roic of previous books is now well on its way to degenerating into a Vorkosiverse Jar Jar Binks: A clumsy comic relief with almost no redeeming value. Moreover, the new way he talks to Miles is so un-Barrayar, so artificial, so un-Roic even, that it snapped me right out of the narrative, which doesn't help.    However, I realized after having read the book, that the major problem with Cryoburn and, prior to it, DI, has nothing to do with lazy writing, being hurried or even being tired of the whole Vorkosigan series, all of which I suspect are true to some extent. That problem cannot be solved even if Ms. Bujold suddenly decides to give Miles her full attention and turns her sparkling writing back on. The problem, unfortunately, is with Miles himself.  Simply stated, he has nothing left to prove. And always having to prove himself to Aral, Cordelia, Gregor, Ivan... everyone, friends and enemies alike, had been the driving force behind Miles from before his birth. It was what made Miles into Miles. He had to drive himself and everyone around him crazy and overcome hurdle after hurdle to prove himself.  Not having this subtext makes Cryoburn a reasonable sci-fi yarn, but that alone does not make it a Miles Vorkosigan book, philosophical musings about the meaning of death notwithstanding.    I don't know if Ms. Bujold is too tired to write another Miles book. I hope she isn't. I keep re-reading the old ones everyonce in a while, and I would love to read another quality addition to the series. I also hope she would place it earlier in his time line, when Miles still had something to prove and work for.    P.S. The fourth star is for the CD. That alone makes this book worth buying. Way to go Baen!
1439148953|2.0|I finished this book in a couple of readings not because I loved it, but because I try to complete what I read.  I'm being generous when I say that this book was slow.  I really wanted to like the main character Eilis, I really did, but she was like a robot disconnected with everything around her while sleep walking through life. This is even harder to excuse given that Eilis, an immigrant from Ireland  has everything handed to her on a silver platter: a job, a place to live, a college to attend and then a boy that loves her more than she does. Instead of taking in the sights and sounds of 50's Brooklyn she seems to be disinterested in everything around her. Some have said that the ending was a \\"shocker\\" given the main character's complacent, dull personality I thought the ending was in keeping with all her decisions.  From beginning to end, she let's others think for her.

Personally, I didn't care for \\"Priscilla\\" at all, as it was too campy, and the storyline, and plot were very weak, unlike 'To Wong Foo...', which features a truly moving theme, plot, storyline, character insight, everything that I felt Priscilla just didn't quite live up too.<br /><br />One, Leguizamo is a natural in himself, *the \\"little latin boy in drag\\"*, and Swayze and Snipes are phenomenol.<br />Leguizamo truly proves his acting chops in this movie, taking his character to areas I've never seen him go.

B001PPLIEG|5.0|..I gotta say, the new bond kicks ass...  I will not go in to details: Daniel C. is a well trained actor, I enjoyed this movie and Casino Royale deeply.  I own all bonds movies (22 I think) and movie wise the last two are way superior. Of course Sean C. is the perfect bond, Roger M. is very funny and Timothy D. a well rounded actor (Pierce B. is a joke, and not a good one) but this new one mmm is good. He's major gadget are too overdevelop balls, thanks to the torture from the end of Casino Royale.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Fantastic package. The films all look amazing. The original \\"The Matrix\\" was always considered to be a benchmark for DVD image quality, but this Blu-Ray edition improves upon it dramatically. Absolutely stunning.    The inclusion of \\"The Animatrix\\" is icing on the cake.    This is a must-own in any Blu-Ray library as far as I'm concerned.

B0036EH3WU|4.0|This is a great set with some awesome extras and even a few hidden surprises.  It's a lot of fun just to go through the box and see all that there is to see.  I can go on and on with the pros, but I couldn't say anything that hasn't been said already.      My only complaint is the storage.  Don't get me wrong, the box has a great design and looks excellent on it's own, but it is very awkward and difficult to store.  I don't know why studios insist on doing this with complete collections of TV series.  I was hoping that the box that contained the discs would be standard DVD size so that I could put it on my shelf and display the larger box elsewhere, but sadly this is not case.  I am one of those obsessive compulsive people that take displayability into account when purchasing DVDs and this set just does not look at home with all my other DVDs.  A very small con in an otherwise excellent collection.    If this is not something that concerns you then by all means, get this set.  The price is right and the extras are more than worth it.

0525951652|2.0|Fall of Giants is rich with history, and readers who are hazy about World War I will find the book an excellent chronology of the period as told through the eyes of Follett's characters.    Unlike Pillars of the Earth or World without End, however, the characters in Fall of Giants are flat and predictable. The book is disappointing, and reads less like a novel and more like treatise on the merits of working-class socialism. All of Follett's clichéd, enlightened protagonists easily triumph over their slow-thinking and simplistically-evil oppressors. Yawn.    The book's ending sets up a WWII sequel, which will undoubtedly pit the open-minded, sons of the working-class heroes against the incompetent sons of their antagonists while they battle Nazis on the beaches of Dunkirk and Normandy.    I will probably read the second book in the series, but I do not await it with the same eager anticipation I had for Fall of Giants.

B002PEP4U0|5.0|A debate has been raging for years within that rarefied global community that earns its keep from the business of what we Americans call \\"foreign aid.\\" (Others, less afflicted by an aversion to international engagement, call the field \\"overseas development assistance.\\")<br /><br />On one side are the advocates for large-scale bilateral and multilateral aid, insisting that huge grants from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and their ilk are the only source of real hope for the many desperately poor nations of what is broadly, though incorrectly, called the Global South (Asia, Africa, and Latin America). The advocate-in-chief for this perspective is Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, who has argued that massive infusions of aid to the governments of the poorest nations can lift them out of poverty in short order. In 2006, Sachs published his seminal book, The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time, a work that provided the rationale for the Millennium Development Goals.<br /><br />Arrayed against Sachs and his colleagues are the born-again critics of government-to-government aid, most noticeably William Easterly, a long-time World Bank economist who came in from the cold in recent years to testify to the widespread failure of \\"foreign aid.\\" His 2007 book, The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good, set off the debate between the two opposing camps.<br /><br />The gist of the difference between the two perspectives is simple: One side insists that the problem of poverty is far too big to be addressed through anything other than large-scale action carried out within each poor country on a national scale. The other side contends that top-down, nationwide development programs rarely work and that only solutions crafted at the grassroots and adopted by those who are most affected by them can bring about genuine social change.<br /><br />Though I've read a number of other books taking one side or another in this debate, the work that has cast the most light on the topic is one that paid no attention whatsoever to \\"foreign aid\\" or economic development schemes, whether large or small. It's an extraordinary, first-person tale by a young man from Malawi entitled The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.<br /><br />William Kamkwamba, the narrator of this awe-inspiring story, was a seventh-grade dropout who mastered fundamental physics by reading an out-of-date English textbook in a local, three-shelf library near his village and using his knowledge to construct a working windmill out of junkyard parts to generate electricity to irrigate his father's farm. He was 14 years old.<br /><br />You can read news reports and even the most perceptive magazine articles about the challenges of development, but you won't get nearly as close to the essential truth of the challenge as you will from reading The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Kamkwamba's tale is unsparing of himself, his community, and his country. Through his all-seeing eyes, we witness the tragic consequences of the profound official corruption that held sway in Malawi for so many years after it gained its independence from Britain in 1964. We feel the unrelenting hunger he and his family experienced for months on end in the famine of 2001-2002. We see the darkness descend all around us as William is hounded by fearful villagers who can only explain his windmill as magical. But, most of all, we observe the steady evolution of his brilliant young mind as he confronts one setback after another, and prevails over them all.<br /><br />If there is hope for Africa, as I firmly believe, it lies in the minds and hearts of William Kamkwamba and other young people whose innate genius is unlocked by the spread of education and opportunity for self-expression at the grassroots. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of William Kamkwambas across Sub-Saharan Africa. Andit will be a combination of top-down aid - to build schools, train teachers, and buy textbooks - with the local action of countless NGOs, with both local and international support, that will provide them with the tools and the freedom to solve the problems that have held down their forebears for generations past. I don't think genuine development - thorough-going social change - will come any other way.<br /><br />(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)ools, train teachers, and buy textbooks - with the local action of countless NGOs, with both local and international support, that will provide them with the tools and the freedom to solve the problems that have held down their forebears for generations past.

0140157352|4.0|Getting to Yes is one of the foundational texts for negotiation. The book states that there are two main ways of negotiating: first, by position, or second, out of interest.<br /><br />Positional negotiation is based on fixed, opposing position. and tends to result in compromise (or no agreement at all). Negotiation from position is when you lock into a fixed position: For example, a man offers $10 for a rug. The seller asks for $30, so the customer offers $15. The seller offers $25, and the customer offers $20. The seller agrees. So the customer pays $10 more than he originally wanted and the vendor receives $10 less.<br /><br />Interest-based negotiation tries to get at the underlying interest, not the position. A classic example is if two little girls both want an orange. Instead of cutting the orange in half, their mother serves asks about interests. One girl wants to eat the meat of the orange, and the other wants the peel to use in baking. By negotiating from interests, creativity can result in each getting all of what they want.<br /><br />By trying to separate the people from the problem, Getting to Yes helps negotiators analyze each problem on their own merits, independent of people's perceptions, attributions, and relationships.

Too many adjectives (as a general rule, if you use three in a row you are probably using at least one too many). The story is ultimately dull and the author comes across as being egocentric and shallow. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book. If I hadn't bought it for Kindle I would have shredded it.

B003XD7ECI|5.0|`Frontiers records' has come up with some rather original ideas for melodic albums but this one is really genius. `Kiske - Sommerville', as the title suggests and most are already aware, is a melodic hard rock/metal album based on vocals duets of legendary German vocalist Michael Kiske and female vocal authority Amanda Somerville.<br /><br />I suppose there is not much reason to go into details regarding the abilities and approaches of the two singers as they are both metal idols at their own right while their contribution on this album has been very much explored by other reviewers.With that in mind I would like to stand on the other factors (beyond Michael and Amanda) that make this album such a musical success and for that matter are just as important as the names on the front cover.<br /><br />A key success factor was bringing to the project possibly the most capable songwriting core of `Frontiers records' that of bassist Mat Sinner and guitarist Magnus Karlsson. Both have been known for delivering amazing melodic works in the genres of melodic AOR, hard rock and metal; and the collaboration of the seasoned Mat with the younger Magnus ideally balances old school and modern influences on the album. The album features additional songwriting by Keyboard player Jimmy Kresic and Amanda, the material they come up with is more mid tempo and symphonic/orchestra-oriented. So closing the songwriting part, the listener does enjoy a variety of rock and metal styles throughout `Kiske/Somerville' while all songs are consistent in big melodies and stellar production.<br /><br />In terms of performing line-up the project finds Matt Sinner on bass guitar, Magnus Karlsson on lead guitar, Sander Gommans also on lead guitar, Jimmy Kresic on keyboards while drum duties are divided between Ramy Ali and Martin Schmidt.<br />Instrument-wise this project continues to surprise as Sinner's bass is louder and more aggressive than one would expect, Magnus' solos are instantly recognizable and never compromised in their length, while the drumming is far more intense than anyone would have anticipated, referring not only to the double bass attack but to the very technical stick work that is to be found throughout the album.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Kiske-Somerville\\" does capture the best of Michael Kiske and Amanda Somerville still it goes on to offer the listener much more that simply an all star project. It is impossible to find any fault on this album:<br />1)The concept is original 2) The songwriting is diverse yet consistently melodic 3) the singers live up to their reputation while uncovering much more of their vocal abilities than expected 4) the performance on instruments unforgettable and 5) it is all topped by possibly the greatest production ever.<br /><br />The limited edition features a 12th bonus track `Set Afire' and a DVD with the two breathtaking promo videos for `If I had a wish' and `Silence'.their length, while the drumming is far more intense than anyone would have anticipated, referring not only to the double bass attack but to the very technical stick work that is to be found throughout the album.

Those things aside it's full of great recipes both from the books and traditional British fare. Well worth the money if you're patient and a relatively good cook

Don't forget to add the seasonings on the preceding page of the book.  It was better with seasonings.  Overall, I like the book.  You just have to read very carefully.

0007263678|5.0|So much has been written about World War II that one is astonished to find new material and a new slant on this dramatic and frightening story.  Here, with Finest Years, Max Hastings, the former editor-in- chief of the Daily Telegraph, tackles the war from the actions, speeches and thoughts of Winston Churchill.  It was not a straight line towards greatness for Churchill.  He dealt with divided opinion about the continuation of struggling against Nazi Germany in the early days of his Prime Ministership, with substantial segments of the aristocracy urging appeasement.  The story begins on that fateful day, May 10, 1940, Churchill's first day in office and the day in which Germany began the onslaught in the West, ending only weeks later in the capitulation of France.  Germany had been preparing for war since the mid-1930's and had already absorbed Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, each with relative ease.     None of the histories of the war that i have read treat the intricate relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt with the same degree of nuance and detail that Hastings devotes to this issue.  It was, in fact, a critical relationship, deftly handled by Churchill, an intensely egocentric man but one who was able to move beyond his ego to gradually persuade the American president of the common cause against Germany.  it took all of Churchill's immensely powerful charm, sense of history and language, and dogged persistence to move Roosevelt to broaden American support for Britain as it battled Germany on the Western front.  The relationship began to subtly shift as American might became increasingly evident in the North African campaign and in the invasion of southern Europe.  American forces rapidly outnumbered those of Britain.  The runup to the invasion of Western Europe, in June 1944, was designed by Americans, over Churchill's strenuous objections, and led by a spectacularly successful American general, Dwight Eisenhower.      But in the early days, when the fate of the West hung by a thread, Churchill was supremely capable of rallying his country in resisting Hitler.  The performance of the Royal Air Force in reducing the toll exacted by German bombs was critical.  Churchill was everywhere during the summer of 1940 as the fight for the skies over Britain unfolded.      However, his record was far more spotty in running the day-to-day affairs of Britain.  Political opposition, dormant during the early days of the war, gained strength as Britain tired of its long struggle and Churchill's sense of military strategy and tactics, famously deficient since the Gallipoli disaster in World War I, became more obviously questionable.    Hasting treats the battle on the Eastern front -- the German invasion of Russia beginning in the summer of 1941 -- with great care.  Stalin was the essence of the crafty leader. He was willing to spend enormous amounts of Russian blood to defend his country, ultimately a brilliantly successful effort.  In fact, the battle in the East became the determining struggle in the war, with Russia losing more than 20 million men killed in action.  This eventually exhausted the German army and, although it gained strength and striking force after its withdrawal from Russia, it never regained the fighting power that it had in the early days of the war.      This is a marvelous book.  It sheds so much new light on the leader of wartime Britain.  Hastings sums up his view of Churchill, a man who had towering talents and some very human faults, by noting \\"the sustained magnificence of his performance.\\"
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Excellent DVD.  Not the typical Robin Hood script. This one stops where the others start. The fictional story takes place in 1199 a.d.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I had some reservations about these but after plugin them in I was instantly shocked, sound is clear and powerful when used with games (I have gaming PC, XBOX 360 and PS3) but amplification falls short when watching movies, sound becomes less powerful although Dolby processing remains intact (5.1 or 7.1) even when used with DirecTV HD optical output, that's why i took one star off from these headphones.  Very comfortable and extremely easy to setup, but i still haven't figured out how to get 5.1 sound from optical output in my PC for games, movies do produce 5.1 sound on PC, any word about this in other reviews would be very helpful.  100% recommended.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Like many, I first noticed Brandon Sanderson's name as the author chosen by Robert Jordan's widow to complete his epic (slight understatement) series.  As someone who grew up reading CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, and Stephen R Lawhead, I somehow managed to never begin the Wheel of Time series or read the works of many other authors who have taken up the mantle of Tolkien.  But since I deployed to Afghanistan with my Kindle, I thought why not start now?      Thus I began with \\"The Way of Kings,\\" which quickly became one of my top five favorite books (I even got my wife to read it--and enjoy it, despite the fact that I can't even get her to watch LoTR or Star Wars!), and after finding myself missing Kaladin, Shallan and Dalinar, and knowing that it would be a while before Book 2 arrived, I found myself perusing the reviews of Sanderson's other works and arrived at the Mistborn Trilogy.    One of the most endearing qualities of Sanderson in this series is how much forethought went into the first two books.  In retrospect, the clues that were placed in the first book were not completely realized until the end of the third.  Secondly, as someone with disdain for gratuitous violence and sex scenes, I was refreshed by the lack of offensive material in Sanderson's works.      But most of all, Sanderson creates believable characters, compelling backstories, logical frameworks for magical abilities and a geography/climate/weather system that keep the plot moving excitedly forward.  I found that even the antagonists had reasonable motives and though you still feel disdain for them, you are given an understanding of them that almost affords a bizarre sense of empathy.  In his antagonist development, Sanderson really soars.    Finally, it's nice when one can't easily predict every plot twist and trick.  There's a great mix of external and internal forces that propel the plot along.      Weaknesses:   I don't know why authors of trilogies/series always feel compelled to remind the reader frequently of previous books' salient events.  It sometimes feels patronizing.  Does anyone ever start these series in the middle?    Minor, but in the second book, on the Kindle, there are dozens of scanning typos.  Such as instead of \\"Ham,\\" \\"Flam\\" is used.  It's just a little distracting.  I didn't find this to be the case in the first or third book.    At any rate, I highly recommend this trilogy and can see why Jordan's widow chose Sanderson after reading these three books.      Next up, Elantris.    Also, speaking of starting a series mid-stream, I want to read the Wheel of Time; but am not excited about reading some of the slower books in the middle.  Can any of the slower books be skipped altogether?  I am primarily reading the series just to get to Sanderson's works at the end.
B003XRZZFM|4.0|I just listened to the whole album and it's pretty good. Nothing on it stands out as being over the top awesomeness. This band does hold a special place in my heart though, if not for them I wouldn't have albums from around 100 different Black Metal artists in my library. Ranging from similar acts as Graveworm to almost polar opposites Burzum. There's nothing wrong with album, it just doesn't stand out as great as [[ASIN:B000BM3YH8 Stormblast MMV [Bonus DVD]]] or [[ASIN:B0000AN196 Death Cult Armageddon]]. Death Cult being my first Black Metal purchase. All in all, if your a Dimmu Borgir fan I would suggest getting it. I downloaded mine from here for just $8.99. I also just downloaded Hail of Bullets newest release [[ASIN:B003ZZEIJG On Divine Winds]], I'll be giving that a listen next. I'm just now catching up on 2010 releases, still plan on downloading Iron Maiden [[ASIN:B003JTHESA The Final Frontier]] and Rotting Christ [[ASIN:B002WMGFM6 Aealo]], I'm sure there's more 2010 albums that would interest me, but I can't think of them now.

1402766785|4.0|This book has almost everything you need to know about anatomy, however it is over 400 pages. You would need to go through whole chapters just to master one part of the body such as the hand or arms. That being said it is a good book, but it is not for someone looking to learn anatomy quickly. It would take you a long time to go through all the material in the book let alone digest it.    Another gripe I have with the book is that sometimes it references muscles by their latin name and you have no idea what muscle the author is talking about. That tends to confuse you and you have to spend time to find out which muscles Bridgman is actually talking about. If you are serious about portraying anatomy realistically then this is the book for you- however if you want to learn the basics of anatomy quickly, another book will probably benefit you better.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I think some of the negative reviewers did not \\"get\\" this film. It was not meant to be a faithful re-telling of Pride & Prejudice. The real focus was on the back story of the characters and that is why it was such fun. We get to see a possible explanation for what \\"really\\" happened. I loved this film and did not want it to end, even though I thought Darcy did too much broody gazing out of windows (the director's choice) The costumes are beautiful, the Yorkshire countryside stunning, the acting superb and faithful to the period.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|For the kinds of games that I play this programmable gameboard is a bit of overkill but I spent a few hours learning to program and use it just to see if I could. I used it primarily with some older games I had like Call of Duty and with WoW: which worked really well once I managed to create a custom profile and macros that facilitated gameplay. Programming seemed easy with a little practice. The ergonomics of the Logitech Gameboard is exemplary. It fits nicely into the hand without the fatigue that often sets in after grasping a solid object for awhile. I found that it slid into position in my hand quite nicely during gameplay. So naturally, in fact, that manipulating the G13 quickly became second nature, requiring little concious thought as if it were an extension of my hand. Using the keys I found slightly problematic, however. Because one's fingers must cover somewhat greater distances than a single motion can accomplish comfortably, I found my hand tiring slightly due to the additional required movement. I also discovered an occasional tendency to hit the wrong keys once fatigue had set in. Some of the keys seemed to stick if not approached correctly: too much from the side rather than perpendicularly. This required practice to overcome but there were residual difficulties. The joystick I had trouble with. The combination of space between keys and joystick manipulation created the most difficulty I encountered with the G13. No doubt it's my own clumsiness that's responsible but it affected my gameplay so I managed to find ways of minimizing joystick usage. You may not encounter difficulty in manipulating both keys and joystick. The LCD display is bright and easy to read. All-in-all because of the G13's superb ergonomics, relatively simple programmability and solid design I found using it a plus experience despite some of the minor problems I encountered.
0975991477|4.0|The book makes you understand the need to deal with your hidden beliefs, but you want the solutions as well. It took me 20 years to master subconscious reprogramming in myself and others. The first step was to identify these beliefs that no longer are needed. This is done with the help of kinesiology. Then I learned to reprogram limiting subconscious beliefs with desired corrections. This type of work required a lot of time to learn, but now I can read subconscious mind of any person as an open book, provided I get permission to work with this person. I identify the person's sabotaging beliefs and reprogram them on conscious and subconscious levels with the correct wording suggested by the person. It is very important that one feels good about the right choice of wording for the subconscious. At the beginning I thought that this work could only be done in person. But after a while I started working with people at a distance with the same great results.   I later on found in quantum physics explanations on why and how it was possible. Some of the people I worked with even were located in other countries. I prefer to use skype to  witness the person's reaction when this reprogramming is completed. There is an inner transformation and a shift in consciousness that accompanies this work. If you need help with the solutions after reading the book, you can contact me at joyful108@yahoo.com. Best of luck, Bela.

0767821629|5.0|In the Thirteenth Floor, we enter a world that mirrors our own, and we are taken a step back into time to see a century lost but revived in a circuitry of machine. And as we are carried across the wave of technology, we question who we really are, and is it our place to play God? The power of imagination falls into our hands, and with it, we dream of life. But are we really living inside the dream of someone else?<br /><br />In Science-Fiction, we cross into new frontiers, parallel worlds, and watch technology surpass our hopes and fears. We are captivated by stories with driven characters brought to life through the heart and soul of actors, and we are mesmerized by concepts that give way to movies such as The One, Thrill Seekers, and 5ive Days to Midnight. And now we ride the elevator up to the Thirteenth Floor, where we discover a world beyond worlds and love that will exist beyond time. And the definition of Science-Fiction opens the door to who we dream to be, but are we really nothing more but a ghost in the machine?

1400032717|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough. Haddon manages to capture all of the nuances of a situation and also be hilariously funny in a very human way, and not in a cruel way at all - but certainly in a dark humor sort of way. My heart went out to Christopher's dad in the story. If I were to have a top-10 list of books, this one would certainly be on it. Of course, a lot would be on it! But if you're wavering, read this book.
B003QCCS36|4.0|This guy is just amazing.  What a wellspring of never disappointing unfoldment.  Although he has that Classic Country/Rock/Blues sound, his originality is so rewarding to hear, and certainly not cliche'.  Love him.
B003VANOFY|3.0|First the good news.    1) The overall sound quality is excellent. I hear things in my music and games that I didn't even know were there until now. The headset sounds better than anything I've ever used in the past. That said, I'm no audiophile and this is the most expensive headset I've ever bought.    2) The surround sound effect is excellent. I had to take the headset off more than once because I was convinced that the sounds were coming from my 5.1 home theater sound system (my computer is hooked into a A/V receiver). I love watching movies and playing games with this headset.    3) I find it's looks and design appealing.    4) The wireless range is excellent. I can talk on skype or listen to music anywhere in my two-story house.    5) The headset also worked in a linux virtual machine via virtualbox. I haven't tried a bare-metal linux install, nor have I tried using it with a mac.    6) People have said that my voice sounds perfectly clear on skype.    7) The headset wraps around my ears which isolates outside noise very well.      And now the bad news.    1) The logitech control panel doesn't reliably indicate when the headset is being charged and when surround sound is detected. Reboots and reinstalls sometimes don't fix the problem. I've since given up on using the control panel altogether and regularly check for updates.    2) The headset is supposed to give you a little beep to warn you when the batteries are running low, but does not always do so.    3) A high-pitched noise can be heard in the left ear when the headset is used while charging. It is a minor annoyance to me, but some may find it aggravating. Rarely, I hear a very loud and frightening electronic noise while using it and charging at the same time - more reboots, reinstalls, to fix that.    4) The included usb accessory that acts as a charging station and hub for the wireless transmitter/receiver does not reliably charge the headset. Sometimes the headset cannot be turned on when it is charging via the charging station. I've had to resort to using a separate charging cable.    5) Configuring the headset so that you can hear your own voice while talking will be difficult for some people.    6) Even the newer beta version of the software package does not fix all the issues.    7) I have a somewhat large head and ears, and find the headset to be uncomfortable to wear for more than a few hours.    8) Buying something that is broken and hoping it will be fixed in the future would be unwise.    In summary, I had high expectations given my past experiences with logitech products and feel very ambivalent about this headset. The software and/or drivers need a lot of work. Hopefully a forthcoming software update will get things running solid. If you aren't a technical user who is willing and able to cope with this device's problems, then don't buy it.    FYI - I'm using this product on Windows 7 64bit.    Update: As recommended on the logitech user forums, I've quit using the charging accessory/usb hub, and plugged the transceiver directly into the back of my computer. It seems that many of the problems have now gone away.
B003WTE886|5.0|It took Taylor Swift two years to make her latest CD, \\"Speak Now\\". Having written every song on the album, \\"Speak Now\\" contains songs of love, happiness, and heartache, themes that not only Taylor's hardcore teen base can relate to, but her older fans can find a connection with. Taylor has this extraordinary fanbase (because of her mass appeal) that has made her the success she is today.<br /><br /> Containing 14 exceptional tracks, \\"Speak Now's\\" lead-single is \\"Mine\\" which has already hit #5 on the Billboard Country Music Chart. Taylor has stated that all her relationships (even at her tender age of almost 21) has always ended in goodbyes, and \\"Mine\\" reflects the fact that the girl in the song has finally found true love. In the music video of the song Taylor actually plays a beautiful bride. Another song that has made headlines even before the record's release is called \\"Dear John\\". Many have stated Taylor wrote it in response to her break-up with singer John Mayer. Other highlights on the disc include \\"Haunted\\", \\"The Story of Us\\", \\"Back To December\\", and \\"Sparks Fly\\".<br /><br /> It is true that Taylor's sound is a lot more pop-sounding on this album, whereas her first two releases were more country oriented, but this shows how much she has grown as an artist. Make no mistake; Taylor is a country music singer first (she is one of only six female singers to garner the Country Music Association Award as Entertainer of the Year); she has simply become a more mature person, not only in her personal life, but in her outstanding songwriting ability and recording career.<br /><br /> Having been released on October 26, 2010, \\"Speak Now\\" will sell a whopping one million copies in its first week of release knocking rap artist Eminen out of the top spot. We are proud of you Taylor!!!<br /><br /> During its first week of release \\"Speak Now\\" broke a record previously held by Shania Twain: \\"Speak Now\\" sold an amazing 1,047,000 copies in its first week on the Billboard Chart making Taylor the female with the highest-selling album upon its debut. The record hit #1 on the Pop and Country Album Charts.highest-selling album upon its debut. The record hit #1 on the Pop and Country Album Charts.

B002JVWRAO|5.0|I loved it, you can tell there were two script writers one for the angels and demons another for the usual ghost hunting all were great I want the complete set cant wait for season six to come out. the angels and demons takes off from season four. This episode is action packed cute funny and above all shows the loyalty of the brothers to fight the paranormal monsters the Graphics are just all inspiring i am a student of the Academy of Art University and let me tell you I am impressed with both seasons four and five. I just hope they keep the suspense growing.     Michelle
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable movie! Great depiction of the time and solid acting. Is it perfect? No, but I think the negative feedback comes more from expectations than from analyzing the movie itself. Great setup for a sequel and the historic revisionism/myths plays well, just as it did in Braveheart.
0807029181|5.0|How can one triumph over tremendous and bitter evils? How can someone even survive the ongoing evil faced head-on in a Nazi concentration camp--in facing the violence, the inhumanity and the injustice, where to all appearances, sin seems to have taken the upper hand? How does one even find hope when caught up in the clutch of such crushing evil that can so easily cause others to throw up their hands in helpless defeat? Victor Frankl not only tells us, but shows us how it's done from first-had experience--from finding meaning in one's existence and those around you--from finding dignity in your life regardless of circumstances--from exercising that which stands seemingly above all human characteristics: human freedom, which gives us the ability to continue to steer our choices and direct our lives.<br /><br />Yes, he writes, wrote: \\"We who have lived in concentration camps can remember those who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's own way.\\" Deprived of his own freedom, paradoxically, he kept his freedom. He continued his decision making. Revealing a profound insight into the reality of our existence, Frankl said, \\"Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.\\" He nonetheless exercised this unassailable supreme human ability while imprisoned under the most horrendous conditions. Accordingly, he maintained to always have the benefit of \\"the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given circumstance, to choose one's own way.\\" He acknowledges the immeasurable greatness of the human spirit, unyielding under the grip of overwhelming evil--insistent on the import and value of right resolve, in spite of all odds--on being fully who we are, regardless of fully inhumane treatment--and remaining fully alive.<br /><br />The book is a study in psychology, all to itself!ining fully alive.      The book is a study in psychology, all to itself!
031603438X|5.0|Written in the distinctive voice of Keith. Different readers will find what they like best about the book-- whether it's the description of how songs were written, or the Mick relationship, or the drug stories-- but one really strong feature of the book is its humor. There are a lot of laugh out loud funny lines and scenes.   This guy is so wise and so funny at the same time.
B000AJIAOO|4.0|When I first stumbled across Within Temptation's \\"Ice Queen\\" several years ago, I knew they were something special. At that point, I had never heard any female-fronted symphonic metal, and the way WT wove the different sounds together was memorizing. Though, at first, there were so many sounds they almost assaulted my ears, but the symphony, mixed with the metal, all being led by Sharon den Adel's haunting operatic vocals was unlike anything I had ever heard before, and just downright amazing.     The Silent Force is an interesting period for the band, they are breaking more from their original doom metal roots on Enter, and the sound is much more complex and mature than on Mother Earth. Now that we have The Heart of Everything, The Silent Force is a step between the heavier doom metal sounds of the WT's past into the catchy, more rock-friendly sound of The Heart of Everything. However, his album manages to straddle both worlds while still delivering amazingly powerful, emotional metal that's irresistible.    The highlight track is \\"Stand My Ground,\\" which is a powerful, gut-wrenching piece of metal that inspires and makes listeners think. Other favorites include the emotional \\"Angels\\" and the beautifully haunting \\"Memories.\\" But, I have to give bonus track (and B-side) \\"Jane Doe\\" credit. In fact, it's probably my favorite WT song ever. Though it draws on the band's doom metal roots (complete with growls), it's got its fascinating, on-edge feel that's both unsettling and oddly compelling at the same time. Something about this song grabbed me the very first time I heard it and still hasn't let me go -even more than the dramatic \\"Jillian (I'd Give My Heart).\\"    \\"Destroyed\\" (B-side) is an interesting and somewhat flat inclusion. It kind of blended into the rest of the album, much like \\"Aquarius,\\" \\"Forsaken\\" and \\"It's the Fear.\\" I'd say that's the only minor issue I had with this album -some of the songs just merged together and lost some of their individuality. I would have like to see a little more distinction between each song. I was also a little sad to see that the U.S. version of The Silent Force didn't include European bonus tracks \\"A Dangerous Mind,\\" \\"The Swan Song\\" or even the beautiful iTunes exclusive (and B-side) \\"Say My Name.\\"    The song \\"Somewhere\\" is also interesting to note here. When I first heard it on the album I found it uninspiring and dull and just lumped it in with the songs that all sounded alike. However, ever since WT released the duet version on Black Symphony and An Acoustic Night at the Theatre between Sharon and Anneke Van Giersbergen (of The Gathering fame), it's breathed new life into the song and I now find it to be one of the most intriguing and emotional pieces on the album.    Though better things do come in the future for WT, The Silent Force is a wonderful achievement for the band and the genre. Though it has some flaws, at it's heart it's an emotional, dramatic display of some of the best female-fronted metal out there.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I have tried a lot of Mouse Keyboard to PS3 type of devices in the Past and I have to say this is by far the best one.  Played the new Metal of Honor with it and works flawlessly.  There was no lag, no jumpy movements and it was extremely easy to setup.  Took me 30 seconds to figure out how to map my keys, then plug the Eagle Eye into my PS3, plug in my Keyboard and mouse and I was done.  Took at 2-3 minutes tops.  Also tried MW2 and it was just as great.  I also thought it was priced fairly compare to other devices even though it doesn't include a mouse/keyboard.  I rather use my own mouse and keyboard anyways.  I use the logitech G9X and I was able to adjust my DPI with my mouse.  So when I was sniping, I lower my DPI and slow down the scope movement.  Again, overall a great product, would be great if it works with wireless mouse.  I read on the forum there was a few wireless mouse/keyboard that it works with, but I was not able to verify that.
B002UJIY7A|3.0|I enjoyed A Perfect Getaway very much while I was watching it because it keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to guess the identity of the killers. And it ended with a viscerally satisfying destruction of the bad guy. The problem, though, is that when you find out who the killers are, it doesn't add up. Too many things happened earlier in the movie that showed that they couldn't be the killers. In other words, if they really were the killers, there's no way they would have acted the way they did or said the things they did earlier in the flick. Just doesn't make sense. So I was pretty disappointed by this. Nevertheless, I do recommend it for a fun 2 hours. And the scenery is spectacular and will make you want to visit Hawaii.
B000HF0ISC|2.0|Fine acting and a fabulous cast. Intriguing story line and interesting plot. I would have given this movie a five if it hadn't been for the moron that laid down the sound track.You could not here the dialog without keeping the volume up then watch out for your ear drums. I SHOULD SUE THESE IDIOTS FOR NOT PUTTING A WARNING ON THE COVER! The sound effects and music kicking in between dialog was offensive it became so loud. What could have been an entertaining movie was ruined!

B003XRDYX2|4.0|I must admit that I was skeptical about this set when I first heard about its upcoming release.  It seemed to me that Columbia was cashing in on the success of the Beatles' mono set last year.  My doubt arose from the fact that, unlike the Beatles (especially McCartney), Bob has always been one to favor the spirit of the moment in recording, and never one to look back.  That said, I am not convinced that he had the patience to sit through the extensive trial and error required to create these mono mixes (which is what Columbia wanted us to believe).    However, I decided to give the \\"Best Of\\" disc a shot.  Upon my first listen when it arrived last week, I became convinced of the value of this release and decided to go with the whole set.  Even though Bob probably had little to do with the original production (aside from providing notes in response to an acetate copy of \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" while on tour in '66), it is worth giving ample credit to Hammond, Halee, Johnston, etc. for their efforts to present his work so well.    I would say that the mono mix of \\"Freewheelin'\\" alone justifies the purchase of this set.  The subtle expressive nuances in Bob's voice are much more upfront when juxtaposed directly against the downstroke of his guitar.  And it is also nice to hear Bob's spontaneous vocal asides during the harmonica breaks in \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" uninterrupted by the engineer trying to keep up on the panning dials!    Other highlights include the warmth of Bob's Nick Lucas Special in \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" (which had been starkly flattened in stereo), the clarity of the nylon string guitars in \\"Just Like a Woman\\" and \\"Fourth Time Around,\\" the art of guitar weaving in \\"Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat,\\" and the punch of the rhythm section in \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" \\"You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine,\\" \\"She Belongs to Me,\\" and \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\" (which lost its power when separated into stereo).  I agree with others' comments that McCoy's and Buttrey's musicianship on \\"John Wesley Harding\\" appear much stronger in mono, and I would add that the same can be said for Strzelecki's bass playing on \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and Gregg's drumming on \\"Back Home\\" and \\"Highway 61.\\"    Perhaps the weakest of the mono mixes is \\"Another Side.\\"  Wilson's reverb makes Bob's voice sound synthetically trebly at times (this is not aided by the fact that it was mixed at a slightly accelerated speed, making the songs shorter and higher than normal pitch).  In comparison with the stereo mix, the clarity of his guitar playing becomes muffled, the harmonica can be overwhelming, and the overall sound feels cloistered.  Also, on several of the mono electric tracks (i.e., \\"Love Minus Zero\\") the incidental percussion feels overaccentuated and distracts from the mood of Bob's poetry.  (It seems that the intent was to appeal to the mid-60s pop market; however, to my ears it just doesn't seem to have stood the test of time.)    Pricewise, I will admit that I am still bugged by Columbia's hype.  This set really only offers five (not eight) albums previously unavailable officially on CD in mono (Bob's first album and \\"The Times\\" were presented in mono on the 2005 remasters, as was \\"Another Side\\" on the old 1990s CD), and at a higher price per album.  Furthermore, it is hard to overlook the inattention to detail in calling this set the \\"original mono recordings.\\"  For example, the first mono pressings of \\"Highway 61\\" featured an alternate take of \\"Buick 6,\\" and the first pressings of \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" included Claudia Cardinale's photo in the gatefold.      All in all, though, I still would suggest going with the whole set (vs. just downloading individual albums).  The LP cover replicas and the booklet are a nice touch (even if a little unevenly cut/folded at times), and a CD played through a good set of speakers always trumps playback from an iPod.  There's enough going on here to justify sitting down and *listening* for a while.

B001AQO3QA|1.0|Having just received this box set from UPS, I popped it into the player to check out the various titles. All of the original, theatrical versions play and look great. The newer versions, on the other hand, such as the Director's Cut of Alien, the Extended Cut of Aliens, etc., look like the picture has been horribly zoomed in and placed off center, with huge black bars showing on-screen (in the Director's Cut, the top third of the screen is a black bar, in Aliens' Extended Cut, the right quarter of the screen was a black bar).<br /><br />I'm sending back in hopes of just having received bad copies. I'll update this review and re-rate it after having received replacement discs. But as it stands, I'll only give 1 star for this sort of low quality product.

031603438X|1.0|Despite its being trumpeted as the heir to Dreiser and other literary titans I found \\"Life\\" to be essentially unreadable and unpleasant. The text sounds as if it was transcribed from oral conversation, and though that can be entertaining for a few pages certainly 500+ pages of the f-word and drugs this and drug that makes for a monotonous climb. I found the book rather bland.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Take a thought, any thought. Now, there are many ways to take that conception and implant in other minds...speech, writing, music, movies, mimes etc. There is subliminal insertion, hypnotic insertion, even insertion on levels we never think about like smell. Pheromones can create a connection or replusion that undercuts our thinking mind. Have you ever met someone and felt that major attraction, or almost physical revulsion and could not quite understand why? Our brains and senses take in information on immeasurable levels and process that data millions of times a day. So it is with the thoughts we process.<br /><br />We always assume that our thoughts are our own. It is only because we are so aware of advertising, mind manipulation etc. that in this day and age the magician must go to great lengths to impress us. Even our subconscious will eventually root out any foreign mental construct that does not fit into the \\"one of us\\" concept, like antibodies seeking out an infection. How to get around our built-in swat squad? How to plant an idea at so deep a level even the subconscious is unaware of the invasion? Once acheived the possibilites are limitless!<br /><br />Inception, the instant an idea comes into being...the Big Bang of conscious, or subconscious creation. Think of jacking-in to someone's mind like in the Matrix. Now, conceive of going into the lower levels of subconsciousness...the dream within the dream, the other realms of lucid dreaming. Take a team of mind hi-jackers and go in to someone's super consciousness and plant the seed of an idea. That seed must be left to germinate unfettered in the subjec'ts mind, so that to all intents and purposes, the thought is their own. That person will never question their own inner reality, because no one else can penetrate the cerebral barrier, or so they believe.<br /><br />INCEPTION takes this concept of mind invasion and runs with it to the pit of the super consciousness. Leonardo Dicaprio plays the mind hijacker and with his team of psuedo-psychic freelancers, his character drops in on the inner world of the son of a very rich and extremely important man. The assignment...get in there...set up the scenario like controlling a lucid dream...set the pieces ever so gently in place and activate the \\"go\\" button metaphorically speaking. Easier said than done. Once inside the clutter of someone else's mind, it can be hard to hang on to our own reality. Where does the boundry go when we start to merge into cross-realities? Demons, we all have them. If those demons, those constructs of our own minds start to take form and identity of their own, how will we deal with the consequences of that?<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are superb, the script insightful, acting...for this type of action movie...great by all members of the cast. The concept is delicious revelry. Who does not wish they could bend reality, be full force in inside a frenetic action/adventure game with the clock ticking and terrorists and inner demons nipping at your heels? SUCH FUN!! Watching the team dive deeper and deeper into the super conscious realm is amazing.<br /><br />For those of us who are lucid dreamers and used to delta and theta wave interaction, this movie is an affirmation of the worlds we inhabit each night. For those who hardly remember their dreams, or swear they never dream, watch this movie carefully. When you go to sleep the next time tell yourself what you want to dream about and go for it. It takes a little practice, but you too can go any place/time you want and consciously drive the action. It's all there in the super conscious mind.

B00005JNTX|4.0|This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.  From the moment it starts, the viewer is treated to a succession of characters and their bizarre adventures, which appear disjointed and non-sensical, but vivid with unbelievable violence, sudden death, and what are revealed to be intriguing clues to a bigger picture that is never completely explained.  It is filmed for the most part in black and white, a wonderful evocation of film noir and gotham, with occasional colors thrown in for unusual characters like the yellow man, or simply for splurting blood.<br /><br />The acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.  He is a sick cop, trying to do some good one last time, leading to an awful adventure.  His ward, a lovely young girl who grows into  Jessica Alba, is a pawn in a larger game that is unclear.  Then there is Micky Rourke, an extremely ugly thug who is out for revenge and crazy but also, the viewer suspects, perhaps redeemable even if he tortures some victims to death.<br /><br />Recommended.  I will definitely watch this again.  There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.  That is far better fun than a single-watch passtime film.

0739384171|3.0|I just completed \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and I would give it a solid \\"okay\\".  The \\"mystery\\" is no where near as good or riveting as \\"Dragon Tattoo\\", but it kept my interest... ONCE it got into the story.  The first third of the book is totally unnecessary.  Basically, Lizbeth's and Blomkwist sexual escapades which I believe were some fantasies of the author on paper.  It was TOTALLY unnecessary and was just \\"filler\\" and had no place in the story itself (not even for character development).  Once the mystery got started (around on the 5-6th CD if you do audio books), it started to get a little interesting.  I also do not like to the liberal political undertones.  They are quite small, but they are definitely there.  You can tell the author is from a socialist country and it spills into the story here and there (but not \\"in your face\\").  Finally, I was not expecting this to be a \\"cliff hanger\\", but that expalins the filler text in trying to stretch this out into three books.  I will likely get the next book, \\"Hornet's Nest\\",albeit reluctantly.  I hope its better.

B001U3Y5XE|4.0|My son (10) is a LEGO fan, so this game seemed a natural for his birthday.  he was excited to get it and play it.  One thing that is nice about the LEGO games is that you can customize them and tailor the rules for your enjoyment.  For instance, on this game we added a timer where the person had to create his/her lego piece within two minutes.  It was an extra challenge and the adults failed miserably - which was fun.  My son can not wait to play with his friends.  Also, it stimulates the imagination and makes a person \\"think\\".  So, overall, I would say this game is a winner.

Danny believes that a boy named Tony shows him things_the future the present and the past. When his dad announces the family will be living alone in a secluded hotel for the winter since he became its caretaker, Tony shows Danny some creepy things-a monster in the halls disturbing signs and REDRUM...when they get to the hotel the visions get worse...dead men on the ground..blood on the walls....and soon Danny realizes mysterious things in the hotel are trying to destroy them. Balls go on in the empty hotel and dead people try to hurt the living. It kept my hands on the kindle and my heart pounding. The scariest book ive ever read........read it. REDRUM.
B002ZG98LO|1.0|....& people think the previous films are bad...this one I tried to watch with an open mind...but the more it went on..two things struck me about this one...for starters..this one tries to repeat moments from the 1987 original..the guy with the big gun, the woman, the booby traps, the jungle setting, the sumari dude doing a repeat confrontation like Billy in the first film, the only saving grace here is we actually see a cool confrontation that we were robbed of in the first film..which is why I give it one star at least...& like the first film, the Predators don't really appear until the second hour, at least with the two AVP films, they were seen throughout, just as the lone Predator was in 1990's \\"Predator 2\\"...this one however, they tease us like in the first film...that might have been o.k. in 1987, but with the three films that came after that one, I expected more you know, the second thing that got me about this one is that it drags, In this one we are told by Lawrence Fishburne's character who has maybe 15 minutes screen time, that there is a war going on between two different types of Predators, I guess the aliens from AVP were not enough of an adversary, these Predators have somehow dropped various people into a jungle on their planet(HOW???) & are hunting them for sport, but it is clear that they are more interested in offing each other than the humans, why drop humans in for sport when you are at war with another species, & people thought AVP didn't make sense, this one doesn't make sense, stick with the other four \\"Predator\\" films, \\"Predator\\" (1987), \\"Predator 2\\"(1990) & the two \\"AVP\\" films...they are better by comparison.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|This show makes my wife and I laugh out loud every episode.  The writing is so clever, and the characters are so great.  I think Phil  is the not likable man on tv.  The Blu-Ray is incredible!  The picture will blow you away.  I would strongly recommend this show.  Just a heads up though, this show is trying to redefine \\"family\\", so if you are traditional you may not appreciate all the content.
0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen does what any protective older sister would hope to have the courage to do. She volunteers to take her little sister's place in the Hunger Games, an unfair, brutal \\"reality\\" tv show put on by the Capital ... drawing 24 contestants, called tributes from each of the 12 districts. So, what are the hunger games? A fight to the death. Why are they fought? Because the Capital basically wants the rest of the country to know that they can do what they want, when they want, and how they want.<br /><br />Excellent story that can be taken at so many levels. You could just enjoy the read. It's a simplistic, predictable plot with pretty intriguing characters (though their names are a mite strange). Or you could delve deeper into the rights, wrongs, and social warnings within.  Definitely worth your time.
B003I87O2I|3.0|I remember hearing an interview with Lou Gramm after he departed from Foreigner the first time. He said Foreigner was alway's Mick Jones' baby. He was right. Mick assembled the band in 1977. I was disappointed when Lou left the band at the end of the eighties. I was happy to see Lou come back to Foreigner to do Mr. Moonlight in the late nineties. This was one of my favorite albums. I saw Foreigner when I was fourteen during their Agent Provocateur tour. It was a great concert. It's too bad to see Lou and Mick have a fallout after Lou's medical problem regarding his brain tumor. I'm glad Lou is back and happy doing his new thing now. This may sound like a silly thing to say, but Mick and Lou balanced the band like John Lennon and Paul McCartney with their songs. Mick has tried to reinvent the band in such a way that it is fresh, but false. He's tried hitting a reset button to go back to the beginning and continue to cash in. Kelly Hanson is a bit of an enigma, because he's not Lou. This album is really good if you listen and delude yourself into thinking it's the old Foreigner... but I'm not quite there yet and don't think I ever will be. I'm glad that Kelly kept the signature sound of Foreigner alive (but it feels like a tribute). It's a neat trick and Mick's lucky to find the right person to front the group in order to fool people into thinking that nothing has changed over the years. I do like all the songs on this album oddly. I want to give this record five stars, but without Lou Gramm this band should not be called Foreigner.The Foreigner label is a cashcow, but how could Mick not keep with the name since he actually owns the name. Maybe this new band should have been called Fauxreigner! LOL. Hope this helps any die hard Foreigner fan. Whether or not Mick shows up to play with the band it still is a tribute band.
B003YNFYD8|1.0|not many tracks considering the price. people need to get into perspective that this is just an over rated band. the most over rated in history i would argue! Certainly some amazing songs especially the ballads but no where near worthy of the best band ever title. All these songs have been flogged and there is a smell of cashing in about these remastered albums.
0596805888|5.0|This book is a perfect blend of teaching and explanation that most cookbooks do not have. I've tried for years and years to follow cooking recipes to no avail trying to understand why it didn't work. No cookbooks really give you an explanation of why certain ingredients are used over others- you almost always learn to experiment and then fail time and time again, wasting money and time. This book has finally filled some sort of chasm that chefs have left wide open. Instead of studying food science, I just read this book to get a brief overview of what an item does in my cooking. For example : I never understood the difference between baking powder and baking soda - until now.     On top of the explanations and witty anecdotes, he also provides many intriguing recipes that I otherwise never thought I could make. One example of this was his recipe for homemade soda. I just recently finished it, and it was delicious.  Really it's not I couldn't find recipes like these online - but there are so many and seldom make near as much sense as the one's he's provided here.     Bravo Sir.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Fauna, one of the three Good Fairies says that tearfully to her two companions Flora and Merriwether just before the film's ending.  Me, too, love happy endings that is, this is one of the better ones, young lovers reunited for happily ever after, and good triumphing over evil!  \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was the first Disney animated film I had ever seen during its original run back in 1959 when I was just about five years old.   As such I have a fondness for it, and it is one of my favorite Disney animated films!    The lavish painstaking care and attention that went into this film from Walt Disney on down is evident in this masterpiece of animated art.  Set in the 14th century, the movie looks like a medieval illuminated manuscript come to life.   The colors are vivid, dazzling vibrant and glowingly lit from within like the finest jewels, with a spectrum that embraces all the hues of a rainbow and then some.   The soaring, lyrical musical score is the most classical of all the Disney animated films, excepting \\"Fantasia\\", adapted by George Bruns from the ballet \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" composed by the master composer Peter Illich Tchaikovsky.   This is a wonderful introduction to the world of classical music for children; I remember years later when I saw Tchaikovsky's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" ballet performed I instantly flashed back to this movie at particular moments, chuckling to myself when I recognized Maleficent's theme in the \\"Puss'n'Boots\\" divertissement.    The story is so well known it almost doesn't bear repeating, it's based on the French version by Charles Perrault \\"La Belle au Bois Dormant\\", about the beautiful Princess Aurora who is cursed on her christening day to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday by an evil fairy who is angry she was excluded from the celebration.   This is softened by one of the good fairies attending who changes it to sleep not death, until she is awakened by the kiss of her truelove.   Disney supplied his own Americanized twists and tweaks to the tale.  These include the prerequisite cute woodland creatures as friends in the forest for Briar Rose/Princess Aurora. But hey they work, and we all like them!    The most inspired touches are the Three Good Fairies, each as individual as her signature color, Flora the born leader in her coral pink, the sweetly dreamy Fauna clad in leaf green garments, and the feisty little Merriwether whose always wears a vivid blue, these are natural extensions of the Fairy Godmother in Disney's earlier \\"Cinderella\\"; as a matter of fact Disney veteran actress Verna Felton supplies the voice for both the Fairy Godmother and Flora! The other most memorable improvement is the arch villainess, the perfectly named Maleficent, a menacing, Gothic figure in her horned headdress and flowing robes of black and purple.   Masterly voiced in curdled, disdainful tones by Eleanor Audley, she is one of the all time best in the Disney pantheon of villains.         There are two sequences that are my personal favorites.  The first is a lighthearted charming one where the Three Good Fairies use their magic to prepare for a sixteenth birthday party for Briar Rose.    Flora uses her wand to make a beautiful gown, Fauna to make a scrumptious birthday cake complete with candles, and Merriwether cleans the cottage.   Inanimate objects spring to life in a delightfully graceful ballet as scissors, needle and thread collaborate to sew the dress, the eggs crack themselves, and the flour, sugar, milk and spices measure themselves into a mixing bowl, and pour the batter into a splendidly tiered cake, while Merriwether leads the broom and mop in a happy parade across the room as they tidy up.   This is accompanied by a delicate, tinkling melody, that strengthens in tone and quickens it's leisurely pace as Flora and Merriwether engage in a comic magic duel as to what color Briar Rose's dress will be, Flora wants pink and Merriwether of courseblue, and the dress keeps changing color back and forth with each flash of their wands.   The second is the escape of Prince Philip from the Maleficent's grim dungeon assisted by the Three Good Fairies.   This is a riveting, heart racing flight, as a little kid I was on the edge of my seat in anxious anticipation, wondering would he make it safely back to King Stefan's castle to awaken Princess Aurora.   The camera angles, the imaginative touches, and particularly the musical score which builds in intensity and timbre, becoming jagged, frenzied and dissonant to emphasize the danger and the terror as Prince Philip bravely fights his way to the castle, through a maze of oversized lethal looking thorns only to have to battle with Maleficent herself transformed into a huge, horrific fire-breathing dragon combine to create an unforgettable scene.   For my money, this still remains one of the most breathtaking battles between good and evil ever presented on the screen.     The vocals are all exceedingly well done; Mary Costa has a lovely radiance in both speaking and singing that make her an enchanting Briar Rose/Princess Aurora, while Bill Shirley brings an engaging youthful manliness to Prince Philip.   I've already complimented Ms. Audley earlier on her Maleficent, so let me acknowledge the three actresses that bring the Good Fairies to life:  Verna Felton as Flora, Barbara Jo Allen as Fauna and Barbara Luddy as Merriwether; all three do sterling work.   Both Misses Felton and Luddy were Disney animation film veterans, who had worked successfully for Disney before and would again afterwards.      This is chock full of extra features mostly on disc 2.   There are games for the children, a music video, an alternative opening and deleted songs (a wise choice by Disney after viewing them) and a virtual reality tour of the Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle.   What I found most worthwhile was the \\"Making of Sleeping Beauty\\" featurette, a short subject on the composer Tchaikovsky and the commentary by Pixar animator and director John Lasseter, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin and Disney animator Andreas Dejas.   Their discussion and comments over the film were very interesting, and I especially liked Lasseter's briefly becoming a little boy again in his excitement over the battle between Prince Philip and Maleficent.   The one flaw is the many trailers and previews that are included, there must be close to 10 at least, very obnoxious, since you can't just access the menu to start the movie but have to keep skipping to the next one.    This is a very poor way to present a classic, & I don't think Walt Disney would have stood for it!
B003YP7N9O|5.0|For all practical purposes, Stand Up may as well be Jethro Tull's debut album (it isn't, just to clarify), as it establishes three precedents that would be followed on every Tull album since:<br /><br />1) Ian Anderson runs the show, and well that he should, as his songwriting gifts and overall vision took this band to amazing heights.<br /><br />2) Martin Barre's versatile guitar playing, while not as technically stupendous here as it would become later on, contributes a tuneful, bluesy edge to the proceedings.<br /><br />3) British Isles folk, as well as world music, would give this band a rich musical vein to mine for decades after.<br /><br />The music on Stand Up is truly unique. From the Jimi Hendrix meets Roland Kirk blues rock of A New Day Yesterday, the wistful beauty of the folk-based Reasons for Waiting and Look into the Sun, the affectionate, jazzy Bach parody of Bouree, to the Pakistani rock (yes, you read that right) of Fat Man, Anderson's songs sounded like no one else!<br /><br />This Collector's Edition set also includes a full 1970 Carnegie Hall concert (well, it's missing some stage banter, but only a pedantic dork like me will notice), with a great-sounding fresh remix, and some incredible performances. John Evans' piano recital includes bits of Beethoven, Gershwin, and Debussy, while Ian Anderson's atonal flute solo can only be described as iconoclastic.<br /><br />The bonus tracks include a mono version of the hit Living in the Past, the complete version of underrated B-side 17, as well as some interesting John Peel radio sessions. The DVD includes the Carnegie Hall concert in surround-sound, and a 45-minute Ian Anderson interview.<br /><br />By all means, if you're a Tull fan, buy this! If you're new to this band, you can't do much better than to start with Stand Up. It's the template that Tull used to create a whole slew of classics in the 70's. And it all started with this one!
0061997811|5.0|The 5 star reviews are spot on for this terrific addition to the Harry Potter world. I finally got a chance to see it in person last night and I will be ordering one for myself and another to give as a gift to my brother, who I think will appreciate it even more than I do.<br /><br />He & I were fortunate enough to visit the Harry Potter exhibit in Chicago last fall and, by choosing to go right after Illinois kids went back to school, we missed the crowds and were able to savor each costume, set and prop. (My favorite? The huge winged statue from the graveyard scene at the end of Goblet of Fire.) I even got to sit under the sorting hat! (Ravenclaw) Of course, there's a difference between seeing actual sets and props and in perusing pictures of them, but the creative minds responsible for putting this book together have done a fantastic job of making that difference as small as possible. The layout is exciting, the image quality (mostly) top notch and the extras - a Marauder's Map, a program from the Quidditch World Cup and another from the Yule Ball, among many, many others - are, IMHO, worth far more than the cover price on their own. (I was very tempted by the $35 Noble Marauder's Map when visiting the exhibit in Chicago, but chose to buy a nice replica of Harry's wand instead. Needless to say, I'm thrilled to get a Marauder's Map with this book even though I have to admit it's not quite as nice or as large as the one I passed up.)<br /><br />While I understand the temptation felt by some of the other reviewers to do so, I'm not in the least inclined to tear this book apart to decorate or for any other reason. Instead, I'm incredibly pleased to have all this great info and these pieces of memorabilia all together in one attractive and high-quality volume. This is a book to pull out often and to pore over slowly, enjoying each tidbit, the remembrances and comments from the actors, the details on costumes and sets and make-up. The scrapbook look and style suit it perfectly and I'm so glad to have it and grateful that so much care was taken in its creation.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Question: Does anyone have information on the Harry Potter encyclopedia thingy J.K. Rowling has mentioned compiling for publication? I haven't heard anything for awhile and am wondering if it's going forward. Seeing the pictures of Dolores Umbridge in this book last night reminded me of how much I detested her and I was hoping Rowling would let us know that Umbridge met some terrible end or, better yet, suffered deeply for her repulsive behavior. Not that I'm bloodthirsty or anything... Okayfine, maybe I'm a *little* bloodthirsty.'m so glad to have it and grateful that so much care was taken in its creation.    Very highly recommended.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy A is one of those movies that successfully portrait the high school universe, a universe that was magical for some of us, less so for some others. The movie has been receiving many positives reviews and rightfully so. What makes the movie work is without a doubt Emma Stone as Olive Penderghast. Stone was in the movies Superbad, House Bunny, Zombieland and a few others but I think Easy A is be the movie that will truly makes her a star. I always loved Emma and it's great to see her as the lead role in Easy A, she was just a perfect fit for the role and brings a lot to the table. Olive is one of those movie characters I wish I could be friends with. Her lovable, very open-minded and funny parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) are wonderful and supportive of their daughter. Her little brother doesn't get much screen time but he's funny and charming. Amanda Bynes who usually plays the good girl plays a not-so nice Christian girl, Olive's nemesis Marianne. The cast of characters are funny, likeable and some are very 80's-ish if there is such a thing.<br /><br />Olive Penderghast is a \\"different\\" high school student. Yet, everyone can relate to her and she is not so \\"different\\". When she lies to her best friend about losing her virginity she doesn't think this little lie is a big deal. The next day it seems the entire school knows what Olive did and treats her like a slut, which she isn't. Olive knows this has gotten out of hands and after hearing some of exaggerated stories about her, she decides that if people are going to treat her like a slut she should act like one, dress and look the part. She then does fake \\"sexual favors\\" for boys in exchange of gift cards; boys can say they had some fun with of Olive. The story goes further from there (and I didn't reveal much in case you're wondering) and it really is something that could happen to a high school girl, it's not far from reality and all of Easy A can be seen as realistic which really makes the audience connect. I must add that it was interesting to compare Olive to the character of Hester Prynne from Nathaniel Hawthorne's book [[ASIN:1453890580 The Scarlet Letter]].<br /><br />I really liked he 80's tribute part of the movie, good call on that one. In fact, the older and more experienced viewer might get the feel that the Easy A was going for a 1980s John Hughes teenage type of movie and in some ways it is the case. At times it really remembers those classics Hughes movies and captures some of the feel, not completely but very close, as close as it will get today at least. It's certainly nice to have nostalgia in the movie and you better bet that you'll want to be watching some of those classic teenage 1980's comedies again. It's also very clear that Easy A has been highly influenced by those 80's comedies.<br /><br />It would be nice if Easy A would be considered a classic in the future, it deserves to be. I think it has a lot of emotional appeal and is just an overall excellent movie and I believe, one of the highlights of 2010. Easy A gets an A in my book and I strongly encourage you to watch this movie, it's very entertaining and worth your time. I've seen it twice as of writing this and I will no doubt watch it some more once it is released on DVD and Blue-Ray. 5/5.t.

B0040UAYI4|1.0|UPDATE - COD BLACK OPS:  Since this is the latest iteration of Activision's franchise, the review should be geared towards that game for the sake of new technology.  I tried out the eagleeye on Call of Duty: Black Ops a few days via the mouse/keyboard setup I previously had.  All worked well, but there were some issues with the start button randomly going off and the R1 turbo function locking up my fire key.  To keep it short:  It still works as before, but no turbo function.  Many people on Penguin United's forums complained of similar issues, and are asking for a firmware update to solve it.       ORIGINAL REVIEW:    Like most PC players, I was absolutely thrilled when I saw the demo of the PS3 Eagle Eye mouse and keyboard adapter in action.  There are several demos on youtube of people using it, as well as avid fans on Penguin's forums who absolutely love this product.  If you love Modern Warfare 2, or any Call of Duty game for that matter (i.e. you pre-ordered Black Ops months ago), you will love this contraption as well. However there is a major flaw with the hardware consumers should be worried about if they decide to pick this up.      Right out of the box, the PS3 Eagle Eye adapter comes with a mini cd for the drivers, and a very long 10 foot cord.  The box says most HID compliant mice or keyboards should work, but honestly it is a craps shoot as to what perpetuals will be recognized.  The G15, G11, and G19 wired keyboards by Logitech all didn't work, however Razer products such as the n52te and Naga mouse all worked perfectly. The Logitech Revolution wireless laser mouse worked with the eagle eye, however the M505 didn't.  It is best to check Penguin's forums before buying this product to get a good gauge on what might be compatible, however Penguin stresses on the website there are no guarantees. My guess is any product that is compatible with 1.1 USB should work, since the ps3 is 2.0 USB and slaved ports end up having to be 1.1 unless using a separate power source.  You also shouldn't be using any type of optical mouse either, only mice which have a default high dpi will do. Otherwise you may max out on your sensitivity settings and not be able to use the product well.    After setting up my Eagle Eye and firing up Modern Warfare 2 on PS3, the product worked as advertised.  Smooth 180 turns, excellent cross hair precision with no jutter or lag, honestly I was impressed by the ease at which I was playing online.  I no longer needed to buy games on Steam anymore, I'm joining the console kids!    After I was done with MW2, I picked up my second favorite shooter Battlefield Bad Company 2, and this is where I started running into issues.  The reticle started juttering a bit.  There wasn't any lag, just a pesky aim point that kept moving.  I tried some vehicle combat, which is critical when playing Battlefield and did alright, but noticed by 180 turning radius was severely limited now.  It was somewhat limited in character movement, but in vehicles, I was picking up the mouse several times just to do a 180.  This is with max sensitivity settings and a Razer Naga laser gaming mouse.  Medal of Honor was the same story, luckily vehicles aren't as crucial.    I tried the Eagle Eye on Borderlands, and while my aim point didn't move as much, as soon as I walked into a vehicle I was floored.  You CANNOT move the vehicle and aim at a different spot other than the front.  If you move your aim point, the vehicle will turn in that direction.  I went back and tried Battlefield with a chopper and noticed this glaring issue as soon as I took off, I couldn't fly the thing without an analogue stick on the left.  What this means for the consumer, is if the game developer decides to make vehicle control variable analogue on the left side, the PS3 Eagle Eye adapter will not work correctly.  There is no option in the Eagle Eye software to compensate for analogue movement.  You either get 100% or 0 deflection, just like a digital controller.    The marketing for Eagle Eye is misleading.  It gives the impression you will be able to play well on almost ANY shooter.  The reality is it was only demoed on MW2, thus you will get what you see on the videos, but little else.  Vehicle combat is sketchy, more so unusable.  Yes, you could argue that you wouldn't buy this device to drive, however vehicles are incredibly crucial in many shooters, thus the option to adapt to it must be there.  As for the aim point juttering on several games, well that's just poor hardware programming from Penguin's developers.   The glaring issue is Penguin doesn't stand by any compatibility quotes, leaving you with the dirty work of figuring out if your gear jives with the hardware. So in essence, you get a product that is telling you 60% of the time, it will work every time; not very reassuring.    There is hope in this product, as it is new and the developers take a keen interest in player feedback. But for a 59 dollar perpetual that only works well on one game, you need to ask yourself how much you really love Modern Warfare 2.

0321525655|3.0|I was very excited when I got the \\"Presentation Zen\\" book, I'd heard great things about the blog and I was pleased to see so many pictures and examples in the book. There are also a lot of words and this is where the book falls down, there's too many words.     The text is conversational and incredibly repetitive, it is a style that could work well as a blog or a speech, in fact, while reading I could imagine it being given as a speech, it just doesn't work as a book. What also struck me was that in his presentation of \\"Presentation Zen\\" he seemed to break all the rules and guidelines that he recommended we use when giving presentations.     This was especially highlighted where printed articles by strong writers like Seth Godin were used, the difference in the quality of the writing was apparent.     There are some good ideas in this book but they get hidden by the chattiness of the author and bludgeoned to death by needless repetition, for maximum value simply read chapter 6 and 7 - this is where the book is at its strongest.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|My review is brief as others have almost said it all.  I just want to say that I am 62 years old, and just the thought about the way I felt when I saw this movie in the theatre makes me tear up.  It is a nostalgic feeling in a big way.  Reminds you of your childhood and those special feelings about growing up.  You want to grow up and get on to being an adult in the worst way, but thinking back now your childhood was such a very special time.  So fleeting and if we're lucky, such a special time in our lives.<br />I highly recommend the purchase of this movie to add to your collection.<br />I honestly feel that the series should stop here.  Perfect right where it was left.

B0013ISU0A|2.0|Despite the negative reviews about this product I decided to go ahead with its purchase.     Now that I have watched the accompanying DVD ('6 days' by French réalisateur Vincent Moon) I can see why most other people are upset about this film.     I don't mind black & white, what I find disturbing is the camera movements. Vincent Moon's camera moves all over the place that I think some sort of warning should exist that this documentary may provoke a whirling sensation in the head. Aesthetically, or cinematographically, I don't know what this director is trying to do, what message to convey with his blurry, dizzy images.    Most of the documentary was shot during sessions at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin which took place in mid-2007 and that I understand were the genesis of 2008's Accelerate. What I don't understand is why this documentary places so much emphasis on the Olympia rehearsals while there is a separate product for them ('R.E.M. Live at the Olympia in Dublin, 39 Songs').     Finally, I'll mention what I was expecting to find in the DVD and didn't find. In other words, what idea did I have of the product when I ordered it and what was finally delivered to my flat-screen TV.    * Hollow Man Live in Seney Stovall Chapel. While this video is widely available in youtube, the Vincent Moon documentary offers an edited version (the Youtube video offers the entire song). In this particular case, youtube proved better than '6 Days' (and youtube is free).    * Supernatural Superserious music video. I know there is a widely publicised site where one can watch this video (or its many versions) but still I was hoping to find it in this product.    * A chapter menu. I was hoping that a chapter menu would allow me to go directly to portions of the documentary, so that if I wanted to play a certain song I could do it, without having to navigate with the fast forward button.    Probably I had too many expectations about this product that very few were met. The conclusion is, I enjoy the music R.E.M. have produced and I'll continue listening to these songs. While R.E.M. are my favourite band, I am not a fan of cinematographer Vincent Moon.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|1st - Know what this CD is.  This CD is a new project for Natalie, it is NOT a CD like any of her previous works and it is a family/children oriented CD.  My wife and I are Natalie Merchant fans and I bought this CD after hearing a radio interview with Natalie discussing how this CD is her take on putting some of her personal favorite poems (fyi, not moter goose type poems) to music.  2nd - Have an open mind, dont stereotype this CD.  Do not expect what this CD will be and I promise you will be pleasently suprised.  I began playing this CD for my 5 year old daughter and she really enjoyed it.  One of my daughters favorite things to do is read along (she is a very accelerated reader) in the book while the songs play.  the song Dancing Bear is probably the best in my opinion - I was really pleasently suprised, I sometimes play that song by myself in the car and I turn it up loud.  3rd - Most of the negative reviews on this album are from fans that wanted it to be something that it simply is not meant to be... I suggest buying this CD as a family oriented listen & accept it for what it is. This CD is not rock & roll, it sound more like a compilation of folk music sounds from all around the world with fiddles, guitars, brass band sounds, gypsy band rythems, etc... very refreshing in my opinion.
0792164911|5.0|There are only a handful of movies that I consider to be the true Halloween classsics... and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is one of them. Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror -- and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders. He soon learns that the locals believe that a monstrous undead Hessian known as the Headless Horseman is the one who's beheading people. As a rational man of science, Ichabod thinks this is ridiculous... until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.<br /><br />But Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree. But as deaths stack up and heads roll, Ichabod and his orphaned servant Masbeth (Marc Pickering) discover that they are up against evil that they couldn't have even imagined.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is vintage Tim Burton, back when he was a little more restrained about said style -- everything is painted in blacks, whites and greys with brief splashes of color (BLOOD!), eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees. And there's that little edge of rickety weirdness, especially when Depp whips out his buggy-eyed binoculars.<br /><br />Now, it's not perfect -- the witch's hentai-tongue/eyeballs always make me burst out laughing. But Burton really infuses this movie with a sense of creeping, bloody horror that gets more and more nightmarish, peppered with moments of bleak humor (Ichabod trying to throttle the Horseman) and some really disturbing beheadings. It's a pretty sharp contrast to the rather sweet, shy romance between Ichabod and his host's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.<br /><br />As for Depp, he's absolutely perfect -- he plays Ichabod Crane as a young man with a horrifying past (which is revealed via dreams) and an abiding love for logic, science and reason. He's also pretty nervy, fragile and neurotic; how often do you see movie heroes who faint more often than the heroines?<br /><br />Christina Ricci is rather wooden at first, but she improves a lot as we discover some of the secrets she keeps hidden. Pickering is excellent as a young orphan who latches onto Ichabod as a surrogate father, and Miranda Richardson is all spidery creepiness as Lady Van Tassel. Also keep an eye out for Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken's hilariously over-the-top Horseman.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is all creepy atmosphere and weirdness, but it also has a solid story at its center.

0525951652|5.0|I'm not a book editor. I'm just a Grandmother that loves to read, and that I do.  I was elated to find that Mr. Follett has a Trilogy and I couldn't wait to get my hands on \\"Fall of Giants\\"!  I LOVED IT. I want the next book right now! What a wonderful way to read history.Being of the older generation of the USA, I could relate to my grandparents who were Hungarian and what it must have been like for them. I have my tales from my own grandmother as I sat at her knee and she told of the German's and the Russians and her plight of escape at age 9, when the armies marched in and killed all the men.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys being captured into the past and I guarantee you that it's very hard to put down. I finished it within 3 days time and that was with breaks!!! Again, I loved it!
B003YK42LQ|2.0|I hate to be one of those pretentious OG fans talking about how I liked a band's/musician's first couple of albums, but then they just lost me...I'm gonna have to here. I got this album Monday evening, and have taken the last two days off of work due to a head cold. I have listened to this album 5 or 6 times in its entirety. It does nothing for me. From the lame Jimmy Buffet album cover (no diss on Jimmy Buffet...let's just leave the tequila sunrise album covers to him, thank you), to the abusive overuse of reverb (to be 'arena rock', does it have to SOUND like it's being played through an arena's PA?), this album is just plain boring. Besides \\"Mary\\", I don't find the songs memorable. Nothing sticks in my head. And I'm a huge Kings Of Leon fan. \\"Aha Shake Heartbreak\\" is a classic and by far my favorite of theirs, with \\"Youth and Young Manhood\\" a close second (\\"Because Of The Times\\" and \\"Only By The Night\\" are like Parts 1 and 2, both occupying a 3rd place for me). What happened to their garage sound? What happened to the fun? This is not a \\"return to basics\\" that I've heard folks say. Just because there are album lyrics like \\"it's where you came from\\" and \\"I'm going back down south now\\" doesn't necessarily make it so. All that being said, this album could sell millions and make them tons of new fans and money. And if that's the case, I don't blame them or any other band that strikes while the iron is hot. I myself would rather be writing and playing music for a living than doing what I do for a paycheck. So I get it; I just don't have to like it. And a side note: if he's got a friend who tells him he's \\"got a big old dick\\", shouldn't the song be called \\"Mi Amiga\\"? Just saying...
0374158460|2.0|I love to read and usually finish a book within a few days to a week...if the tome is quite hefty. So when I catch an episode of Oprah and she declared \\"Freedom\\" to be one of the best books she has ever read, I was intrigued. I quickly purchased the book from Amazon and eagerly began to read it as soon as it arrived.    Firstly, the narrative was not engrossing or very well paced. The uneven writing style (i.e. jumping from author to character writing perspective) was quite discouraging. The pacing left great banal expanses of irrelevant information that did not advanced the plot or endear the characters.    Secondly, I enjoy broadening my vocabulary and don't mind an author inserting unfamiliar words that I might have to look up in the dictionary, but I despise it when an author makes up a word and uses it without definition as if it were of a common lexicon.     Finally, I am not a prude, but jumping from one sexual encounter to another incessantly does not make for great narrative. The graphic depiction of one sexual act after another that doesn't enhance understanding of the character is just unnecessary. I thoroughly enjoy a sexual encounter between characters that helps explain who they are (i.e. a rape that explains a closed off character or a consummation of a relationship), but I don't need to know the details in a grossly explicit way.    Overall, there was plenty of character development, to a fault, but I never really felt compassion for any of the characters. So even when the plot resolved itself, the only thing I could say was I was grateful to be finished reading this dreck. If \\"Freedom\\" is an accurate example of Franzen's writing style, I can honestly say that I understand why I was unaware of his existence as a writer.

B000VWIBOO|5.0|There's a three or four year span where just about every Elton John/Bernie Taupin song was gold.  Even the least of these had something to offer.  Maybe more so on this album than the others, Elton's vocals bring such a rich texture of emotion and sometimes attitude to every track.  Listen to his angst on Amy and his emotional plea on Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.  He is clearly the master here and knows exactly how to portray every character.  Phenomenal accomplishment.  If you've only heard the hits from this one, you're missing its best moments.<br /><br />Chris Bowen<br />Author of, [[ASIN:1432724533 Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom]]
B003A2C3J6|4.0|I bought this book knowing I would probably agree with it. Turns out I was right.    Detox baths, ear candling, Brain Gym, homeopathy, the MMR scare, nutritionists, moisturisers, vitamin supplements, pharmaceutical companies  - they are all myths that are deftly and humorously deconstructed by physician and professional skeptic Ben Goldacre. Most importantly, he presents facts - quotes peer-reviewed papers, looks behind the news reports, reasons on the evidence. The chapter on how big pharma distort the data from clinical studies is worth the price of admission alone. It's easy to read, but it probably helps if you have a background of some sort in the sciences.    However.     Despite any protestations to the contrary, don't ever think Ben Goldacre cares overly much about the people whose myths he gleefully deconstructs. Referring to things that are untrue as a 'vast empire of nonsense', 'hocus pocus' (Brain Gym), 'gobbledegook' (homeopathic remedies) tells me the author doesn't have an entirely objective view. Neither does casting doubt on the intelligence of members of a profession: apparently, nutritionists 'lack the intellectual horsepower to be fairly derided as liars', and journalists that sensationalise news reports are are `intellectually offended by how hard they find science' and therefore 'resentful' of not being part of the progress of science. There is a fair dollop of intellectual snobbery throughout the book.     Skepticism is fine, even healthy to a point. It's foolish to swallow everything you hear. But hard-nosed skeptics usually have more faith than they care to admit - and Ben Goldacre has an almost evangelical faith in evidence-based medicine.     Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book. And it certainly confirmed some suspicions. I just worry about how Ben Goldacre's unrelenting skepticism has coloured his interpretations of the facts. In the end, books like these really only polarise people into opposing groups. I wish the author was more interested in dignifying the uninformed than bashing people with logic.

B000LC3ID8|3.0|Picking up minutes after the end of Saw II, Jigsaw [Tobin Bell] is very near the end of his life. With the help of Amanda [Shawnee Smith], he kidnaps a doctor [Bahar Soomekh] who must choose between keeping Jigsaw alive until another victim can play his game, or death. The other victim, Jeff [Angus MacFadyen], is promised that he will meet the person responsible for the loss of his child if he can pass a series of tests. The two victims, doctor and father, play their games while an agitated Amanda tries to keep her temper and jealousy under control and prevent herself from offing the doctor herself. Although this Saw movie is more satisfying than the second, with a twist ending that is significantly different than the last two, it is still a puzzle thriller, not rising to the level of the truly horrifying original.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|Two men are chained up in the bathroom of a filthy abandoned building. They don't know where they are or why, but they do know that one of them has to kill the other in order to live. As their ordeal progresses, secrets leak out, tying the men to one another, and to the man known as the Jigsaw Killer, who punishes those who are insensitive to others, who prey on their weaknesses. A haunting thriler with many twists and turns, as well as a rich character study about the nature of sin, redemption, voyeurism and the inhumanity that we all are guilty of just by going through our everyday lives mindlessly.
0316069485|3.0|As a Michael Connelley \\"completist\\" I'm predisposed to enjoy anything he writes. However, \\"The Reversal\\" left me flat. It's definitely his least effective effort. Previous reviewers have done a good job describing the novel's weaknesses -- undeveloped characters, awkward transitions (particularly the first/third person shifts), and an unprecedented (for Connelley) lack of suspense. [SPOILER ALERT] You don't have to have a big, surprise \\"twist\\" to create a satisfying novel. But \\"The Reversal\\" needed one ... desperately. When the ending came I thought, \\"No way!\\" In fact, that's what prompted me to jump on Amazon and read what others had written. A previous reviewer wondered if Connelley was distracted by delving into the \\"enhanced\\" technology arena. Let's hope so, because this isn't the type of book that made me a Connelley lover.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I enjoy disturbing movies and even though this one is quite disturbing, I think it is also a really engaging film most people would enjoy.  Some movies (Salo, Cannibal Holocaust) seem to keep your attention purely through shock.  I'm not complaining about that but Irreversible feels very real and actually has great character building.  I was enthralled throughout the entire viewing and thought about it several days after I watched it.  My one complaint is that I had heard too much about the film before watching it (people are so inconsiderate) and probably will never have the chance to get the full effect of the movie.  Hopefully you can just watch it with wine and the lights off knowing nothing about it.

0765326353|4.0|From prior works and reviews I expected a trite fantasy with reworked material.  What I received was well thought out setting and reasonable dialogue if somewhat contrived characters.  I would find this work comparable to some of Robert Jordan's or Michael Moorcock yet I feel there is more action and more flavor to the backgrounds than the former and more grit than the latter.  If you like storys with unique systems (magical, cultural, etc.) and new ideas then this is the book for you.  If you are looking for a brutal work like those of Joe Abercrombie or purely metaphysical like Gene Wolfe look other places.  I like the series format and look forward to this one going the distance.

0553386816|4.0|Ford County (the setting for Grisham's first book \\"A Time to Kill\\") is the fertile ground from which John Grisham harvests seven short stories which touch the human condition in general and the southern condition in particular.     If you are not southern, these stories will provide you a window of understanding towards southern culture and how southerners deal with life as well as death.  If you are southern, you will recognize most of the characters contained within the pages of \\"Ford County\\".  If you are also from a small southern town (population less than 5,000), you will probably know each of them personally.     Grisham is at his best in this collection when the story has some legal underpinning, but is not the focus of the story itself.  The exception is the final story (Funny Boy) which handled a man dying of AIDS.  It was respectful and showed what I considered to be an even handed portrayal of small town reaction to such an event.    (Blood Drive) A tale of three less than noble volunteers heading to Memphis to donate blood to an injured local.  This is my least favorite as it becomes a \\"three hicks go to the big city and get into trouble\\" story.  I did not find it funny, but rather shook my head as I know both uneducated and educated people that have even less common sense than these three.    (Fetching Raymond) Two brothers and their mother visit the third son on death row.  The characters are well drawn and Grisham manages to subdue his own hatred of the death penalty, though is there for all to see.    (Fish Files) & (Casino) are basic legal scam stories.  Both are enjoyable but suffer from Grisham's tendency to allow a story to reach its end without enough uncertainty to provide dramatic tension.    (Michael's Room) is the revenge story every person who has been screwed over by a slick lawyer and the legal system dreams of over and over.  The story itself is satisfying, but the ending is completely unbelievable.    (Quiet Haven) My favorite story.  The hero of the story is out for himself, but he is like the thief who robs from thieves.  He redeems himself by doing more good than ill.  As someone with experience with nursing homes, I was rooting for him from the first page to the last.      All in all, \\"Ford County\\" is better than Grisham's recent novels.  Not a masterpiece, but a very good read.
B003WTE886|3.0|Taylor Swift has grown on me as a singer.  Some of her songs are fun fluff and the music is often catchy. However, all her songs are beginning to sound the same.  Some still sound like a teenager wrote them.  She's a young adult now and I would expect her voice to mature with her (which it's not). Also, I wonder how long she can sustain a singing career. The times I have heard her perform live, she's been terribly off-tune.  There's no denying she's a good songwriter, but her voice just can't measure up to her songwriting skills.  Maybe she needs a voice lesson?    Despite that, I still enjoy her new cd. There are a few songs that are extremely annoying. One would definitely be \\"Speak Now,\\" which is unfortunately the title of her cd. It is bubble-gum pop at its worst! That being said, I enjoy \\"Back to December\\" and \\"Mine.\\"    One last note, I'm mystified by the music industry categorizing her as country.  She no longer sounds country to me at all!
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Before Raising Sand:  Comparisons of \\"Band of Joy\\" to \\"Raising Sand\\" are inevitable, I suppose.

However, when I finally reconciled the fact in my mind that the two will probably not record a follow-up to \\"Sand\\", I've refrained from comparisons to their subsequent releases.  Rather, I took a good long look into their past solo efforts for clues of the genesis of their inspired duet performances.  The results of that search are listed below for anyone who would like to find and listen to these songs.  They are in the same order I have them on a play-list, and if you care to listen closely, you can almost hear hints of AK singing background on the RP tunes,(although she's really not there.)

030726999X|5.0|After reading all three of the Millennium Trilogy I came to a realization about a definite theme to Larsson's novels. Which is that people in Sweden do not have the right to defend themselves.<br />Whether its prohibition to own non-lethal protection like tasers or pepper spray in case they are attacked, or the heavy regulation of firearms ownership, the complete absence right to carry it is obviously clear that the people of Sweden do not have the right to defend themselves in an attack.<br />Take for example when Erika Berger is dealing with her stalker. She called the police who were ineffectual, she armed herself with a golf club, but when Milton's security consultant comes by he says she could be convicted of murder if she killed her assailant. It doesn't matter that she's a woman who is being stalked and is having what would seem like very violent actions taken against her. She cannot seek an equalizer. It apparently doesn't matter that she would be defending \\"her\\" life against someone who meant to do her harm.<br />Salander in \\"Fire\\" and \\"Hornet's Nest\\" is wanted for her assault against the biker thugs. Two mean who have criminal records and singularly probably out weigh Lisbeth by 100 lbs at least are not being sought for the assault.<br />For this to be the case especially for women who are at a physical disadvantage, to not be allowed to equalize themselves against their attackers, even with non-lethal means is ridiculous.<br />If someone breaks into MY HOME with the threat of doing ME harm I will use the force necessary, whether that requires a firearm or not.<br />Here in Missouri we have the Castle Doctrine, that is anyone has the right to shoot someone who has broken into their home. In fact not a month ago a young man killed someone who broke into his home. The would be criminal's family was up in arms and very upset at the young man who had killed their family member. For sure it is a sad loss, but they have to understand he was somewhere he should not have been, he was breaking the law, and the individual who shot him was completely in his rights. If someone is in your home and you didn't invite them you have no idea why they're there. You should have every right to defend yourself, but there are many states and other countries where this is not possible, especially in an age where home invasion has become so prevelant.<br />Missouri also has the right of concealed carry for liscense holders. Anyone wanting to carry a firearm must 1st go through a background check and pass a firearms safety and usage class.<br />So it is here that I say that the right to defend yourself is just as sacred as the right to free speech, due process, and so on. To not be given that right is a violation of a person's INALIENABLE right.s breaking the law, and the individual who shot him was completely in his rights.

B0001ADAVK|2.0|Interesting film.  It reminded me of my own life.  I graduated from High School and went to college in the fifties, and it couldn't have been portrayed more honestly. It was a terrible, pompous uptight generation.  I disliked everything about my school and the people in it.  Fortunately, I had other talents outside of school, and worked to develop them. While other kids were joining sororities, I was singing on a local TV show once a week.   Had two a wonderful career in music.  I eventually opening my own book store and had two books published.  I was always sorry I didn't grow up in the 60's instead of the 50's.  Would have made a huge difference in my life. But despite that, I loved the sixties and seventies, and though I was a little older than most all my friends, it didn't matter to them or me.     The film was portrayed exactly as things were in the McCarthy era and the up-tight generation of the 50's, and though I liked the film, it kind of hurt to remember it.
B001BSBBEE|2.0|I don't get what the hype is about.  Being low budget is not an excuse for bad filming, Night Of The Living Dead was low budget and that's superb.  Carnival of Souls on the otherhand is poorly edited, scripted and dreadfully acted.  I felt no fear AT ALL.  It does not deserve a cult like status.<br />There are much better horror movies out there.  Don't waste your money on this one.

B003YK42LQ|2.0|At its best, rock music is supposed to be dangerous. It should have intent and sincerity. When KOL first came on the scene, I caught a small show in Boulder, CO. I recall discussing with friends that KOL were a band who MEAN it. The songs were immediate, engaging and yes, dangerous. It was sloppy and polished at the same time. Caleb's phrasing on songs like Soft, Red Morning Light, and King of the Rodeo was so unique it was almost singular. I'd never heard anything like it. And the guitars had that beautiful tube break-up that was the perfect match for Caleb's raw but lyrical vocal style. KOL was the band I'd been waiting for ever since the Strokes decided they were too cool to make records and tour.     The problem with Come Around Sundown isn't that the band abandonded their original sound. The problem is that I don't believe them anymore. With the possible exception of Back Down South, there is scarcely a moment on the record where the music feels engaging, original or sincere. And dangerous? All I can say is that this set of songs is even less dangerous than Colplay. I don't fault the band for trying to make a career though, and songs like Radioactive, The End and Immortals clearly have the \\"anthemic\\" quality that will translate well live. This is no small achievement.  The folks who really love highly polished, effects-laden, atmospheric guitars and big sing-along choruses in the vein of Use Somebody are going to enjoy most of this record.  Folks hoping for a return to a more raw rock n' roll aesthetic will be disappointed...again.      In fairness, only a handful of bands in history have managed to write songs with both mass appeal AND a sense of danger. The Rolling Stones did it for Baby Boomers. Nirvana did it for Gen X. I thought the Kings might be the band to do it for Gen Y. Instead, the new record completes the band's transformation from promising young rock torch-bearers into something akin to a less talented Radiohead, a less charismatic U2 and a lesssincere Coldplay all rolled into one.
B00005JLF5|4.0|After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to just barely avoid being an outright plagiarism.  I suppose coincidences occur from time to time but the sheer number of these \\"coincidences\\" suggests to me that when JMS left Paramount Studios disappointed that they wouldn't agree to produce his brilliant ideas for Babylon 5 that not everything that went with him into that studio actually made it out with him.  In any case, I've thoroughly enjoyed both Babylon 5 and DS9 and if I had to pick the one that overall I think is the better series I would pick the former.<br /><br />One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well.  I had to try very hard to find even a single imperfection and only managed one white spot in a Miles O'Brien scene during one of the early episodes of this season 1.  In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 1 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player.  The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality though as there are many soft and grainy picture frames but the quality does improve from episode to episode and from season to season.  The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release.  For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to \\"upgrade\\" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.<br /><br />While Babylon 5 had a pretty strong opening season DS9 though takes quite some time to find its feet and I suppose when you are secure in the knowledge that you have at least 7 seasons to get things right you can afford this but as Babylon 5 constantly had to worry about getting accepted for another season each year it had to make sure each season was strong to ensure continuity.  I guess when your back is against the wall it can bring out the best in you and probably explains JMS' receding hairline!<br /><br />Still while DS9 season 1 isn't the best one it does a good job eventually of building up the foundation for the seasons that follow.  The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine.  Overall, despite the slow start, this dvd set of season 1 of DS9 sports a surprisingly good clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.<br /><br />Recommended!ailable.

B003UERZ88|4.0|Halford's back and feeling competitive. \\"Made of Metal\\" pummels and pulses with songs about competitions, warriors, athletes and other fighting folks. I fully expect at least three of these songs to be adopted by wrestlers sometime in the coming TV cycle. Heck, the title songs is all about racecars. And you thought Nascar was only for country music types.<br /><br />Nope. Shredders and Rob Halford's one of a kind roar can get into the pit with the best of them. Even if the car is some sort of demonic Hadesmobile. If that sounds appealing, then \\"Undisputed\\" (as in 'heavyweight champion of the world'), \\"Matador\\" and \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" will get your elbow into fist-pumping mode. Even without the sporty metaphors, Halford are giving fans plenty to groove on. \\"Hell Razor,\\" 25 Years\\" and the ferocious \\"The Mower\\" are the kind of clear cutting metal fans would expect.<br /><br />Curveballs exist, too. The slide guitar on \\"Til The Day I Day\\" will surprise some, but it sure works. And like \\"Angel\\" on Priest's \\"Angel of Retribution,\\" \\"Fire and Ice\\" explores relationships, however volatile they may be. \\"I Know We Stand a Chance\\" does as well, which help give \\"Made of Metal\\" a heart. Guitarist Mike Chlasciak delivers on the solos, giving the album its attitude. As one would expect, the voice is pure Rob Halford. Where his projects outside of Priest are concerned, \\"Made of Metal\\" is just as enjoyable as \\"Resurrection.\\"
B003UDP996|3.0|This is Metallica at their very best!  Some may argue that \\"Master of Puppets\\" or even \\"Ride the Lightning\\" are better but to me this album encapsulates very well all the qualities that make Metallica what they are: among the best ever metal bands if not the best ever.  Besides before \\"Load\\" I think it can be safely said that Metallica never had a bad album.  This album could be described as their \\"Sgt. Pepper's ...\\" as they lifted metal to as close to an artform as is ever possible.  To me no one has ever come close in the genre to touch Metallica and Iron Maiden.<br /><br />What is disappointing though is the mlps version which is nowhere near as good as the previous Metallica non-SHM cd cycle release which was one of the best mlps designs that I've ever seen.  This mlps design though is made from poor quality thin cardboard that is assembled in such a way that you expect the whole thing to come apart once the glue gets old which is a pity given what they expect you to pay for this.  The sound quality though is pretty good and seems to have benefitted from the SHM-cd treatment to some extent and this master is not over-compressed.  Listening to this album as a fan is interesting as you compare this album with what they did on their debut just to see how far the band evolved to achieve their artistic peak before they decided to cash in on the \\"Black Album\\".<br /><br />Also included in this package is a 16 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese while the English lyrics are in tiny print on the inner sleeve which is the best part of the mlps design.<br /><br />Overall this is a great album for metal lovers although this is a disappointing mlps version for collectors.
1400064287|5.0|Summary   In \\"Made to Stick\\", the authors Chip and Dan Heath elaborate on the \\"stickiness factor\\" discussed by Malcolm Gladwell in \\"The Tipping Point\\", wherein some messages and ideas tend to stick in our minds more effectively than others.  The overall concept of the book discusses how the creation of \\"stickiness\\" can be attributed to six principles:  Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotions, and Stories.  In fact, each chapter focuses on each one of these six factors individually.   The first chapter, \\"Simple\\", focuses on how for ideas to stick, they need to be simplified to their core ideas and made short and to the point.  Company slogans such as Southwest's \\"THE low-fare airline\\" are great examples of simple, sticky messages.  The second chapter, \\"Unexpected\\", discusses how ideas and messages that come as a surprise to those who hear them can be very sticky.  Factors that can further elaborate on this unexpectedness factor such as raising the target-audience's curiosity about the message can even further create stickiness in their minds.  Chapter three, \\"Concrete\\", elaborates on how messages that are solid and concrete rather than being scattered and abstract will be much more sticky and easily retained.  The authors discuss how abstract concepts tend to be confusing to those who aren't experts, and therefore are very unlikely to stick in the minds of the general population.  However, ideas and messages that are more concrete and tangible (as well as visual, in many cases) can be much stickier.  The example of a third grade teacher in Iowa is cited as an example in this chapter.  Because her students were too young to fully grasp why Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated, she conducted an experiment in which she separated the brown and blue eyed children into different groups and then told them different things/gave them different privileges based on their eye color.  This experiment was \\"brutally concrete\\" in demonstrating to thechildren what racism was and why MLK had been assassinated.  The fourth chapter, \\"Credible\\", talks about how credibility is essential for a message to stick.  If a message comes from a person or institution that does not hold obvious credibility within society, those hearing this message are likely going to question its validity.  Statistics, as well as compelling details can often increase stickiness via credibility.  Chapter five explains how emotion can evoke a great deal of stickiness in ideas and messages.  When people are able to relate to something, they will often times become more vested in its message and become emotionally vulnerable to it.  Chip and Dan cite how charities, such as those who try to raise money for needy Korean orphans or cruelly-treated animals, often arouse sympathy and compassion amongst people which in turn ultimately inspires them to act.  Finally, Chapter six, \\"Stories\\", describe how stories have the power to both inspire others to act, as well as stimulate thinking.  The increased stimulation that occurs in the brain when people listen to stories is what causes them to think harder and analyze these messages more deeply, therefore making these messages very sticky.  The authors cite the Jared story (how the famous Subway spokesperson lost nearly 250 lbs on a diet that involved simply exercising and eating Subway sandwiches) as a great story that has stuck in the minds of probably every American familiar with the Subway brand.    Response/Opinion   I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Made to Stick\\", by Dan and Chip Heath.  Not only did I agree with their six principles, but I also found myself relating to many of them in my own life.  I also really liked how the book was organized, elaborating on each of these six factors individually in a chapter of their own, with an introduction and a prologue as well.  Ironically enough, I think the book's \\"concrete\\" and organized layout helped its ideas to stick with me, possibly more than any of the other books we have read thus far during this semester.   Through reading \\"Made to Stick\\", I felt that I could personally relate especially to the \\"Credibility\\" principle.  Since I am a very logical person, I tend to always find myself wondering why I should believe a particular message, as well as whether or not it comes from a credible source.  One example of how I can personally relate to the Credibility principle in this book was when I was actually applying for this MBA program last year.  During the application process, I knew that I wanted to attend a school in the Philadelphia area for financial reasons, as well as other factors.  However, I was a little wary as to which institutions would back my education with a credible name that would ultimately look good in the eyes of my future employers.  Though I had the general idea that schools like St. Joe's and Drexel offered solid and reputable programs, I had no concrete facts telling me of the true credibility of these curriculums.  However, once I found out for example that St. Joe's is ranked in the U.S. News and is also recognized by the Princeton review, I became much more confident in its credibility.  What I was reading and hearing about St. Joe's immediately began to stick in my mind to much more of a degree.  In fact, the credibility of St. Joe's became even more sticky when I consulted my friend's father, a very successful CFO with an impressive executive resume, about MBA credibilities.  As soon as he mentioned St. Joe's as one of the highly-credible schools, I was even more reaffirmed as to my believing what I had heard about the University.   Overall, I really enjoyed \\"Made to Stick\\" and felt that Chip and Dan Heath made some excellent points regarding ideas and messages' abilities to stick within our society.  Whether it be their simplicity and concreteness, or their ability to evoke emotion, an idea or message's success almost always depends on its ability to stick within society.  I think that these sixprinciples are excellent and encompassing factors representing what it takes to make a message or concept be retainable by those who hear it.

B003WTE886|5.0|I spent the last couple of days listening to this album over and over again, trying to figure out if I really liked it or not. \\"Fearless\\" was a nice \\"poppy\\" album. It featured the songs you'd want to sing along to on a road trip with a good friend. \\"Speak Now\\" is something different. I suppose you could \\"sing along\\" to the songs on this record but Taylor Swift shows, more than ever, her talent for songwriting and conveying her real life and true emotions in every lyric. I'm not sure if this has been said already, but \\"Speak Now,\\" definitely conveys a darker, jagged side of Taylor Swift. With the exception of a few songs like \\"Mine\\" and \\"Sparks Fly,\\" a lot of the record talks about a broken, angry, or hurt Swift. Still, the record is far from generically \\"sad\\" or shallowly depressing.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure if I was a huge fan of this side of Taylor Swift. But it wasn't until a few hours ago, did I realize how much I love this album. I've never been able to completely relate to Swift's music, considering a lot of her songs were just flat-out \\"girly.\\" But I couldn't help but relive my own experiences and emotions through the songs on this record. I was personally surprised at how much of the CD was relevant. Swift holds back nothing. \\"Dear John,\\" is probably as gritty as you can get while still being politically correct. \\"Back to December\\" is a pure apology for mistakes made and the way a former relationship ended. But what really got me worked up was \\"Enchanted.\\" I had this song on repeat for hours. \\"I'll spend forever, wondering if you knew, I was enchanted to meet you... wishing you were at my door... Please don't be in love with someone else.\\" This song literally brought me to tears; I couldn't fight back the emotions, thinking of a past relationship that was perfectly described in this song. The tiniest details were spot on and Swift's vocal performance on the track was incredible. And though she's no Celine Dion, her true conviction and raw emotion is impossible to miss.<br /><br />Swift has never been more candid and sincere. The lyrics are incredibly grounded and candor; rather than singing about fairytales and overly romanticized relationships, she's taken a much more mature and realistic approach to her songwriting. The album is literally a diary of her most intimate thoughts. The gravity of the songs allows for a deeper appreciation of the music; the songs are mercilessly straightforward and unfiltered. Her growth and maturity is spilled out over the entire album. This is definitely Swift's best yet.ble to miss.    Swift has never been more candid and sincere.

B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|Well, it's Disney and it's a blu-ray.  Good story for little kids although my daughter doesn't seem as captivated with Tinkerbell and the fairies as much now (maybe because now she's into the Princesses more).  Blu-ray quality is great, but of course, so are other CG movies like this.

0316098337|4.0|This book was the kind of book that you think about when you aren't reading it. The story is well written and compelling at many parts. I like that it's told by the boy's point of view and think the authors invention of events is probably close to what might happen in reality. Very believable. BUT, I was left wanting more at the end. Something wasn't there and something bored me about it. Overall, I'd recommend it, but don't look for a spectacular ending - just the expected.

0984536140|5.0|I signed up for a local college class in art, nothing to do with history. But when I was touring the campus bookstore I found this little book. I checked my iPhone to compare prices and amazon was cheaper than the bookstore so I ordered from amazon instead. I had to order because after looking at this book it was clear there was something missing from my WWII history knowledge.     I have always been a history buff and loved anything to do with WWII, but somehow I never read Hitler's own book. I guess I always assumed it was a hate filled rant and not worth reading. I now know that it is very much worth reading and this edition is especially worth reading.    This edition includes a lengthy introduction which includes a teacher's guide. Of course, it was written for the classroom, and it also has a student guide which gives a summary and explanation of Mein Kampf plus explains a lot about Hitler. Then there is the main introduction which explains even more history and explains the history of the translations of Mein Kampf. All fascinating and I had not even made it to the actual text of the book.    When I finished reading all the background, I was given a link to a supplement file that had even more information on Mein Kampf, the history behind it, when/where/how it was written, some inside secrets behind Hitler's writing style, and corrections that were made to this edition plus parts that were restored.     Now, finally I can return to this book from the file and start actually reading Mein Kampf. It was great! I learned a lot about the times and Weimar that I never knew before. It is funny how they don't tell you everything in history books. This edition also includes notes right in the text which explain things I would not have known. It is very nice  because I might be lazy and not look up a person or place, and even if I did I would get a general description. The notes in this book are clearly aimed at students because they explain people along with their relevance to the area where they are mentioned, not just a generic description. It is obvious a lot of research went into this book.    I am glad I found it and it is a great book even if you are not a college student but just a student of WWII.
0385738757|5.0|Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end. No more puzzles. No more variables. And no more running. Thomas was sure that escape meant he and the Gladers would get their lives back. That's what Thomas thought, but experienced young adult dystopian readers knew better and hoped for another installment in the story.  James Dashner did not disappoint.  The story of Thomas, Teresa and the other Gladers continues in The Scorch Trials.  They thought Teresa had triggered the end in The Maze Runner, but the truth is the end for the outside world was triggered long ago.  Burned by a scorching sun and infected by a mysterious disease known as the flare, the world is a wasteland.  The government has disintegrated, replaced by something called WICKED.  The Gladers have only just begun to run.  Can they make it through another trial to the safe haven and the promised cure for the Flare? And will they ever figure out who the good guys are?<br /><br />If you enjoyed The Hunger Games trilogy, you will enjoy this series.  It has a somewhat more edgy sharpness to it.  This highlights the danger the characters are constantly facing. The reader can feel Thomas' confusion, frustration and fear leap off the page.  The action never slows down in this second book.  At the end I felt almost as exhausted as Thomas and I can't wait for the next installment.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|I love Taylor! Seriously... I could not wait for this album to come out!    With that said, I find this album to be a little over polished for a country album. A little too popish for my taste. I miss the simple guitar songs that Taylor has been so perfect at creating- AHHHHH!     This album still has the quirky Taylor lyrics with the \\"ha-ha, sucks for you undertone\\" which she works like no other singer/ songwriter. Guy bashing, check. Inspirational feel good song, check.     Songs I can't stop listening to (my BF will know them by the end of the week since I have been singing them non stop:)) ... MEAN- great music!.... and SPEAK NOW- catchy!
031603438X|3.0|I will be brief, this is not a 5 star book. If you love The Stones, you will find it worth reading. If you expect to find out anything new, you won't find much here. As to the claim by Keith that he remembers it all, I doubt any true fan of the group, no matter how much you might idolize Keith, would believe that. As an example, Keith makes sure we know Brian Jones was not the leader of the Stones, although when it suits his purpose, such as the firing of Ian Stewart, its Brian who carries out the deed. Not because he was the leader, but since he thought he was, the unpleasant chore falls to him. This contradiction shows up in several places. Also, Ian Stewart is the founder of the band, according to Keith, even though Brian placed the newspaper ad the band formed around, its one more example of Keith making sure Brian gets as little credit as possible. The naming of the band also is now a group decision, or a Mick, Keith and Brian decision, even though in every other book I've read about the band Brian gets credit for the name.   As for whats good about it, some of Keith's stories are amusing, and he is obviously sincere in telling many of them. However, it isn't the book many lifelong Stones fans will expect. Read it, but don't get your hopes up.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|I still haven't seen the original, but my friends wanted me to see this with them. There were a few scenes that will make you jump and scream. This movie is sort of a prequel and sequel combined to the characters of the original. After their house is robbed, the sister of Katie and her family put up cameras all around their house. It starts off slow, but things gradually get scarier. I would probably recommend PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2!!!
B003L20ICE|2.0|I really wanted to like this film but when one of the \\"Lesbian\\" Woman starts an affair with a \\"Straight\\" male, they lost me. Being Gay isn't something you can change or turnoff like the Julianne Moore character.<br />Since a Lesbian Woman wrote this film, you would expect that she wouldn't take the easy way out and go with the cliched plot point. If you can get past this, you may like the movie.<br />How is it that it turns out to be the Mans fault at the end? They tell him to get out of their life but they are the ones who sought him out. It takes two to tango and the Woman was just as much responsible.<br />What does she get? One night on the couch.<br />Good performances for sure but the script really needed some work.
0393072231|5.0|This book is not just interesting but a pure 100% dynamic entertainment as it takes the reader through the past 7-8 years of the sub-prime debacle. Highly recommend even for non-financiers as it is written in very engaging and Layman language. Even after you move on past the WOW factor, it's an impactful read.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I became a fan of Keith's the first time I heard \\"Love Somebody Like You\\" from \\"Golden Road\\". His energy, passion, emotion, irresistible hooks (and looks), and lyrics that are unpretentious yet beautiful combined with his incredible talent and ability to put on a good show is what makes him such an enjoyable artist.<br /> He can make you throw your arms out to the world and let in the sun with his characteristic carefree spirit and in the next track make you want to break down and cry. He is by far my favorite country artist.<br />In Defying Gravity, he doesn't introduce anything we haven't heard. His sonic and vocal experimentation of \\"Love, Pain, and the whole crazy thing\\" didn't quite work and he must have discovered to stick with what he's good at: feel-good country/pop. Not that any of this material is shallow. On the contrary, I think that the last track \\"Thank You\\" is one of the most emotionally brilliant songs I've ever heard from any artist. It's a bare and honest testimony of his past and his life and how he was saved by love. Keith just lays his soul out for you to hear. I didn't move a muscle when I first heard it and by the end I was in tears. And I'm a guy!<br />The rest of the album, for the most part, showcases Keith's irrepressible optimism. More than anything else, Defying Gravity is about falling in love, summer romance, and opening up your heart. \\"Kiss a Girl\\" and \\"Sweet Thing\\" are the top summer singles of the album, both full of energy and excitement about falling in love. Sweet Thing, especially, is immensely catchy. \\"If Ever I Could Love\\" starts out with an intro you'll be tapping your foot to before a word is sung. I love Keith's use of  tribal-type drums toward the end. I would say that this is the highlight track as far as music goes. \\"Till Summer Comes Around\\" follows with a moody guitar hook and blue lyrics about a lost love. Beautiful song full of imagery. \\"My Heart is Open\\" and \\"Hit the Ground Runnin\\" are typical Keith, even if they aren't top-knotch. I could take or leave either of them. \\"Only You Can Love Me This Way\\" is a sweet, acoustic ballad reminiscent of \\"Making Memories of Us\\". Might be my personal favorite of the album. With \\"Standing Right in Front of You\\" and \\"I'm In\\" Keith is back with signature style and puppyish enthusiasm about love. \\"Why's It Feel So Long\\" employs an interesting calypso, islandy groove that sounds almost like Kenny Chesney. He pulls it off though, and it's a nice, easy-listening track after all the energy of the album. And we've already gone over \\"Thank You\\". So powerful<br />Musically, there's not much gravity that hasn't already been defied by him. The title is probably more about the subject matter, although Keith has always been a tremendously brilliant musician and songwriter. But I think he went a little conservative on this album. There's some variation and experimentation, but not too much. It's basically good, solid music that won't drive away any listeners. And if you were already a fan of Keith's, I think you'll love this album.  I would rate it number two of his collection, after \\"Be Here\\" which showcased more musical diversity, but still, I was thrilled with it.
0525951652|5.0|I am surprised at all the bad reviews of this book.  Yes, it was the most expensive Kindle book I have ever bought, but I did not feel cheated when I finished!    I loved \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\"  Couldn't wait to read \\"Fall of Giants.\\"  I was not disappointed!  The characters were varied and interesting.  I loved the way they were from all walks of life but were inter-twined into the story.  I downloaded the Kindle sample the day it was released, and had downloaded the entire book before bedtime that same day.    The only negative comment I have is the detailed descriptions of war battles that occurred during WWI.  But I skimmed through those and do not feel I missed anything from the story.    I will add that I also read \\"World Without End,\\" and I was very disappointed.  The story took place some 200 years after \\"Pillars,\\" and it just was not a sequel.   But I am just adding this comment to let the reader know I don't like ALL Ken Follett historical fiction.
B00316DDVS|5.0|The first time I heard of John Frusciante, (I have listened to the RHCPs, but didn't know about his solo work) I was reading a short blog where someone said they liked to drop acid, climb into a sleeping bag backwards and listen to a John Frusciante album on headphones.  That was enough to pique my interest, so I started with The Empyrean.    On first listen, I thought it was pretty good. After 5 listens I was realizing I had found something truly special.  After 10 listens I periodically wept as I listened, overwhelmed by the beauty of this man's work.    After a lifetime of listening to a wide array of music, from Prog rock bands like Genesis, Queen and Pink Floyd, to modern electronic marvels such as Shpongle, I am delighted to find an artist who is mixing a wide array of genres into a seamlessly beautiful masterpiece such as this.    Simply outstanding. I shall recommend this to all of my musician friends.
B003WTE886|5.0|Well done Taylor! I haven't stopped listening to it yet. Fun cd with some heartfelt songs as well. I LOVE \\"Never Grow Up\\" as a mom it gets me every single time. Love it!
B003XRZZFM|5.0|Incredible new release. Powerful and full of headbashing rhythm that makes me want to run through snow covered forests to dusty plains under a blanket of stars while my muscles are fueled by the energy being fed to me through my headphones. Keep those horns high and let the black flame burn Dimmu and all metal bands and fans the world over. Kill, kill, kill....for metal!

1400064287|4.0|The Heath brothers focus on a concept that has been analyzed by psychologists and authors alike, the concept of ideas \\"sticking.\\" After reading Malcolm Galdwell's book, The Tipping Point, they decided to write a book about one of his theories \\"the stickiness factor.\\" They wrote the book to help the reader understand why some ideas \\"stick\\" and others do not. The term \\"stick\\" simply means that \\"your ideas are understood and remembered, and have a lasting impact- they change your audiences opinions or behaviors.\\"    In the process of writing the book, the brothers took the time to actually examine various sticky ideas. In this analysis, they were able to determine six principles on what makes a concept stick. They are: Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotions and Stories. They took these principles and said to create a successful idea it must be \\"a Simple Unexpected Concrete Credentialed Emotional Story.\\" It was also interesting how these words form the acronym, SUCCESs. After introducing the relatively simple concept, the authors use the rest of the book to explain each of these individual principles.    Chip and Dan use various examples that people can relate to at some point in their lives. Their stories are interesting and make easy reads that makes the reader want more. The principal that   stood out most to me was Principle #5- Emotions. In the quest to get your idea/product to stick in someone's mind, you must be able to form an emotional attachment with people. In order for an idea to stick to a person, they have to care about it. The best way to get someone to care for our ideas is by associating the idea with  emotions that already exists. The idea must appeal to the person's self-interest, but at the same time appeal to  the person they may want to be.     I found Made to Stick to be an interesting read. Most of us come up with good ideas, and we want people to hear them and remember them, but we don't know how to go about doing it theright way. This book gives the reader some tools to use to make ideas \\"sticky\\" so that they go beyond the \\"in one ear, out the other\\" normal situation. Overall, this book is a good easy read and recommend it to anyone that wants their ideas to stick.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|I just love movies that open up a whole set of emotion by allowing one to live and feel along with the characters without forcing them into a pre-prepared emotional ride.<br /><br />The film spoke to me so retrospectively. My my father had just died in a flood and I had to cut short my harrowing travels through Nepal and India. I had to rush home and attend a memorial service and face my two sisters who I haven't seen in seven years and a mom who I haven't seen in thirteen. Just like the movie we all had to face each other as people changed by time and tragedy and find that we dislike each other greatly but find out inevitably that we are unbreakable in our love for each other because we are family. And, oh yes just like the brothers in the movie, we were smoking in my father's garage because cleaning a flooded-out house just sucks the breath out of you.<br /><br />It is to me one of the most well-crafted, well assembled and visually appealing movies to date. I have always like Wes Andersen since the World Aquatic with Steve Zissou. He has a way of manipulating visual atmosphere and arranging scenes with spare dialogue making it richer without overcrowding it. He is a whole new style on his own while somehow borrowing from the past. I do agree with some when they say he is a genius.
B000000W94|5.0|I really like this CD. I had read of Gary Moore and Peter Green but this is my first Moore CD. I got the best of two this way. Good music, great songs, some fantastic solos. I don't believe you will regret buying this one.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|No doubt, this is one of the best \\"soundtracks\\" I have ever listened to. Its totally epic and if you need some music to push you, that's the right collection.    I hope they will sell more of their creations in the future.
B003JTHESA|4.0|First, a little about myself.  I am not a long-time Maiden fan like many of those who have offered up their own fantastic reviews.  I've only really expanded my knowledge of heavy metal within the last couple of years, but I've done my best to approach the genre in a comprehensive manner.  Where Iron maiden is concerned, I'm most familiar thanks to the Flight 666 documentary, the amazing Live After Death album, and this The Final Frontier (including seeing them in concert for the tour of the same name).  So, in short, I'm fairly familiar with their pre-90's work and know very little of their newer material.    Second, I've latched onto the sub-genres of progressive and sludge/doom metal the most; so the progressive sound of The Final Frontier doesn't bother me.  Sure, there's an obvious contrast between the galloping choruses of their classic songs and this latest effort, but Maiden seems to have weathered the transition admirably.  The Final Frontier definitely requires a larger portion of the listener's attention to appreciate, but this is common of most progressive music.    Finally, I'll try to keep the remainder of this review short.  The single most impressive thing about The Final Frontier is how smoothly the themes play out across significant points in Earth's history.  Discovery and existence itself are presented with illustrations of the American western frontier, the legend of Arthur and his knights, early seafaring explorers, and of course the unknown reaches of outer space.  The Final Frontier doesn't romanticize the subject matter, though, and instead takes a more political approach.  The lyrics imply that such historical hallmarks were/will be motivated by greed and selfishness.  The album has a very dystopian feel overall.    My biggest criticism has to do with the sound mixing.  Each member of Maiden puts on a fantastic performance but sadly it all sounds a bit washed out.  The depth  and sharpness of sound just isn't there.  I hope that The Final Frontier is eventually remastered for the better.    All in all, Maiden is skillfully moving forward in a new direction and I'm very excited to see where it's headed.  Highly recommended to all who aren't too deeply set in their preconceived notions of Maiden or prog metal in general.
B003F256T0|5.0|My son likes this toy alot. He says this is one of the best and most durable Dragonball Z figures he had so far. This is a very well detailed toy. It comes with super saiyan and super saiyan 2 heads, which he loves. He also uses all 6 faces and every pair of hands that comes with this toy.
0385342047|4.0|I have been laughing while reading since the first book in this series. Becky's got some questionable attitudes, but she's really a nice person...So even though it would seem that she has not changed since book 1, she's still very lovable. Come to think of it, if Becky Brandon ever changes, then there might not be a book 7, 8, 9, etc.... I'd rather have Becky stay the way she is.
1439133948|5.0|Just got the book and anxiously pulled out the CD I'd heard mentioned in other reviews.  YES!!! E-book versions of ALL the Miles books.  I've been doing the Amazon \\"request a kindle version\\" for all of them, only now I'm delighted to get them all for a mere $13.99 (but I have already bought paper copies of every one, yes). Plus I get the new book in both paper and e-book. I'm saving Cryoburn for a special treat when I've got more time to savor it. Okay, I did sneak a peak at the very exciting beginning. Not sure how long I can hold out.  Thank you Ms. Bujold and Baen publishing!  Not exactly sure what they are thinking giving it all away, but I wish some of my other favorite series would do this.  If you haven't read a Miles Vorkosigan book before, I have no idea if Cryoburn itself is a good place to start, but since you get the whole series on CD, you can find out which one would be, if you have a computer or any e-reader.  And if you love them as much as I (and many others) do, go and buy the paper copies for yourself or as gifts so they stay in business and get Ms. Bujold to write more!  My copies are well-worn from being passed around and re-read.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|Out of the 3 prenatal WORKOUT-workout (i.e. not yoga/pilates) DVDs I've purchased, this is the middle ground one - it's not as vigorous as Teddi Bryant but it's more of a workout than Leisa Hart.  Consequently this is happily the one I do the most!  It's only 40 minutes which makes it easy for me to do the whole thing in the mornings before work (& yeah sometimes I only have time to do parts of my DVDs but that's another story).  Note I am a regular exerciser, am \\"advanced\\" in workout-DVDspeak - I normally do 3-5 days of cardio/strength a week at the gym (was an avid spinner/stepper until knee issues occurred 10/2009, now I do just cardio machines for aerobics).  I'd call this DVD intermediate to intermediate/advanced.  The first time I did this in my 2nd trimester, I definitely could feel the workout but it was very doable; it's work but not strenuous work.  I continue to feel this way throughout my pregnancy (I'm 33 wks now) - it's a workout, but it's not SUPERvigorous.  Which makes an outstanding daily workout.  BUT if you're a gym rat that needs a big dose of endorphins (not the moderate regular gulp that this gives you), I suggest supplementing this DVD with more strenuous activities like regular gym workouts or Teddi Bryant's prenatal workout.  If you're okay with moderate-to-advanced activity, or are at an intermediate/beginner level, this DVD would be perfect as your only workout (or one of a few workouts).  Erin works your whole body with excellent explanations - you know everything is pregnancy-safe & you get lots of info about the changes in your body.  AND Erin has a terrific personality - friendly, fun, articulate!  Yes it's in a \\"living room\\" setting (is that coffee table really a piece of glass on stacks of books? heh) but at least it's a bright, warming & welcoming room.  The workout uses stuff most people can find in their own homes - a sofa/easy chair, a doorway or wall, a straight back chair - so not having to drag out extra exercise equipment isrefreshing.  Sure the music (synthesized kids' music/lullabies) isn't ideal & I wish there was more cardio but I'm finding prenatal videos as a whole don't really have much cardio... trust me, your pulse will get going when you do strength while preggo!  I haven't tried the partner workout but I'm wondering if James Denton was trying to be funny by being so lackadaisical in the beginning...c'mon James, show some support & enthusiasm!  Your wife is rocking this prenatal workout!  Some of the things that Erin says in the relaxation/stretch get me emotional, in a good way... what a great way to end the DVD.  This workout leaves me feeling wonderful & I highly recommend it. :)
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|There will definitely be a few hits from this CD.  Our First Time, You Can Count On Me, and my favorite Lazy Song  Great harmonies with collaborating artists and really well mixed vocal and instrumental sounds.

1453837736|2.0|I understand that Pride and Prejudice is an honored classic.  However, for me personally, I finally listened to myself and put the book away after reading about half of the story.  The problem is that the characters are shallow and pretentious, and are simply not very likable or compelling. I think the novel, with all its gossipy nature, is the 1812 version of celebrity gossip television shows.<br /><br />I have read most of the English classics from the 1800s, including truly great romance novels such as Wuthering Heights or Tess of the D'UrberVilles, but sadly, found Pride and Prejudice to be boring and not worth my time. Full disclosure, as a middle-aged male, I may not actually be the target audience for the book. However, it should appeal to young women about the same age as the protagonists.<br /><br />Updated years later: Forced myself to finish reading the novel; I stick with my original \\"thumbs way down\\" assessment.  The characters are all air-headed twits, shallow and stupid.  A waste of my time, and I have no idea how it became a classic.  Guys, this book is not for you - it is for young women.
B0030A0ZD4|4.0|While I can admit that Moonwalker is not a great film, as a Michael Jackson fan, it's always held a special place in my heart. It's a series of music videos (or short films) strung together with a pretty loose plot. Scrutinize it and it will fall apart, but if you don't take it too seriously, it can be very fun.<br /><br />With that said, if you're looking up import blu ray editions of the movie, you're likely a big enough fan of it (or Michael Jackson's music) that you don't need anyone to write a review telling you about the film itself. So instead of going into detail about the movie, I'll focus exclusively on the blu ray.<br /><br />Assuming Amazon keeps my review on the right page (I've seen reviews get tussled around to related items), the edition I'm referring to is the UK blu ray of Moonwalker. At present, there is no US version (nor was there an official US DVD edition) so I bought this to upgrade my import DVD and I was quite impressed with the results.<br /><br />First, let me say that this is a region-free blu ray, so it should work on any US blu ray player or PS3 and the packaging is entirely in English (with the exception of a little bit of Spanish on the disc art itself).<br /><br />The film itself is in full 1080p 1.85:1 widescreen, keeping it in its original theatrical aspect ratio, and the print looks beautiful. I've never been impressed with the A/V of Jackson's DVD releases in the past, but Moonwalker is very clean, preserving an 80s film-like look without any noticeable damage or dirt marks on the print. Colors are vibrant and contrast is consistent with the original look of the movie... if every Jackson release in the future looks this good, we could consider ourselves lucky.<br /><br />The audio, presented in DTS-Master Audio 5.1 surround, was just as impressive. I didn't find myself blown away by directional effects, but compared to past Jackson releases, as well as other movies of the era, this track certainly does the movie justice. Where it especially shines is when it's playing one of the music videos which, thanks to the higher bit rate blu ray provides over CD, has become my preferred way of listening to these songs (even when I'm not in the mood to watch the rest of the film).<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this release is that it was censored. I've had the VHS and DVD of this movie (both were left uncut) and now, for the first time, a line toward the end of the film, where Pesci's character Lideo threatens to get the kids high while holding a needle, was cut. I can't say that I particularly loved the line, but as a purist, it was kind of annoying for me to see anything cut. However, at the very least, the cut is handled in such a way that if you didn't know where the line was supposed to go, you likely wouldn't notice it. Other references to drugs (from Pesci's character) were left intact and there is no option to watch the original version of the film.<br /><br />A theatrical trailer is provided in anamorphic widescreen, and although its print is quite dirty, I was still very happy to see it on the disc. Generally, Jackson DVDs leave special features on the cutting room floor so, at the very least, it was great to have something.<br /><br />For the clean, clear and vibrant presentation with a great audio track and a bonus trailer, I'd have easily given the UK blu ray edition of Moonwalker a 5/5, however, I can't in good conscience give it a perfect score when the film's been cut... especially after Jackson's death when he is no longer around to have had a say in the matter. So I'll leave it with a 4/5, and a very high recommendation to fans nonetheless.he music videos which, thanks to the higher bit rate blu ray provides over CD, has become my preferred way of listening to these songs (even when I'm not in the mood to watch the rest of the film).

B00005KHEU|5.0|After getting into ELO several months ago, I have ventured throughout their discography: from Out of the Blue to Balance of Power, Time to Face the Music. During this time I read a lot of reviews of ELO and their other albums. One thing I noticed was a lot of complaints that Discovery (or \\"disco very\\" as it's sometimes called) was filled with disco and was a sub-par album. Expecting the worst I purchased this album. I have to say, I was very surprised! This is one of my favorite ELO albums!<br /><br />Where's all the disco I'm hearing about? Sure Shine a Little Love and Last Train to London have a disco sound to them, but that seems to be the extent of it to my ears. I hear some beautiful ballads, including Need Her Love and Midnight Blue, the latter of which is my favorite song on the album. The strings really get a chance to shine on that track (one of the last times that'll happen with ELO). Need Her Love has a unique vocal melody, but it certainly grows on you after a couple listens!<br /><br />As for the \\"disco\\" tracks of Shine a Little Love and Last Train to London, they're very fun and catchy songs. Shine a Little Love has actually been one of my favorites since I bought their Strange Magic \\"best of\\" album a while ago. One of my other favorites from that compilation is Confusion. I'd say after Midnight Blue that is my second favorite song on the album. Confusion to me has a very \\"Out of the Blue\\" feel (which is definitely a good thing)!<br /><br />Then we have The Diary of Horace Wimp. Another interesting, yet catchy, tune. The build-up to the first chorus on that song, with the piano and then the drums, makes for a great foot-tapper. I always find myself drumming along with Bev Bevan on that one.<br /><br />And who can forget their big hit Don't Bring Me Down, which is featured on this album. As with a lot of the biggest hits of my favorite bands (Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen is another great example), I find this song to be one of the weakest of the album. It's good, don't get me wrong. But it just doesn't stick in my head like some of the others. However, I'd say the weakest song on the album, in my opinion, is Wishing. I've read a lot of positive reviews about this song. For some reason it just doesn't do anything for me. This is the one song I sometimes skip on the album.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give Discovery 9 out of 10. It has a ton of gems that just get stuck in your head all day. Jeff Lynne is a musical genius! While there are a couple weaker songs on the album, the better ones certainly make up for it! I wouldn't recommend this album to a new ELO listener. For someone looking to get into ELO, get their Strange Magic compilation double album. It'll give you a little taste of all their pre-2001 albums. From there I'd go with Out of the Blue, and then maybe on to Face the Music and/or A New World Record. Those are ELO's greatest, in my opinion. After that Discover makes an excellent addition to your ELO collection!wrong. But it just doesn't stick in my head like some of the others.

1449389627|5.0|Ever wanted permission to passionately explore something at work or play at a new challenge? Maybe fail a few (dozen) times without any real loss of face? Scott's exposure of innovation strips away the unhuman saintliness of the moment and exposes the hours of dedication and rejection that come before and after most real innovations. He releases us from the illusion that progress must be immediately game-changing, earth-shattering, and other hyphen-accentuated superlatives.<br /><br />More than once the reader is admonished to do and to create; not just to consume.  Creative success comes to market birthed from experimentation, wonder, failure, and perseverance. This book deserves a good read and a long review. I've given it the first but am inspired to implement it more than blather about it. If you'll excuse me, I'm overdue some creative adventure.
0486274268|5.0|This book isn't going to be any good to you if you're looking for hardcore muscle/bone structure, but if that's the case a veterinary textbook will probably serve you just fine.

Not many words in this one, but not many are needed-- what words are there are extremely insightful and helpful. Cannot recommend this enough!

B00127RAJY|5.0|Anyone familiar with Jillian Michaels knows that there's a lot more to her than just a great body. I have never purchased a fitness dvd in my life; partly because I'm in great shape and also because I'm disgusted by pretty women with nice bodies who because of that make workout dvd's.  Nice body does not parallel strength and overall health and fitness. This dvd really pushes your body to do more than what you would usually do in the gym. Though I eat well, am in great shape, and maintain a moderate workout schedule, I still felt the burn...and I also felt it on level one! There are two choices with \\"30 Day Shred\\" that really separates Jillian from every other attractive female with a workout dvd and that's the two options she provides. There's a trainer who completes the routine on a moderate level and one who completes it on an advanced level. I completed the challenge on the advanced level but would likely have felt a burn had I completed it on a moderate level. Also, all of the women maintain very feminine shapes which is great for those who are interested in an intense workout without bulking up. Lastly, you do not need outdated or bulky workout equipment. The video does call for hand weights which I did not have but substituted for water bottles. I highly recommend for all fitness levels.

B0048IMZMG|5.0|Taylor Swift has progressed not only as a songwriter, but as a singer. In this album she has opened up her heart and it has bled \\"progress\\".  Songwriting is great. Singing is better than \\"FEARLESS\\".  The young girl has ANGST, and it's apparent.  For those that don't know:  Angst, often confused with anxiety, is a transcendent emotion in that it combines the unbearable anguish of life with the hopes of overcoming this seemingly impossible situation. Without the important element of hope, then the emotion is anxiety, not angst. Angst denotes the constant struggle one has with the burdens of life that weighs on the dispossessed and not knowing when the salvation will appear. An airplane crashes into the side of a remote snow-covered mountain; those passengers that worry about their lives without hopes of survival only face anxiety. In contrast, those passengers who worry about their lives with hopes of survival but do not know when the rescue party will arrive face angst.

I can't stop listening to it! Go Taylor!!
B0042KZJR8|5.0|This is a great 1CD (21 songs, Amazon) or 2 CD combo (22 songs, Import CD) release by the Canadian singer-song writer/crooner, Michael Buble' titled, \\"Crazy Love Hollywood Edition\\". The first 13 songs on '1CD Amazon Edition' are as per \\"Crazy Love\\" album, which has mostly raving 331 reviews as of today here on Amazon.The remaining 8 songs are what is contained in \\"Hollywood The Deluxe EP\\" or Disc 2 of 'Import CD', described/reviewed as follows : The first CD is the number 1 bestselling album, \\"Crazy Love\\" [This album has been in the Amazon Top 100 list for more than one year now, a great release by Michael Buble']. It has a bonus track, \\" Some Kind Of Wonderful\\", a great (Gerald Goffin/Carole King) classic done beautifully by Michael Buble'. If you haven't heard/own this album, please do so soon, it's 5 stars affair, a highly recommended listening! Disc 2 is the 'new album' : has 8 tracks, five of which are great live recording/performances by Michael Buble' & three 'new' studio tracks. The opening track, \\"Hollywood\\" is the first single/video : it's an ok track with great guitar chords & vocals by Michael Buble'. Track 4, \\"End Of May\\" is a great solid track with great piano interlaced with some exquisite beautiful violin with great lyrics & vocals to boot! Track 8, \\" Best Of Me\\" is a rather interesting cover version & interpretation of the great classic song that David Foster (producer on this album) released in the 90s. The remaining 5 tracks are great live recordings/performances by Michael Buble' : \\"At This Moment\\", \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\", \\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\", \\"Heartache Tonight\\" [from the number 1 bestseller album, \\"Crazy Love\\"] & well known old favourite, \\"Twist And Shout\\". If you already own \\"Crazy Love\\" album, I recommend you to rather buy \\"Hollywood Deluxe EP\\". If you don't own \\"Crazy Love\\" album, this is a great CD for you especially that Amazon has reduced/slashed its price significantly (half price)!
0385523912|5.0|I discovered Barbara Demick when she was interviewed on the Dennis Prager show and was immediately interested in the book.  It turned out to be one of the most fascinating reads I have had in a long time.  Her writing is immersive, achingly descriptive and compassionate.  I came away from it with a sense of awe at the tenacity of the North Koreans, sadness for all of their terrible losses, and a deep sense of gratitude for being born in a free country.  She says herself that it is impossible to know everything that has/is happening there, but her accounts are an excellent window into this strange land.  Well done Ms. Demick!
B00007K02F|5.0|Loved it!!! So wonderfully romantic and I think this movie has brought to life an old classic.  William Hurt is execellent as the aloof and mysterious man of the house. Has a few twists and turns that keeps the movie going.  Glad I purchased it for my collection.
014241543X|5.0|What a beautiful book, captivating, interesting, a page-turner if there ever was one.  I cried several times, hoping, hoping...<br /><br />The story is told through in two alternating parts:  the memory of a life and the events shortly following a horrific accident.  The juxtaposition of these two is seamless, as Gayle Forman fills in the details of a life for the reader to admire, to love.  Her characters seem real, and the relationships what you'd find in real-life.  While some authors contrive to make teenagers hate their parents, you won't find that here.  The parents, grandparents, brother, boyfriend, and best-friends all fulfill their roles as this book moves from breakfast to a new life.<br /><br />Music lovers will find Mia, a seventeen year-old cellist, a true lover of music.<br />It was rather funny reading the word \\"Discman,\\" which caused me to wonder if the Young Adults who read this book will recognize the Sony product of yesteryear.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout are words of wisdom placed in the mouths of the wise.  When asked why he quite the rock-star lifestyle, Mia's father replied, \\"I'd played that part of my life out.... Sometimes you make choices in life and sometimes choices make you.\\"  And Mia, at age ten, affirms, \\"When you feel sad, you look sad.\\"<br /><br />If I stay?  That was the choice that Mia had to choose between, to stay or to...
B000U91OII|5.0|My application originally required a 50mm fan and I ordered this by mistake. Nevertheless, it's about 1/10th as loud as the NVIDIA-supplied fan and seems to cool the chipset just as well. I actually can't even hear this thing running. It's virtually silent! Scythe comes through again!
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|Bonamassa has been my favourite for many years,and thanks to him this record makes it.I got the record for about 14 days ago and last Friday 22/10 i saw him live in Gothenburg (Sweden) and that was one of my greatest moments.
B003YGSLDA|4.0|Is this the best movie ever made? No it isn't. However I would hate to see someone pass this movie over because a review said this was a awful movie. This movie is a typical christmas movie, its there not to really wow someone with a story or effects but to explore another place in our memories and answer a few questions that we may have about a magical season. However I don't want to sell this movie short! The story of Santa has been told many times and we see him created from a mere mortal or we see him in modern times dealing with the realities of today. Whats unique about this movie is that it gives as a look at the evolution from the basic wooden toymaker to the man who brings us bikes and video games. No we don't see the toyshop turn into a video game studio but we get to see how Santa has remained timeless even though we may not have. I find it very hard to believe that even the cold hearted wouldnt get a little choked up when Santa takes his first flight, or when he is awed by the toys waiting for delivery. I realize this is not a Christmas classic yet like WhIte Christmas or Its a Wonderful Life however this movie has something we can only attribute to magic surrounding the Christmas season.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|As always this man delivers.I have been looking forward for a livealbum and now it came.GREAT.
1607050072|5.0|Ok, I have to admit I hate buying books that I have never laid my eyes on or touched, but I braved it and ordered this book based on the cover. While some of the projects are a tad redundant, I love the lay-out and find it absolutely inspirational. There is a range of skill level represented and anyone can pick this book up and start creating. Beautiful lay-out and neat projects. I think anyone would enjoy it. Ok, off to peruse it a little longer.
B003TSEL7S|2.0|I read the first seires Percy Jackson and the Olypians while it was fairly obscoure and when this came out a whole lot of people urged me to read it but I hate popularity so I didnt. On a whim I decided to try the free sample on the Kindle. TOTAL RIPOFF. Really. It was soooo predictable and I suck at predicting too. Maybe later in the book its better the whole freaking first chapter it was like &#34;Oh theyre at a school for bad kids their demigods. He has a freaking drachma that turns into sword.&#34; Hmmm... anything like a certain pen I know? I wonder how he fly. Seriously. He can freaking fly. Is he related to a certain God of the sky? Oh and dont get me started on Pieper and Leo. Hmmm... all the boys love her. Great with his hands. Who could they be huh? Dont get me wrong I love the characters but do we really need another son of the Big Three? Wasnt the whole freaking last seires about not forgeting the minor gods and stuff? I do like Butch obviously a son of Iris but what about Hectate and Nemisis and Eros and Tyche and Janus and Morpheus and Helois and maybe Nike and Hebe and Nosoi or Charites just to name a few of the top of my head. Urrrg! Anyway youll probably like this if you havent read the first seires but if you have maybe not so much.
B000001FN3|5.0|I loved the old Vincent Price movies he did doing those old Edgar Allan Poe stories.  When the Alan Parsons Project, came out with \\"Tales Of Mystery And Imagination Edgar Allan Poe\\" #38, I knew I had to get it.  When it was first released, it didn't have the voice of the legendary Orson Welles.  If you like Edgar Allan Poe's writings, get this excellent album.  This album produced 2 hits, and the orchestration by Andrew Powell is just something else.      \\"The Raven\\", #80 is a classic song with vocals by Mr. Alan Parsons himself, the crazed vocals of Arthur Brown (Crazy World) fame on \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", John Miles sings on 2 of my favorite tracks, \\"Cask Of Amontillado\\" and the #37 hit \\"(The System Of) Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether\\", the instrumental \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher\\" and the nice ballad \\"To One In Paradise\\".  Turn out the lights and listen to this album by yourself in the dark, and feel a little scared.       In 2003, Lou Reed came out with his take of Edgar Allan Poe, on \\"The Raven\\", get the special edition version, great 2 CD set.
B000T5O48U|1.0|just inadequate in all avenues. A disaster of just boredom. It's boring. It's not scary. Give a go ahead nod to Dee Wallace, but people give this accolades of classic and the best horror, yadda yadda yadda, are you $#^@# kidding me man? Are you all from a lemming planet of suburbian mindlessness, as these movies seem to be shared by the same lot of people.<br /><br />Just horrendous. It's not scary. its not suspenseful, its not keen or cunning, its just garbage. Boring mundane incessant drivel. A nominal attempt at scary, done by yet another director who butchers amazing novels. Tommyknockers  AWFUL, Pet Semetary AWFUL, Langoliers SNOOZE FEST, The Dark-Half Inadequate, Storm of the Century AWFUL, Graveyard Shift BRUTALLY BAD....but all those books were stunning.<br /><br />CuCant, and Cuwont, more like CUjoke.
0811876373|5.0|It was everything I hoped for. Very thorough just actually fairly easy. Adore the book.
0060254920|5.0|This is a story of a boy who misbehaves and is disciplined by being sent to his room without supper.  In his anger he imagines himself sailing far away and landing in a place full of monsters.  He escapes being eaten by fooling the monsters and giving them the idea that he is a ferocious monster himself.  After he is made king he leads the monster in being terrible.  One day he gets bored and runs away from the monsters and sails back to his home where he returns to his room and finds his supper waiting for him.  This is a fun book for all ages and is worth the retelling of this story.  Jack gave this book two arm waves in the air and a growl.
B0040T7B2W|5.0|Ok. This ain't gonna be long: I've been a Belle & Sebastian fan for like ten years now and I've alwas wondered when whould they \\"write about love\\". This album is like paying a tax that they owed us for a very long time. \\"Little Lou, Uggly Jack, Prohet John\\" is simply perfect. I've also had the oportunity to assit to their Mexico live show and they where wonderful. That's all. They rock.<br /><br />(Pardonez mon anglais, svp!)
B0044XV3QY|4.0|blah blah blah, give us the 3D blu-ray already.  We have the technology, this is seriously just milking it.  Just release it in 3D on blu-ray.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|I used this for my notebook and desktop. My computers seem running very well & normal than before.
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Update- March 18, 2011-    Alright, perhaps I was being a little *too* harsh initially.  A good portion of Communique has grown on me, and in some cases, has grown on me significantly.      For some reason I didn't originally notice the downbeat and depressing quality of a song like \\"News\\", nor did I notice the catchy vocal melody of \\"One-Handed Sailor, and, despite sounding like a ripoff of \\"Water of Love\\", the chorus in \\"Angel of Mercy\\" is quite spectacular as well (though the verse melody in this particular track is probably better- best one on the entire album, in fact).      Even the title song has improved in my eyes and that's *definitely* a huge surprise because I hated it at first.  The only real weak point is the closer- \\"Follow Me Home\\".  It just fails to make any kind of impression on me whatsoever, plus the guitar playing is really weak here as well.  Without a doubt though, the very best song is the opener \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\".  It's so good it should have been featured on the bands debut album instead.  It certainly *sounds* like it should have been included there, anyway.  Oh, and hating a song like \\"Lady Writer\\" is basically impossible.  The rhythm of this track reminds me of \\"Down to the Waterline\\" a little bit, and the guitar solo near the end is fantastic.    Another aspect of the album that I somehow originally overlooked is the guitar playing.  It's really good when the band makes the decision to jam out in a few of the songs.  Unfortunately it never happens enough, which is disappointing.  This is why I recommend the debut over this- the guitar playing on THAT album is matched with some astonishing songwriting.  However, I'll admit my original review was an exaggeration and that Communique isn't as bas as I originally believed.  Sometimes original impressions change, and this is a golden example.  It's a good album.    Here's my original review submitted four months ago.  I'll keep it here just for the heck of it.    After having thepleasure of hearing the absolutely wonderful debut album, Dire Straits fails to make the follow-up *anywhere* in the same league.  Now the bands slower-paced, typically boring and musically devoid and uninteresting style of guitar rock has firmly taken hold with the release of Communique.      It didn't take long, did it?      The band had the opportunity to release exactly ONE glorious album before eventually settling into a routine of what sounds to me like pretty dull adult contemporary soft rock without any of the admirable qualities of their debut.      The debut album is NOT at all like this album thankfully.    However for those who love driving home on a rainy night and for those who prefer the atmosphere such a driving experience provides will *definitely* be able to appreciate an album like Communique on a level I'm not familiar with.  The album does feel like it's intended for people who appreciate quiet, moody soft rock music in all its glory.      However I'm someone who likes to hear quality songwriting and beautiful vocals, and this album fails to impress me like the debut album does.  I recommend skipping it unless you absolutely MUST find out what the bands second album is like, and simply think I'm exaggerating about its mediocrity.  I'm not.      I have to warn you though- besides the opening track, it's much different and worse in comparison to the first album.  It's just so gosh darn boring.  There, I had to say \\"boring\\" even though I promised myself I'd never resort to using that word because it's just so easy to throw around a word like that whenever Dire Straits is mentioned.     PLEASE go with Dire Strait's debut instead and you'll thank me.
B0029F21BA|5.0|I can always count on Clint Eastwood to make a good movie. Mystic River is just the right amount of drama-- obviously it has some disturbing ideas, but not sick and twisted ones you would see in horror movies (IMO). I mean the movie shows how characters cope with the trauma and troubles that they are faced with. I saw this movie when it came out and again just recently. It is one of my must own movies because it has such a great mysterious plot which kept me guessing. All of the actors including Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon gave great performances. The music suits the movie well. The only thing I found annoying was when Dave (Tim Robbins) kept talking about the forest and the wolf...Alot of people seem to complain about the ending. I think it was sufficient and well made. The idea is to make do with what has happened since you can't take back what has been said or done. etc..This movie gives you something to think about and has a satisfying plot, 5 stars .
B00127RAJY|5.0|My height is 5.9 and used to be 169.5 lbs.

But you could certainly follow it!<br />Part of a good thing about is that it only last about 20 minutes, but make you sweat more than 40 minutes of running.<br />Since work out is so hard, you gets more committed to sticking to your low calory diet (I call this a good spiral effect where one complements the other...hope you understand what I meant...).<br />Also, since it is in home excerciese, it's so accessable. (better than deciding whether to go to gim or not...just horrible doing that).<br /><br />After loosing 20 pounds, I think I could keep go on loosing and loosing, but I've stopped (dieting portion at least).<br />The reason was Co-workers and friends are saying, I've lost a bit excessively (never expected that, sigh).<br /><br />Even if I ever get all my weights back or more, now I know \\"HOW\\" to loose them.<br /><br />Anyway, best work out video ever!!!<br /><br />---<br />Oh, forgot about the bonus part.<br />Amongst many good things that comes with, I guess perhaps with any regular physical excercise, I was glad to find out that my stomach area was one of the first to go (At least in my case, since I'm not sure about the other types...)<br />Nevertheless, I'm not too thrilled about my finger or wrist getting narrower... I already have girly fingers and wrists to begin with.
