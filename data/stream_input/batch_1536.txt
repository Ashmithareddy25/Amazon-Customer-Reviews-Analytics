B0007TKNII|4.0|if you loved the the play, Phantom of the Opera, you will love this film. There are no restrictions in presenting these scenes, unlike live theatre, the characters are real, the music is sensational and the acting superb. I love this and I loved Love Never Dies, a follow on from the Phantom.<br />A must have for both. Thank you Amazon!

1936608898|5.0|Melissa's and Dallas' friendly approach to a reader (=me) made me very comfortable and it felt like I was sitting in their kitchen, drinking some kind of approved beverage and listening to them both talking to me about carbs, fasting and benefits of coconut fat. Funny parts (jokes, hahaha) were very well recognizable for me :) and they were even funny when translated to my language (of course, I was sharing the new knowledge with my boyfriend while reading!). It is hard to explain, but I never felt like that while reading a book. That hunger for moooore information (and what about the dairy, hey, tell me what exactly grains are playing with inside my belly, ha, I told my grandma red wine is a *hit and not a hearth healer), that joy I felt while reading! Because with ever new page it was more and more clear to me that I AM BACK WHERE I WANNA BE, and where I was a year ago, before I failed so terribly. I love that fact that it is not my fault that I crave junk (it is the junk's fault, blame the burger!!!). I loved the chapter about dairy, because I stopped doing dairy way before I discovered paleo and it did nothing but GOOD for me (I really can't even have a bit of cream in a coffee, otherwise I block a bathroom for days!!!).<br /><br />I love that every explanation in ISWF is amazingly simple and easy to remember, as I am a person who not only wants to know WHAT to do, but wanna be able to explain WHY. \\"Because Hartwigs said so\\" is a fantastic answer :D but my hunger for knowledge in this field doesn't get satisfied by that. Now I know WHY and I am able not only to explain, but to discuss!!! I tell everything to my boyfriend, since we are gonna get on a WholeLife wagon together. He suffers from a bad back acne his whole life and it really IS starting to get better since he is with me (understand since he is off dairy and grains). For him it is an amazing thing, he never though he will be able to get rid of that, now he not only sees a progress, but actually knows what was causing a problem. I rather fix a problem at his base, find a reason \\"why-is-this-happening\\" and \\"how-can-I-prevent-that\\" than buying a gallon of concealer to cover a pimple. And when someone asks me \\"what is bad about wholewheat bread???\\" I wanna be able to give them and answer that will not only explain, but also make them think. I made my mom stopped eating yogurts, and she was a person who was nervous without one a day! My boyfriend changes his sweet soda for plain water at lunch. I threw away so many things from my pantry, because I just couldn't live with that stuff in my house, even though I never used it.<br /><br />It may sound a little bit to over the top, but I would call ISWF \\"A Guide To Life.\\" Not a healthy life, happy life, nutrient dense life. Just LIFE. It is for sure a bible of MY life. I am never getting back to potato chips, cookies, thick creamy sauces and heavy ice cream. Never. The same way that I knew, when smoking my last cigarette (as the Easyway, sorry again, tells you to do after reading it), that I will NEVER light another one, I am 100% convinced into living a WholeLife. The fact that my life partner is on board with me is even more exciting.<br /><br />It Starts With Food to me was kinda \\"old news.\\" I already knew all the information (or at least the basic outline). But I SO desperately needed to read it. I believe it saved me. And there is nobody else I can be thankful for that than amazing Hartwigs! Thank you guys, from all my heart. It does start with food.<br /><br />If you are slightly interested in your well being (well, you only have one body for life, right?), consider trying Whole30. I guarantee it will change your life. It Starts With Food is a must-have guide for everyone who is serious about their well health, doesn't have stubborn opinions (people drink milk for generations dude!!!!). Buy it on Amazon! Hardcover and also a Kindle version (I have both, silly, right?) available, plus you can get a lots of downloadablegoodies on the site (these are really helpful!). If there is just one book you need to read about food and the way you should be eating to maintain healthy and happy body, this is just it.goodies on the site (these are really helpful!). If there is just one book you need to read about food and the way you should be eating to maintain healthy and happy body, this is just it.

B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I'm in the group that isn't ashamed to say that they loved and still love `Shrek'.  Our faction is dying off and is being replaced by a growing group of individuals that refuse to admit they were initially smitten and instead insist on claiming the film to be a saccharine mess with no redeemable value and worthy of nothing but scorn.  Seriously, if you do not know of the existence of this group then please visit any film discussion forum and you will find thousands of them.  Saying all of this; I am also not afraid to point out that after the initial moment of animated bliss, this franchise has nosedived.  The second `Shrek' was a bore, the third a minor upstep and then that fourth was a total abomination.<br /><br />I was skeptical about Puss getting his own gig.<br /><br />Thankfully, this film is a complete treasure.  Think what you will and balk all you want, but `Puss in Boots' is actually better than `Shrek' ever was because it has more grounded focus, better jokes (that are less pop culture heavy and more solidified in their own origins) and crisper animation.  Also, I love the way that the film isn't afraid of creating a villain that isn't completely wicked.  I have a pet peeve with children's films that center on the epitome of cruel.  I mean, I love `Toy Story 3' as much as the next guy, but did Lotso really have to be that wicked, so wicked as to attempt to murder the toys that just saved his life?  So, I was very pleased to see a redemption take place here that made the film feel more kid friendly.<br /><br />Yes, the names Puss and Soft Balls are an obvious crude humor joke directed at the adults in the room, but I let that one slide.<br /><br />Seriously, this one is SO good.  Any fan of animation, fairy tales, the cast or the original `Shrek' will eat this up.  Antonio should stick to cartoons, and Mr. Galifianakis is on a roll!  The plot, which incorporates Jack and Jill as well as Jack and the Beanstalk is clever, witty and comes full circle, and the big reveal sequence concerning Humpty Dumpty (complete with slow motion flashback) was spot on perfection and left me in complete stitches.  HIS FACE!!!!<br /><br />UGH, I love this movie!e big reveal sequence concerning Humpty Dumpty (complete with slow motion flashback) was spot on perfection and left me in complete stitches.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Terrific suspense with a low body count, this book pivots on how distorted a relationship can become when ids and egos run unbridled. These won't become your favorite characters, but are they ever a hoot to follow. Oh yes ... more humor than your likely to find in any mystery/thriller this year.
B006RUJST6|5.0|When I think about how a book should make you feel; sad, angry, frustrated, happy, laugh out loud, & most of all hopeful.  Slammed did that for me.  The way the author used her words to create such a powerful story is amazing.  I have never felt so many emotions for so many different characters.  My heart broke for them all at some point, then I would get mad at them all, and finally fall back in love with them.  This is much more than a love story between Lake and Will.  It's a love story about the entire family and learning to find acceptance in a world you can not possibly believe your apart of, and learning to love those who love you, no matter what the circumstances may be.<br />Slammed is probably one of the BEST books I've ever read.  At this moment I can not think of a better book.  A must read for anyone.
B0085G0DNU|5.0|**Updated** I want to bring to everyone's attention that in order to get all the bonus tracks you must buy the soundtrack TWICE: once here and once on itunes.  I bought the itunes version to get two extra tracks and I highly recommend them both.  I almost lowered my score to 4 stars given you are not purchasing the complete soundtrack on Amazon or itunes.  There is even a track that you can ONLY get by purchasing your movie tickets at movietickets.com which I have not done.  This trend, which began with DLC for video games, is not befitting the consumer and I am a bit annoyed.  That being said, I added my thoughts on four of the five bonus tracks below.<br /><br />Quite by accident, I noticed that the entire soundtrack was available for streaming on Empire Online legally, a week before it comes out officially.  I have been looping the soundtrack since and it is epic.  Hans Zimmer is by far my favorite composer alive trumping even John Williams in my mind.  Zimmer is responsible for my favorite themes and soundtracks scoring everything from the Lion King to Call of Duty.  His work with James Newton Howard on the first two movies was sensational, but this is the first time going it alone in a Batman movie.<br /><br />Zimmer admitted that he had no problem working on the \\"Batman\\" half of the scores, but relied on Newton Howard for the \\"Bruce Wayne\\" aspect.  This dynamic is reflected in this soundtrack as the love themes are notably absent.  This is clearly a dark movie.  In its place are the haunting chants and melancholy strings which provide volume to the entire score.<br /><br />Many of the recognizable themes from the original two movies make a reappearance in this score but not in an bad way.  The old is mixed with the new and Zimmer often reinterprets his old themes to give them new life.<br /><br />\\"The Storm is Coming\\" is clearly an introduction.  It is a short track that is about half a minute and probably is played with the corporate logo as the film begins.<br /><br />\\"On Thin Ice\\" seems to convey an emotion of looking back at the previous films and the devastation Gotham has endured.  It is filled with sad strings and a hint of the looming terror.  We are introduced to the final theme played throughout the soundtrack.  It is quiet but reminds me of \\"528491\\" from inception which preceded the great \\"Mombasa\\" action track.<br /><br />\\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" is clearly the first set piece of the movie.  I remember hearing it when I saw the first six minutes of the film in IMAX in December.  I am not going to spoil what happens, but suffice it to say it is the first time we meet Bane and he makes quite an entrance.  The track uses entirely new music.  On my first play-through it was unremarkable, but put it on a good car audio system and the layers pop out.  The bass on this track is taken from Zimmer's inception playbook.  The tone is foreboding and terrifying but beautiful.  It is almost all electronics and drums while introducing us to Bane's theme (the chants).<br /><br />\\"Mind if I cut in\\" is my least favorite track.  I agree with the other reviewer that this is an example of where Newton Howard would have filled this void.  This is a slow track with piano and violin.  It reminds me of a detective track where a character is looking t uncover some mystery.  My guess is this is when we are introduced to Selena Kyle.<br /><br />\\"Underground Army\\" is another quiet track with lots of electronics.  It has a menacing tone as if evil plans that are being made by Bane and his henchman.  It introduces a few new melodies but seems like an average track at best.<br /><br />\\"Born in Darkness\\" looks back at Batman's past by echoing themes from the \\"Batman Begins\\" but appears as another quiet filler track.<br /><br />\\"The Fire Rises\\" is the second major action music which introduces some new themes and horror elements with minor notes, strings and drums.  The track seems to depict (and this is just a guess) Batman's first encounter with Bane.  There are lulls in the action which build to intense loud action queues.  This track must be listened to on a great audio system to reveal its layers.  I find this track to get better with repeated listenings.  Zimmer certainly uses his inception style in this track with the heavy electronics towards the end.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Out There\\" sounds like its straight out of the \\"Dark Knight.\\" It quietly repeats the piano (love?) theme from the previous movies but never utilizes the full orchestra.  It is another filler track.<br /><br />\\"Despair\\" is filled with new and old music blended together. He reinterprets his \\"Dark Knight\\" music from \\"Why So Serious\\" by throwing in a long cello build-up with the famous two note themes.  The second half of the track is a reinterpretation of the end of \\"I'm not a Hero\\" from the previous soundtrack as well.  While it repeats alot from past soundtracks it remains fresh and exciting.<br /><br />\\"Fear will Find You\\" seems to be another action sequence against Bane.  Zimmer uses the chants for the first time alongside intense drums and electronics mixed with the old themes and the new theme from this movie.  The two are seamlessly integrated.  You will think you know the track straight out of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and then it will take a new and unique turn.  It could be construed as a remix, but I think of it as a fresh take.<br /><br />\\"Why do We Fall\\" is one of Zimmer's finest as it builds to a swelling climax with strings and drums.  Batman is clearly defeated in spirit but is convinced to try one last time. (This is another guess).  It builds to epic levels before breaking out in the Batman drum and string theme.<br /><br />\\"Death By Exile\\" is a filler track that offers little to nothing but an additional track listing.  At 23 seconds it should have been combined with the next track.<br /><br />\\"Imagine the Fire\\" is the most epic track and contains many new action queues coupled with old familar themes.  It reminded me of \\"Mombasa\\" from his Inception score and \\"The Chase\\" from Batman Begins.  This track has everything from old themes to electronics to strings and drums.  This track completes the soundtrack and demonstrates Zimmer's abilities to orchestrate a climactic final encounter with Bane (another guess?).<br /><br />\\"Necessary Evil\\" clearly depicts the aftermath of the final battle.  I feel as though there are hints as to the outcome but no certainties.  It is a suspenseful track as the movie has not yet been released.  It quietly references the Batman theme introduced in this movie.<br /><br />\\"Rise\\"  This is Zimmer's playground to end the film on an epic note.  It is very much like \\"A Dark Knight\\" from the last soundtrack but is a slower (and more epic) version of the final track soundtrack which sends chills down your spine. The swelling strings and slow pace allow the orchestra to really shine.  This track again hints at the outcome of the movie without being definitive.  Clearly it depicts loss, but on what scale?  I love this track, but it is not long enough.  It is the final Batman track we will hear from Zimmer, so I wished it would be more like the 17 minutes of the last finale.<br /><br />**Update**<br />\\"No Stone Unturned\\" is a bonus track that I just downloaded.  Essentially, there is nothing specifically new here but it remixes the themes from all the movies as an action piece.  It is absolutely a must have for any fan of the soundtrack.  Its an exciting track that adds to the intensity of the overall score.  At 7 minutes, it is an impressive piece.<br /><br />\\"Risen from the Darkness\\" is another bonus track which is similar in principle to the first one.  It again remixes old themes with the new and adds one more action track to this terrific soundtrack.  Again it's nothing groundbreaking or new, but gets the action music swelling in new ways.<br /><br />\\"Bombers of Ibiza\\" is the final bonus track and is clearly has the touch of a different composer.  It's all synthesizers here and clearly what you think of with normal remixes.  This track I could do without.  It almost feels like club dance music.  It's not bad but also not memorable.  There is even a little dubstep mixed into the track.<br /><br />With the new tracks, the first two listed are clearly the work of Zimmer working in the studio to put together old familiar themes to make them into exciting yet generic action tracks.  These first two do feel like they could be played somewhere in the movie and could have been added to the original soundtrack.  The final track is a standard third party remix which has some nice rhythm but comes across as dance music.<br /><br />**NEW UPDATE** These are my thoughts on the itunes bonus tracks.<br /><br />\\"The Shadows Betray You\\" is a track you get from the itunes version and I feel disappointed it was not included in the original soundtrack.  It is a very dark track with synthesizers featuring the new themes.  It almost sounds muffled, (perhaps a reference to Bane's mask)but in an intentional awesome way.  I recommend finding this track.<br /><br />\\"The End\\" is another itunes track clearly the credits and all I have to say is WOW!  I feel upset that this track was not included in the soundtrack as well.  I love this track.  It is slow and brooding and is very unlike the other tracks.  It is ominous and intense and features the familiar themes but with a Darth Vaderesqe breathing in the background.  This is a very dark ending.  I hope they release a more complete soundtrack or where you can pick these songs up individually.<br /><br />**End of Update**<br /><br />Obviously the movie has yet to be released and will likely enhance the listening experience of the entire soundtrack, but it doesn't need a movie to be considered a spectacular accomplishment.  Unfortunately I don't have the musical training to properly convey my emotions regarding this soundtrack, but hopefully the tone of the review demonstrates my enjoyment of this score.<br /><br />Everyone expects the best from a Hans Zimmer score as they do with Chris Nolan and Zimmer does not disappoint.  I will be looping this soundtrack for weeks to come no doubt.  Words fail to describe how much I love all of Hans Zimmer's work and must be experienced rather than listened to.  Together the three Nolan-Batman soundtracks rank up there with Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars as the best trilogy scores of all time.  Listen to this soundtrack often and on a great audio system with strong bass.  Your ears will thank you for it and your neighbors will forgive you (I hope) for the vibrations.<br /><br />**NOTE**<br />I also saw that there are additional tracks that come with the physical CD, so I preordered it as opposed to the MP3 option.  Ill add my thoughts once the CD comes.

145470246X|5.0|I have been enjoying Sabine's wonderful beading patterns via her website on the internet, some free and others purchased at her Etsy store. The book includes more patterns not available online. I truly believe that Sabine is one  of the most creative beaders in the world. She is astoundingly prolific.<br /><br />Her patterns were always easily understood, even to novice beaders.<br /><br />Most importantly, she uses easily available components. All standard size beads/crystals. No 24 carat antique charlottes or clasps that \\"make the piece\\" and are unavailable anywhere.<br /><br />I have made several bracelets from her patterns, each with different color schemes and each one has been a total hit, with some people literally grabbing my wrist. Now I can move up to necklaces and can only hope that people don't grab my neck when I wear them ;=)).<br /><br />I have a large collection of beading books, including ones by the \\"masters\\"-Laura McCabe, Marsha daCosta, Diane Fitzgerald, etc. Sabine's book is the only one I can unhesitatingly recommend. The other \\"master's\\" books include too many \\"odd ball\\" patterns which are bizarre or ugly and/or require unavailable or hideously expensive components (300 swarovki crystals and \\"vintage\\" rivolis you can't buy anywhere). I would wear any of the jewelry pieces in this book.

B007UQ30OU|5.0|Upon first listen, as a fan, I may have been seduced and hypnotized by Adam's voice, but the complexity and layers of his vocals make this CD ALBUM a masterwork. You cannot just download a single here and there; please spend a little more and you will NOT be disappointed. Even on random play, all the songs are cohesive to Adam's vision, despite his interview-friendly explanation of light/dark progression of tunes through the CD.<br /><br />There are a variety of pop rock influences throughout, from '70s rock, '80s disco and funk, '90's driving house music, to simply very personal ballads (Underneath, Outlaws of Love), but the main thing that holds it all together, intentionally, is his voice, whether layered in the dance pop tunes, or up front and center in ballads. He's also exploring new dimensions with dub-step influenced songs such as the unique and seductive Broken English and (in the deluxe version) the unearthly and ethereal Nirvana.<br /><br />He said early on that he clearly heard that his fans wanted his voice to be front and center, not buried by hurried production and uncertain direction post-Idol. All the songs on this CD make his voice front and center, and in very creative ways. You will not be disappointed. This CD ALBUM is not just a collection of songs, it is an oeuvre.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|2 stars for enterntaining only.<br />Book 1: intriguing, sexy, sexual. She is so \\"cultured\\" and \\"versed\\" but her language is plaged with F n S words. If she is sooo articulate, can't she find a way to replace her foul language?<br />Book 2: oh a love story, a proposal....but she becomes more and more inmature by the page!! Geez, grow up!<br />Book 3: if by now you can't figure how can they have brutal/tortured sex 6 times a day everyday! or where they get the time for that, neither could I.<br />And it is sooo long to read her tortured soul. My goodness, she is sooo childish. Between the foul and the intricate-go-google words she uses, it sounds like an oxymoron herself, or more a moron than an oxy.<br />I regret buying book 3.<br />Want to read it...save your money and borrow the book. Or just go to library and get real erotic real literature books like Postman rigns Twice.<br />This series is a waste.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Overall this watch is a solid 8/10. The only negatives would be that it will stop working if you don't wear it for 12 hours. The day and date is not very well designed. Sometimes it takes a while to set the correct day and date. Everything else is great. The face is small, but if you're looking at this watch, it's probably something you want. I got the black one and it looks great. I would consider buying this watch if you are looking for a solid automatic watch for under $100.
B005LAIGF0|4.0|If you tried to watch this in movie theaters and then got a chance to watch it on DVD or streamed it instantly  (as I did) you can compare the different versions. There is a  DVD version for sale which includes scenes cut from the theatrical release.<br /><br />This film review is based on the film's Instant View version of the film which seems to be the shorter version, clocking in at 2 and 1/2 hours.<br /><br />Potential viewers should know that lawsuits delayed release of the movie and DVD due to disputes with the producer, the screenwrier, etc. Could a 3 hour movie be cut to 2 and 1/2 hours and would that affect the movie's integrity and flow?<br /><br />Eventually, the movie was shortened, and (sadly) released in just two theaters.<br /><br />This film is worth seeing by so many more people than those who made it to those 2 theatres. Yes, the film has its flaws. But it is also a complex and thought- provoking exploration of the consequences of  life after witnessing a terrible accident and trying to grapple with doing the \\"right thing.\\"<br /><br />Here are some reasons to watch this movie and the serious questions and issues facing potential viewers:<br /><br /> Early on, a young woman, Lisa (played by Anna Paquin), witnesses a shocking tragedy, one where she feels involved and responsible (at least, in part). How would someone still evolving into adulthood face that? How would she react? This is a MAJOR focus of the movie and also one of the reasons people didn't like it. There is a lot of adolescent drama, often extended and intense. Some feel it goes on too long and stretches credibility.<br />I confess that I was one of those who had issues with Lisa's endless drama and attempts to contact others affected by the tragic accident and push their boundaries. Her actions are  what another character labels as \\"strident\\", including Lisa's language, attitude, and inability to gauge the discomfort of those around her.<br /><br />But the interview I heard with Kenneth Lonergan (who appears in the film along with his wife) gave me a new perspective. I went back and watched the film again.<br /><br />And I rethought my first response and wondered: how would someone so young possibly react under the circumstances? How would a  college student's identity and emergence into adulthood be affected? What would be the range of reactions? These questions gave me pause. Perhaps what seems grating and even obnoxious in Lisa - and could turn off viewers- makes sense after all. It did to me - on my second viewing.<br /> Does the final scene at the opera, the point where films traditionally reach a resolution, mesh with all the events before then? I think it does, reflects Lisa's vulnerability. But I can see both sides of this.<br /><br />I also hope you watch Mark Ruffalo's performance as a bus driver linked with pivotal events. He is an actor who doesn't always get enough attention because his performances seem understated. But he is superb in this movie.<br /><br />I've left out so much.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know everyone's talking about this book. So I purchased it too. I also know sex should have kept me glued to the pages. It did not. Honestly I was so bored. There is no literature here, it only moves on to the next (light) S&M description. The story line is so thin, and I'd pick the book back up and not remember what it was about or what was happening. I'm a voracious reader and that's really saying something.  Kudos to the author for coming up with a niche that is selling like hotcakes. I didn't get the hype and could not imagine buying the 2nd or 3rd boring books so I went on to read a new novel I am loving. Sorry, \\"Fifty Shades of Huh?\\" is not a book I can recommend.
0307719219|5.0|Why Nations Fail takes a topic over which much ink has been spilled - why some nations succeed and others fail - and distills it into one overriding theme. Nations rise and fall based on their political institutions.<br /><br />There are, from the authors point of view, basically three types of countries. First, those in which there is no strong central government. These are the most extractive (people's property, freedom and ideas are always in danger of being taken away) because without a central state, there is no rule by law and there are few paths, except by force, by which a person can turn their ideas and talents into money. Somalia is an example of this first type of country.<br /><br />The second type of country is that in which there is a strong government, but the institutions that are in place allow for only a few elite to rule. This type of country is also very extractive, though not as extractive as the first type. Rulers are able to rule by fiat, placing their own interests above that of the people. The most enlightening example of this, is how the Ottoman Empire decided against legalizing the printing press for many centuries. The printing press would have allowed for a flourishing of ideas, as it had in Europe, but allowing new ideas the Ottoman rulers knew, destabilizes the current order, of which they were a part. The printing press also would have destroyed the profession and the prestige of the scribe profession. Merchants and printers would have become a new prized class of people, and with continued economic success would come political success, which would destabilize the power of rulers. Current day governments that fit this mold are North Korea, and many poor African states. To a much lesser extent, China also could be classed in this category.<br /><br />The final type of country is those with a strong central government, but whose institutions allow for a wide array of voices to be heard. The authors make the argument that no country hadembraced the this type of government - with ancient Venice and Rome coming closest - until England after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. England still had a king, William of Orange, but he was constrained by many other people, with a variety of competing interests. At this point the modern version of democracy was far away, but here was finally a government in which multiple perspectives were embodied. This political revolution was followed by an industrial revolution because creative destruction was free to thrive. Instead of the powerful protecting their own interests alone, a more representative government meant people were free to monetize their ideas and therefore create and invent stuff that would drastically improve society. Today, the US, Japan, South Korea, Botswana and western Europe could be included in this third type of country which the book term \\"inclusive.\\"<br /><br />It is always difficult to jump from one of these types of countries to another type. Too many people have too much invested for change to readily occur. That's why China is, for the forseeable future, likely to remain an extractive institution. And it's why many African nations seem to be in a perpetual vicious cycle even after they have revolutions to introduce more freedoms into society. But it's also a reason why American success has been relatively stable.<br /><br />I thought the argument the book makes was persuasive. The book covers many time periods and countries, preferring a panoramic approach rather than a single case study. I thought that was a wise decision because they were able to show that the dynamics of government that lead to success or fail are usually very similar no matter what the geography, the period of time, the culture or religion in that country are. That said, I do think may have too easily dismissed other potential influences on national failure or success, like that of culture. Early in the book, for instance, they mention the caste system of India as a potential societal influence on national success. But they only spend a few paragraphs on it, quickly dismissing it in favor of the political institution theory. They could have been more informative in making the case against some of the other theories that propose to explain why nations fail. This drawback is slight however. Overall it's a fascinating, thought provoking book, and it's compelling in its powerful but simple thesis.
B00782O7NE|5.0|\\"The Artist\\" almost dares moviegoers to see it.  It's a black-and-white silent picture shot in the old standard boxy aspect ratio, much as movies were made and exhibited until sound, color, and widescreen transformed cinema dramatically.  Mel Brooks played with the idea for comic effect in 1976's \\"Silent Movie,\\" incorporating a slew of big-name actors to boost box office.  In contrast, \\"The Artist,\\" a foreign film about old Hollywood, offers no superstars and does not strain after jokes.  Instead, a touching script, the humanity of its characters, and the talent of its principals turn this unusual project into a commercially viable movie.<br /><br />The time period spans 1927 to 1932, a time of enormous upheaval in Hollywood.  \\"The Jazz Singer,\\" the first talkie, hit screens in October, 1927, and sounded the death knell for silent pictures.  Some silent film makers and stars succeeded brilliantly, many did not, and opportunity boomed for new talent.  \\"The Artist\\" focuses on two characters whose Hollywood careers move in opposite directions.  George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a Chaplin-like star of the silent era.  He gives a fan of his, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), her first break in show biz. In 1929, the head of the studio, Al Zimmer (John Goodman), announces that the studio is ceasing all silent film production and getting on the talkie bandwagon. As Valentin resists the change to sound, his star dims while Peppy's career blossoms.<br /><br />There are clearly plot similarities to \\"A Star Is Born,\\" \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" and any backstage picture in which the ambitious, talented kid makes good.  But \\"The Artist\\" has a tremendous charm all its own.  The old-fashioned filming techniques become secondary to the story, which is a simple tale told extremely well and with great humor.<br /><br />Dujardin is a master of physical comedy and will remind the viewer of those little moments in Chaplin films when he enacts a comic bit, such as the dance of the rolls in \\"TheGold Rush\\" or his roller skating acrobatics in \\"The Rink.\\"  Dujardin's Valentin is an agile performer and a snappy dancer who can enchant an audience by improvising a series of hilarious curtain calls.  He loves his star status and regards the coming of sound as a threat.<br /><br />Peppy, on the other hand, is as game for the challenge of sound as she is talented and charming. Pretty, spunky, with an ebullient personality and a mischievous twinkle in her eye, she lights up the screen.  Ms. Bejo is a wonder. She has a face made for movies;  when she's on screen you can't take your eyes off her.  Reminiscent of the young Mary Tyler Moore and Debbie Reynolds, she is perky, frisky, and adorable.<br /><br />There is also on hand one of the funniest canine stars in years -- Valentin's dog, who not only appears with him in movies, but also is his constant companion, whether at home, attending a premiere, or sitting in a movie theatre.  The dog is always at his side and goes into Lassie-mode when Valentin's life is in danger, insisting that a cop follow him to the rescue.<br /><br />Director Michel Hazanavicius has taken great care in presenting the period of the Roaring Twenties and beginning of the Depression. Costuming and set design, down to the vintage film equipment depicted, are flawlessly incorporated. The actors perform in the style of the silent era, but the director strikes exactly the right balance to keep the movie from becoming a spoof.  That would be very easy.  It's far richer as it shifts from broad comedy leading to elements of tragedy before culminating in one of the best movie finales of the year.<br /><br />It's rare for a movie to be this exhilarating.  As you watch \\"The Artist,\\" you are simultaneously entertained, impressed, moved, and overjoyed.  When a film does all that, it must be attributed to creative genius -- the perfect blending of script, performance, and direction. This is one such case when everything comes together to produce a perfectmovie.<br /><br />What makes \\"The Artist\\" more than just a gimmick film is its sincerity and obvious love of cinema.  It transports us to a distant era and treats its characters as real people, not cliches.  Director Hazanavicius has created a loving tribute to the medium of film that both celebrates the past and acknowledges the inevitability of progress.<br /><br />Blu-ray extras include a 22-minute overview of the film's production; the featurette \\"Hollywood as a Character;\\" short vignettes dedicated to production design, cinematography, costuming, and the musical score;  blooper reel; and a 45-minute on-stage Q & A with the stars, director and producer.

Its not high art, it hasn't aged particularly well, and it stars Wesley Snipes who ranks just above Steven Seagal on the \\"I actually own movies starring this guy\\" embarrassment-meter.  Nevertheless I'm a fan of comic book films, vampires, and R-rated action films and Blade delivers the goods and is a lot more fun than it deserves to be.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes is Blade; a human-vampire hybrid that hunts his blood thirsty cousins with the aide of his hillbilly pseudo-father Whistler (Kris Kristofferson).  Blade is feared by the vampire population but  a particularly bloodthirsty vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) has an ambitious plan to destroy Blade and enslave the human race.<br /><br />If you go into Blade expecting Interview with the Vampire you're going to be disappointed.  Even though Blade deals with vampirism at heart it's an action-kung fu picture and it isn't apologetic about it at all.  The film is filled with non-stop action; there's plenty of hand to hand combat, sword play, and shootouts plus more than enough vampire gore to keep things interesting.  Wesley Snipes has never been known for his superior acting ability but he's near perfect in a role that requires him to treat his B-movie starring role with deadly seriousness.  The plot is very silly, Stephen Dorff is a villainous ham, and quite a bit of the CGI has aged extremely poorly but in spite of its many flaws Blade is a memorable time waster.<br /><br />Blade simply looks and sounds great on Blu-ray.  This release is a drastic improvement over the nearly 14 year old standard definition DVD.  Black levels are much improved and I saw no signs of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).  There is a nice layer of film grain present that is only distracting on several CGI shots where it looks out of place.  Color accuracy is good and the abundant amounts of blood really pop against the somewhat monochromatic color scheme.<br /><br />The DTS-HD MA soundtrack is even more impressive and is an even greater improvement over the DVD.  The Blu-ray sports a 6.1 channel DTS-HD MA mix versus the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 track and the added surround channel isn't wasted. Surround activity is constant but not gimmicky and the LFE channel is impressive but not out of control.  Gunfire has more `oomph' to it than the DVD and dialogue is more distinguishable during the film's more frantic moments. The signature acoustic moment in Blade has always been the opening Bloodrave sequence featuring the Pump Panel Recon Mix of New Order's Confusion.  That sequence alone was demo worthy in the early days of DVD and on Blu-ray it continues to give me goosebumps.<br /><br />Unfortunately Warner Brothers has not included any new supplemental materials for Blade.  Instead the same Special Features package created for the 1998 DVD release is recycled here and it feels anything but special.  The audio commentary is still worth a listen and the \\"The Origins of Blade\\" featurette is an interesting watch mainly because of how far comic book film adaptions have come since Blade was originally released.  Otherwise most of the extras are forgettable (try watching the alternate ending... yikes).  I would have loved to have seen a documentary with new interviews with the cast and crew but Blade continues to be treated like the `red headed stepchild' of successful comic book adaptions.<br /><br />Blade isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but its juvenile strengths far outweigh its dramatic weaknesses.  If taken too seriously Blade can be easily picked apart but if you're just looking for a fun vampire action flick then you shouldn't be disappointed. The video and audio are both fantastic and are noticeable improvements over the old DVD.  The supplement package is disappointingly just a DVD carryover and doesn't contain any new material which is a shame.  With that said, [[ASIN:B007KW5MFE Blade]] is still an easy Blu-ray to recommend so go ahead and sink your teeth in.ew interviews with the cast and crew but Blade continues to be treated like the `red headed stepchild' of successful comic book adaptions.<br /><br />Blade isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but its juvenile strengths far outweigh its dramatic weaknesses.

B0067EKY9K|3.0|\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\"  is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (\\"Chocolat,\\" \\"The Cider House Rules\\").  A visionary sheik (Amr Waked) believes his passion for the peaceful pastime of salmon fly fishing can enrich the lives of his people, and he dreams of bringing the sport to the not so fish-friendly desert.  Willing to spare no expense, he instructs his representative, Harriet (Emily Blunt), to turn his dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert, Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), who thinks the project is both absurd and unachievable. When British government publicist Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas) champions it as a good-will story, however, the unlikely team puts everything on the line to prove the impossible is possible.    Metaphorically, the movie contains the message that we can find our oases no matter the desert.  Also resonating is that, with unlimited resources, the wildest, craziest dream can be pursued, if not fully realized.  McGregor and Blunt are the film's best ingredients.  Both have charm, and it's fun to watch the scientifically oriented Dr. Jones become immersed in politics as a romance with Harriet blossoms.  However, the film drags for long stretches until a satisfactory final act.  There are two bonus featurettes.
1416955070|5.0|.. :) I will have so much fun with this review. :D<br />First off, let me say a few things. The Mortal Instruments is my favorite series. Ever. Jace Wayland is the best character that I have ever read about about this book was the main reason I started getting really fascinated with angels, and the whole bad boy/ sarcastic-snarky-with-a-really-sweet-side-for-one-special-girl thing. :)<br /><br />I love this book. The writing, the characters, the plot, the author, the setting.. Everything. I named my cat after Chairman Meow, for Christ's sake. I loved Magnus, and Valentine was creepy. Still is creepy.<br /><br />Clary, for me, was the first heroine that could actually do something for a change. She didn't put up with Jace's crap, she's funny, she's unwittingly beautiful, and she's incredibly brave. She loves her friends, her mom, more than anyone could ever imagine. There's a reason she won the heroine tournament at the YA Sisterhood blog. She's amazing.<br /><br />Jace. Oh good God. Such a perfect boy. If only he were real. Sarcastic, arrogant, kick ass fighter (the best his age), and downright hilarious. My ideal. Is he good looking? Oh yeah. Does he know it? Hell yeah. I love him because he has quotes like this- \\"Did you ever think that in a past life Alec was an old woman with ninety cats who was always yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off her lawn? Because I do,\\"  And then he has quotes like this- \\"And now I'm looking at you,\\" he said, \\"and you're asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before - bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it - but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me.\\" He's just so perfect.<br /><br />Okay. I think that pretty much covers that. I want to thank Cassandra Clare for being the first author who really spoke through her reading to me. That series is just so perfect. I love it. THANK YOU.<br /><br />7 out of 5 stars. Definitely. No doubt. Wait. Probably more. 50. That should cover it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|there are a lot of glitches in the game. the games would freeze, it wouldn't give me my daily coins, and there are way too many ads! I'll start a game and an ad will pop up!
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I love JT! And I've seen the performance a million times but having it on DVD so I could put it on the big screen with the speakers was awesome. And all the extra content. Well worth it.
B000R5N1MC|4.0|Blade Runner is by far one of the best movies ever made. In this box set you get everything! Even a tiny metal unicorn and spinner car. The extras a really cool, and the \\"Making Of..\\" videos are awesome. I even love the box it comes in. It looks like Deckard's briefcase. Great purchase.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|I'll be honest. I loved Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park was opening for P.O.D. when Hybrid Theory was released, so I went out and bought the CD, so I would be familiar with their music when I caught them live with P.O.D. I had heard the first single on the radio and liked it, so I was pleasantly surprised that the whole album was good. I was even further surprised that they were able to reproduce everything on the album in a live setting flawlessly with tons of energy. After the show, the band mingled with the audience as the other bands on the bill played. Their youthful energy was infectious.<br /><br />I then bought Meteroa the week it was released and was disappointed that it sounded pretty much exactly like Hybrid Theory. It was a monster selling album, but it was too similar to their previous album for me. Then, the band made an ep with Jay  Z which I didn't like at all. So, with two strikes, I was pretty much off the Linkin Park bandwagon.<br /><br />As the band experimented with their sound over the next two albums, I would check them out and (legally) cherry pick a song or two I liked, but something was missing. That spark, that sound, that intensity that I loved on Hybrid Theory just seemed to be missing, and I felt the band that had shown so much promise was still trying to find their footing with very uneven results.<br /><br />Now, flash forward to today. We reach Living Things. All I have to say is, \\"Wow.\\" If Living Things had been released after Hybrid Theory, I would have never jumped ship. Of course, without the experimentation on previous albums and work on side projects, the band might not have ever been able to produce Living Things. The spark and energy is back on the album. The mixture of aggression and melody is pitch perfect again. In fact, what I felt the band struggled with on every album since Hybrid Theory was finding the right dynamics in mixing genres like they do. I think they nailed it on Living Things.<br /><br />It seems like they have settled into their own skins, not as one of the leaders of the nu metal movement but as one of the leaders of the electronic rock movement. Bands who mix electronica with hard music like Enter Shikari, Abandon All Ships, and We Came As Romans owe a debut to Linkin Park, and as Linkin Park uses more dubstep or dance elements in their music, they aren't jumping on any new bandwagon, they are simply making a logical progression, incorporating the sounds they like, which have always included hip hop and electronic music, into a rock format. Weaving these collages of sound takes skill, and they show those skills to maximum effect on this album.

B003VANOFY|2.0|I was terribly disappointed with the function of this item. In less than a month I've removed it from my system after the switch that turned it on, continued to fail. In addition, when using the surround sound part of the earphones, the sub-woofer never worked, and as mentioned, the on-off button was difficult to work. The control light would flicker out just after turning it on, and there were many times after switching it off, it would turn itself back on. This was definitely not the kind of product that I've been acquainted with from Logitech.

B000002IAZ|5.0|I first heard Buffalo Springfield in the late 1960's while in Junior College in Long Beach, Ca.<br />The song lyrics were thought-provoking, heartfelt, and fun. The music would make you think, laugh, cry and be angry all at the sametime. \\"Retrospective - The Very Best of Buffalo Springfield\\" is one of THE best albums I have ever heard or owned. I wore out my record years ago and have a cherished CD.
B008B3F38C|5.0|While I do agree that the orchestration is a bit downgraded as compared with their first two albums, Lucidity and April Rain, this album took literally no time at all to grow on me. After listening to it from start to finish, I can honestly say that it is a true work of art in its own right, and is well-deserving of a 5-star review.<br /><br />One thing that sets this album apart from the first two albums is that, aside from \\"Where Is The Blood,\\" there are no guest appearances from other vocalists, allowing Charlotte to prove that she can shine magnificently on her own, with her powerful and highly versatile voice. Being trained in both jazz and classical, she has the ability to convey emotion on multiple levels, and it shows in every song.<br /><br />Furthermore, the additional four live versions of songs from previous albums makes for an excellent bonus, and proves how real they can sound live without having to do pre-recorded playback, unlike any of the no-talent pop hacks that pollute the airwaves here in the U.S. If they ever play closer to where I live, then I am going to see them, no questions asked.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a true work of art that took alot of time and effort to make, and truly puts any Top 40 mainstream crap to shame, in terms of the talent and artistry involved. Plus, Charlotte Wessels has more talent and class in her little finger than than anyone like Britney Spears, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Ke$ha, or Nicki Minaj put together, and would be a FAR better role model to young girls than any of them could ever hope to be - IF Delain can only get the attention and respect they TRULY deserve.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend this album to anyone who appreciates real, honest music that is made for the art, and not the money. Support great artists! This is REAL music!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game runs pretty smooth on my kindle fire. there's a bunch of different games not all that I like. the downfall is that you only start with a few games and have to play those to earn coins to open the new ones.

B0010DGYJW|5.0|I will tell you why...this album is epic. The Crimson Idol is Blackie Lawless's brightest moment and yet his darkest. He released a masterpiece heavy metal concept album that doesn't get enough due credit for the sheer ammount of intensity and perfection (yes I said perfection). This was not my first W.A.S.P album, in fact, their debut was my first so in no way am I being biased on this review. The tracks flow almost flawlessly together, the vocals are in a league of their own, and the drums and guitars add to the overall intensity of the best that is The Crimson Idol. Very, very few albums can actually get a listener to fell emotion only based on the overall sound. This album is rare folks, but the story and the morals it teaches is something few people in this generation can understand. Don't wish for something, for their is always a consequence (Main character gets all the fame, the girls, the respect, the \\"love\\" yet he still has nothing.\\") Don't change who you are, stay true to yourself (Main character using the mirror to snort drugs.) This album was and still is in a class of its own. Very few albums will ever top this it is a true masterpiece. I would love to give more details but I would hate to run this story for the reviewer, so my recomendation for you is to listen to a few of the tracks. If you like the way it sounds, GO BUY THIS. Then listen to it again, but this time listen to the story, the main character, and listen to the morals.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love it. One of the best Sudoku games on the Android platform. It can test the experienced and teach the noobs.
B000002IOY|4.0|Yes the title is a total Overkill pun, but in all honesty this is one of their best moments and ranks up with Horrorscope and Taking Over. Now some people are saying there are a lot of Metallica influences here and Overkill stole some of their riffs. The fact is, Overkill and Metallica both played thrash at this time, and were on opposite sides of the country. Now that being said, there could have been some influence from both bands but I highly doubt the guys sat in the studio and said, \\"Let's steal some of Metallica's riffs and see if we get praise.\\" If that was so, the would have had a distinct Metallica sound, to me, they still sound like Overkill. So end of that rant. Time to Kill and Elimination kickstart this album, with heavy guitars, thundering drums, and Bobby's insane vocals, the listener knows their neck might be broken from the ammount of headbanging. I Hate is a fun track, though not very serious in the lyrical department, I think its a fun song to listen to when you're mad. The fourth track, Nothing To Die For, to me is the first track that seems a little stale, almost repetitive. But next we have the 10 minute 15 second epic, doom inspired, Skullkrusher. This track is slow (until it builds up near the mid way point) creepy, and addictive all at the same time. At over 10+ minutes the guys do a good job at keeping it interesting. Birth of Tension, explodes like the beginning of the album did. The double bass on this song is almost top notch. Who Tends the Fire, Mid-pace and heavy, carries over from Birth of Tension in energy and power. The Years Of Decay, quite possibly the most beautiful song they have ever done. IF you have never heard this track I recommend it, it's my favorite of the whole album. Now we close with the trasher, Evil Never Dies, which is actually the fourth installment of the trademark Overkil series and it is another fan favorite also. If you want to start with an Overkill album, I would recommend this one or Horrorscope as I see it being their shinning moment. But if you like a more intense, rawer sounding album, go for Feel The Fire, or Taking Over.being their shinning moment.

B006GKHE6G|3.0|It's a pretty fun game, but the replay value is not there. A few times around the track is all you need, and then you're kind of over it. The graphics are nice and the controls are fluent, so overall I'm not upset about the 99 cents I spent on it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|We are talking the first season of one of the best shows TNT has every put out there. Supernatural is a complete show from start to finish with dynamic characters, enjoyable plot, and fun action/sci-fi sequences. Sure you can find this show online, on Netflix, or whatever other TV/movie source you use, but there is nothing better than owning the discs themselves and being able to kick it up on the couch and rock out to one of the best shows out there. Plus, the next season is starting up soon so there is no time to waste when talking about getting caught up!

0618918248|5.0|This is definitely the best book I've ever read, it literally changed my life... I strongly recommend reading this book if you were educated on any religion and you think there are things that don't quite match your view of the world/life or if you want to understand more about religions and why we believe in God(s). Even if you are a strong believer, reading this book will help you understand the reasons why there are people who don't believe in God(s), be tolerant and learn to accept different points of view instead of trying to change them. Before I read this book I was a \\"non-practicing catholic\\", after reading the first chapters I thought I would become a deist... when I finished, I discovered I was really an atheist.

I was expecting more of the same and was disappointed in finding a world album with all laid back rhythms. This is not to say it is not a good album.  By all measures it is a unique sound only Melody can bring.  It was just not a style high on my list of enjoyment.  I hope she returns to the sultry jazz style I enjoyed so much in her first two CDs.

All you need is a German goofy-looking boy, a pedophile and convicted murderer former SS woman guard, and a ridiculous script to explain yet again another chapter of the most barbarous, atrocious, and cruelest crimes in human history. Hitler was right in predicting that the German guilt is to last a thousand years or more.
B004H3WWU2|5.0|I have been looking for a bag like this for MONTHS. I carry a significant amount of stuff(listed below,) and I walk allot so a messenger bag is not an option unless I want to wreck my spine, but a regular backpack makes me look like a college freshmen. Other bags have too many pockets on the outside, which looks unprofessional. I prefer a minimalist aesthetic, with not pieces of flare or crazy colors. This delivers. I also don't like to have too much extra space, as I prefer the bag to retain a nice shape, and extra space encourages extra stuff. This bag is perfect. It looks great and fits everything in an organized way with room to spare.<br /><br />The bag feels durable and retains it shape when filled. As for the other reviews; yes the zippers are a little stiff until you get used to them and they loosen up a bit, but that stiffness is what helps the bag retain its shape and un-slouchy aesthetic, and yes, there are more pockets inside than you will need, some of which will be useless... but the point is not to fill every pocket, but to have a pocket for everything you need one for.<br /><br />A couple pencil loops would not kill it, but if it bothers you that much, buy a pencil case.<br /><br />Here is the list of stuff I carry<br /><br />17\\" laptop<br />Charger - I have a small one, but a larger one would fit.<br />Sunglasses in a case<br />Ipad (most of the time)<br />kindle (don't ask why i carry both, I like it, OK?)<br />Leatherman<br />A key folio with keys to a few places I own<br />A small totes umbrella<br />A case with some pencils/pens<br />Moleskin notebook (a thicker version)<br />small vial of Advil,<br />kindle charger with iphone/ipad converter<br />Car lighter to USB adapter<br />USB fob<br />Some other small stuff.<br /><br />It all fits, comfortably and there is room for more, but not too much more...
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I have over the years bought almost every version of these recordings that RCA has issued, including some 78s when some of these performances were hard to find. Even though I  purchased the set from  the early '90s and many of the remasterings since, it is great to have these outstanding performances in the best officially available sound, all together, especially at Amazon's huge bargain of a price. Toscanini, even when he is wrong (Mozart, for example), is always interesting, and when he is right (Dvorak, Verdi, Beethoven, and others), he is outstanding. By modern standards, some of the sound is rough, but what can one expect when the most recent of the recordings is almost sixty years old and the earliest is pushing ninety? The only thing missing from the collection of the '90s is the detailed notes that came with each disk; other than that, the packaging is far more convenient than the old set. The first classical music I ever listened to, back when I was a teenager in the '60s, was Toscanini's Beethoven on LM-6901. The sound is unquestionably far better now than it was on those old disks. It is a pleasure to find these old friends as stimulating and inspiring as ever. There's a lot to learn from listening to them.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Omg this album is tooooo good!!! Honestly if you've been a Linkin Park fan since Hybrid Theory you would know exactly what I'm talking about. When I was a young girl and listened to Hybrid Theory for the first time I was hooked on Linkin Park. I remember hating how Hybrid Theory was sooo good but the songs felt too short so I had to keep rewinding the tape. (Yes I have the cassette tape). Well, Living Things is no different. Only now I don't have to push rewind I simply let the album play on loop. This group has been in my life for so long they have become apart of my family literately. My brothers and sisters all have been Linkin Park fans since we were kids and this album simply brought it all back. I love Linkin Park as a band and more than that I love what they stand for. 4ever LP!
B00005R2IS|5.0|I won't go into a review of the movie itself as there are many on here already.  I knew the movie before buying it, liked it, which is why I bought it.<br />This review is to let folks know about the Special Edition.  For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio.  It also happens<br />to have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time.  Plenty of<br />extras and great quality, this made for an excellent 'guys night'.<br /><br />One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn't really seem especially... mad.  I mean, he's mad, but I always thought<br />mad was supposed to mean crazy.  He's not all that crazy.  Makes for great alliteration though.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|All of the five star reviews for this book only served to keep it away from me, i thought that it must have been done by family and friends who bought the book because i have never seen a book with reviews this good. Upon Actually reading this book i was stunned. it doesn't read like any authors first story and in fact i would go so far as to call it a masterpiece. I won't go into the storyline and what all i liked because reviews are not really my thing but i felt this book deserved my support so here is my Five Star Rating, A job well done. Keep up the good work!
B0084PB97G|5.0|So beautiful, so heartbreaking, so important.  BW's voice is so beautiful, and so tortuered.  The lyrics are just amazing!  You can't buy this quickly enough.  Listen loud and listen often.  It is one of the best of the year, and at $5 it's a steal.  Buy it before they change the price!
030758836X|4.0|I could not put this book down - I loved all the twists and turns, wondering what would happen next...until the end.  The ending, to me, was very anti-climatic - after all the build up...this had me disappointed. The ending wasn't bad enough for me to not like the book, but I was disappointed.
B007SGM084|4.0|I got totally sucked in to these books and I am sad that I finished them so fast!  Fun read for summer.
B00881VLCE|3.0|the controls are really hard to use use use use use so it kinds stinks 16 17 18 19 20
B005L38QK2|5.0|I bought the mouse to play diablo 3 but i ended using it for so much more. The macros you can create helped me a lot in other type of software such as Adobe Illustrator, Indesign and the whole suite. I also manage to save keys to work for internet explorers and itunes. The product is great. It shiped earlier and in the best condition.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best love it.have a lot of games but this one has all in one.games for the kids to lol
B007MDB6L0|5.0|very good service and quality, would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase.  very happy with my purchase. happy happy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is not only entertaining but challenging as well! I recommend it so far I have had no problems with it which is rare with most apps I hslace come across
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well..it's a bunch of mini apps within one! :) just give this app a try people!&cent;: I like it. its good for when your bored c:
B007SGM084|3.0|I was a little taken aback by the detail of the sex in the book.  Had not read any reviews before I purchased the trilogy so guess it was my own fault I was shocked.  This trilogy is not for people who get offended by graphic sexual exploits.  Actually the story was very good and could have been written without some of the sexual details.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|hey people..I love this game c: but where is the update at? I realized my friend had a newer updated version..and I'm still waiting for that update -_-
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This is great for my needs but it feels cheap. The front cover is very flimsy plastic. However, I like the design, it doesn't add much weight or size and three way the front flap lays is nice. I'd buy out again.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this app! its very fun and entering :) its a good app for when your siblings wont shut up. c: well I give it 4 stars c: of course I like to play too c;
B007MLDC2I|5.0|I haven't read the book, but the movie was fantastic!!!  Great plot line and acting.  I love Daniel Craig and mystery thrillers.  It ran a bit slow in the beginning, however, it still kept your interest and when it did took off, it really took off. . . it was like being on a rollar coaster with excitment.  I recommend this movie for a fan of mystery thrillers.  I can't wait for the next one!
B0081J9OWC|5.0|then you've lost a lot of your childhood spirit. No, it's not very polished nor extremely complex, but it is very fun and upbeat. Jane's voice is captivating and finally gets the space it deserves on this album. Fiya Wata is completely hers: [...].    If you jumped on the Ed Sharpe fanwagon after hearing \\"Home\\" and \\"40 Day Dream\\" then you might not enjoy this album. If you thought Alexander was a step in a good direction, then you'll like this album, which seems closer to Alexander than Up From Below.    Listen to the samples and youtube videos before you buy! Watch some live versions to get a feel for what Ed Sharpe and the Zeros are all about.
B005OK721G|1.0|I'd just like to start this review off by saying that this movie is putrid. She has the brains of Eisenhower and the stealth tactics of Shinobi, which makes her unstoppable from beginning to end. After seeing her parents killed as a little girl she seeks revenge on some mobb and she doesn't stop until that is accomplished. She tells her Uncle at a young that she wants to be killer, he then shoots and kills an innocent driver, kneels down to her asks if that's the life that she chooses, hears the ambulances nearing the scene, and then walks off without anyone screaming \\"Hey that's the killer.\\" When she is all grown she came up with this brilliant idea to fake like she is drunk and runs head on into a cop car and then goes to jail. She gets to jail with no idea and they charge her with a DUI which she was never tested for (and she was never even drunk in the first place, but faked it...somehow) and they lock her in a cell. She infiltrates and booby traps the entire jail as she follows through on a plotted murder of a mobb member as she slips through vents and some phony close-call death experiences without even being seen! She kills the guy and makes it back to her cell just in time to throw her prostitute outfit back on and pretend like she's sleeping. She shot through a bullet proof window, evaded the entire Swat Team who the drop on her, black-maled the Swat Team head honchos, and predicted at the end of the movie that the guy she was chasing was going to drive a particular van and decided to stick 2 Rottweilers behind the driver's seat, knew that he would call and brag about his narrow escape, and simply says \\"Eat\\" and the 2 dogs eat him alive.<br /><br />Dumb movie! Please don't watch it if you do not want to laugh.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Finally. A long time come back of some serious R&B. None of that pop oriented R&B passing off as R&B Hip Hop. Frank Ocean has done it. The interludes are awesome. Each song tells a poetic story. This is the album you listen to with a nice cocktail or a glass of wine. From beginning to end, it wll fill you up. This album will get you to reminisce and dream of what should have or should be.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is a great, lightweight cover for the Kindle fire. It is easy to find in a dark bag, with it's white cover. The stand works well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Such a fun app I definatly recommend it!:) You should definatly get it and its free which makes it all the more worth while.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|3 Reason why I like this show and this review will make you want to watch it.<br />#1 Usually in zombie movies you don't really care about the characters but in the walking dead each character has their own opinions and are very interesting<br />Rick-Lori-Carl-Daryl-T-Dog-Glenn-Shane-Dale-Andrea-Carol-Sophia-Randall-Hershel-Maggie-Beth-Patricia-Jimmy-Otis. All these characters I love and are very interesting oh and not to forget Michonne.<br />And you can easily bond these characters and care for them.<br />#2 The zombies look very good thanks to Greg Nicotero who did the makeup to them. In zombie movies the zombies don't look that good but in here they look fantastic and thank god they didn't put zombies that can run and hopefully they don't ever.<br />#3 The story is so good because the survivors are put in this terrifying and new world as Dale says in episode 207 Pretty Much Dead Already. 'This world is ugly it's harsh it's a survival of the fittest. And the survivors have to face HARD decisions like whether to save or kill Randall or to look for Sophia or leave her out there. Also the zombies aren't the only enemy in this world. There is also bad guys out there like the 2 guys Tony and Dave who shoot at Rick-Glenn-and Hershel.
0762777931|5.0|This tiny, shiny, happy love bug of a lady has written a book that is more about loving yourself for the sake of your health, rather than restricting or limiting yourself. Kris Carr is my Supergirl:)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like this app because I love doing puzzles and now I can do them wherever I go.  Works great on Kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a pretty fun game you earn points by playing the games. then you can spend them on more games<br /><br />4.5/5
B006GHA9VQ|1.0|I HATED this movie.  They took a beautiful story and turned it into UGLY.  It almost totally ruined the 'Phantom of the Opera' for me.  It was a bad ending for every character.  Buy the song \\"Love Never Dies\\", but please don't buy this horrible movie.
B005T87QCI|5.0|please tell me how you get the update I do not know how to. But I love this game it is awesome
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Although not as good as seeing it live, this is the next best thing to it. It's worth every penny.  And it's far, far better than the movie version. Fantastic production and wonderful cast.  Thank you Andrew Lloyd Webber for the beautiful music.
B005LAIGSM|3.0|UPDATE:<br /><br />I had to downgrade the rating for this product.<br /><br />For gaming...I'll give it 5 stars. But for pixel display...I'll give 1 star. Videos are very grainy and my art program does not work as well as with other moniters (even old ones). Thus the reason I gave it 3 stars. If you're buying a moniter for gaming only, then this is your moniter. But for regular use....I'd look else where.<br /><br />END of update.<br /><br />Just received my benq 2420t. It took awaile to figure how to create a custom display setup. I found a very helpful tutorial on youtube. Type in \\"Benq xl2420t color\\" in Youtube search and click on the first video (after the ads) and there you will find a good tutorial if you haven't figured it out yet.<br /><br />Also, I had to go into my nvidia control panel to make a few adjustments also....one being the refresh rate (in the resolution section) to change it from 60 Hz to 120 Hz.  I've been viewing videos and so far...I'm very pleased. I haven't tried any games yet...the Sims 3 being my favorite. But I suspect it will be a good experience with the extra refresh rate with 120 Hz, not to mention the beautiful rich color (although I would have to give some of the credit for the rich color to the Nvidia gtx 590 video card).<br /><br />I Have to say....I LOVE the color and the clear font. The yellow is the first color I look at when buying any monitor or tv. The yellow is a deep rich golden yellow - just the way it should be. Usually, in my experience, when the yellow is rich, as it should be...the rest of the colors are rich also. I had a 27 in Dell UltraSharp U2711. The reason I replaced it, was that it was too big - especially for gaming. Also, I could never get the font to look right on the web pages or when using Notepad. And the Sims 3 game would sometimes drag (if that's the right term).<br /><br />With the Benq monitor, the videos play more smoothly. There's no lag when viewing videos that have a high HD setting.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed, which is very important....my video card is running at a cooler temperature. With the Dell...it ran at a constant 70c sometimes going as high as 80c. But with the Benq - it's running at a constant between 50 and 60c.<br /><br />So far....I am very very very pleased with this monitor. For me, it is well worth the price. I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />And Bravo to Amazon.com - for the excellent service. I received my monitor one day early. I love the convenience of using Amazon.com. I've never been disapointed with their service or with the prices they offer.
B007RXRSEY|4.0|I was really excited to see a new album by Slash and hoped it lived up to all the hype.  It is a very good album and he hasn't lost his touch.  I wish he had brought back some of the people he had on the first album or some new people and not just use the same vocalist (who is still very good and I have no issue with).  With that said, this is one of the hardest-rocking albums I have bought recently.  If you really enjoy Slash's work or hard-rock in general, definitely check out this album.  You will not be disappointing.
0345803485|2.0|Wow. I'm usually not very critical when it comes to books. I'm writing this review because I can't believe it gets the hype that it does. Maybe everyone is intrigued because of the BDSM? BDSM has been around for a very long time and there are much better books on the stuff, believe me.<br /><br />The sex scenes in this book is so unrealistic I found myself skimming through them whenever they came up (and trust me there were plenty - eyes rolling). It's like every chapter has 3-4 sex scenes and they're all HORRIBLE. I couldn't even finish it. Worst read of the year so far.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|American Reunion is the very nostalgic fourth in the American Pie series (or eighth if you count the direct-to-DVD features). Even though it was released thirteen years after the first American Pie, it sure didn't feel like it as the actors and actresses pretty much look and act the same as they did back in 1999. Sean William Scott continues to steal every scene he is in as Stiffler. Even though it is \\"good\\", American Reunion isn't the best in the series. I still think that award goes to American Pie 2 for being fast and funny pretty much from beginning to end. American Reunion has some slow spots and a lot of soap opera moments, with several relationship issues taking place. Still, it's worth seeing for fans of the series. If you aren't a fan of the series, it might be lost on you.
0439813786|5.0|As much a fan of the ebook revolution as I am, \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" is a perfect example of a literary work of art that could never be faithfully rendered electronically.  The text, carefully arranged on multiple page spreads, is one thing that would suffer in the translation -- but it is the artwork, and its ingenious insertion into the story, that can't be reproduced in pixels.<br /><br />The hundred-plus full-page drawings are so simple yet so exquisitely detailed you can practically hear the sound of a pencil scratching out all the cross-hatched shading.  Lingering over the illustrations is as much a pleasure as forging ahead in the text to find out what happens next.  It's a schizophrenic approach to reading that melds into a perfect whole under Selznick's masterful marrying of story and pictures.<br /><br />The inevitable comparisons to the also-excellent film version belie the utterly unique experience of each. Stark, black-and-white stills and elaborate color-in-motion images satisfy different appetites of the eye, while the story -- same spine with a few different appendages -- moves along engagingly in both media.  The joy of \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret,\\" as with any book, is that you make the story happen by turning each page and connecting the parts in your imagination.  That's a primal pleasure which technology is ill-suited to replicate.  Vive la papier!  (pardon my French!).<br /><br />-- mm
B0081J9OWC|5.0|This album has a great hold on what ES & t MZs have always been. There is a little for everyone and every mood on this album from the acoustic soulful tones of tracks like \\"Child\\" and \\"Man on Fire\\" to the reggae undertones of \\"One Love to Another\\" and \\"Mayla.\\" I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so much fun I love playing the game<br />I recamen for everyone. to play it it is fun
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. very fun and additive.  My daughter plays it everyday. She cant wait to get enough money to buy the next animal and make the family.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|This recording is amazingly layered, unusual and not because it's so indulgent that it is a damned shame for what might have been.  It's brilliant and schizo.  Close!  But, no cigar.  BRIAN WILSON was at the height of his extraordinary powers, and was apparently losing it.  PET SOUNDS was critically praised, but financially bore no comparison with anything THE BEATLES issued.  This intended follow-up might have secured THE BEACH BOYS' place in the Psychedelic years.  Alas 'twas not to be (though great BEACH BOYS albums that came later are beloved by diehards like me).  If you are a fan, as am I, it's hard to fault what we've waited the better part of half a century to hear...
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad is one of the best series ever shown on television. It is a bit off-beat (plot and characters) and, like The Shield, it makes you root for the good bad guys. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, start at season one and work your way through to Season Four. You won't be disappointed!!

0345803485|1.0|I decided to order this book after hearing all of the great reviews about it. It is an understatement to say that this book is pornographic.  The main characters have graphic sex in practically every chapter. It is definitely for mature audiences only, but I digress. My main problem with the book is not the graphic sex...I knew it would be pornographic from the reviews.<br /><br />What disgusts me about this book is the two main characters. Mr. Grey is unbelievably controlling and demanding (and I'm not referring to the sex scenes). He is psychologically, and even a little physically, abusive. A character of this nature is not foreign to literature, but it disturbs me that E.L. James tries to paint him as a charming, mysterious, romantic character. There is nothing romantic or charming about abuse. He practically brainwashes Ana into being his sex slave. James has written the character of Ana to be so irritatingly naive that she accepts the way Mr. Grey treats her and even considers it \\"hot\\".<br /><br />Every page I read made me angrier and more nauseous. This book is completely terrible. I would venture to guess that E.L. James has a disturbing past of her own. Otherwise, I don't see how she could have written such filth about an abusive relationship and market it as an \\"erotic romance\\".<br /><br />I bought the entire trilogy at once, but I have no intention of reading books 2 and 3. Book 1 was torture enough. This book was a waste of time and paper. In a time when young women's self-esteem is at an all-time low, this book does nothing but try to convince young girls that they can make a man happy by surrendering complete control of themselves and catering to his every whim.<br /><br />I implore you to not buy this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought it was very fun I loved it I think everyone should have it its free and easy to install

B007X4N0DU|4.0|Let me preface my review by stating I have been a HUGE P.O.D. fan dating back to \\"Southtown.\\"  I have been waiting for this record for sometime now with GREAT expectations!!  \\"Murdered Love\\" may be one of the band's most lyrically intense releases to date.  Having said that, the last track on the U.S. release, \\"I Am,\\" totally turned me off from what I once thought was so COOL about the band.  I have always admired the band for sticking to their guns and releasing tracks praising and glorifying Christ in many different ways.  I don't understand why the sudden urge to introduce muted out f bombs??  It definitely doesn't add anything to the meaning or intensity of the track to me, but instead causes a HUGE distraction....Thus the four star rating.<br /><br />Now the rest of the record.  My favorite tracks include, \\"Murdered Love,\\" \\"Babylon The Murderer,\\" \\"Lost In Forever,\\" \\"On Fire,\\" and even \\"I Am\\" minus the harsh lyrical babbling in places. Sonny, Marcos, Traa, and Wuv continue to mature and grow musically as well as spiritually and it definitely shows in this record.<br />The Japanese release includes a track \\"Find A Way\\" which should have DEFINITELY made the U.S. release.  GREAT track!!!<br /><br />Overall, I was a little let down, especially considering all the pre release hype.  P.O.D. are still one of my favorite bands, but this release left me wanting more classic P.O.D.<br /><br />BOOM BIDDY BYE BYE!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love it.  I play it at my grandmas house.  Its the cats meow.  It is the bees knees.  Meow. meow.

B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is a love story in more ways than one. If you are a lover of the making of music and if you are a fan of love stories. The story has 3 different perspectives that comes together so beautifully. Although the acting itself was not a stellar performance, each actor played its character well and made me to love this movie. I can watch it all the time. One of my favs!!
B000000OR9|5.0|absolutely a great album from the hair-band days. If you like any of the music from this era you should love this one.
0553801503|5.0|This is another great installment for A Song of Ice and Fire. I do not think this is a step down from the first three, on the contrary i think this is on par with the first three. A Feast for Crows gives a lot of character development for Ceresi and Jaime, two characters that are fascinating to me. While I do get annoyed with the constant mistakes of Ceresi I still think all the back story we get is worth it.<br /><br />If you are truly interested in the ENTIRE story of A Song of Ice and Fire then A Feast for Crows is going to be just as good as the first three. I love all of the history and character development thats in this book. You really understand, as much as you can in a Martin novel, the characters. Don't let the averaged 3 star review fool you, this is a great installment in this epic series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I absolutely loved this first book.  Great characters, great concepts.  This book alone carried my through a extra couple books of the misery that follows.  You will fall in love with characters in this book.  Don't!  Anyone with a scrap of decency gets mauled as the story continues.  You are left with the despicable characters.  Eventually it gets so bad that you start routing for the least loathsome of them just so you stop being disappointed when the newest character you try to like gets crushed by the game.

0307744434|2.0|I was really REALLY excited to get my hands on this book once I heard about it. I thought it would have everything I like: magic similar to that in \\"Harry Potter\\", the wonder and awe of the circus like in \\"Water For Elephants\\", and a deadly \\"Hunger Games\\"-like competition, where only one victor is left standing. Unfortunately, \\"The Night Circus\\" was a huge disappointment.<br />First of all, where is the character development?? Or even the characters for that matter? Morgenstern reveals painstakingly little insight into the characters' perspectives and feelings. This really made the book a bore because I couldn't get attached to any of the characters. Had even a few of the major characters had been fleshed out a little better this flaw could have been overlooked, but unfortunately that's not the case.<br />The plot was extremely frustrating. (Not the good kind of \\"this is so delightfully complex\\" frustrating, but the \\"OK, how is this even related to that?\\" kind of frustrating.) My main complaint with the book is flow (or lack thereof). The book jumps around from place to place, character to character, time to time, in a way that is supposed to be witty and thought-provoking, but it ends up just being confusing, uninteresting, and not well plotted. Also, I am STILL not sure what the main point of the plot was supposed to be. The \\"challenge\\" and its origins and consequences are never explained; I questioned throughout the entire novel, \\"What is the point of this?\\" Unfortunately, I don't think there is one!<br />I will say that Morgenstern is excellent with the sensory details (the sights, smells, tastes, and sounds of the circus). Those parts of the novel are ridiculously good and descriptive. If only Morgenstern could have had that much pizzazz with the rest of the book!<br />In conclusion, all the elements of \\"The Night Circus\\" that you would think would be awesome just don't blend together. It's like a dish that has all your favorite ingredients and looks tasty on the surface, but from that first bite you can tell none of the ingredients blend together and thrive.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I absolutely loved the first book.  Now I am kicking myself for falling into the trap of this series.  I can;t take the abject misery that each book stacks on the one before it.

B003ZZAXFO|5.0|I first heard this album on vinyl, and it completely blew me away. To this day, it never gets old.It's so deep, so emotional, so...in a sense, thrilling. Two songs in particular are my favorites. \\"Biko\\" is an amazing, classic live song about Stephan Biko. \\"Family Snapshot\\", however, combines Gabriel's Genesis years with what he would do in So. Melt is an overlooked classic!
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|I love this music and can't stop playing it. It is relaxing and heartfelt. The deeper meaning contained in the words is carried by a light and rolling music.
0393080269|4.0|I read the book on the two legs of a recent transcontinental flight and liked the content, the method and most of the arguments. It is a well written, but not so well edited text. The book claims that China and Taiwan separated at the end of WWII. While the Japanese left China in 1945 the territories did not separate till the end of the civil war in 1949 when Chiang Kai Shek fled the mainland. On the Chapter on India he cites the example of Bihar and uses the term \\"lawless Biharis\\" which was not in good taste. While the recent state of affairs in the state has not been good this way to uniformly brush the citizens of a state does not add value to the book or its message.<br /><br />These small mistakes apart there are a couple of underlying themes that I felt are important for anyone considering buying the text. Though the book claims to be looking at the long term returns from different economies and the author's predictions about the same he presents a very narrow view of looking at policies and tools.<br /><br />Let us look at something of relevance to the American audience. The book claims that in the aftermath of the Great Depression the US followed Hayek's paradigm to let the markets clear out ill resources and return to health and the result was that the US economy doubled in size in the next 20 odd years. While it is true that the government or the Fed intervened very little in the early part of the recession in 1929 the recession did not end till 1933 and by then a few things had happened:<br /><br />1. The Fed intervened and brought more liquidity into the system.<br />2. The dollar was devalued (by almost 75%) essentially creating inflationary expectations in a deflationary economy.<br />3. The New Deal was brought in.<br /><br />The first two steps clearly are monetary stimulus, and the last one is nothing but a fiscal stimulus. The real growth that brought US to the forefront of the world was the war fueled spending during WW II. None of this is a freemarket and invisible hand policy approach. So the claim that the US economy doubled in size because the policy makers of the day left the market fend for itself are on vary shaky grounds. Putting that as a matter of fact is in my opinion outright peddling of ideology.<br /><br />The book further claims that the reason for Japan's lost decades even in the midst of one of the largest fiscal and monetary stimuli was that Japan did not let markets correct the problems in the economy. Japan managed to grow out of the ravages of WW II and managed to produce numbing growth with the same model and no natural resources to speak of for more than 4 decades! How come the model is good when it works, and not good when it does not? I think a much better analysis of the Japanese story is in Richard Koo's [[ASIN:B002G7UTK6 The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics: Lessons from Japan's Great Recession [HOLY GRAIL OF MACROECONO]]].<br /><br />One other point that he does not take into account is that though Japan's economy has not grown at a rapid rate in the last 20 years its per-capita income is very much at par with other developed nations. With the population virtually stagnant and a high standard of living an argument can be made that the people do not care what international investors think of! The difference between Japan and China (or for that matter India) is that China has 4 times as many people as the US: it is not a small state. So the sheer size of the Chinese economy is bound to grow and become larger than the US in our lifetime.<br /><br />The book insists on using market exchange rates to make comparisons. It makes sense as a selling point if one can use it to paint a more contrasting picture but for a book on international economies not bothering to mention PPP rates does not seem to be an oversight. On the basis of market exchange rates the developing economies may look smaller, but market exchange rates include a lot more information than just the cost of goods and services. So his insistence on using market exchange rates was a bit off-putting.<br /><br />What I loved about the book was the frequent reminders that leadership matters, and good leaders produce good results. I will talk about the country I know the most of: India. The growth rate of the nation as a whole has come down to about 6-7%, but there are states within the country that are growing at or above double digits: most notably Bihar and Gujarat. The reason I chose these states are that the state leaders are by all counts the most enterprising of all state leaders in the country, but the contrast is that Bihar is the poorest state in the nation, and Gujarat is the richest. But they are both growing at more than 10%. So the small base story does not seem to be very valid on the face of it. Good leaders on the other hand are important. One of the biggest arguments for the slowdown of the national economy has been that the central leadership has been mired with socialist ideals and leaders. One of the most commonly used term in the country today is Policy Paralysis. Time magazine's Asia edition even carried a cover story with the Indian prime-minister on the cover with the title \\"The Underachiever.\\"<br /><br />The other thing I loved was a very concise description of modern economic histories of all major developing economies in the world. I am inclined to include the text in my reading list for my International Finance students.<br /><br />Read the book. It is fun, but take some of the claims with a pinch of salt. When I read something I keep the person's position in mind and make appropriate deviations from the claims. Do the same with this book: the author is a major investment banker! When reading anything from Stiglitz or Reich or Krugman I make it a point to look to the right for better analysis, and when reading Friedman or Hayek or anything from Wall Street I look to the left. I do not claim to be anywhere close to any of these guys but it just makes better senseto keep people's ideological positions in mind when reading their work. As is said there are lies, damned lies, and then there are statistics. We can crank up numbers to prove anything but if we have an idea of where the person is coming from it makes it easier to take a more balanced view of things on hand.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|So glad I overlooked the low ratings ! Why anyone would rate this book lower than 5 stars is beyond me . The name says it all .. It is a beautiful disaster but so much more beautiful in the end .. If I had it my way there would be many more to follow but honestly it ended perfectly. Jamie McGuire knows how to write. Angst, hate, pain, love .. It has it all . Couldn't have asked for a better story. It's the book I've been begging for without even knowing it for years. I'm positive I'll be rereading it again . It haunts me everytime I happen to see the cover on my kindle or in recommendations on amazon and has certainly been hard to find a book to follow .. Thank you Jamie for sharing this heartbreakingly beautiful disastrous story with us I'll be waiting impatiently for more from you :)
B00846TRHY|4.0|This movie falls in between the cracks due to harsh language in the beginning and some gore, and the generally positive (but also critical) portrayal of Christianity on Childers. Plus a reminder of the ongoing atrocities the UN is doing nothng about. That's why it didn't last long in the theaters, I would guess.<br /><br />Childers is leading a pretty bad life when a traumatic incident makes him realize he has to change. He finds salvation in Christ, and things turn around. He is confronted with the sufferings inflicted by Kony and friends, and goes to the Sudan to do something to help, building an orphanage and feeding the victims.<br /><br />What do you do when helpless children are being kidnapped and turned into murdering monsters or killed? What do you do when these kidnapping cowards bring the fight to your gates, destroying their safe haven besides?<br /><br />Childers decides he has to fight back - using bullets and the occasional RPG. And this is what makes this movie interesting. What should he do? What should Christians do? Is \\"turn the other cheek\\" for when you're slapped, or also when other innocents are being slapped around?<br /><br />We see his frustration when fellow Christians back home seem indifferent to the horrors he has seen - at least, where their pocketbooks are concerned. He begins to focus on the Sudanese to the neglect of his family. Right or wrong? Is his daughter right to fret over Dad's refusal to spring for a limo for her formal when kids in the Sudan are getting hacked to death and blown up? We are not told if he shares these sufferings with his family; the movie portrays him as keeping it to himself.<br /><br />One reviewer mentions some scenes thrown in for dramatic effect, such as his crisis of faith, turning instead to himself to solve these problems. I don't know if this is true, but be aware of this possibility.<br /><br />In the end, it's a powerful, disturbing, and stirring movie. At the very least it may spur you to help financially by donating to organizations such as Angels in Africa.ancially by donating to organizations such as Angels in Africa.
B00846REIS|4.0|I got an e-mail a few weeks ago which read something along the lines of \\"If you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey, you should read Bared to You.\\" Sadly, it had not been released yet, but I eagerly counted the days. I read some early reviews of it and they were overwhelmingly positive, which increased my anticipation even more! Finally, I had the book on my Kindle Fire (release day) and sat down to read, completely ignoring the assignment for my summer class that was due in less than a week and devoured the book. I couldn't put it down and finished it the day I started it. It grabs ahold of you like a baby with a piece of candy and refuses to let you go.<br />Gideon and Eva were both damaged characters. I enjoyed that they weren't perfect but not so damaged I couldn't relate to them, even though they both had some moments you wanted to smack them upside the head.<br />The book was well-written, interesting story, Eva and Gideon had chemistry that almost made you forget to breathe and steamy sex scenes. Eva's model best friend was a great character, as was her boss and his boyfriend. My one main gripe about the book was really about Eva's financial responsibility. Her stepdad was rich, her biological dad was a police officer. At the beginning of the book, she says something about not being able to pay for her student loans so she let her real dad take care of them (we'll forget also for a moment we find out later she has a nest egg she refuses to touch that started at 5 million and has been growing under the watchful care of her step dad but she can't use the interest or the investment returns and her middle class dad has to pay for it?) Then later she buys a very expensive ring? Not acceptable to me. I get that it's fiction and she has many people in her life that are wealthy, but that just seemed wrong. OK, I'll stop griping about that now  .<br />I didn't even finish reading the book before I recommended it to my mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Mother-in-law LOVED it, haven't heard from sister-in-law. If you enjoyed 50 shades (and even if you didn't like 50 Shades but you like steamy books every now and again), you should give this a read. Not for younger readers (I won't let my teenage daughter read it yet).<br />Sensuality: several descriptive sex scenes<br />Rating: 4 starsen't heard from sister-in-law.

B005FPT51K|4.0|I really do love this camera.  For these reasons, I can see my son when in his room at any time I choose just by turning on my iphone, I can talk to him through my iphone to comfort him if I am cooking or just can't get to him at that very moment, and that I can mount this on my wall and through my iphone I can move the camera to view almost any spot in the room.  Now setting this camera up to use while at home I would say was fairly simple.  As far as setting this camera up to use when you are gone so that if you have a babysitter and you want to check on baby while out I have not yet fully figured out.  Through your home wireless this camera works without a glitch I love it.  Luckily for me my son is 4 months and I am not ready to have a babysitter anytime soon.  =)
B006O8K4LW|5.0|If you go on Google, you'll find that Olli Mustonen sometimes infuriates critics because of his wayward. headstrong interpretations.  There is no such problem with this program!  Scriabin was a bizarre, if talented, composer, and this program is a good introduction to his highly interesting, if slightly weird, world.  Early Scriabin sounds somewhat like Chopin, and late Scriabin is more renminiscent of Debussy.  His music is difficult to bring off, both technically and musically, but Mustonen succeeds.  His choice of recital pieces ignore the composer's middle period and sticks with the early and late stuff, but quite successfully.  Strongly recommended, for those who are interested in good pianism and this rarely-heard composer.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I don't actively seek out reading vampire romances, but I've read quite a few by now... including Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series, Karen Chance's \\"Cassandra Palmer\\" and \\"Midnight's Daughter\\" series, and Meg Cabot's \\"Insatiable\\" series. Of these, I like Karen Chance the best. \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" is... readable, but pick up any of those first.<br /><br />Pros: The plot is reasonably interesting as Diana's magical heritage slowly reveals itself and we meet a cast of supporting characters including Isabeau, Sarah, Emily, Marcus, and Miriam. The story moves around from Oxford, London to rural France to small town New England which make for nice changes of setting.<br /><br />Cons: I think I had the same problem as many other reviewers did -- Diana is clearly an incredibly intelligent, capable and powerful woman and witch, but allows herself to be so controlled by Matthew that it's off putting. I know why everyone was supposed to be so obsessed with the Ashmole book, but it's weak and unconvincing for being such an important plot point.<br /><br />I have about zero interest in reading the sequel. Couldn't care less what happens to them.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|They say there are two components to enjoyment of a story... one part is the suspense of what will happen and the other part is how you get there. I watched and thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons of the Game of Thrones television show on HBO. The television series follows the plot of the book pretty well, so I already knew what would happen, but really loved reading the book. You know a story has lasting quality when you're able to enjoy the journey again even when the suspense is gone. I loved gaining all these additional insights into George Martin's captivating characters. It was surprisingly well written and evokes an entire world in your imagination that is more 3D than felt from the screen. I found every character to be sympathetic -- even the ones I didn't expect to like -- as they took their turns narrating their POV. The Stark children are young in age, but are portrayed so maturely that it doesn't feel like a children's book at all. I was a little nervous about the violence and sex scenes. They are somewhat... descriptive, but didn't feel gratuitous or overdone. It's definitely a long book and did take me awhile to get through, but I've already plunged right back into reading the second!

We were hooked and began searching for more on the elusive gruffalo.  Through Amazon we purchased the original story as well as The Gruffalo's Child.  These led to a visit to its official British website to see what else was available.  I see a gruffalo birthday party in the works!

B007RXRSEY|5.0|The collaboration between Slash and Kennedy seems to have found its mark with this collection of songs. Kennedy is the perfect voice for Slash's ranging, hard-driving style. Paying homage to great sounds from the 60's, 70's, and yes, even the Guns n' Roses days, Slash tears through this album with a force I haven't heard in rock in a long, long time. Kennedy's range perfectly accents the riffs and pulls a classic sound into the future. I haven't stopped listening to this since I downloaded it. Favorite tracks include \\"Not for me\\", \\"You're a liar\\", the title track, and \\"No more Heroes\\". Really though, there is not a bad track on this. Well worth it!!!!!
0307887448|5.0|Okay, I loved this book and am certainly one of the people this book was written for.  I still play old adventure games, 80s music, and was an early BBS user - I had an atari 2600 when I was a kid and played it a lot - my dad was an electrical engineer and I had The Holy Grail memorized before I started high school(and I'm a chick) - I was never AS into the movies and TV of the 80s as some of the characters in this book - but many of them are still in my head as classics.  This is a very unique and fun book and I am so happy one of my friends (who shares my love of classic video games) recommended it to me.  I listened to it on audio read by Wil Wheaton which was a little surreal but also really fun as well.

B001KWTBQQ|5.0|Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a lighter dose of the Star Wars universe, in that it's a cartoonish CGI film that is made for the kids, but adults can enjoy it as well. It's fun to see all of the familiars, but without the hard-edged evil from a Count Dooku or even Anakin. Here, Anakin takes a Padawan learner under his wing, and throw in some good humor from the supporting cast, and what you get is an hour and a half of an enjoyable kid flick. Yes, there's violence, but this is Star Wars, so it's inevitable. The plot is somewhat strange (Jabba's son kidnapped) but that's okay; it's neat to see what the writers do to expand the boundaries of their imaginations. I thought the voices were done well and were pretty much on par with the original actors from the 6 movies. The biggest appeal of this film series is that we're still getting Star Wars even after the movie franchise has closed its doors, so there's always something to look forward to.

B004LP3AYI|1.0|This review is about the digital, Kindle version of this book. It is so filled with errors it looks to have been edited by one who learned English as a second language. I describe the editing thus not to try to be funny but because of all the wrong verb tenses and a instances of singular nouns that should be plural or vice versa. Those are exactly the kind of errors you hear from non-native speakers of English. The print version that I read before was much cleaner. There is truly no excuse for this. To skimp on the quality of this ebook is particularly insulting when you consider that the Kindle version cost more than the paperback I purchased a few years ago!

B0015F1VY8|1.0|I liked the first Elizabeth film. There is no way this sequel could have been written by the same writer. Rather than a story; this film is a series of images with weird music, and disconnected, meaningless, dialogue which does not connect into a story. The lavish costumes and sets give you the impression the film is going to tell a story, but it never does. I read the reviews and was expecting an okay movie that was not quite as good as the first. However, it was far worse than I expected.<br /><br />There is a subplot about an assassination, but we only see a small piece of the story, and are left with more questions than answers.<br /><br />There is a subplot about the Spanish Armada, and there is no story here at all; just images and weird music..<br /><br />There is a subplot about palace romance. You get a beginning and end with no middle, and no rhyme or reason. \\"Weird\\" is the best word to describe the script. Some new-wave artist is presenting us images with weird music, and a dialogue intended to match the weird mood of the images and music; rather than tell a story.<br /><br />There is more story in the reviews than in the film. There is no story in this film at all. The writer should never have been paid, because he never wrote any story. The writer should be flogged, keel-hauled, and stretched on the rack for ripping us all off; along with every reviewer who gave this more than one star, because they did not want to admit they had been swindled.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Alien must have a lot of pretty hardcore fans, because I saw little reason to hate this movie. I enjoyed it. Quite a few fans had an issue with the Engineer ship scene. It's quite clear that there was exploding debris all over the ship forcing them to stay on that path. Watch the scene again. It makes perfect sense. This is a fine example of overeducated, overgrown children who think they're smarter than everyone else, especially the people that made this film. It's a shame, because I thought the movie was extremely well done and deserving of a sequel. Thanks to the ridiculous complaints, this probably will never happen. Just dumb the next film down and make it PG-13, Fox. Clearly, your target demographic is too ungrateful to deserve great R-rated sci-fi.
0345444051|5.0|Though this book dates itself, it has to be among my favorites when it comes to mixing the topics that it did. It's a short story compared to some of Clarke's other works but worth every page.

0451457994|5.0|I am not sure how else to describe the amazing adventure that takes place in this novel as anything other than brilliant.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought this book on a chance because of the very high reviews (currently has a full five star average) and relatively small price for a book of this length.<br /><br />Took me a while to actually get around to reading it, yet probably within minutes of starting I was hooked in by the first of the five stories that make up this Omnibus. Yet after the first story, the pacing, style and mood changes from suspenseful and dauntingly mysterious into a more slow and understandable experience. So it's easy to tell that the first story was written as a stand alone story that purposely leaves questions unanswered, and the follow up books were left to pick up the pieces and answer the questions. In fact, I felt this Omnibus only had two stories, being that the last four directly tie to themselves. Each section tends to stick to the perspective of just one character and the last one cleverly switching between quite a few different characters.<br /><br />Yet overall, all five of these stories combine to give a unique take on a sc-fi concept that has already been done a multitude of different ways. The pacing may be slow at times, yet that is part of the charm that it takes the time to slow down and give the reader some atmosphere of not just the settings but the characters also.<br /><br />Best of all, this series seems to have a very good chance of becoming something very big. There appears to be a lavish full budgeted movie in the works, there are prequel books already coming out and plans for sequels to come out also. By the time the movie comes out this may very well be the new big franchise that everyone will be wrapped up in, so why not beat the hype and read this great book now?

B008B3H4VQ|2.0|Remember the days of Hybrid Theory and Metoera, when the music had a lot of lyrics and was much more aggressive? Well, those days still have not returned. The music on this album is more akin to Midnights to Midnight, but softer. It's like they had an orgy with Fionna Apple, Coldplay, Adele, and Muse; and this album was the result of that. While listening to the album, I wondered if Linkin Park said, \\"Wow, look at the success of Muse! How can we emulate that sound?\\"<br /><br />I agree with a previous review that bands need to evolve so they just don't vomit out the same sound over and over. I guess I just feel like there's a difference between evolving and changing styles completely, LP doing the latter. And maybe that is because their musical interests and style truly is \\"evolving\\" this way, and that's cool if they are remaining true to themselves and their musicianship. But, I do miss the older days of their career.<br /><br />The worst part of this album for me is the overall lack of lyrics. Chester and Mike just like to repeat the same lines over and over. They really need to get back on drugs.<br /><br />If you loved Minutes to Midnight and Thousand Suns, you will likely enjoy this album. If you've been waiting for a return to Hybrid Theory and Meteora, move along and keep waiting; or just give up.
0385474547|4.0|My teacher for AP World History assigned a summer reading list and i chose this book to read. It was a short in my case (4 days) compared to another book i had to read. In the end it was good book, but i would not have read it if it was not on my summer reading list.
B005HSL626|4.0|realy fun game but the screen did go black a few times and the adds were a little to big for my taste.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|What can I say, I love the Beatles and all of that craps that John Lennon and the hippies stood for in the day. It was like a drunken night party that eventually have to pay for the next morning. I still love it, I just got wiser .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an outstanding app. It allows the user to access multiple versions of the Bible and offers some really good studies and devotionals. The app will also read many of the versions out loud in a pleasing non-mechanical voice. I have this on my phone and my kindle and I use it every day. Thanks YouVersion for a great Bible app!

B004ZZFMTK|5.0|I have wanted this cookbook since I was a teenager and I watched Julia on TV.  I'm so glad I bought it.  The book gives easy to understand instructions for French cooking techniques.  I wish I had bought it years ago.  I'm baking and cooking things I never  thouht I would try and these dishes are turning out great.
0307477479|4.0|I devoured this book in about three hours simply because I could not put it down.  It came highly recommended to me by a colleague and his pristine record of somehow knowing exactly what I will enjoy is still in tact.  This book was harrowing and haunting in that I cannot stop thinking about it even days after I have finished it.  I find myself remembering events and incidents from the book as I go about my daily business and I keep working the intricacies of the woven stories out while I process the overall themes.  I believe part of what I really like about this book is the idea that--like fine wine--it takes a while to breathe before it becomes truly remarkable.<br /><br />I must admit to not being a fan of the infamous Power Point chapter; however, when placing in the the grand scheme of the book, it makes sense and--for me at least--it added a poignancy in that Egan writes a character who is so ill-equipped to effectively communicate that her options are limited to the staccato cadences of Power Point language.  The Power Point focuses on another character's obsession with musical pauses and in this chapter, Egan gives us a different kind of pause.  It is very effective, even if I did become annoyed at having to turn my book sideways...<br /><br />The brilliance of this work isn't in chicanery or stunt writing.  The brilliance comes from a writer who creates fully realized characters and then shares their stories with us one fleeting glimpse at a time.  The thematic arc of the passage of time and its sometimes devastating effects is what ultimately connects the characters to each other in quite the same way the readers connect with the piece.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run!! its Sooo fun! and u will like it too;) if u like instgram u will LOVE it!!!!
0345803485|1.0|This book is about abusing women. Its a pathetically written tale of a woman who wants to change an emotionally unavailable man. He is controlling, she hates it and is too stupid to figure this out. Its hidden under some porn, but the abuse issue churned my stomach.  Would not recommend to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Katniss and Peeta make a cute couple. Both are compelling characters that seem very realistic. On that note every character in the book was realistic and stood out on their own merit. I especially liked Rue, so small yet agile, brave, and smart. Gale is a character I could easily grow to love. Responsible, caring and obviously adores Katniss. For most of the book I rooted for Gale and Katniss to end up together. However from the cave scenes on Peeta won me over completely. I've known very very people as open with their feelings as he is so he struck a chord and resonated deeply with me.<br /><br />The story held my attention from the second page to the end. That's a hard thing for any book to do these days. I have a very analytical mind and my inner editor/critic never shuts up. But the story line was so compelling and easy to relate to that I was absorbed all the way to the end.<br /><br />While I'm intrigued to find out how the story will continue, however I was greatly dissapointed that the book left off on a huge cliffhanger.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this is a lot better than the free version. someone I know always wants to play this version rather than the free version he has. It's challenging and addicting in a good way :)
B007SGM084|4.0|I really enjoyed these books, although I don't see what all the controversy is about as the things the actually do are fairly tame.  By the 3rd book I was skipping the sex scenes because they're all pretty much the same.  The 3rd book  also felt rushed and disjointed.  That being said, I've recommended these books to most of my female friends and a few of the males as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's fast, it's flexible, it has great graphics...and unobtrusive ads. What more can you ask for?  It's an android app winner!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is amazing! it has different edits as well as blemish and hue!!! I absolutely love it! It is a must get!!!!!!
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Let me just say that my first review was rejected because of a rant about this book, hehe.  Now that I have gotten that out of the way...<br /><br />I love deliciously bad.  I'm a big fan of light/ escapist literature.  There was nothing delicious about this book.  It was incredibly painful to read.  I'm relieved I bought the $2.99 copy--  but I definitely have buyer's remorse.<br /><br />So, the plot reads like a bad ABC special about dating violence and binge drinking.  The characters need some serious therapy.  In terms of writing, the book dragged and the plot took strange twists.  Just when I thought I was nearing the end, I'd look at my percentage meter on my kindle and notice I was still only 25% through the book.  It was almost like two books in one with two plot lines, both of which would just not die.  There were a ton of extraneous, undeveloped characters.  I couldn't wrap my head around why certain characters made it to the book.  The male character was a restraining order waiting to happen-- I found nothing redeeming about him.  He was just a thug.<br /><br />Then I realized-- self published!  Zero editing or filter!  Nobody told this woman that writing a YA book with a criminal philandering thug as a lead romantic interest.  might not be the best example for teens.  Women are sucking up the \\"I can change him, all he needs is me!  Love will see us through\\" mantra with a straw.  Right.<br /><br />For the record, I see women like Abby in domestic violence shelters.  Way too often.<br /><br />It gets two stars because I made it to the end.  Rock on with your bad self, McGuire!
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have spend many hours playing this game. Easy to use. I highly recommend this for people who like to spend mindless hours wasting time.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Got this beauty of an app several nights ago and haven't been disappointed! I recently returned from a trip to the British Virgin Islands and fell in love with the sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks outside of my hotel.  When I saw this app I had to grab it and utilizing the plugin feature I was able to create a custom set of wave sounds so realistic that it's like being back in the beautiful BVI.....amazing app! The plugin feature adds great versatility to this app and allows it to grow and add more sounds and scenes as time goes on. Great value considering you spend a 1/3 of your life sleeping or at least trying too!
0061438294|5.0|I never realized how well it can work on some persons and how limited it is on others. Detecting the truth is an art. Concealing the truth can be done too. It is good to know that there are limits on our ability to detect a lie. When my gut says lie, I can probably believe it; I might not be able to prove the lie though. Joe writes in an easy to read style. A good read for investigators, parents, and leaders.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is one of the grates apps I have ever played. this app is grate for comepetative and not comeprtative people.its grate for kids I would know I am one!also its grate for adults.
B000JML7EC|5.0|A classic.  Everyone should read this book...and all things written by Robert Louis Stevenson.  He is one of my favorite authors of all time.

B007TXN4TK|5.0|I LOVE this app! its very fun and easy to do. some of the songs are hard yes, but that the joy of doing it is trying to pass it! worth getting!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I play this game almost everyday! my sister even likes to steal my kindle to play it! so over all its a great game.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book for 2 reasons!(ok, maybe more than 2 but 2 main reasons) The first one is because of TRAVIS!!! I am a sucker for an alpha male and it doesn't get much better than Travis when we are talking about alpha males :)  The second reason I loved this book so much was because it was so real! How many couples do you know that fall in love and live happily ever after without complications?? Exactly, not many!! All of the problems that come up in this story could happen and do happen but if you love someone enough you make it work.  This is one of the first books that I have ever read that I could read 10 times and never get bored with it :)
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I cannot understand why this got such good Kindle reviews. It is just another postapocalyptic family values sob fest, like Hunger Games. You would think that in a future with restrictions on reproduction, people would find better motivations than love. As if living in a hole is not depressing enough, the author feels we should be depressed even more by sappy romance. If I am to put up with the depiction of an unrealistic distopia I expect some redeaming qualities from the story. Seriously, if they can repair their hydroponics, you would think they could repair their remote sensors. Maybe I have been spoiled by books like Windup Girl, but so far as I could stand reading it, Wool is terrible.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|It seems almost everyone has an opinion on this book and my opinion is that it is AWESOME!!! The people who call it \\"mommy porn\\" obviously have not read many adult romance books because they all have \\"steamy\\" sex scenes in them.  I have heard and been involved in many conversations about this book and my feeling is that everyone has the right to their own opinion but don't judge people when they don't feel the same way as you.  I love Christian and Anastacia's story and I am not ashamed to say I have read it and LOVED it!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great app for people of any age if is a egicinal game and makes you think a little bit insteade of being so easy!! ;)
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a really fun app. i got it when it was free actually but it has good effects. i dont think its worth 5 dollars but its definately a good app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is harder then it looks so have fun let the kids play eye and hand. have to work together
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice simple nothing fancy. easy to use. looks like something that would have been included. big numbers would be great for those who need readers.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. I actually couldn't make myself finish it. I kept reading hoping for more, but finally gave up on it. It's a slow read, and more redundancy as with the last two books.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|When I got this I got it for free! And anyway I like this game. I dont understand why its 1 dollar now...
B004T2QZL8|4.0|So this game is fun, really fun. I haven't gotten any glitches. I can only give it 4 stars because I can't get on quest one yet. It maybe something you create. What I feel I should mention, its great for some kids. It depends on the age of the kid and parent. You can turn child-mode on and off. It also has a password which is always good. I digest this game for anyone that wants to think or want to preoccupy themselves.
1936608898|5.0|Having read Robb Wolf's \\"The Paleo Solution\\" and Mark Sisson's \\"The Primal Blueprint\\", I wondered how reading \\"It Starts with Food\\" would enhance my experience as a sweet-toothed paleo-wannabe.  \\"It Starts with Food\\" has provided me with clarity and a simplification of healthy eating standards.  Instead of chiding myself for consuming \\"cheats\\" and considering every morning as a \\"restart\\" on a doomed mission, I am now mindful of the value of the treats I choose to indulge in and am beginning to connect them with their consequences and triggers.  Dallas and Melissa's meal-structuring guidelines have made it very easy for me to fill myself and my plate at any of my 3 meals a day, and I am reducing snacking.  Of the 3 books I've mentioned in this review I see this one as best for giving to \\"fat-phobic\\", nay-saying family members, who have already heard about paleo and have been frightened!  Looking forward to a successful Whole30 later this month!
0606231722|3.0|For a 300 page book, you shouldn't have to read over 100 pages before it becomes interesting. I was highly enthusiastic to read the book, but there's too many survivor accounts not worth reading. To be fair, some of the accounts are fascinating. I wish the author had expanded on the latter and not written the former. Less characters would have made a more interesting read. I recommend borrowing this book from the library. It IS worth reading, but I would try to find a way to read it without buying it... or buy it for cheap! FYI, there's no way a movie could even closely resemble this book, unless it's a documentary and there is no way they will do that with Brad Pitt. In comparison, I'm guessing the upcoming movie will probably make this book look awesome, which it isn't. Not a bad book either. Three stars
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun and super addicting i play it for hours at a time without knowing it... it never ends
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my next book after finishing the Fifty Shades trilogy and I was pleasantly surprised. It held my attention and had me wondering what would happen next. This couple has issues but girl takes revenge to an entirely new level.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a pretty fun game but I don't love it most of the games were like impossible to complete I wouldn't exactly recomend it
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I knew I had to order this cover once I saw my mother-in-law's. It doesn't add bulk like most other covers I've seen. The only drawback for me is the stand which isn't very sturdy. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.
0634049011|5.0|I just received this book today and already I find it amazing.<br /><br />Background: I've just been playing for a couple months where I know all the notes in the first position, including musical notation, and many of the first position chord shapes.  I am teaching myself with several books.  Because my goal is to be able to play the Guitar White Pages (which I also purchased from Amazon) and not by tabs, and because the fret board was so large and mysterious, I didn't know how I would ever be able to determine, by looking at musical notation, where on the fretboard I should play a particular note.  How will I ever know what all of these notes are?  How can I tell by looking at the music whether I should be at the 7th fret or etc.?  I was feeling overwhelmed just thinking about it.<br /><br />Then, while looking for a book of scales, I saw this book.<br /><br />This book: I have only just completed the second chapter and already I can see that this book simply unravels the mysteries of the fretboard.  By the end of chapter two, and this was completed in 15 minutes, I could choose any note on any string in any fret on my guitar and easily and correctly choose the same tone going up and down the fretboard.  I  have started on chapter three and see how the inclusion of it is going to allow me to name each of the notes very quickly.  (Just a note, while I completed this very quickly, I am going to play the exercise in my regular practice for the next while.  It was very easy but I want to reinforce the knowledge and not rush to \\"bigger and better things\\" without fully grasping and retaining the fundamentals.)<br /><br />I have browsed through the book and I can see that as this information becomes ingrained, there is much theory and practice left, to allow you to understand the keys, scales, relationships, etc. as I progress; but because my express purpose for buying this book was to create a comfort and demystification of the fretboard, I give this book 5 stars - thatgoal was accomplished in 15 minutes.  I am no longer anxious and, instead, have great confidence that I will understand everything I want to know about the fretboard.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the easy way in which this book teaches and I believe I am going to gain so much more than I even anticipated.<br /><br />A tip for people who are interested in learning musical notation: I decided to associate the exercises with notation and to accomplish this, whenever possible on an exercise, I draw a staff next to it and depict the notes on that staff myself.  In this way, I am continuing my association between what I learn in theory and positioning with the musical staff and reading music.<br /><br />From a beginner's perspective, this was an excellent purchase and I'm very pleased.
B0027MJU00|3.0|While this was a good read, it was kind of all over the place to me. It was dark with twists but there was a lot to keep up with.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I wish to be very careful in how I write this review.  This book is excellent. This book is horrific. This book is insanely well written.  You can get the gist of what the book is about from the preview of the book, however it is and it is not what the book is really about.  How well can you ever really know someone?  Can you ever really know someone? This me made me think really hard about dating.  We all put on a show so to speak, some more than others, but just how much?  This book takes you there, and leaves you writhing in that realization and the pain of it and doesn't let go.  It twists you and turns you and knots you up.  I talked about this book for a week after I was finished with it because it begs alot of questions.  Read this book.  You will not be sorry!
B007SGM084|5.0|Once you start reading, you will not want to put it down. While the whole \\"Inner Goddess\\" thing got on my nerves, I enjoyed every second of the books. The only downside is when you finish the 3rd book and come down from your Christian high upon realizing your next book is nowhere near as exciting.
B0055S348W|1.0|I saw mixed reviews for kindle fire &amp; thought I would give it a try. I paid the full price of 12.95 for this app &amp; have not been successful in getting it to print anything! I have an HP wireless printer. I cannot even get it to connect to a gmail email address or print out a contact card. from what I can tell total waste of money. I plan on calling amazon &amp; seeing if they can refund me back my money.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Episodes I and II comprise what one might call the nadir of the Star Wars saga.  Episode I illustrates the benefits of a greatly expanded budget and amazing progress in the area of special effects compared to  the first released Star Wars film (1977) later given the title of Episode  IV - \\"A New Hope\\" which single-handedly and unexpectedly redefined the science-fiction genre of film.  Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" was just as revolutionary if not more so in its time nine years earlier but did not create the frenzy of public response as Star Wars did largely due to its not being as much a work of entertainment as it was, and is, a genuine work of art that happens to be in the film medium.<br /><br />Episode I - \\"The Phantom Menace\\"  -  ends with an impressive battle sequence with labored comical overtones followed by a victory celebration in pretty much the same manner as Episode IV, but this film begins getting into trouble long before that.  Here we have the character Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi knight played by Liam Neeson and his young protégé Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor the latter of whom would be played in his later years in Episode IV by Alec Guinness, one of the relatively few character portrayals of the entire saga having any real depth.<br /><br />We meet the CGI generated character, Jar Jar Binks, who falls in with the two Jedi characters to everyone's, including the audience's, dismay.  Jar Jar the Bink, the so-called comic relief of the film, seems to be a curious amalgamation of Liberace and Shemp Howard who never seems to know quite when to shut up.<br /><br />Then we come across the arch villain of Episode IV, Darth Vader, as an eight year old boy played by Jake Lloyd who at this point in his life has the name Anakin Skywalker with the unfortunate nickname, \\"Anny.\\"  I suspect that this could well be a  significant factor leading to his problems later in life.  But his portrayal does not betray any characteristics whatsoever that would have led to the fiend that he is destined to become  -- not even a hint of darkness in his personality.  He is portrayed as a happy little boy who is loved by his mother who was, incidentally, presumably a virgin when she gave birth to him which seems to have a familiar ring to it.  But he shows no signs of ever having been seriously mistreated, even by his boss, an annoying flying insect-like creature who is interested only in money.  Young Anakin is not a loner at all and is popular among his childhood friends.  I think that a far better choice for this part would have been the young actor Daniel Logan, only two years older than Jake Lloyd, having a dark and more serious demeanor, whom  I am  convinced could have developed a more interesting and effecting character.  Logan played the small part of young Baba Fett in Episode 2.  I think with a little coaching he could have developed an Anakin worth watching -- something from which nearly all of the actors in this film would have greatly benefited.  The part of the character who turns out to be Queen Amidala is played by Natalie Portman who, in this film, whines and mumbles to a degree that is excruciating.  In all of these instances the casting director and film director are to blame for allowing these kinds of situations to develop in a high budget film having wide expectations from an enthusiastic public.  The visual highlights include the underwater city, the home of Jar Jar Binks and his people, who show no hints of having evolved from marine creatures.<br /><br />There is the pod race, which young Anakin wins along with his freedom  to join up with the two Jedi and Jar Jar, which should have tipped him off at the outset to remain at home.  But the two Jedi believe him to have the potential of becoming the greatest of all Jedi.  The pod race sequence is burdened with silly and loud sound effects and wears out its welcome quite some time before it actually ends and ultimately leads to the final battle scene described above which alternates with a light saber fight in which the character played by Liam Neeson is killed.<br /><br />The well produced visuals of the film cannot compensate for the unforgivably weak script which is only exacerbated by poor casting decisions and inept dramatic direction resulting in unconvincing  performances provided by much of the cast.  George Lucas seemed to be more interested in his toys with the unfortunate result of failing to tell a good story.
B00782O7IY|3.0|[Upfront Note: the hate email has started rolling in. My opinion of the film differed from yours, but that is OK. I would bet some significant money that there are a fair number of Amazon customers that would benefit from reading a few of the dissenting views. Don't be a hater. And, no, just to answer the most common query, I am not entirely an idiot - although we all have our moments.  ;-)  ]<br /><br />A French film about silent movies in Hollywood done in black and white ...<br /><br />I saw this on the airplane coming back from Europe.  The mostly French passengers were going wild during the film, laughing at nearly every nuance, a glance, a crumpled bit of paper, ... I felt like I had inadvertently walked into a Jerry Lewis movie marathon.<br /><br />If you enjoy artistic films, if you watched \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\" 37 times with the director's commentary on then this film is for you.<br /><br />If you've ever enjoyed a Bruce Willis film, if you liked Battlestar Galactica then it will be a chore to watch this film.<br /><br />The film academy doesn't always select film for an award based on popular appeal; in fact occasionally the choice is inscrutable, \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" anyone?<br /><br />Like opera, you're likely to love or hate this film with little middle ground.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of most opera.<br /><br />;-)
B0000AC8LZ|5.0|I ordered the Office Space for someone's gift who has never seen the movie. I have<br />watched the movie many times and I know the person I bought it for will really<br />like it. I liked the price and the quick delivery.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|To me this movie was just very bad in all aspects. The acting,story & effects were just horrible. This makes the first movie seem very good now to me. This is definetly one of the worst comic book movie that I have seen. It's right down there with the Captain America movie from the 90's. I would not buying this movie or even renting it,  just skip it all together. It's 2 hours of your life you won't get back.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love the update! use the dragon on all the levels you can in 2012. its really fun I was getting sick of the normal angry birds,  but Rio and seasenol angry birds is way better

B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and not boring at all I played this game 1 month straight. I wish they made more games like this one.
B006C45LHA|4.0|Cowboys and Aliens is a refreshing and new concept of the old Western. Very entertaining and yet still kept that old western feel to it.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|*NO SPOILERS*<br /><br />Ok, I was pretty reluctant to hop on the Fifty Shades bandwagon but having finished the series for the fourth time in 2 weeks I can safely say that it is worth the time to read!<br /><br />This book is the bet in the trilogy in my opinion.  It has plenty of drama, emotion and SEX- well what did you expect!?  While the writing may not be full of challenging story lines and high octane drama it gets the imagination going and is a nice break from reality.<br /><br />The book continues right where Fifty Shades of Grey left off, and barrels down the same path- taking the reader on a journey of erotic adventure.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the book- if you enjoyed the first you will definitely enjoy this sequel- do yourself a favor- make a coffee, find a quiet corner and sit down for a relaxing read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm not big on the fb. games like this because they get addicting and u spend all your time at the computer... this is still addicting, but I can cake it with me and work a little here and there. :)

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Yes, I agree - Twilight with some spanking, minus the glittery vampires, and considering that I'm going through yet another Twilight phase - seems to be an annual thing, this was appropriate.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|A wonderful book and a must read for anyone claiming to possess an open mind, be they atheist or theist. I am glad I found this, Richard Dawkins is superb about informing people of things that most would not or could not know about religion.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|The album is great. It was worth every penny. I say this because it seems that Chris put his heart into his music. I can tell this is his heart. I think it's rude that people are judging him by his actions and not his heart. He's human he makes mistakes and he happens to make great music. My favorite tracks are \\"Don't Judge Me\\", \\"Mirage\\", \\"2012\\" etc. etc. I love that he went back to R&B on this record.
B001IHJ97E|4.0|This is the movie I remember the most from the 80s because I found the main idea fascinating, so I grabbed a copy the day the Blu-ray came out, July 10th, 2012, and watch it. I'd originally watch it on T.V. and seeing it in my 170\\" home theater was a total delight. For starters, I didn't know the \\"real-world\\" scenes had a smaller ratio than the \\"dream\\" scenes (1:66 vs 2:40). Same goes with the sound, where real-world sound is not as impacting as the dream sound. Music is okay. It'll remind you of Avatar (or is it the other way around?).<br /><br />Acting is stiff, and the movie feels a tad dated, but you have to watch for what it is: a Science Fiction movie from the 80s. With that in mind, I enjoyed it immensely. I loved the dream sequences the most. Up to this date, they hold their value. Well, it's Douglas Trumbull, isn't it? They look amazing in a home theater. I doubt they'll look as good on a small T.V.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read at least 3 works of fiction each week, and this is the FIRST book review I have ever felt compelled to write.<br />That alone says more about WOOL than my review itself ever could.<br />I'm a huge fan of science fiction (the good kind. the kind that's more about the people than the science), and WOOL is now on my list of most highly-recommended books, right alongside the Philip K. Dick's and Kurt Vonnegut's.<br />The future depicted in WOOL, insane and intense as it is, bears frightening similarity to the present. I suppose the similarity lies in the sheer humanity of the story. Hugh Howey writes his characters with such empathy and depth that I find myself sympathizing with all of them. There are few distinctions between the good guys and the bad, and the motivations that drive each of them are perfectly reasonable. Like those \\"There but for the grace of god, goes I\\" situations. It is one of the most realistic pieces of dystopian fiction I have ever read.<br />The sheer pace of storytelling kept me up all night. Not to mention the incredibly unexpected twists that resolve plot points so NEATLY. If there's one thing I can't forgive in fiction, it's the deus ex machina and lazy storytelling... WOOL is the complete antithesis of that.<br />I finished the WOOL 1-5 OMNIBUS in one sitting, then went straight back for Wool 6: First Shift- Legacy. This is truly one of those un-put-downable books that I will be recommending to anyone I know who reads. Impressive in scope, depth, and emotion. I can't praise it enough.<br />By far my best purchase this year. My thanks to the thousands of reviewers who convinced me to take the leap. Get the Omnibus edition, then Legacy... at just under $10 for both, you will not be sorry.<br />Now I am going to check out what else Mr. Howey has to offer.
B00846REIS|4.0|if you liked Fifty Shades you will like this novel...left me wanting more. Its an addicting read you wont beable to put it down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of variety, some games are easier than others, and it's nice to play a game where IAPs are truly not required to progress in the game.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I would have you refer to the Book review. George Lucas is pure Genius. He took a Novel and turned it into a Classic.

B008CPZNL6|3.0|Flipboard is one of my favorite apps on iPad so I was very pleased to see it on Android, but it needs a landscape mode to work well on widescreen tablets (in my case a Xoom). That would make it a five star app.
B002L5CNRA|5.0|This is a movie you can watch 100 times and not get bored with. Anyone that has any connection with N.Y. and this Era can understand.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is my favorite app on my kindle fire. the picture is amazing and the story line and shop make this app even better. the best thing? ITS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Some reviews complain about the plot not being good but I loved this book!! It was very addicting to read and just had me engaged from the beginning to keep reading it all the way through the 3rd book!! I think the author wanted all of us women to become obsessed with Christian Grey, which I think has worked. After reading all three books I have tried reading other erotic books but none have compared to this trilogy. If you loved book one you HAVE to read the second and the third!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Lol didn't think it will be this fun. But it seems like I can't stop till I try as many combination.
B00729Z782|5.0|I just love it when I come across something previously unknown to me and it turns out to be a quality project like this (doesn't happen often enough).  Top shelf concept, vocals, drums, axe, keys, it's all here, a fine, classy prog effort.  Gonna have to buy the other DEx offerings (can the others be this good?).  This one goes near the top of the list of favs for 2012.  Buy this and support the talent on display here.  Well done, mates.

B007MU85D0|5.0|i tip my hat to the members of this band for making some pretty good music to listen to. if your into music like this then your off to a good start. the music is caring, calm and beautiful to listen to. nothing too crazy on this album that would make you cringe or leave a bad taste in your ears and with the simplicity of the album i guess people would find this to be dull but to be honest i think it just shows that less is more with this band. i hope to see them again with new music to come and IM TELLING YOU!!!!!! BUY THEIR ALBUM!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't know why people say it sucked but it's probably because you don't clean your screen .......<br />I always clean my screen and I have no problum .....<br />I love temple run because you can go so fast..<br />my high score is : 1894<br />so I think people just don't try

0515149489|2.0|I've read and enjoyed lots of Nora Roberts books overthe years but this one just didnt capture my interest. Good thing I just downloaded the free sample and not paid for the book. I could not get into it at all. Not as good as other Nora Roberts books.
1452101248|5.0|I've made a lot of the recipes in this book and not one of them disappointed me or my family.  The author's combination of flavors is amazing and I love that it has Asian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern influences all of which we love to eat on a daily basis.  His list of ingredients per recipe may seem intimidating or even overwhelming but really, once you've stocked up on a few of his most commonly used seasonings/condiments such as dark and light soy sauce, kechap manis, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil to name a few, you're all set to make his dishes in a cinch.  In fact, all of his recipes are so quick to make that I often rely on this book for a quick lunch or dinner.  I urge you to try all of his soba noodle dishes...these alone make this book worth purchasing!! Oh and last thing, I'm not a vegetarian at all but eating his dishes alone satisfies the carnivore in me as he thinks of every component in the dish...both protein and carbohydrates.
B008B1W3V4|4.0|I stood in line for a taping of a New Year's Eve performance in NYC. It rained and they only sang 1 song, but that's love. True, it's different from what we're used to from Maroon 5, but I find the music very catchy and upbeat --- perfect to be my new running music. By the way, although clean, \\"Payphone\\" is not rap-free. I agree with those who think the addition of the rap session is irrelevant and damaging to the overall song. I sat on the fence for a while before purchasing the album because of all the negative reviews, but I'm glad I decided to remain a big fan.
B005FMZWD8|3.0|I loved the look and styling of the watch and was very disappointed that it just stopped running.  I reset the time and it worked for a bit longer and then stopped again.  It might have just been a battery issue, but I did not try to replace the battery.  I wanted to exchange it for one that was working, but it was not one of the options.  I plan to buy another Invicta watch in the future and hope I have better luck.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Okay, got the first one in this series for free and thought it was just okay (3 stars) and then the 2nd one was cheap and the reviews were so plentiful, thought, why not, give this author another shot.  The 2nd one I really felt the heroine was TSTL and did not see, other than looks, why the genius, handsome billionaire would be attracted to someone so comparatively inexperienced and again so freaking stupid (uh, repeatedly tells her not to send personal emails which can be traced).  The emphasis in the 2nd book was constant bedroom action and it just got boring.<br /><br />The hype for this Fifty Shades series drove me to check out this 3rd book (although rather than buying, I borrowed this one) cuz I thought, maybe the story really picked up in the last installment and there has to be some basis for this fandom - yes?  The answer is no.  The 3rd is like the 2nd only more stupidity on the heroine's part (I am so disgusted that with all the servant help she has both inside the home and at work, she couldn't remember one shot!) I am not at all getting the popularity of this series.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book-literally could not put it down. I spent many nights awake reading when I should have been sleeping. Needless to say I had a few<br />looong and exhausting days at work. It was well worth it though.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have read nothing but negative comments about this book and or the series. So I decided not to read the books. However all of my friends of ALL ages loved these books and could not put them down. THey all read them in days, hours not weeks etc...so I decided to give the first one a try with a sample. The book I was reading I was so board with Ive been off work for a bit and havnt finished a single book....Im already into the first one and it does not deserve the negative comments it has received. Im so happy I listened to my friends and not all the comments and am reading the series. So far so GOOD!!!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I bought the \\"no ad\\" version of Angry Birds Rio. After I opened the App I explored the buttons on the front page. At the bottom of my Kindle Fire and in the middle right above the menu button there was a music icon. When I clicked on the icon thinking it had to do with the music on the game and sound it directed me to the Amazon page which said I could buy the music for Angry Birds Rio. The scary thing is it had logged me into my Amazon account. I deleted it from history, cache, data etc. I would play the game and when I went to my web page there it was again with me logged in. I removed the app and still it kept coming back with me logged in. Do not buy this App. So much for ad free.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|First off, I took a gamble and picked this up on Blu for a couple bucks cheaper than Amazon's current price. Picture & sound quality are superb. If you are a fan of this movie, you'll love the transfer.<br /><br />For an adult Sci-Fi movie fan, I thought this was far better than the likes of \\"Cowboys vs. Aliens,\\" (which wasn't bad) and \\"Real Steel,\\" (which was really bad).<br /><br />The movie is derivative (you will detect elements of \\"Stand by Me,\\" \\"E.T.,\\" \\"Gremlins,\\" etc.) but it does have a good, plausible storyline for a sci-fi film, with decent performances by the (mostly adolescent)cast.<br /><br />It isn't as gritty as \\"Cloverfield,\\" nor is it quite as heartwarming as \\"E.T.,\\" but like those films, it is good sci-fi entertainment, and well worth taking a chance on if you haven't seen it yet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought this app was cool but I rated 4 stars because have to earn points to unlock games! but good any way!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Face it, the only things we learned from Star Wars Episodes I-III are that aunt Beru was a real hottie back in the day, Jar Jar Binks should have stayed on the drawing board, and someone should have risked getting fired and stopped George from casting the role of young Anakin Skywalker.<br /><br />If you want REAL Star Wars, then you are talkin' episodes IV-VI.<br /><br />We're talkin' Alec Guinness/Mark Hamill/Carrie Fisher/Harrison Ford Star Wars, we're talkin' the Force before all of that midichlorian crap Star Wars.<br /><br />Even though George couldn't leave well enough alone and had to dink around with 'em (what I call the \\"Mark of Cutesy\\"; you know, alien poo-poo jokes, etc., additional sophomoric stuff to try and tow these classics down to the level of episodes I-III) the original trilogy looks and sounds stellar on Blu Ray.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the original three films and want to see them in most likely the best condition we'll ever see short of going to the theater, then this is it. The detail and texture of many scenes are a revelation. John William's music sounds awesome.<br /><br />Note that the price you pay for just the original trilogy alone is that you do not get any of the special bonus stuff included in the entire \\"Saga\\" set, but for me, it ain't worth triple the cost and three additional boat anchor films which I will never ever watch again, even sails to the wind, or if someone paid me a million billion dollars even.<br /><br />One star off for the aforementioned \\"Mark of Cutesy,\\" and I don't care if they re-re-re-release these films on Blu in their original form. I'm not putting any more money into George's pocket...
B0075HP2K4|5.0|In the midst of trying to expand my musical taste, I ran into Birdy when one of my Facebook friends posted \\"Skinny Love\\"...<br /><br />Before the day was over, I decided nose around her other vids to see if I'd want her album... hah, yeah... after \\"People Help The People\\" and \\"1901\\" I was a gonner!!!... Unfortunately, her album wasn't available in the States yet... and in those few weeks of anxiously waiting, I came upon \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" - HOLY COW what a song! It made me even more anxious! I really couldn't believe myself. I hadn't ever waited on an album before, as I had a movie or something lol xD<br /><br />Unlike some artists that become lost in my mp3 player, Birdy has stuck. HER WHOLE ALBUM. I rarely go a day without listening to her. \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" and \\"I'll Never Forget You\\" (or as I call it \\"86 Charlie\\") are two songs I didn't discover on YouTube, and are now a few of my more favored on the album... she also has a wicked cover of Taylor's \\"Fire And Rain\\" AND a cover of The National's \\"Terrible Love\\" which she has propelled into a whole new league of epicness - It makes you want to sing along \\"IT TAKES AN OCEAN NOT TO BREAK\\" at the top of yer lungs!<br /><br />Miss Jasmine isn't to be taken lightly - over 90 million YouTube views speaks for itself ... I've seen a few comments saying 'her music is boring' - 'not nearly as good as the original artist' - or all of the Bon Iver controversy on YouTube... but I think it's poppycock!!! Real music is becoming hard to find these days! Being a musician myself, I'm telling ya, this girl is legit! And aside from that, after watching several interviews and live performances of her, she seems to be an upstanding, well-grounded, lovely girl - someone people should look up to. I await her second album.<br /><br />- Cameronnearly as good as the original artist' - or all of the Bon Iver controversy on YouTube right now... but I think it's poppycock.

B000PMG16U|1.0|Ironically, George Lucas has become the Emperor that his movies rail against.<br /><br />With unlimited resources and absolute control, Star Wars prequel episodes I-III are successive duds when compared to the original trilogy.<br /><br />Episode I makes us suffer through Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker.  You really can't blame the actor - he was hand-picked by George.  There's a segment in one of the bonus features (on my Episode I DVD, not in this Blu ray 3 pack) that shows Lucas intently scrutinizing one of Lloyd's performances. What is going on in the man's mind is unfathomable, but the end result is dismal.<br /><br />Then we have Jar Jar Binks,  probably the most universally despised computer animated character that will ever  grace a big budget movie.  There is no doubt that George must have been aware of the avalanche of  negative feedback this character generated in Episode I,  yet  as if to thumb his nose at the fans, he sticks ole Lizard Boy in episodes II & III (albeit to diminishing degrees).<br /><br />The last straw for me,  Episode I -wise, was the inclusion of the concept of \\"midichlorians\\"  as a physical, measurable component of  The Force.  Here, Lucas  takes  one of the best  \\"less is more\\"  concepts in all of moviedom and unnecessarily pollutes it.<br /><br />Episodes II and III fare little better.<br /><br />George Lucas' best work was done  when he was under pressure and had  a limited budget to work with (American Graffiti and the original Star Wars).  The franchise  also proved very successful when he farmed out the  director duties (The Empire Strikes Back).<br /><br />Unfortunately what we have at this point is a spoiled kid, gleefully shoveling sprinkles onto his ice cream, and the resulting gaudy concoctions induce a belly ache.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it a lot. It's really really awesome. So much fun. I think I'm seriously addicted. But if I had to change one thing,  it would be that characters are a little pricy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I know it's gotten the rap of being \\"soft porn\\" but it is so much more than that. It really is about a relationship... granted, a fairytale one where things move super fast, and the man is super rich, handsome, and young.. but if we can read about vampires, faeries, and \\"muggles\\" than what's the harm in some unrealistic-tad-bit-twisted love story?  It's an easy read and the characters will stay with you.  Gotta love that!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once i started the series I didn't stop until I was done! Usually don't get wrapped up in fads but this was an amazing series! I laughed I cried and I want more!!!!!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I wasn't expecting too much as this is a Disney production. Much to my surprise this turned out to be a really good movie. I put this in my top ten of all time. Lynn Collins was perfect as the princess. Be sure to watch the Blu-ray DVD extras as a lot is shown about how the film was made and a lot of fun stuff too.

B004EPZ08O|4.0|This is definitely the best Final Destination since the second movie, without a doubt.  The concept of Final Destination is simple and quite a clever concept that can be done a million different ways.  Thankfully, we finally have a FD that doesn't suck on all levels.  The past few have had god-awful CGI, terrible dialogue, and were just flat-out stupid.  This isn't on the same tier as Final Destination 1, but it's way better than what I could have possibly expected.<br /><br />Storyline - the premise is the same as all FDs, but with a twist.  Kid foresees accident/catastrophe right before it happens, comes back to their senses and then tries to get everyone out of the situation.  Since they \\"cheated death,\\" death obviously comes back for them in the most gruesome and disgusting ways.  They always die in order of the vision the kid sees them die in.  The twist of this movie is that you can avoid your \\"comeuppance\\" by taking another person's life.  A little odd but it adds a new element.<br /><br />CGI - the CGI is really, really great.  Some of the deaths look a little bit goofy, but for the most part it's stellar.  The accident scene at the beginning has actually received much critical acclaim.  It's top-notch stuff.<br /><br />Dialogue/acting - the dialogue is a definite improvement over the last few FDs.  Nothing groundbreaking or terrific, but I didn't roll my eyes every time someone spoke a sentence.  The actors were decent, but I'm not sure if that was from improved dialogue or better actors.  Either way, both were better overall.<br /><br />Deaths - this is important since everyone watches FD for the deaths.  The deaths are super gruesome and crazy.  I also enjoyed how they made them totally unpredictable.  At first you're certain the victim is going to be electrocuted, then you think they're going to drown, and then all of the sudden a bear jumps out and eats them.  That's not an actual example, but that's about how unpredictable it is.  Very disgusting and unique.  And that's the point of the movie, right?<br /><br />Overall, great movie for what it is.  I hope FD continues to step it up and make better sequels in the future!nique.  And that's the point of the movie, right?<br /><br />Overall, great movie for what it is.

B0018KW3XS|5.0|This 2007 recording is really quite special in so far as it is an entirely Cuban production. Not only are all the dancers Cuban and Cuban trained, so is the (pre-recorded?) Havana orchestra. Most importantly though, the whole development of the present Cuban ballet expertise is the result of the dedicated work of the choreographer, Alicia Alonso. There are currently 80 dancers in the Cuban Ballet plus 250 students and a further 2000 in other provincial schools across Cuba.<br /><br />The Cuban choreography is described in the sleeve notes as a combination of Russian, American and Italian influences allied to the vitality of the Cubans. The notes go on to describe the outcome of this as producing `an expressiveness and a joy of dance without equal' and I am definitely inclined to agree based on this extraordinary production.<br /><br />The dancers dominate a colourful but minimalist staging set - probably a touring solution. The costumes, however, are of high quality and are extremely attractive, capturing exactly the mood of the piece. The music by Minkus is precisely as expected, with no alterations, but from there on the production differs from any other I have seen.<br /><br />The choreography is the creation of Alicia Alonso as mentioned above, and she has been able to create a spectacularly vibrant rendition of this rather slight story. The two key dancers representing Kitri (Viengsay) and Basilio (Ramel Frometa) dominate as they should with dancing of tremendous energy, skill and enthusiasm. The youthfulness and good humour of their roles comes over strongly. This is also supported by all the subsidiary roles plus the excellent Corps de Ballet. The most spectacular moment of many comes at the end as Basilio throws Kitri, who holds a joyous star-like shape, a full half metre above his wide stretched arms before catching her for a final set-piece hold. Fantastic and unforgettable!<br /><br />The camera work is supportive and excellently portrays the production although I suspect that the high definition recording may be a bit over-contrasty. I would expect this to be rectified on any Blu-ray should there be one in the future. There is good surround sound - clear but a little reverberant which is why I suspect a pre-recording. You would not know otherwise. These, to me, are minor quibbles when so much else is of such excellence.<br /><br />Whatever other version you have of this ballet, I would suggest that this is worth a try and likely to become an absolute favourite. For me then, a clear 5 stars.lthough I suspect that the high definition recording may be a bit over-contrasty. I would expect this to be rectified on any Blu-ray should there be one in the future.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles '1' recording release is a gem of an album.  Available on CD and vinyl, this release contains many of The Beatles #1 selling hits during their cumulative career, and is representative of some of their best work as musicians together.  Although this release is compilation disc on several derived recordings, this release has chosen many of the more recognizable and popular Beatles' music.<br /><br />The music ranges from early Beatles recordings (Love Me Do, I Wanna Hold Your Hand) to the 'A Hard Day's Night' era, to the more psychedelic era of Yellow Submarine.  Also noted are the strong influences of John Lennon during their latter years, with nods to George, Ringo and Paul.<br /><br />If any release were representative of The Beatles most notable efforts, this would be that release.  While there are many unmentioned songs that could have supplemented this recording, most any Beatles follower will appreciate the songs that were included in this album.<br /><br />This review gave the release 5 stars for the sheer magnitude of popular songs that could ever grace one single album.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Let's face it, if the guy wasn't gorgeous, rich and a stallion in bed you'd all be wishing this jerk would just immerse himself in therapy and stay away from women until he gets his head on straight.  Honestly by the end of the first few books I was no longer caring that he was abused because it was no excuse for how he treated his wife.  The third book took me a long time to get through but I was determined since I paid for it.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than the first 2 books, I was wrong...  His reaction to her pregnancy was shameful beyond belief and her pitiful constant excuses for his behavior truly made me sick.  I don't care how good looking, rich or well endowed this man is.  I don't care if he can make women orgasm just be looking at them.  The fact is, his behavior is abusive and wrong.  Women swooning over an abusive man is just beyond my comprehension.  These books were a HUGE waste of money.  I wish I could get a refund from the author.  The money she's making on this pathetic excuse for literature is shameful.

B000002L7Y|5.0|What strikes me even now as I listen to this album again and again?  The emotional tones and emphases in all the right places by singer Morten Harket.  This man's voice is a thing of rich beauty, full of depth and expression and mystery and longing.  I remember hearing that these blokes from Norway didn't speak any real English at the time they made this album and that defies my comprehension.  Listen to songs like \\"Hunting High and Low\\", \\"Living A Boy's Adventure Tale\\", and \\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\\" and tell me how someone who doesn't know where to put an emotional emphasis on English words not only gets it right but does so beautifully?  The music, somewhat dated, is still a brilliant mix of elegant pop fluff and swirling heavenly harmonies (as on \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\\") and romantic dash (\\"Train of Thought\\") with a bit of haunted misgiving or uncertainty thrown in for good measure (check out \\"Living A Boy's Adventure Tale\\" and \\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\\").  These songs beg you to sing along with them and I'm all the poorer for it when my voice cracks as I try to live near to the alto-esque \\"Love Is Reason\\" or the mega-hit \\"Take On Me\\"--\\"Take on me/ Take me on/ I'll be gone/ In a DAY OR TWO!!!!\\"  Trust me, you don't want to be around when I sing along with the end of that lyric!<br /><br />Honorable mention needs to go to this albums trio of producers as they undoubtedly guided A-ha in their debut and helped the artists make the album into what it is: Tony Mansfield, Alan Tarney, and John Ratcliff, our hats off to you gents!  Thanks to all involved for such a fantastic debut album!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was recommended this book by a coworker and was not disappointed in the least. As a young adult (21), I really liked the tone of the book. I often find myself bouncing back between teen and adult books, trying to find something that I can relate to, while still looking for something mature enough that I don't roll my eyes through the entire thing. This was the perfect happy median for me. I really enjoy reading books with young characters but also like a little bit of grittiness and maturity.<br /><br />The story line is pretty good. No crazy twists and turns, but plenty to keep you engaged throughout the story. I finished the book in under 3 days. You'll find yourself rooting for Abby and Travis and their crazy relationship all the way through to the end.<br /><br />However, if you're someone who can't stand couples who are constantly breaking up and getting back together, this may not be the book for you. At times, you may find yourself wishing you could just slap Abby around a little bit. For those cynics out there, you'll probably be annoyed throughout most of the book. I however found the book to be a beautiful representation of how hard it can be to be young and in love. I'll be eagerly awaiting McGuire's next book, titled Walking Disaster which will be a rewrite of Beautiful Disaster in Travis' POV.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend the book to any females between ages 17-30.
B004B8DH98|2.0|I just wasted two hours of my life. I thought \\"How bad can it be? It has George\\". Flawed thinking. Don't do it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy.  I read the entire series in one weekend.  Oh, Mr. Grey, the things you do.  :-)  I liked the fact that it actually had a plot!  With all the chatter I had heard about the books, I thought it was going to be sex, sex, sex (which is okay ;-)  ) but these books held so much more.  I laughed, I cried..GREAT READ!!!
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|this game sucks its face of u cant even honk like real cars NEVER GET PEOPLE IT SSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKKS!! I hats it

I love this app..I'm deciding on whether I should or shouldn't get this app...I'm kind of disappointed in the game because it doesn't save what you had...I had about 3 houses made and next time I get on in the day it brings me to a different place...other than that I love it! so I think that I will definitely give this app a 5 star rating! and I'm definitely buying this from the app store! and since everybody keeps giving it 5 stars i GIVE THIS APP OR GAME 5 STARS! IT ROCKS!&hearts;&bull;&bull;<br />  ----
B00005OMTT|4.0|Enigma's appeal extends well beyond their core audience - you don't have to be heavily caught up in this genre to enjoy the entire album from A to Z.  Pretty much, if you liked \\"Sadeness\\" or \\"Return to Innocence\\", the two tracks that got radio airplay, this album is for you!  It has a soft-rock quality to it without that sad-sack sympathy (think: Alan Parsons Project), and that's hard to find.  Fact is, it's hard to tell this is a compilation and not an original album, the continuity is so even.
B000VK6MNI|5.0|Aaron Eckhart (Two Face) plays the ultimate spin doctor as a tobacco lobbyist. The movie is extremely funny and educational. It teaches people, and Aaron's son, not to accept the status quo in thinking, that there are alternative realities depending on how one wants to use spin it. A truly libertarian film to the point of absurdity. Great comedy no matter where your politics fall.<br /><br />Parental Guide: simulated sex, frequent F-bombs, no nudity.
0345529057|5.0|This bundle is great. After watching the first season on HBO, I realized that the books the show was based on had the potential to be even more interesting. And they were, by far! This is the greatest fantasy series I think I have ever read.<br /><br />To those complaining about binding and missing pages, I'm surprised. My copies didn't have any defects; the books were sturdy and all the content was there. I assume in keeping the price low, some shipments may have defects, but that is what amazon's great return policy is for! It is super easy to get a replacement from amazon on defective products.<br /><br />So if you haven't read the series yet, buy this!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A friend thought this would be a fun romp for three gals to read and then discuss. Honestly, it's amazing the power of hype to turn the dumbest crap into a pop-culture phenom. The book itself is a beach read at best; an annoying pain in the ass at worst. The main character was disturbing in his power to seduce a bright young virgin and turn her into a bumbling sex addict. None of the characters is very likable or believable. Again, it's a \\"fantasy\\" romp, and if you can swallow that and can get past the juvenile writing and the lame, redundant sex descriptions, it's like a BRAVO TV show; not exactly good, but campy enough to enjoy when you're tired and looking for something that isn't too cerebral. A tip: Skip the sections where the author goes into \\"The Contract\\" for the 10th time! Oy! Where's the editor when you need one? Hats off to the author's PR team, though! They're wizards for turning this pulp into a national obsession.
034580404X|5.0|This was one of the best series that I have ever read.  I am so in love with Christian.  He is a very complex but lovable character.  I read part of this series at the beach during vacation.  It was a perfect vacation read.  My husband was up in the room where I could reach him easily.  I attacked him several times while reading this which is totally out of character for me.  I finished reading this last night and I feel like I lost a friend.  Please write another series E.L. James.

0385534639|5.0|An epic tale, spanning years and locations. A story so grand, vivid and wonderful, words fail. Pages and pages of unforgettable people, places and things, so rich in detail, that you feel like you have become a part of it. Perhaps my favorite thing about The Night Circus is the magic it bestowed upon me. One evening I will look outside my window, and even though I know better, a part of me will always hope to see those tents a short distance away. To feel the completeness that circus gave to those characters, a place to belong. I know without a doubt that years and years from now people will look back at The Night Circus and it will be remembered as one of the classics for all times.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|Easily one of the best. So easy to use, easy to control and decent little edits. I love using this app to brighten up my pictures and really emphasize the colors of my photos.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|I've had 3 replacements and never had one last more than a few weeks with out getting dinged up in the middle of the screen somewhere and then it's all I can look at.  4 bucks a pop for replacements.  Try anything else but Zagg.  Over priced junk. Deserves less than 1 star.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|It is rare these days for a movie to both entertain and make one think. Not only were the visuals stunning, the plot was interesting even if it was just another take on the ancient astronaut theory and the special effects were remarkable. I was expecting another crappy, mindless alien movie with nothing but a bunch of predictable mindless beasts lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce. I think a lot of nerdy fanboys got butthurt because it didn't turn out to be just that. Aliens have been done to death, brought back as a zombie and then done to death again and then some. I find it humorous that fanboys think the Alien films were wonderful and without plot holes and inconsistencies. The same basement dwelling virgins that have posters of Bladerunner on their walls forget that that film was also ripped to shreds by their ilk when it first came out. It wasn't until the director's cut came out and a few years had passed that it became a respected sci-fi classic. Fanboys are a lazy lot, want only mindless, nonstop action and just don't want to think. They want everything spoon-fed to them on a silver platter with nothing left to the imagination. Nerd fanboys are ruining chances of more great sci-fi movies being made because producers know fanboy losers will hang out in their darkened rooms and pick the movie to shreds frame by frame so they can go online and tear it a part in a vain attempt to sound smart when it just makes them look pathetic. And when the day comes that the only movies being made are stupid rom-coms and cheesy disney flicks the butt-hurt nerds will complain to no end but they'll have no one to blame but themselves that producers won't want to make anymore sci-fi flicks. I really hope they make a sequel because the engineer universe can be expanded upon whereas the alien universe is dead. So if you're a pretentious fanboy, don't watch this film, watch the alien movies that have already been made because they're all the same and there is nothing new to add to the alien universe because aliens are just mindless beasts fought by undeveloped characters with big guns that nobody cares about.
B008IBPECW|5.0|We watched seasons 1 and 2 using Amazon Prlme.  We have never seen a better written or produced show.  Magnificent characters.  Superb cast.  Historically brilliant.  The best.  But to get a full understanding of the show, you must start on season 1, episode 1.
1401322425|5.0|I've made a few recipes from this book and they all turned amazing!<br />What i like most is that it gives you ideas and you dont actually need to use all the ingredients he says, so no matter where in the world you are, you can have a great meal!<br /><br />The home smoked salmon is fantastic!<br />Great ideas to use all of your vegetables!<br />I tend to grow some at home, so i use his advices there too! He explains what you need to do etc.<br /><br />Cook per season, what to use .... the whole book is related to your home veggies garden, or seasonal veggies. I love it!<br /><br />Pictures are atunning as usual!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I find this simple but repetitive tunes to be wonderful and catchy.  I'm hooked!  I was originally exposed to Moby randomly.
B001EJY8RW|3.0|beautiful cinematography, well acted and it is always a pleasure to watch Ferrer, Stowe, Costner, Quinn, etc...but what a lame script! Hard to believe the wife of a mexican kingpin who is guarded by his own private army, would not know that he would spy on her, tap into her phone etc. Could the lovers be more naive? After falling in love, they should have hightailed it to the u.s and gone into hiding. But I cried a little at the end anyway.
1466401885|5.0|Easily my favorite book right now! Absolutely fell in love with the male lead, Travis Maddox. He's that tattooed broken bad boy that you automatically wanna fix.  It's a very dysfunctional relationship between him and the female lead, Abby Abernathy, but it felt real and raw!  Read it twice, back to back, never done that with a book. Then after a couple of weeks read it again, then recommended it and lent it out to my friends. Itching to get it back, so I can read it again!
B003ELY7PG|5.0|This book is brutally concise and honest. It gives easy to follow advice in sharply crafted sections. A must read if you have any creative inclinations and want to get better or plan to get started on a creative pursuit and want some direction and encouragement,
0751532711|1.0|If you want to read about lies, bogus claims and<br />wrong advise...then buy the book.<br /><br />Stay away from this crook...
0060558121|2.0|Im not sure why this book received high ratings. It was meandering and disjointed. The characters were under developed and their motivations were vague - vague even for folks  who enjoy classic literature and ancient human beliefs.
0743454537|1.0|I suffered through this book because I liked the character of Anna. The author spends far too much time evaluating the personal lives and back-stories of marginal characters. It was the ending of the book, however, that destroyed the novel. It was surreal. It was cliche. It was a cheap shot. The author claims there was no other way to realistically end this novel. Really? What are the chances in real life of such a false turn of events. Shaking my head and wishing I hadn't wasted my time on this book.  Sorry, Anna. The author went for melodrama instead of giving you the choices you fought for.
B002WJI65S|5.0|My 9 yr old son collects Mario series plush and was very happy with goomba. These are small - slightly bigger then the palm of my hand.
0345803485|2.0|This book is based on unimaginative repetition: the words, the images, and the orgasms all repeat uncreatively.  The main characters murmur and mumble about 5 times a page.  The book reads as if the author studied for the GRE with the vocabulary list limited to sardonic, recalcitrant and mercurial.  In addition, the characters are limited to a handful of facial expressions also overly used: biting lips, blushing, cocking their heads, twisting lips, pursing lips, rolling eyes etc. And each orgasm causes the main character to explode into a million pieces, instantly and repeatedly.<br /><br />That said, the book is suitable for the beach and light (very light) summer reading. It would remain forgettable if it weren't for the repetion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I read this book just after reading Truman Copote's In Cold Blood.  All that did is magnify the poor writing of Fifty Shades.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|That game is as good as the other Doctor Panda. I recommend it to all other parents. Kids really like it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I would recommend this book. I finished it in one day. I laughed, cried, and felt as though I was with Mia. The sequel is not as good but still a good read
B000V5Y2E4|1.0|I found the relationship between Major Kira and the old man to be unbelievable.  It's fitting that the only other woman on the farm was mute. And the conversation between Major Kira and Lieutenant Dax in the beginning shows that no one on the written staff knows how to write for women.
0345525558|5.0|Diffenbaugh took a very emotionally charged subject that is rife with dark and disturbing issues, and created a book that was completely exciting to read. Instead of using these issues as a platform to preach to readers, or bring us down into the depths of depression over the magnitude of the problems inherent in the foster care system, she used them as a platform to tell the story of a fascinating girl who gradually learns about herself from the situation she has been born into. I truly enjoyed this read, and finished it within three days.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Having come from a frugal family, a lot of what the book is about seemed common knowledge to me... However, it was neat to see the stats, comments, and examples that were expressed throughout the book.  I have often heard the comment that if you work in the bank you will notice that many who look like they have money and aren't afraid to spend it... don't have it or simply spend all they do have.  Those who look like average everyday people are typically the ones with money in the bank.  I know this not to be true in all situations, but it says a lot about our culture and the influences around us.<br /><br />Even though the book is dated, there is a lot of worthwhile information in it that even those who are frugal can gain insight from.<br /><br />I have read several other books about financial worth, gain, business, etc and this was the most fun and interesting read, and the most possible to focus towards.<br /><br />I enjoyed all of the examples of millionaires... how they lived, what they were offered to come in for their time for questions for the book, what they did for a living, etc, etc.  It also put into perspective how our parents shape us in our spending, our careers, etc.<br /><br />Personally, I feel it's important to save what you can and invest wisely, but I also feel it's important not to live so frugally that you miss out on some of the fun adventures in life.  I think there is a happy balance between saving for the future, and living for today.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire does not disappoint! I was unsure where the story would be able to go with the Games finished and Katniss back in safe territory, but I was happy to discover that the plot moved briskly along with the same sense of urgency that was present in the first book. The Capitol City's grip on Katniss and Peeta is stronger than its ever been before. They've become celebrities, and President Snow, leader of Panem, seeks to control their actions (thereby controlling the public perception of them) by threatening their friends and family if they don't comply.<br /><br />Ever since the Games ended, Katniss has been feeling strain on her relationships with Peeta and Gale. Things with Gale haven't been the same since her return from the Games, and Peeta has been distant since he discovered her romantic actions in the arena were simply strategical. Katniss cares for them both but is confused about her feelings, feeling pulled between both guys. One thing she knows for sure, is that she doesn't want a relationship that will lead to marriage and ultimately bringing kids into the twisted society of her world. I really felt for Katniss in her situation, both guys are so nice, and the history she has with each is undeniable. Like Katniss, I simply couldn't choose a side; I ended up wavered back and forth about the guys right along with Katniss! I eventually did choose the guy that I think she should ultimately end up with, however with the uncertainty of the future in their world, I wonder if they will actually survive to see a somewhat happy (is that even possible in their world!?) ending.<br /><br />At about the half-way point I came across the biggest twist I-never-saw-coming (I'm talking HUGE!), leaving me speechless and completely unsure of what to expect. There's not much more I can say while keeping things spoiler-free, but let's just say there seems no end to what these characters have to endure. Yes, the twist was amazing and completely unexpected, but I really felt sorry for all the people it effected.<br /><br />The characters and their bonds are a huge part of this series, they just pull you in, feeling like you've known them for years. Katniss almost always has some kind of a threat hanging over her head, whether on herself or those she loves, but somehow she always manages to persevere. And Peeta, oh Peeta, I feel so sorry for him at times. He has such a sweet and gentle side, and his devotion to Katniss is unwavering, even when she doesn't return his affection. Their future is so often unsure, I just hated the thought of either one being harmed. The constant threat on their lives, and even their district, brings such a sense of urgency to the story that it's really hard to break away from reading.<br /><br />At this point I'm two-third's of the way finished with the series, and things are just as fresh as ever. Yes, the plot is undeniably disturbing, and the actions of the Capitol and those in charge are despicable, but the light in the darkness is Katniss and her friends. They're forced to do some horrible things, but they don't lose sight of the fact that it's wrong. They long for a change in their country's structure, impossible though it may seem. At this point change is certainly in the air, but how much change can actually occur in such a warped society remains to be seen.t sorry for all the people it effected.<br /><br />The characters and their bonds are a huge part of this series, they just pull you in, feeling like you've known them for years.

1463514581|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! So much so that I finished it in one sit. The story grabbed my attention from the very beginning and never once let up.<br /><br />This book has everything from mystery, adventure, romance, and humour, and a very gassy dog. You can't help but love Rose; a young, naive, quirky woman who is finally beginning to live life at the age of 24. And Joe (sigh), her sexy, adorable and very caring new neighbour who is definitely not who he seems. Throughout the entire novel I just kept rooting for them both.<br /><br />Denise Swank has most definitely delivered a well-written novel with so many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. It's a novel that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. Don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling by the time you finish it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to all Chick-Lit lovers and those who've never read one, and for $2.99 (Kindle), it's a steal. I so look forward to the next book in the series because (whoo-hoo) there is one. Happy reading!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was awful! The author needs to learn how to use a thesaurus. The book is basically porn and it's not even well written.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This movie was fun and entertaining. It remained true to Austen's story, and purpose. Northanger Abbey was meant to be a spoof on gothic literature, and the movie kept to those elements by using genre characteristics. The actors did a fabulous job. Overall it was a charming movie.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A well done documentary. My wife and I saw it first on NetFlix and decided to add itr to our personal collection.
B00589AYWW|4.0|One of the pillars of the age of the Enlightenment, from which the American and the French revolution arise, was the central role given to reason.  Unfortunately (or not) humans are not creatures of pure reasons, and this book explores how even modern societies can self-deceive themselves in taking course of actions completely contrary to their own basic interests (the case of the Vietnam war being one of the most striking example, but definitely not the only one).<br /><br />In this work the author investigates how bad initial assessments can self-reinforce  themselves once a course of action has been decided, despite proofs and evidences that the original decision was flawed.<br /><br />It is an original and interesting essay on how human beings are prone to self-deception, and on the moral courage and vision that it takes to recognize and correct one's mistake, qualities these, many years after the book was written, still in a short supply, in my opinion.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|This book, while it has gathered huge praise, is, in my opinion, not deserving of this praise. The story is relatively straightforward, and while there are some twists, they don't really surprise anyone who has read a few detective novels. While Lisbeth and Mikael are well developed as characters, the rest of the characters are one dimensional and shallow. While Lisbeth is introduced to us as socially awkward and isolated, this changes as the book progresses and is dropped by the author as and when he seems to think its not needed, notably when Lisbeth travels to Switzerland.<br />Mikael, as the main detective character, is more rounded and believable. He is a man who needs to clear his name and this investigation is his chance to do just that. The other characters who inhabit the island seem to fall into a series of cliches, the old man who wants to settle everything before he dies, the woman who wants to forget the past, and the strange man living alone with a terrifying secret life. As the various secrets of the inhabitants are revealed the book seems to centre less on them and too much on the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth,a relationship which I found strange and uncomfortable.<br />In conclusion this book is not as good a book as I had hoped it would based on its reputation.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It is a very easy read, a little bit predictable, but yet intresting enough to continue.  It is a really good book and I enjoyed it very much!
0345803485|2.0|Since this series of books has been getting lots of press, since the book store I was in at the time didn't have the bios that I was looking for (whoops, an unintentional plug for Amazon), and since I had some time to kill, I perused a copy of this novel to find out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />After reading for maybe 1/2 hour (and a long 30 minutes it was), I found myself wondering how much money the book reviewers of various newspapers and websites were paid for praising this piece of mediocrity, which isn't even on the same level as your typical Harlequin romance.<br /><br />The next thought was that the book's publishers and the above (paid off) reviewers (I won't blame the writer here becuz I doubt if she believes that she's as talented as Jane Austen or Emily Bronte) must be of the opinion that most female readers are as insipid and desparate for romance as tv advertisers seem to think: we get a male protag who's mega-wealthy though not yet 30, who loves showering his money on his paramour, who's an expert at all the things romance-craved women SUPPOSEDLY admire/love, who's hung like a great dane, etc, etc, etc and a female protag who orgasms with an ease that wd have shocked Masters and Johnson (and, perhaps, even Shere Hite and Nancy Friday).<br /><br />As an avid reader, I have to say that I am impressed by the superb marketing campaign behind this book, but as a man, I must say that I find the success of this series disconcerting.  If one were reading it to simply stay abreast of current trends or to have something ironic to read on the beach, train, subway, bus, etc it wd be one thing, but to read it for any other reason, seems to me, a waste of one's valuable time (indeed, as the sex scenes are so unrealistic, if not ridiculous, the book is pretty much useless even as \\"erotica\\", in the most obvious sense of that word).  Suffice it to say, the choice to read it or not is yours.

They sound great no matter what kind of music I'm playing (it goes from metal to classical depending on what I'm doing), they STAY in my ears with no movement (I'm just *not* an earbud kinda girl) no matter how active I am, they last forever, they are super comfortable, they go on and off very easily (I can easily just yank them off by the cord when someone is speaking to me without worrying about one of the earbuds turning into some sort of catapult flying through the air), and flip them back on when I want to.<br /><br />I guess I'm old-school, but give me these headphones any day over any earbud, giant-ear-covering-stereo-jobbies, or high tech whatever comes next.<br /><br />And my six year old daughter? She's a convert, too. My husband has bought her multiple types of headphones (earbuds, just for kids high fidelity ones, novely ones, etc.) and she always winds up making off with these, so I'm getting another set just for her.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've been reading erotica for years, and all of the authors that I read have tremendous talent.  After finally succumbing to the hype, I decided to purchase this book...and it was the worst decision I ever made.  This book is the most horrible piece of drivel that I've ever read!  I can't believe that there are women out there who actually think that this book was so great that it helped shoot it to the Best Sellers list.  What have you been reading?  Comic books?  Let me take that back...there are comic books with more of a plot, better dialogue, and more engaging characters than this crap.<br /><br />I made it to page 115 and then I just couldn't take it anymore...I had to stop reading.  I felt my IQ plummeting the longer I read.  How can a 21 year old woman in this day and age be so naïve that she's at the point of stupidity?  No computer?  No email?  Never having touched herself, \\"down there?\\"  Tripping over her own feet?  Someone shoot me!  Even Amish teenagers have more worldly experience than this chick.<br /><br />And trying to cast Christian Grey as a Dominant?  Laughable!  He is soooo not an Alpha Male.  You want Alpha Male?  Read Gena Showalter, Lara Adrian, Elisabeth Naughton, Nalini Singh...they'll show you what an Alpha Male is!!  This guy is 27 years old, is a billionaire with no explanation as to how he got his money, but he's never at work, and of course he's worldly and sophisticated...give me a break!<br /><br />It angers me that there are so many wonderfully talented writers out there, sweating away at their craft but getting no recognition, only to have nonsense like this trilogy go Best Seller AND get a movie deal!!  It's a travesty!  If this is what Publishers are looking for, then we're in a lot of trouble!
B00846REIS|4.0|I had been looking for something to fill the void since finishing 50 Shades and this fit the bill. Relationship was a bit rushed but steamy sex scenes are worth it.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is much a great show, and it was very easy to buy on Amazon and play on my computer.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is amazing but on the kindle it sucks because it doesn't collect coins good but on other devices you picked the right game if you picked temple run &lt;3 this game if we could get married y'all are invited :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles and I logenthis game. there are MANY free puzzles to out together as well as different difficulty levels. I'm very impressed!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I am a bit of a Disney fanatic I must say and was a little skeptical about this because I was afraid they would take the storyline way off key to the ordinary classic. They did some different twists from the orginial but it went with the storyline. Charlize Theron, all I can say is WOW she was the perfect actress for that role because she can be bold and was just incredible. Ive read the other reviews about Kristen Stewart being really bad but in my opinion she did a great job in this role as Snow White. Everyone is always talking about her role in Twilight and how awful she plays in those in which I disagree. If she was so untalented then why do people go and watch them and love those movies? Who would be a better choice? Going back to the Snow White movie, if you havent seen it get to the theaters you wont regret going everyone (actors and actresses) clash very well together!
B004LX0DHC|5.0|This book is a great read , and easy to pick up the concepts. It doesn't answer questions, but helps you understand what the right questions are to make about a piece of work, and the decisions you make as part of that. If you feel a bit lost, this is a great read to refocus on what is important, and what is not.
0345803485|3.0|I honestly read this book because of all the crazy hype of it. It was all over my social networks, in magazines, on the Internet, etc, so I decided to give it a try. Keep in mind, I am a 20 year old college student. This book is a typical cheesy love story... It is predictable and frankly, quite annoying.<br /><br />The unrealistic aspects of the story got to me, mainly her saying holy crap on every page. I just don't buy it.... A girl who becomes a raging sex freak and likes bondage says holy cow and holy crap....no, she would say holy shit.<br /><br />I do see why this book gets a lot of attention though, it's a fantasy and gets young adults in a sexual mood. However, if you're looking for a great read with intriguing language and content, don't waste your time with this book.<br /><br />I am in no rush to jump into the second book but might keep it laying around for times of boredom.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely ADORE this book. Everything about it is so harsh, so greuling, and so gratifying. Definitely a distopia, the book is the most compelling thing I have read in YEARS! My heart actually hurt when I put down MOCKINGJAY, the third book in the trilogy. Anybody who has not read this book had better start, because once you're in, you'll be amazed at EVERYTHING in the book and wish you'd read it sooner! Suzanne Collins inspires me so much, as do Katniss and every other good character in the story :) I am an aspiring author, and my book is: [[ASIN:1478173769 Forever Amber]] Please check the H.G. and my story out :) Thanks for reading... BUY THE HUNGER GAMES!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|... and definitely over-hyped.  Like some earlier reviewers, I was counting down pages in hopes of a payoff at the end.  Alas, it never came for me.  The characters were not particularly interesting to me, though I did appreciate the writer's use of language throughout the story.  I will continue to explore unusual genres in my reading, but, as this book reinforced to me, it will be somewhat of a risk.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is a poor rip off of 50 Shades. Very disappointing read! Save your money by not buying this book!
0345803485|1.0|Wow, what can i say? Not sure how all this hype got started but this is far and away the worst book i have ever read. Believe me I am no shrinking violet and enjoy a great sex scene as much as the next women but there is not one part of this book that I enjoyed outside of the first 5 pages. I can't decide who I hate more...the women who actually allows this guy to hit her and basically beat her up or the man that does the hitting. What is sexy about mental and physical abuse? I like my men strong, tough,sexy and man enough to keep his anger issues and aggression out of the bedroom. Seriously, what is wrong with that guy? Ick! Serious \\"dislike\\". He needs a good punch to the throat by a emotionally strong women and not in a kinky way....
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ive ever played. its awesome! I especially like the mega coin upgrade. thanks temple run!

B003MOHX8S|4.0|If you like the instrumentation and powerful motifs of movie soundtracks, then don't forget to add movie trailer music to your collection.  When a movie composer writes music for a scene there is a certain amount of \\"filler\\" music that is inevitable for talk sequences or general ambiance.  These filler sequences don't usually have much emotion or melody and unfortunately take away from time you could be listening to your favorite moments.  That's why movie trailer music is so perfect.  As soon as each track starts, it's instant motif - and they're catchy and emotive.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 star is because many of the tracks sound derivative of more famous works and composers.  For instance, one of the tracks starts note for note the same as Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight theme.  Now I realize that Hans can't claim unique authorship of what amounts to a minor 3rd chord progression, but the instrumentation is almost identical too.  Thankfully they carry it on into a fuller melody.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying more of these albums in the future.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love cut the rope. You get to make plans on how to get the candy to Om Nom. I would recommend  this app to everyone.
B006RUJST6|5.0|yes I resisted this series because of the slam theme but let me tell you even tho I am not a fan of that type of thing I loved this book! I have never smirked so much reading a book or cried!
B007V508CC|5.0|Don't pay attention to all the haters.<br />There are some annoying things (some cutesy lines and a few that are repeated too often), but this is a great CD.<br /><br />I bought the CD for \\"Payphone.\\"<br />I'm okay with it, but I'm surprised that it's a little edgy. It features some swearing.<br /><br />\\"One More Night\\" is fun. It starts the CD off on a strong note.<br />\\"Daylight\\" is a strong song.<br />\\"Lucky Strike\\" is another cool song. It's fast and truly a blast.<br />\\"The Man Who Never Lied\\" is memorable.<br />\\"Love Somebody\\" is pretty good.<br />\\"Ladykiller\\" is short (2:44), but very good.<br />\\"Tickets\\" and \\"Fortune Teller\\" are good, but a bit repetitious.<br />\\"Sad\\" stands out emotionally. The lyrics are great.<br />\\"Doin' Dirt\\" is very uptempo. It's basically a dance song.<br />\\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" isn't the best song on the CD, but it closes the regular version of it well.<br /><br />Bonus Songs:<br />\\"Wipe Your Eyes\\": The first few seconds make me go, WTF? It sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks are singing in Hindi (it's quite comical).<br />A very strong song after the first 15 seconds.<br />\\"Wasted Years\\": The third song that features a bit of swearing (the second is \\"Tickets\\").<br />The lyrics and vocals are very cool (the best way to describe the song is that it's smooth). A definite highlight.<br />\\"Kiss\\": Wonderful filler.<br />The cover is long (7:01), but really worth listening to.<br />The sound quality could be better. The song sounds like it was recorded in a bar. Still, it's a lot of fun, and the song turns into a jam at the halfway mark (the musicians rock out a little, and the music is great).<br /><br />The vocals and lyrics are pretty seamless.<br />Maroon 5 is clearly at their peak (I have all of their CD's).<br /><br />The title of the CD is appropriate.<br />The group has been overexposed (I don't like Adam Levine on \\"The Voice,\\" and I don't need to know about all the women he dates). As a result, I was hesitant to buy the CD. I'm glad that I did, though, and you'll probably be glad if you buy it too.that I did, though, and you'll probably be glad if you buy it too.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I watched this movie because someone recommended it to me but I had heard about the really bad publicity so wasn't expecting much.  WOW I loved it!  Maybe the critics were watching something else and got confused - really its well worth a look.  Loved the story even if its been done before and loved the CGI.  Just watch it and make up your own mind - some of these detractors maybe a little (sorry I mean a lot!!!) jaded.  They after all canned the Star Trek movie with Chris Pine and I believe that was inspired as well.
1469984202|5.0|I bought this 100% based on the amazon reviews alone.  As soon as I finished the first book I sent a message to my good friends who I knew would love it that they NEED to pick this up.  They all did, and they all loved it.  All 5 in this series are great and I'm reading the first prequel now.  Thanks and keep em coming!
B006IDG2T6|3.0|I have a lot of respect for Sam Harris, and his writing is as good as ever. My problem with the book, as was mentioned by another reviewer, is his fallacious, determinist argument against retribution.<br /><br />As a neuroscientist, he should have known better.<br /><br />There are simply too many people with all the psychological and neurological characteristics which might excuse acts of murder, according to Mr. Harris, who nevertheless refrain from committing such acts.<br /><br />With only 0.005 percent of the population being murdered each year, it is reasonable to assume that most of the abused-in-childhood, brain-tumored, economically-disadvantaged folks among us don't commit murder, for whatever reason.<br /><br />Sadistic torture-murderers are just \\"unlucky,\\" Mr. Harris? REALLY?
B007VTVG4C|2.0|Album is of heavy grade vinyl and weighs a ton, however the factory people (if I could only track this factory down!), keep handing the records before they're set and leaving PERMANENT finger marks on the records.<br /><br />I can not get these marks off of the LPs even with professional grade cleaning. This is not the first new release lp to arrive in this condition. So I know there's an LP factory somewhere possibly in China producing these lemons! Thanks a lot for wasting our money.<br /><br />Sonically, the lp did not sound deep with wide soundstage or rich in tonal qualities. It sounded like a bad AAD recording CD with pops and crackle right from the first moment the needle hit the record.<br /><br />I have not even been able to enjoy the music because I am so irritated about the condition my brand new album arrived in.<br /><br />I am speechless.<br /><br />If this is your vinyl comeback, you can keep it, I will keep buying CDs.
B005QBKXSC|5.0|if you are a daughtry fan, this a great cd. i enjoyed watching him on american idol and have liked his music ever since.
B004I1WIWU|2.0|This is a wonderful album pressed onto a horrible LP.<br /><br />The sonic quality is just not there. The album has surface noise right from the get-go. Furthermore like many new release albums I bought in the last few weeks, this is all packaging and no quality lp album. The lp itself has a melted spindle hole that ran over the label, the lp had finger and hand marks and scuffs from poor handling during production. These marks are permanent and can not be removed.<br /><br />This is the third new release, new pressing album to arrive in this condition.<br /><br />This is fraud guys....<br /><br />vinyl is dead on arrival if this is a comeback at all...
034580404X|2.0|Take out the eye-rolling, lip-biting, blushing, flushing, & \\"Oh my\\"s and all that's left are the extremely repetitive sex scenes. After the fourth time, even those are boring. These two are like rabbits and have sex every time they're in the same room. Throw in very little plot and weak character development and it makes for a disappointing read. Save your money.
B006PTZNRU|2.0|If this is how Vinyl is making a comeback, I am sorry to say this is a stillborn rebirth.<br /><br />While album covers and inner sleeves are beautifully rendered and designed, the two Lps in this album are paper thin, both have hand marks from the factory that would not come off even after professional lp cleaning. The lps have surface noise in places when played for the first time on two separate turntables with relatively forgiving gentle cartridges. One of the lps has off center and wrong shape (not circle, an ellipse) distorted spindle hole with melted vinyl dripped and frozen on the label.<br /><br />The sonic reproduction is a crude transcript of what's on the CD and makes one wonder, why deal with the babying of LPs when the CD sounds better.<br /><br />Wonderful album and music, I own it in digital form, CD form and I wanted Lp to see if some of the tracks like \\"state of the art\\" would sound better with wider soundstage on the lp like some songs do. No cigar. I do not think this was remastered for LP, I do not think this LP album was made in the US.<br /><br />I don't think made in China and Vinyl comeback are compatible concepts... If you're going to make us pay as much as a CD or in some cases twice the CD, it needs to sound better, look better, hold up better, and be defect free -- especially for vinyl. You can not sell defective vinyl -- it is fraud, as the sound -- the product you're selling in case it is not clear to you -- will be low quality.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Luckily I got my Perplexus Epic in one piece. The plastic components look fragile and you dont want to drop it on the floor. The Perplexus Epic is a very hard game even for an adult. There is hardly an easy obstacle. Even at level one it begins at a high level of difficulty. Although i have reached level 25 which took me two days, I probably should have gotten the Perplexus original first. I like the 3-D maze concept. Each obstacle is used twice as it can be flipped over to create a new path - ingenious. A little trick I discovered. You can use a magnet to position the ball in some instances. As some obstacles are extremely hard, like trying to balance on a tightrope.
B0086700CM|5.0|way addictive hooked on the game right away and have trouble putting it down, it is definite must play if you like challenges
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Given, Pink Floyd were much younger when they did The Wall, so that album was more extreme, and Rush is now much more mature, so the lyrics are not psychotic like those of Roger Waters, but I see many similarities in the concept of this album. I urge everyone to read along with the lyrics in the excellent little booklet that comes with this for the first 1 or 2 listens and view the awesome illustrations, which by the way paint a very good picture of the \\"mood\\" of this music. Younger fans won't see it, but those fans like me who grew up with Rush and are about the same age as the band will relate to the lyrics a lot better. The theme of this album, like The Wall, is at times introspective and dark, expressing the alienation and cynicism that come with growing older...<br /><br />\\"Believe in what we're told, Until our final breath, While our loving Watchmaker, Loves us all to death\\"<br /><br />\\"An early promise that somehow died, A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage\\"<br /><br />\\"Sometimes the angels punish us, By answering our prayers\\"<br /><br />\\"A man could lose his life, in a country like this, Sunblind and friendless, Frozen and endless\\"<br /><br />\\"All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, Cause sometimes the target is you\\"<br /><br />\\"Belief has failed me now, Life goes from bad to worse\\"<br /><br />And at other times, it is reflective back upon the lessons and regrets of our youth...<br /><br />\\"For all those years I had to get along, they told me I was wrong\\"<br /><br />\\"What did I do? Fool that I was, To profit from youthful mistakes?\\"<br /><br />\\"I learned to fight and learned to love and learned to steal, I wish that I could live it all again\\"<br /><br />Musically it is flawless, as is typical with Rush, guitars and drums rocking hard through most of the songs except the seemingly overlooked gem \\"The Garden\\", which is a beautiful ballad. There is not a single weak song, they are all strong so it is hard to pick a favorite, but I guess so far mine is \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", which has an almost Zeppelinish sound to it.<br /><br />My only complaint, a minor one, as others have pointed out, is that although it rocks hard and sounds great loud, it would be better if it had a bit more dynamic range. There are some parts where Geddy's vocals are almost drowned out by the guitars, so I think when mixing it they could have lifted him up just a bit higher above the instruments. Understand, I think this is only a MINOR problem, and the album still sounds great.<br /><br />Those who don't like it at first, give it at least 5 listens. Many albums are weird that way actually, you need to hear them several times until you really hear what the musicians are playing and saying, especially with concept albums. I remember when I first heard \\"The Wall\\" I thought it was awful, but later on all of a sudden it just blew me away. That is when for me all the songs started to become recognizable from each other and I heard the real strength of this album. I'm not going to sugar coat it and call it a masterpiece like some did, I think that's exaggerating. A masterpiece only comes in 1 out of 1000 albums at best, like \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Tommy\\" by The Who. Perhaps if Rush had added a few more songs, made it a 2 disc set, and done a little better mixing, this would be a masterpiece, but it is still an excellent album, different from, but among their best ever. The mood of this album is serious, personal, and mature, so especially you younger kids, don't expect to hear the uplifting high vocals like \\"Fly By Night\\" or \\"Tom Sawyer\\", but I think most of us who grew up with Rush will really love this album. Although it really rocks, I wouldn't refer to it as a \\"kick-ass\\" or fantasy album, it is a more realistic but \\"beautiful\\" and brilliant work of music from a well-seasoned mature band. I see it as similar to a non-psychotic version of \\"The Wall\\" except Time is the enemy rather than alienation, and the \\"Clockwork Angels\\" can at times be more like demons, bringing us closer to Death, which brings to mind a lyric from another Pink Floyd song, \\"Time\\"... \\"Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death\\". I recommend reading the booklet at least once, because if you can't relate to the excellent lyrics and images you're missing half the beauty of this magnificent journey through life, and all the emotions that we feel along the way. Enjoy!<br /><br />P.S.  Teres, if you're out there, sorry you had to miss that concert back in L.A. :(  Get this one and keep rockin' with Rush girl, and give me a shout! :)
B008645YH6|5.0|Now, I've been a fan & admirer of Welsh lass Marina since \\"The Family Jewels\\" was new in the UK in 2010...I am a hardcore Anglophile mind you...and saw her twice in NYC in 2011...and was told she was bigger in the US than the UK...surprised me, as an online cult is not out in the open...when I met her (charming as heck), she said she was recording this album in LA and was immersed in Americana pop culture, working again with The Bird & The Bee's Greg Kurstin (he produced \\"Oh No!! on TFJ), and was inking to get back there...our Marina was overflowing with ideas, and based on the results...the utterly beguiling \\"Electra Heart\\"...it was totally worth the wait.<br /><br />This is an S-M-A-R-T pop record of the highest order.  Using common pop language to communicate her unique outsider Welsh/UK-bred ideas and reflections (funny and sad and ironic) on Americana and pop culture in ways that anyone will understand. Certain songs grab you immediately with an utterly Katy Perry-type of warble she's grown into...if \\"Primadonna\\" doesn't remind you of KP and have you thinking it could be her next hit, your ears are clogged...BUT this is not a bad thing!!  I do like Katy Perry, she does know what she's doing and \\"Teenage Dream\\" is a well crafted pop album, absolutely, but that album is missing an unpredictable, creative quirky intelligence that Marina delivers 100% of the time like on \\"Primadonna\\", an amazing pop song...Marina is a smart observant creative type that uses catchy-as-heck pop forms as social commentary...not many people can pull this off well like our heroine can.<br /><br />What's even cooler is that certain tracks grab you by the collar instantly with their catchy bubblegum-type of approach like the 1st 3 tracks...\\"Bubblegum B*tch\\" (I'm sure people like Katy are slapping themselves thinking why didn't I think of that title?? LOL.), \\"Primadonna\\" and the gorgeous \\"Lies\\", while others reveal their secrets S-L-O-W-L-Y...so she keeps you listening and coming back and finding new favourites, maintaining your interest.  Right now, I'm loving \\"Teen Idle\\", the US-only \\"How To Be A Heartbreaker\\" (such a fun song), and the gorgeous closer \\"Fear & Loathing\\" has me amazed (Marina's spectral dramatic delivery may remind some of Florence Welch which I hear too but more pop and even a drop of Regina Spektor like on TFJ's \\"I Am Not A Robot\\")...\\"Valley Of The Dolls\\" is another favourite.  As another reviewer said, \\"Electra Heart\\" IS indeed cinematic, which is amazingly cool.  I hope this record wins awards and garners her a bigger US audience...it is coming from what I found out.<br /><br />This US edition is better than the UK regular...it did remove \\"Living Dead\\"...I'm sure you can find the track online, or Elektra in America (is there a more apt label for this record??  I don't think so.) will have this song on a soundtrack in the future...and adds 3 songs in its place...the amazing gleefully fun \\"How To Be A Heartbreaker\\", and 2 tracks (out of 4) from the UK deluxe...the original 1st single \\"Radioactive\\"...I love that song, don't see why it was left off the UK regular, weird...and \\"Sex Yeah\\", which is cool commentary on relationships.  And the track order is satisfying because the 2nd half is not all slower songs...it mixes things up more.<br /><br />All in all, I am THRILLED with this record, and word is indeed spreading about \\"Electra Heart\\"...a triumph indeed...and Marina deserves everything coming her way...it already hit #1 in the UK & Ireland...we'll see if she follows her fellow UK labelmate in the US, Ed Sheeran into the US Top 5...I'd be pleasantly shocked if she does, but this will debut high from the buzz...it is selling out in various stores.<br /><br />Go Marina!!!

B000SGGUWS|5.0|Yes I gave Pretty Little Liars 5 stars.  No, this novel is not in the same category as Shakespeare, but for what it is, it's great.<br /><br />I wanted to read the series after seeing ABC Family's Pretty Little Liars.  The TV show does differ from the books.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />The premise:<br />At the end of seventh grade, a clique of 5 girls was ruled by one of the girls, Allison.  Allison is the classic \\"mean girl.\\"  The girls all had a secret referred to only as \\"the Jenna thing\\" which bonds them and keeps them close.  Allison then disappears and the rest of the girls fall out of touch.  It's now the beginning of junior year for them and they all start receiving mysterious texts from \\"A.\\" The problem-A knows everything about them including secrets they don't want others to know.  So, who is A?<br /><br />The characters:<br />Aria-Having returned from being out of the country for 2 years, she meets the man of her dreams at a local bar. Only problem-he turns out to be her English teacher.<br /><br />Spencer-The typical over-achiever, Spencer is out to be the best-and to move out from underneath her perfect sister's shadow.  One<br /><br />Emily-A competitive swimmer struggling to meet her parent's high expectations, Emily starts to become confused about what she wants including if that means she wants a boyfriend or girlfriend.<br /><br />Hanna-When Allison was here, Hanna was the \\"fat friend.\\" Now, she's turned into Rosewood's \\"It\\" girl.  Of course, she has her share of problems-a dad who she doesn't talk to anymore, a boyfriend who won't sleep with her, etc.<br /><br />Comparison to the TV show-I personally, even though I'm 30, think Pretty Little Liars is a great show. Very guilty pleasure! Well, I think the first novel was actually better than the TV show.

B005T87QCI|4.0|A great game for kindle fire, beautiful graphics and fun gameplay. There's only one problem... it's missing three of the cheif characters! I hope that they are included in an update, and I'll give it five stars for sure!

B0034G4P4O|4.0|The movie contains story from at least two different books in the original \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" series, \\"The Crab with the Golden Claws\\" and \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\".<br />The movie itself is chock-full of action and lifelike animation.  One of the scenes can be kind of hard to follow what is happening, but it's rather funny anyway.  The very young children may find some of the action too violent and scary, but for older kids, it's fine.<br />I had originally been hoping that there would be more special features, like deleted scenes and outtakes; but the behind the scenes feature was interesting, to see how they made the animation.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|Although I was a serious student in college, I slept through my economics course. The professor mumbled in monotone, and I thought the course dry and too abstract. Thus, I never dreamed I'd ever give sustained thought to the subject again. But when Fareed Zacaria recommended Krugman's book End This Depression Now!, I felt I needed informed information about our present American economy and what actions/philosophies/cultures/politics had tumbled Americans into this present crisis predicament. Paul Krugman sustained my attention by using metaphors, allegories, simple stories, and humor to make the subject engaging and even personal. As a result, my understanding the background and specifics for what candidates, journalists, and propagandists are presenting to us as THE TRUTH and THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE AMERICA'S ECONOMIC CRISIS gives me the filter for determining who actually knows what he/she is talking about, who hasn't a clue, and who is twisting facts and informed information to his/her advantage for dishonest political gain.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I have to say that this book was great, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first. The first book is new and exciting, taking me out of my comfort zone. Then book two, I felt was toned down. There are some points I really liked. I loved the fact that we get to see a different side of Christian and a glimpse into his childhood. Christian is starting to thaw a little in his emotions. We get to see that his family really loves and cares for him. The B***h Troll gets told off and I couldn't be happier about that. Ana gets a little bolder. Both in demeanor and conversation.<br /><br />I'm kinda on the fence about this one, I liked it, but something was missing.<br /><br />I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I found this book to be a great motivator and launch pad for moving from a hooked in, high debt, high stress lifestyle into a more relaxed, focused, flexible, and resilient way of being.<br /><br />That said, it is certainly not a step by step guide. It is not a how-to. Rather, it teaches you the \\"why\\" behind any given how, and allows you the space to make those \\"whys\\" work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is back on track with book one. I had some issues with book two and waited a while before I started reading book three. I am glad I decided to pick it back up. I extremely enjoyed this one. Both Christian and Ana have grown up a little. There is a lot going on in this book. Some mystery, heart break, joy, and of course lots of sex! Intense, that is what I would describe this one as. Christian and Ana both have some MAJOR breakdowns. I didn't want this one to end. But, you get bonus material with this one. You get to see the interview from Christian's POV and even a small story from his POV as a child with the Greys! One thing I don't understand is why the author kept eluding to what was going on between Mia and Ethan, but never gave us a conclusion. Was that just filler?<br /><br />Anyway, I would say FSF ties with FSoG for me! It was a great book. I will be re-reading this series!<br /><br />I received a free copy of this to review. I will always give my honest review of the book.
B001853NZK|5.0|Great product well made no issues.  I was concerned about its size when I ordered it so I will tell you my findings.  I put 100, 9 slot sleeves in it, and filled it with \\"Magic The Gathering\\" cards. Two cards per pocket for a total of 1800 cards and they fit just fine.  I wouldn't however put any more than that in then you would be overflowing up and over the D-rings.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|A very cute and fun game. But just tell your kids not to buy stuff and you'll be fine. Its great.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I was very pleased upon opening this game by the quality of the graphics and the ease of play . Then the challenge of getting my times down to get the three gold stars led me to several rounds faster than four minutes and that yielded further surprises. The only drawback so far was that the game locked up so badly at one point that I had to uninstall and reinstall it. Of course the problem was partly my fault because I'm new to Kindle and accidentally bumped the screen after selecting a level to play. Apparently it tried to open two levels at once and that didn't go well. Object lesson: plan your choice and only strike your choice once. Have fun!
B001I189MQ|5.0|One of the best movies in history. I dont understand how batman begins could score more stars than this classic. that movoie drug on and on.
034580404X|5.0|Despite what's being reported as \\"mommy porn\\" which is an insult, this trilogy is a complicated love story.  The 1st book is a little elementary in the writing style, etc. but by the middle of the 2nd book, the characters are well-formed and maturing, as you would expect.  I have to admit though, I would've been disappointed if it ended tragically.  After the stress of the emotional ups & downs of the relationship, the ending needed to be positive - and it was.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I'm a fan of great graphics and Dungeon Hunter 3 amazes me. I love the game play and I have to admit I am very very addicted!
B001O4WNCE|5.0|This was my childhood dream to beacome a ghostbuster, that was about 19 years ago, to this day a part of me always remembers those were the good days. Pure nostalgia and a fun movie to watch, especially on halloween. The special effects, you can tell by watching the movie are a bit dated, but it still looks awesome to this date. I would highly reccomend this movie to any scifi fan or ghost fanatic. Five stars in my book.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It is ok it is not the best ever or anything. But like I said it is ok but not the best and wish I had the full version
0345803485|1.0|The only interesting part of the books, the premise of a sexual contract, is ruined within one page. It could have turned into a great thriller. Instead the story is Mills and Boon - but worse. Man is ****ed up by crap childhood. Woman doesn't have a clue but thinks she can mend him. He gradually caves in. By volume 3 there is a sickly happy ending that you don't remotely care about. Life is richer, much more interesting. Sex cannot always be rationalised - and bloody well probably shouldn't be! How sad that people read this utter inanity and find something in it. The sex is unbelievably dull and implausible. Dialogue is non-existent (do women really want a man who cannot say anything remotely interesting?) And the quality of writing is DIRE. Maybe women like it because it is painfully (!) obvious that the women has all the power (as the protagonist admits)????? By the end of Volume 1 she has stripped (sic) out his identity to a lost little boy, controlled him and taken away any identity/personality he ever had. Thank God real men and women, and the relationships between them, are much more complicated, passionate and interesting. Please do not waste your life and go and live the real thing. If you must fanatsise about meeting a rich man with a plane go watch Pretty Woman - it does everything this book pretends to so much better.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Im really enjoying this game! I like the fact it has various levels of play...making it more challenging. I play on my Kindle Fire and highly recommend this game for anyone.
0451228375|5.0|Four hundred years after Pillars of the Earth, the story continues. Written with historical information intertwined with the challenges of everyday life. The characters are developed so well that you won't be able to put this book down until the very last word is read.

B008602KQI|5.0|Even though this film, and the book, have a predictable ending and plot development, I still like its allegorical message which is very optimistic, romantic, and brave. In my humble opinion, I see the world of the film as not so much a dystopic view of some possible future, but as a candid portrait and satire of our current post-capitalist dystopia. It helped me to realize that we currently live in a totalitarian, feudal, aristocratic, religious global society and culture, where the rich and powerful sacrifice the young in order to keep the lower classes in line. Think Iraq, Afganistan, Iran, .. Keep everyone afraid, hungry, oppressed, and ignorant/ stupid by hypnotizing them with hyperreal media.<br />The ultra mediatized Spectacle society portrayed so beautifully in the movie, with the exaggerated super fashion bizarro look of the residents of the Capitol, reminded me so much of Guy Debord's revealing and incisive look at the Society of the Spectacle done in the 1960's, and still equally valid today in 2012. Panem is the American Empire, but where is our Katniss?<br />Another observation on the metaphor and trope, I noticed that like many other post-apocalyptic films, after the great conflagration, it is always a reactionary, conservative, totalitarian regime that takes over the running of the world-as if the apocalypse always leads to regression and a return to a feudal society. A good example is \\"The Handmaids Tale\\" by Margaret Atwood, and the film based upon her book.<br />Excellent movie and book, see the film and read the book(s). They are part of the Red Pill that will wake you up from The Matrix!

B004BJMEO6|2.0|First off, I gave this movie 2 stars not because I didn't like it, but because there were so many things wrong that could have been easily fixed.  I am a fan of sappy romances with sappy happy endings and this movie delivered BUT that's all it delivered, well the two main characters were nice to look at so i'll give a couple of points for that.<br /><br />I believe this movie was made within the last couple of years, but looking at the setup and the characters it looks dated back to early 90's. Wardrobe was horrible and out of date. Having a limited budget is not an excuse for a poor wardrobe. I know what it's like to have to stretch your pennies, but a trip to Target, Walmart, or the local Pic and Spend would have done wonders and you still would have had money to spare.  Next, the script was not the best. The two main characters are good actresses and it seems they did the best with what they had.  There was good story here to be told but the writer/director didn't quite know how to deliver it. Put aside the fact this is a lesbian movie and just look at the movie aspect of it, have anyone ever seen a movie of this quality on television or the big screen? Lifetime wouldn't even air this.<br /><br />The good things about this movie are not lost, the main characters are attractive, they can act and they do have chemistry.
0345803485|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Go ahead and purchase \\"50 Shades Darker\\" & \\"50 Shades Freed\\", because you will want to keep on reading. Looking fwd. to E.L. James next book!

B00846REIS|2.0|I think the author  read 50 Shades of Grey and thought she could compete by writing a book in a weekend. I have no doubt she could write a good book if she wanted too. I just won't be reading them. There was no depth to the characters, I can't believe that E L James is not suing this lady for plagiarism!

B0041KKYBK|1.0|What a horrible movie!  I had to force myself to watch it to the end.<br /><br />I bought it because I was hoping to learn a bit more than I already knew about the events that transpired during the financial crisis.  I believed the \\"documentary\\" label and the awards it supposedly received.  Plus I have always really liked Matt Damon as an actor.<br /><br />This is a biased, completely superficial film with a single objective of convincing the viewer that all of Wallstreet, the financial services industry and most large businesses in general are run by evil, greedy, unscrupulous people.  It features heavily edited interviews that clearly were meant only to embarrass the few people who agreed to be interviewed. It is crystal clear that everyone involved with this film has absolutely no experience whatsoever with any type of large business.  It is naive to the point of being disgusting.  It is completely void of any real information.<br /><br />After watching it, I looked again at who was quoted at praising the movie.  LA Times.  Go figure.  One thing that did become clearer to me is why so many actors/actresses and career long politicians take the positions they do.  It is simply because they are totally lacking any actual experience of running a business, let alone being a corporate director. Zip. They are, in fact, clueless.  What is really scary is they are absolutely blind to what they are missing and they blather on as if they are experts.  This movie is a perfect case in point.<br /><br />There were many things that were broken and strayed way off track that caused the financial crisis.  There were leaders who should have listened much better than they did and there were clear warning signs that should have been heeded.  Some people did let money influence their judgment.  If you are interested in understanding these areas more, look somewhere else.<br /><br />Matt Damon, you seem like a nice guy and a good person.  You are certainly a great actor.  If you are going to get involved with business, including the politics around it, please find someone who actually knows something about the subject, listen to them and have them help you.  Reading a book about directing a movie and then walking on a set believing you can make a great film is a excellent analogy.oing to get involved with business, including the politics around it, please find someone who actually knows something about the subject, listen to them and have them help you.

B00425S1H8|5.0|This adapter works well with a mac OSX running 10.7.  No problems at all.  Quality seems good.  I recommend this adapter; but, don't expect it to work with the Innova 3160 automotive scanner--the scanner's software still does not support OSX--not an issue with the adapter, though.
B0072X2O66|4.0|For any fan of classic heavy metal, this will be familiar ground. The more listens you give it, the better it gets. Stand-out hard rocking tracks include Indifferent and Undaunted. Now to the lyrics. A bit too juvenile. Did the word \\"wannabe\\" have to be featured in one of the best songs? \\"Feelin' me?\\" Nope, sorry, not feeling those lyrics. Most tracks have passable lyrics, albeit with a lot of cliches thrown in. It's a solid metal release that will grow on you, but not 5 star due to some poor lyrics. Ignore the lyrics, and rock out.
B0086700CM|4.0|So we all know by now that on the iPods and iPhones it worked well. I was so excited when this finally came out that I almost literally played all day! after a couple of day it stopped noticing some of my swipes and I would die when I tjought I shouldn't have. I was just thinking well maybe I am not swiping enough or need to turn up the sensitivity. I did that and it just made it worse. I look at the reviews and someone even said that it shut down their device! I think there is something wrong with this app that needs to be fixed!
0525423656|4.0|After finishing Matched I was so eager to complete the series that I ordered the second book immediately, and pre-ordered the third book. I wasn't disappointed by the second book and look forward to the third.<br /><br />Crossed has more action than the first book, but continues to be driven by the relationship between Cassia and Ky. Xander played a very small role in this novel. My only complaint about these books is that I find I'm constantly hoping for more information: about side characters' back stories, about how the world came to be the way it is in the story, and more details about the Society in general. Maybe I'm looking for too much detail from a YA novel. I will say that you do receive more of these things in Crossed, and hopefully that trend continues for the third novel.<br /><br />I think the reason I have enjoyed these novels so much is that I find the world interesting, the characters are well developed (I actually care to find out what happens to them), and the romance believable. If you liked the first book I would definitely give this one a try.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Will everyone who believes these characters all died please look up the definition of the word \\"multiverse\\" in a dictionary.  Re-watch the show.  You'll find very few loose ends, and LIVING characters at the end.

B00866JLEG|2.0|This movie was disappointing. Grant you the lead male actor is definitely easy on the eyes, but did not fit the part. He was too young to properly portray the lead. The movie left to many questions open and did not explain enough. I read the book so I knew the reasons, but those who have not will be left with questions.

B007SGM084|5.0|I am so GLAD that I purchased this trilogy it was AWESOME!!  The story line kept you on edge through all 3 books.  I was so sad when I realized that I would no longer have Christian and Anastasia to read about.<br /><br />I know it sounds CRAZY but you fall in love with the characters in this book so much that you don't want to leave them<br /><br />Well worth the $29.99 investment to my Kindle.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was skeptical to buy this because of the low reviews and mention of knee problems afterwards.  I have never had knee issues, and someone posted they never had problems until they started working out to this DVD.  SO many posted about knee injuries.  This made me skeptical.  But hey, I wanted to shred.<br /><br />My calves were killing on day 2!  It was a good pain, though.  A pain that you know you're being worked. My body felt like jello after the first couple of workouts.  Jillian is a GOOD teacher and takes her time to SHOW the viewer things to avoid (knee injuries, for example).  And as she's talking (one review noted how distracting that is.  Um, WHAT?  She's teaching moves to avoid!), she has her girls continuing to do the workout so it's not like the momentum stops.  I dunno... I just didn't understand the low reviews.  Oh, and no knee problems because I am always making sure my knee does not go over my toe, which she reminds the viewer from time to time.<br /><br />I'm not a huge Jillian fan - never have been really - but I can see her love for her job and her willingness to want people to get healthy.  That, to me, is awesome.  She isn't cocky about it either, such as, \\"Check ME out\\" but overall just good at what she does.  I'm sold.  And now I wanna add her abs one.

B003TXKSWK|5.0|Most inspiring, engaging!  In a magnificent way, The Roots embrace the past to learn for the future in their music.  Feeling the fight, the hurt, the anger, the hope, the faith - all culminating to our ability to love. They make it clear, \\"We Will Never Forget\\".  They make it clear, \\"We need to step up and take care of eachother - take pride in our country\\".  What a comfort!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I absolutely love this app. It has some very challenging games and my family enjoys playing. The ads do not bother me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a great app by far. It makes reading the Bible easy and fun. Give it a try and see for yourself.
B008CRC506|4.0|I'll have to admit that I've done some theatre in my time -- and this show does not in any way depict reality.  It's more like those old \\"back-stage\\" musicals done during Hollywood's era, which were just as \\"accurate.\\"<br /><br />Having said that, I'll confess that I just adore this show and it was absolutely a \\"must see\\" for me every week.  It's fun, slightly campy, with over-the-top plotlines and some truly wonderful musical numbers along with actors who, for the most part, play this absolutely .  (Favorites for the Season: \\"Don't Say Yes Until I Finish Talking\\" as sung by Christian Borle and \\"A Thousand and One Nights. I'd love Raza Jaffrey to stay if they gave him more musical numbers, never mind that Dev is a putz.)  It's *fun*. It's not deep and often ridiculous, but this is something you can put, just sit back and let wash over you.<br /><br />Are there things that could be improved? Oh, definitely.  Are there things that don't work in Season 1? Well, I'll probably fast-forward through much of Julia's marital problems, hope Karen will prove a bit-less wide-eyed and not miss Ellis one bit when the show returns.<br /><br />But I'm definitely going to watch Eileen throw her drink in Frank's face at least a few more times before that.
0345529057|3.0|Ok so I bought the bundle of four books - the tangible soft cover printed on paper books. I bought them around the time that the other reviews complaining about the poor physical quality of the books were written (mid-year 2011). I did not find any of those problems -missing pages, pages falling out, binding breaking or miss printed pages. The paper seemed a little cheap; the books were very heavy so a higher quality of paper would have added even more weight to this bloated epic. (This is the transition from the product review to the content review).<br /><br />Yes I did say bloated. Some compare Martin to Tolkien, I just don't see it. Is it just because he is writing a long story in a fantasy world? Others have done that. Is it because he is an exceptional writer? There are several of those too.<br /><br />Martin has used over 4000 pages to get the story where? Half done? After 4000 pages of Tolkien I had read the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, including appendixes, The Silmarillion, The Unfinished Tails and The Children of Hurin and then re-read The Lord of the Rings, not including the appendixes and The Silmarillion one more time.<br /><br />What's your point you might ask - go ahead, ask. Well I don't know what my point is. I am vaguely dissatisfied. Less than happy, I feel unfulfilled. It was a lot of work to get through this marathon of literature only to find myself half way home with years of waiting before another frustrated read leaves me unsatisfied.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first two books, I really did. But Martin's style has eroded my thrill of reading. During  the fourth book I found every little style annoyance began to cause me physical pain. What annoyances? Let's  see, \\"fearsomely strong cider\\" every time the cider was sited , \\"cuz\\" every time Jamie spoke to a cousin, \\"nuncle\\" by characters who had used uncle in prior books  and always telling us about little girls underwear. Really no more talk about small clothes -please.<br /><br />Martin does notremind me of Tolkien, more like David Brin - Startide Rising second trilogy anyone? Or maybe George Lucas and Star Wars - great ideas,  masterfully executed - initially and then run into the ground by its own weight.<br /><br />Yes I will read book 5 - I'll buy it used. And I'll read book 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 and...my Self-esteem will diminish with each book. Most likely either Martin will die before the story ever comes close to an end leaving all of us unfulfilled.
1416550534|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, but after stumbling through 250 pages and putting it down and picking it up -- multiple times -- I've lost any desire to know what happens next.  The characters need to be developed earlier in the story line and there needs to be a big enough suspense to make me want to go to the end to find out whatever shocking twist of fate awaits. The conversations went on and on in painstaking detail & I found the main character, Grace,  to be void of any real personality.  I loved Kate Morton's writing in The Forgotten Garden and The Distant Hours, which is why I kept reading this story hoping for a flame of interest. Unfortunately, it never came and there are many other great books out there I'm wanting to read.

I loved the complexity of the characters, the relationships between mothers and daughters, their ups and downs, all in the name of love.  Just as in life, some people love their friendships full-heartedly and others only conditionally, I was reminded of both sides of loyalty; beauty and betrayal. The suspense and mystery in the book started early on and left me wanting more.  A page-turner and a joyful read.<br /><br />\\" ... It wasn't often, though, that Mother joined in story time. For the most part she disapproved of stories. \\"You must learn to know the difference between tales and truth, my Liza,\\" she would say. \\"Fairy tales have a habit of ending too soon. They never show what happens afterwards when the prince and the princess ride off the page.\\"<br /><br />  \\"But what do you mean, Mother?\\" Eliza would ask.<br /><br />  \\"What happens to them when they need to find their way in the world, to make money and escape the world's ills.\\"<br /><br />  Eliza never understood. It seemed irrelevant, thought she wouldn't say as much to Mother.  They were princes and princesses, they didn't need to make their way in the world, only as far as their magical castle.<br /><br />  \\"You mustn't wait for someone to rescue you,\\" Mother would continue, a faraway look in her eyes.  \\"A girl expecting rescue never learns to save herself. Even with the means, she'll find her courage wanting. Don't be like that Eliza. You must find your courage, learn to rescue yourself, never rely on anyone else.\\"\\"

Rate the MOVIE, not your buying experience! Good heavens! Not everyone reads every review, so those that don't will get the wrong impression. Seriously, why do people do that here?

I listen to this album when I get tired of over-produced music and just want to hear the Irishman sing like he's in my living room.

B003UESJHE|5.0|Simply put, The King's Speech is extremely motivating and powerful. The film, directed by Tom Hooper (John Adams, The Damned United), has plenty of funny moments to balance itself into what may be one of the top 10, even 5 films of the year. Colin Firth delivered what should be an automatic Oscar nomination, with his performance of the king to-be. His portrayal of a career staggering speech impediment is incredibly convincing. Geoffrey Rush also delivered an Oscar worthy performance as King George's speech coach. Helena Bohnam Carter is a charmer, as always. She's just great. I was quite surprised at how thoroughly entertaining, yet intelligent The King's Speech was. It's a must-see, and perhaos not a must own. It's certainly one that won't be for everyone, but everyone should at least see it once and give it a chance like I did. I may just surprise you with its brilliance.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I was reluctant to see this film because I was afraid it'd be depressing to watch a young man die.  Instead I found it a rich film, brilliantly crafted and splendidly acted.<br /><br />There's been a lot of argument here about Chris McCandless's motivation.  A voice-over from his sister said he was was extremely angry at his father, who he'd learned had abandoned a son Chris's age from an extramarital relationship.  Identification with his betrayed half-brother, a wish to punish his father, the challenge of graduating from college and having to go out into the world -- all these contributed to his rejecting his upward-striving father's values, giving away all his money, dropping out of his family and indeed civilization.<br /><br />I don't believe he was suicidal.  After all, he was trying to leave the wild when he found himself trapped by spring floods, and his death was due to his unintentionally ingesting toxic berries that impeded his body's ability to absorb nutrients.  I also think it's simplistic to attribute his behavior to a \\"mental illness,\\" an imprecise layman's term.<br /><br />If pressed by a health insurance company, therapists might diagnose \\"adjustment reaction of adolescence.\\" But that'd merely sum up his delayed maturation:  his heedlessness -- he was warned of the dangers he faced, yet barely prepared himself; his problems with authority, as shown by his boating down a river after being denied a permit; his uninformed optimism.<br /><br />Basically, Chris was nice kid whose family troubles and personal inexperience impaired his judgment, fatally.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|RED is not bad, for a movie about bunch of old retired agents who become targets by the same government they once killed for. R.E.D. stands for \\"Retired and Extremely Dangerous,\\" and that's exactly what they are. The cast of RED is questionable for an action movie on paper (except for John McClane), but after seeing them all in action, it's better than I ever imagined. I had neutral expectations for this film, and I'm happy to say it's a pleasant surprise. Bruce Willis is as great as he's been in a while. That isn't saying much because he has not had much energy lately, but the rest of the cast picks up his slack tenfold. John Malkovich is amazing. He is genuinely hilarious. I thought it took some kind of special skill to make people laugh every time you spoke. He isn't a comedian, but whatever it is, he has it. The man is pure comedic genius in this movie. See it for him if nothing else. Malkovich isn't it though. There is also Helen Mirren in a fur coat and military boots, with a big @ss gun. Something worth mentioning is that they trained her well with those guns. The lady did not blink or close her eyes when shooting, like I'd expect her to. Just a straight face. I loved that. I really believed she was a trained killer. She is badass beyond words, yet manages to stay classy. How does she do it? The Queen with a freaking sniper rifle? Yes. And there is also Morgan Freeman. His last role was a President, now he's a retired agent. And he's great in his role, but don't expect to see him for too long.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good too. Ernest Borgnine made me smile in his tiny role, and I enjoyed Richard Dreyfuss. Yeah, the cast is full of older actors, but you won't be able to tell. I have to say that Mary Louise Parker was a little annoying at times, but she doesn't hinder the movie overall. The performances are great, but what else is there? The comedy aspect of the film is better than the action to be honest. I laughed a lot, and so did the rest of the audience. There are a couple of action scenes that will make you cheer though. Mainly the airport scene. I won't go into detail, but I think everyone will like that part, despite their feelings on the rest of the movie. Besides what I've mentioned, there isn't too much to else to the movie. I enjoyed the locale hopping. It was sort of Bond-like, but it stayed within the U.S. I also enjoyed the plot. It was slightly complex, but very easy to follow for the dimwits in the audience. No offense, to those of you who are dimwitted. :P I think this is a movie that will be very enjoyable to those of you who can ignore slight inconsistencies in the narrative and just enjoy the mayhem.

B004B8DH98|3.0|I think this movie got a pretty a bad rap from people who didn't know what they were walking into. Let's be fair, it is a Focus Feature. They're not really known for action now, are they? I agree that the trailers were very misleading, but that does not take away from what the actual product is. It's a quiet, slow paced homage to Italian cinema, and a character study of a lonely assassin. As a suspense thriller, it has its moments, but I wouldn't say they were great. George Clooney was pretty good as Jack. Not his best performance, but it didn't require much from him to begin with. I have to say, Violante Placido is a reason for any male to sit through this somber film more than once. She seems too beautiful an actress to be so willing to show it all so much, but there it was, and was, and was...Rental.

B000A7DVR2|4.0|After hearing a lot of hype about it, I finally cracked and got The Big Lebowski. While it certainly didn't bump No Country For Old Men from the top spot of my favorite Coen Brother films, it still didn't make me regret buying it either. I would rank it at number two. I actually can see myself growing more and more in to it as I watch it a few more times. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, the Dude. The Dude is a mellow unemployed bowler with a laid back attitude about everything, except his Persian rug. He also has really has a thing for White Russians and pajamas. His character was actually the first thing that pulled me into the story. Jeff Bridges doesn't play The Dude, he IS The Dude.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges has a solid supporting cast as well. John Goodman in one of his five appearances in a Coen brother film, is actually hilarious as Walter. My favorite moments are the times that he tells Steve Buscemi's character \\"Shut the f**k up, Donnie!\\" I really enjoyed this movie all the way through, but it could have been better. One thing I had a problem with were the dream scenes where the Dude would either be flying over Los Angeles, running from Russians with scizzors, or some other psychedelic figure. This is just my own personal nitpicks. Fortunately, there are only a few of these dream sequences. Besides that, my only other complaint is that, as extreme the events of the film were, I never really felt excited. In the end, The Big Lebowski is funny enough, and the performances were great. So this movie was worth the purchase.

B004NOH9LW|3.0|This film is hard to sum up. On one hand, Hereafter is a thought-provoking study on how different people handle their lives and life after death. On the other hand, it's a bitter disappointment when you consider the talent involved. However you feel in the end, Hereafter certainly does warrant at least one watch, if anything to see why there is such a division amongst viewers. The score is a depressing one. It sounds a lot like Unforgiven's in ways, and all of the actors are as depressing as the subject matter. They do a pretty good job at portraying the pain, grief, and all around hollowness caused by the death of a loved one. It's definitely well-acted, and the cinematography is pretty good as well. Dark and ominous are the best words to describe this one. It's a somber affair. That's obvious when considering the subject matter of the focal point of the three stories that the film revolves around. If you know me and my reviewing style, you know I hate to summarize plot, but I'll say that the three stories build up to an intersection that does absolutely nothing for the audience, or at least it did nothing for me.<br /><br />You feel for the characters throughout the story, but when they cross paths (after about two slow hours), you are left with a longing. I felt like Eastwood just ran out of story, so he wrapped it up abruptly. *Spoiler* And for a film that is so sad and depressing, the generic Hollywood happy ending pissed me off. Also, the opening sequence looked like something from 2012. Cars flipping down the street, trees falling, explosions in the background, and chaos. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sequence, but it just reminded me of 2012. My major complaint about this movie is that it really just left me feeling unfulfilled. I didn't take anything away from this, not a positive way to sum it up. I can't even explain why they took a supernatural route with it. The \\"Herafter\\" parts were pretty hokey. I didn't like The Lovely Bones either, but I'd consider watching that one again before this. I'm truly disappointed, but see it if you like Clint Eastwood. Just don't expect too much.er watching that one again before this. I'm truly disappointed, but see it if you like Clint Eastwood. Just don't expect too much.

B002ZG99NG|5.0|Ben Affleck basically gives all of you that hate him the middle finger with this movie. It's very reminiscent of Heat with ingredients from The Departed (one of my tp five favorite films), but still manages to maintain its freshness. Affleck proved with Gone Baby Gone that he could direct, and he solidifies that notion with The Town. The Boston locations were beautiful to look at, with a few nice aerial shots. The tension is suspenseful enough to put a majority of the audience on the edge of its seat. The romantic aspect never got corny, and most of all, the accents never sounded forced to me. I've never been to Boston, but I'd be willing to bet that the actors sounded pretty legit. Jeremy Renner was simply amazing in the movie. He can pretty much play any role. I cannot wait to see him as my favorite Avenger, Hawkeye. John Hamm was great as well. Mr. Mad Men is coming up in the world. My only gripe, besides the obvious copying (or homage, depending on who you ask) of previous gangster films, was Blake Lively. That chick overacted her ass off. He deserves an award. But that wasn't enough to kill my love of this one. Add this to your collection!

B002ZG99TK|3.0|Unstoppable has a few great things going for it. First of all, the cast is great. Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson and Kevin Dunn turn in good performances all around. The tension is on point for pretty much the entire time. I saw many people in the audience on the edges of their seats. Literally. I'm not just saying that because it's the cliche thing to say about a suspenseful movie. I heard plenty of gasps and 'oh no's' throughout the film, so it accomplished it's goal to exhilarate. Problem is, it fails to rise above what you see in the trailers. Big freight train carrying toxic chemicals is on the run, unmanned, and two unlikely partners have to save the day. Sorry for the cliche, but this movie is just the same old s**t on a different day (but with convincing characters). The main problem is just as I stated above. This movie is nothing more than what you see in the trailers. So if you liked what you saw, this is right for you. If it looked lame from the get-go, then guess what? ... Exactly. That said, I was actually one who thought to myself, \\"what the hell are Tony Scott and Denzel Washington making another train movie for if the last one (Pelham 123 remake) wasn't well received?\\" They have teamed up to make some pretty good movies in the past, or at least decent ones to other people that I loved (Man on Fire, Deja Vu, Crimson Tide).<br /><br />This movie falls closer along the lines of another Taking of Pelham 123, but much more exhillerating. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your point of view. I've come not to expect much from Tony Scott, and that usually works for me.  If you take him at face value, you may enjoy most of his lesser appreciated movies more than you expect to. Another huge issue I had were the quick cuts, and the unsteady camera. How old are the gliding camera shots that pan across actors' faces when they're talking? I'm fairly tired of it, personally, but I can accept it when it shows a cinematographer's intent on doing something to aid the suspencs. And after the third camera shot from the tracks, beneath the train as it passes over, I got a little aggrivated. These old, and often annoying methods can work, and not irritate people like me if only the director and director of photography would learn the concept of moderation. Once, or even twice is fine, but beyond that is just overkill. These methods do work at getting some people in the audience's heart rates slightly elevated, but overall, they often end up coming off as cheap gimmicks when overdone. Now don't get me wrong. I recommend this movie, but barely.on doing something to aid the suspencs. And after the third camera shot from the tracks, beneath the train as it passes over, I got a little aggrivated.

B0088W7KM8|1.0|I remember the days when movies and tv didn't try to blow your brains out with sound effects and background noise.  The days when even commercials were tolerable.

It's like having to watch commercials where you always have to mute the screaming idiots!!!!!<br /><br />Hopefully one day, someone will recognize that when it comes to sound, less is better....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just finished this morning and enjoyed it immensely. In this world, the characters are survivors of an apocalypse that happened several hundred years ago. For the most part, they live with the fact that the world outside is inhospitable. Their only view of the outside world exists through the cameras streaming to the 'up top'. The rules for living their are strict and breaking them means being sent outside to clean the cameras.<br /><br />As I read through, I came to feel for the characters and their struggles. I could understand their desire to do something and the effort it required for them to get there. It was interesting to see how these characters came to understand their situation and what got them there.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Emma Corrigan is a very relatable Cinderella with a wicked \\"stepsister\\" and handsome Prince Charming. Her story raises the question of what would really happen if we were absolutely honest to those we claim to love.

And although I am not normally a fan of the romance genre, I highly recommend it.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|So after having so many friends recommend this book I decided to read it and see what the hype was about. Now that I've finished I'm scratching my head and asking myself WHY is there so much hype about this book?!<br /><br />When I read the first few pages I started to think it was a book aimed at teenagers, given the way it was written. Obviously it wasn't. I overlooked the teenagery type of language and wanted to get on with the story, but the story line was so S L O W to unfold. By the time I was a third of the way through I had already gotten sick of the \\"oh my\\"s and blushing, and lip biting and peeking through eyelashes!<br /><br />I was waiting for some really raunchy sex scenes to be played out, but alas I was disappointed there too. Every scene was basically a repeat of the previous one, and there was really nothing to them. He just had to look at her half the time to turn her into a quivering mess and it was all over. After hearing my friends rave about how \\"Hot\\" the scenes were, to say I was disappointed is an understatement!!<br /><br />In relation to the characters themselves, well I found them infuriating. Christian is annoyingly morose and a total control freak. I had to keep reminding myself that he was only 27. He came across as more like 47. Likewise I had to remind myself that Ana was 21, and not 14. Seriously, referring to her bits as \\"down there\\" and \\"my sex\\" she seems so immature and it really REALLY annoyed me.<br /><br />And while I'm on a rant, what was with the 50 page contract?! TWICE?! Yep, that made for riveting reading... not. Likewise with the random email exhanges. Seriously, who writes emails like that?!<br /><br />All in all, I found the book to be repetitive, very poorly written, repetitive, unbelieveable, annoying, repetitive and slow. Oops, did I already mention repetitive? Oh my.....<br /><br />I won't be wasting any more time reading the other two books. I read the reviews of them and found out how the story plays out. If you want to know how it unfolds, read the reviews. Most of them are well written and I didnt have to wade through pages and pages of repetitive lip biting and boring sex scenes!
068817776X|5.0|Edith Hahn Beer's story is totally engrossing. I could have read this book in one sitting if I didn't need to sleep! What an amazing woman who bravely and patiently waited out the entire duration of the war to reclaim her identity. Edith suffered, not in the same way as those that perished in the camps, but in a way that is almost more mentally demanding. To get up every day with the fear of being caught, knowing that every action, sound, or word could betray you. That kind of mental strength makes this woman a true war hero to me.
0345803485|2.0|While I see the appeal of this book, no one can deny the cliches, stereotyping, and poor, poor writing. If you are interested in S&M and a true story of one woman discovering her own desires, do yourself a favor and read Whip Smart, by Melissa Febos. You won't be sorry.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|After investing so much time in the 4 book set, I decided to ignore the negative reviews... I wish that I had heeded the warnings. Fully 65% of this book is a waste of space. Often, an entire paragraph is devoted to nothing more than listing the 20-30 dishes in a meal, or an extensive listing of names for people in a room (many of which play no part in the story line). I do not know if it is ego or a need to pad the book, but I DO NOT recommend this book at all.

B004LROUW2|5.0|1Q84 was recommended to me by a heavy reader. I thought I would give it a try and was very pleased with the book. The story is unique and involves an alternate reality. The lead-in is clever and it takes quite a few chapters to see where things are probably going to come together. I liked the plot. I was very satisfied with the book and recommend it. I can understand, however, why some would not like it. It is well written. I wouldn't mind if it was even longer.

0307593525|4.0|I'm a fit and active young man who appreciates tasty food and consider myself a Francophile.  I love most things French.  Lacoste is one of my favorite brands.  I cook with La Creuset cookware.  Prior to purchasing these volumes I cooked mainly a hodgepodge of my own design.  It did not have the complexity and time honored elegance of French cooking.  This book is lovely in that it does not just contain a series of recipies.  It teaches you the techniques to make the various sauces that constitute the recipies.  It teaches you the basics and then allows you to progress through all of them.  Cooking takes practice.  Don't be surprised if you burn through boxes of sticks of butter before you learn how to clairify the butter adequately.<br /><br />Oh yes, if you cook with this book, you will be using butter, which the French call beurre.  Plenty of it.  I'd start looking for the natural butter from your local producer because the industrial butter is a lot of filler.  You will cook with heavy cream and eggs quite often.  When I was making an obsessive effort to cook French everyday, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Still, that's not the fault of this wonderful cookbook.<br /><br />This makes a great gift, and comes in a nice box set which looks good on a bookcase, or displayed in your kitchen.  A kitchen should be a bright and sunny place where magic happens.  Julia Child's cookbook will allow you to become a magician, with tons of practice and fortitude.  Just do yourself a favor and join a gym if you're planning on eating nothing but the creations in this book.  They're rich.

0062197258|4.0|\\"If it pleases the court...\\" the story begins as the scene in the courtroom unfolds.  Lee is on the stand and he explains how his girlfriend Cathy would go into a crazy state when he came home late or when she didn't know where he was, accusing him of cheating on her and hitting him.  Lee is asked if he ever hit Cathy and he responds that it was just once.  She had locked him in the flat and came at him with such venom that he swung back and knocked her down.  She came again and again he knocked her down before he found her keys and was able to escape.  Lee is asked why he left her bloodied and he explains that he was only trying to get away and that she didn't seem to be in bad shape...<br /><br />But things are not as they seem at first.  And so begin two streams of time in the book as the story unfolds.  One stream of time takes place long before the event that led to the court hearing, back to when Cathy met Lee and how it was all wonderful at first but how he changed.  Things begin to fall apart as the abuse, first mental and then physical, begins.  The other stream of time occurs years in the future after the event occurred as Cathy who now has OCD is trying to get hold of her life again.  The author flips back and forth in time, chapter by chapter.  The reader knows that something horrible will happen and has happened, depending on the chapter.  The suspense builds in both streams of time and things begin to happen to Cathy in both streams of time.<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner is a disturbing story that is well written.  Cathy and the other characters are all well developed.  We get to know Cathy both as she was but more importantly as the person she became because one can empathize with her.  The author describes the abusive relationship and the effects of the OCD in believable detail.  The buildup of the suspense is very well done.  The reader looks at what is happening from the outside and wills Cathy to get away, but she cant.  Lee has such an strong hold over her both in the past and the future.  I found that as the story from the past got closer to the event from the courtroom, I really wished that the author wouldn't describe what was about to happen in detail.  But when it came, it wasn't as detailed as I dreaded although it was still gruesome.<br /><br />As far as criticisms go, I did find myself annoyed when Cathy who has had OCD suddenly begins to get control of it just when the compulsion to check that doors are locked would have served her well.  Also, once the events begin to unfold for Cathy, things do become a bit predictable, but the story remains riveting throughout.<br /><br />As Into the Darkest Corner is a disturbing story about domestic abuse and the effects of the abuse it wont be to everyone's tastes.  But, it certainly is a riveting read and I recommend it.

0307341577|2.0|I'm shocked DARK PLACES is getting such great reviews! I read \\"Sharp Objects\\" and was thrilled when she wrote another book. However, due to the really obvious foreshadowing in the beginning of the book, I had the story solved instantly. I still read the rest of the book to get the gory twists and turns, but I was let down. Some of the plot twists seemed unnecessary and trivial. I recommend skipping this one and going straight to \\"Gone Girl\\".

B0044KU7EQ|5.0|Unlike the poster before me, I am not new to the Blues.  I began to lose interest in most other music in the late 60s and have focused on the Blues ever since.  In spite of my decades of purchases, there still are included here a handful of artists I was unaware of and several more whose names I was familiar with but not their music, particularly in the pre-WWII material, which is most of this set.  So even if your experience with the Blues, like mine, has spanned about 45 years (and the last 25 doing a local Blues radio show), you should find more than ample new material to justify the cost of this set.  I paid about $55 and I see now it ships for ten dollars more.  Mine came from Germany in a little over a week, faster than anticipated.<br /><br />Admittedly, the packaging is cumbersome, but a recipe box would likely remedy that, and a good, reasonably priced Blues guide (an essential part of a growing collection, anyway) like All Music or Penguin would provide the artists' backgrounds omitted from this set.  I do wish they had given some sort of individual recording dates and personnel listings, although much of that can be determined from other sources.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|I borrowed this book from lendle.me, and I am grateful through and through that I didn't waste a dime of my money on it. After the wild (and completely unwarranted, but that is another review all together) success of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, another Twilight fanfiction author decided to try her hand at self-publication. I know this because I read quite a bit of fanfiction and not 20 pages into Beautiful Disaster I said to myself, \\"Why does this book seem SO familiar?\\" I changed the characters names in my head to all of the characters from Twilight, and there it was--I've read it before. She didn't even change the original title, this was a fanfiction that she pulled and decided to publish. No issues there--I think more authors should self-publish, there are some amazing writers on fanfiction.net. Jamie McGuire, however, is NOT one of them!<br /><br />I only made it half-way through this book. As far as some of the critiques saying that since it is FICTION it should be able to have whatever kind of ridiculous characters that the author can dream up, I disagree. I love fiction, and I love romance novels, but there has to be some believability to the characters! Abby was just awful, there was not one consistent trait to her personality. What kind of person MOVES IN with a man she doesn't know on a bet? An idiot, that's who. Travis was violent and disrespectful. Beating someone to a pulp because they LOOK at your girlfriend the wrong way? Completely unrealistic. The entire college atmosphere was ridiculous and unreal, and I just couldn't get past it.<br /><br />I deleted this from my Kindle and trying to suffer through it because of the great reviews. All it left me remembering was why I never followed the author the first time around--she isn't a great writer. Plain and simple.

Hillerman books (very short) and some Le Carre recently, and it occurred to me that if J.A. was writing today, she would be a great mystery writer. One \\"struggles\\" to decipher who, where, and when. This is much more than a comedy of manners. Holmes would have been baffled by the twists and turns, the hints and allusions; and that is what made it so difficult to put this novel down. A \\"whodunit\\", if ever there was one. This was a much smoother reading experience than P&P which has a more intense love story. Girl gets boy makes fun reading.

B000046PVN|4.0|This is a \\"10\\"-star production with a slight dissapointing issue: the sound. I know this is originally 1978, pre-digital, but many, many analog recordings from before have been remastered beautifully and carry lots of juice. And it is a pity, because Rhino went all the way to produce an item that is super-complete, well anotated and truly beautiful. Now: the sound is not bad, it carries a good bass punch and is very listenable, but having experienced so many recordings from after or before, you get a feeling this is NOT the last word on how the remastering can go. Given that it was produced around the year 2000, you wonder further. To be more specific: it is a bit constricted and, overall, unrefined. You kind of know \\"there is more there\\".<br />The caveat did not dissapoint me on my purchase, given the collectable nature of the release, but still, sometimes I wonder whether greedy companies do not pull all the stops so they can further remaster it down the road and make more money out of suckers like me who will fall for it and buy it yet again; as any John Williams fan would.<br />Curiousity: did composer of \\"Deep Space Nice\\", Dennis McCarthy (b.1945-), paid tribute to the master John Williams with that beautiful and noble theme? If you hear \\"Krypton\\" here, you might think so!
B00005QAPK|5.0|Histoires extraordinaires (Vadim/Malle/Fellini, 1968, 121')<br /><br />I have just discussed Boccaccio '70 on amazon uk, a 1962 Italian episode film, so it seems appropriate to treat a similar product next: Histoires extraordinaires (1968), dubbed Tre Passi Nel Delirio for Italian and Spirits of the dead for English. The English language version features narration by Vincent Price. The movie contains three stories by Edgar Allan Poe, as directed by European directors Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini, and distributed by American International Pictures. Jane Fonda, Alain Delon, Peter Fonda, Brigitte Bardot, and Terence Stamp are the stars.<br /><br />The film received a mixed critical reception, with the Fellini episode widely regarded as the best of the three. Reviewing the picture under its English language title Spirits of the Dead, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that \\"Toby Dammit, the first new Fellini to be seen here since Juliet of the Spirits in 1965, is marvelous: a short movie but a major one. The Vadim is as overdecorated and shrill as a drag ball, but still quite fun, and the Malle, based on one of Poe's best stories, is simply tedious.\\"<br /><br />I fully agree: The first two episodes - Metzengerstein and  William Wilson - are not really worth discussing any further, especially since Fellini's Toby Dammit, with an extraordinary performance by Terence Stamp, is so far superior. In 2008, Toby Dammit was separately restored under the personal supervision of its renowned cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno. A new 35mm print was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it was widely acclaimed by the press as a lost Fellini masterpiece. The episode features music of Nino Rota and \\"Ruby\\" by Ray Charles, and is 37 minutes long.<br /><br />The story has autobiographical elements: Former Shakespearean actor Toby Dammit is losing his acting career to alcoholism. He agrees to work on a film, to be shot in Rome, for which he will be paid with a Ferrari. The film is actually the first Western by the Catholic Church, so we are clearly on Fellini territory. After helping a little girl find her lost ball, Dammit begins to have unexpected visions of the girl (whom he has earlier identified, in a TV interview, as his idea of the Devil).<br /><br />Once given his Ferrari at a movie awards ceremony, Dammit, drunk, races around the city. Workers try to stop him at a collapsed bridge across a ravine, but intoxicated by a vision of the little girl, he chooses to make the mad attempt to drive across the ravine. Irrespective of whether his car reaches the other side, Dammit is decapitated by a thick wire stretched before the ravine on the other side.<br /><br />106 - Histoires extraordinaires (Vadim/Malle/Fellini, 1968, 121') - 12/7/2012'Ferrari.

B0084BM7GW|4.0|This set includes the Blu-ray, DVD and Audio CD. The discs are the same as those that you can buy individually. If you buy them individually, you would save money. What makes this set 'Deluxe' is you get is a slip case holding a fold out sleeve that will store your three discs, along with a booklet with the credits and some nice B/W stage photography. The packaging is slick, bit is that worth the extra premium over individual discs? That is up to you.<br /><br />Now that that is out of the way, let's move on to the review!<br /><br />Upside, the performance is great, the band was on their game. There is just enough by way of extra video effects to keep it visually interesting. However, because of that don't expect the video to look like the direct to HD shows that are on Palladia, as you will be disappointed. Downside, the editing is a little weird at times with slo-mo shots transitioning back to actual speed. B/W and back to color. Couple those with audience shots at what seems like the 'wrong' times. If someone with more knowledge of the band, and the way the band and audience interact during shows was in the edit suite, we could have had a better visual experience. For example, a few of Simon's stage gestures are lost when the camera is off of him, a view of the crowd's faces yelling 'Switch it off' during Planet Earth was absent, etc. I'm just glad this release was not the David Lynch 'Mayan' show. That was artsy to the point of getting in the way of the performance.<br /><br />The audio mix is good for the video. Just enough reverb of the arena sound was captured to give you that live feeling, however, the mix seems a little off for the CD, it sounds a little softened, not very dynamic, almost out-of-phase at times.<br /><br />How did I get to 4 stars? Packaging 5/5, Blu-ray 4/5, DVD 4/5, CD 3/5.

B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran's \\"+\\" is a stunning set, filled with melodic gems.  \\"Drunk\\" bubbles with Ed's shotgun lyrics faster than a bullet.  \\"U.N.I.\\" (you and I) has a similar shotgun lyric and then slows down on the chorus.  One wonders how he remembers the lyric like, \\"And I don't get waves of missing you anymore, they're more like tsunami tides in my eyes.\\"  \\"This\\" is a gorgeous slow song with Ed's high pitched voice as fragile as it is gentle, \\"You are the earth that I will stand upon, You are the words I will sing.\\"  \\"The City\\" sparks my auditory imagination with Sheeran's electric guitar stabbing like a cattle prod into the light & bubbly melody.  \\"Lego House\\" has his clipped lyrical delivery that magnifies the energy, \\"I'm out of touch, I'm out of love, I'll pick you up when you're getting down.\\"  \\"Kiss Me\\" marries a gorgeous romantic melody with Ed's quivering passionate vocals, \\"I was made to keep your body warm, but I'm as cold as the wind blows.\\"  With six of the 12 tracks being exquisite and the rest of the set also strong, this is an amazing set.  Enjoy!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I purchased this book because all my girlfriends were talking about it. I really enjoyed the story/plot of the trilogy but the 'playroom' and sex scenes got a little bit much; the author could have cut out a lot of the sex in the books as she did not need that. I am not a prude, but I skipped over the sex parts eventually as I was keen to see how Christian blossomed into a 'normal', loving man. Overall a very good read. I could not put them down.

B0029LHWFO|1.0|This book really deserves zero stars. This book, along with the Audacity of Hope, should have given a fair warning to the American people about Barack Hussein Obama's far-left agenda. Sadly, though, it was ignored and with the help of the far-left media we got this radical elected. You asked for it, America, and you got it. Read this book and you will clearly see his communist and racist agenda for our nation. Next time, before you get wrapped up into \\"YES WE CAN!\\", do your homework, America! Romney in 2012! He's not the best, but he is the only hope this country has for this year. We must fire Barack Hussein Obama. And Amazon, don't you even think about deleting this review like you did for my review for the Audacity of Hope. This is relevant for the book and you've already made enough left-wing political statements to the public.
B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Austen's first published novel, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", has lost none of its charm and ability to entertain over the years.  Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are thrown on hard times by the death of their father.  Living in straitened circumstances in a tiny country cottage, their prospects for marriage are set at risk in an age in which a young woman's first job was to find a good husband.  The two sisters will pursue much different methods in searching for a suitable man.  The sensible Elinor exercises almost superhuman patience in waiting for the man of her choice to make the right choice, while her emotional sister will throw herself into an impulsive love affair.  Their lives will be further complicated by the well-meaning and often humorous interference of friends and relatives.<br /><br />Austen's talent for ingenuous plotting and excellent dialogue carry a superb story to a most interesting conclusion with an ambiguous moral that fans are still arguing about.  For fans of Jane Austen, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth reading again; for new readers, find out what you missed; highly recommended.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|The first book at least offered something outside of the ordinary romance novel, this one was just plain; plain sex, plain plot, plain character development, just plain vanilla. Not to mention that our darling protagonist is really Bella swan in disguise. so maybe i'm a little twisted myself but I was hoping the playroom would at least have one more scene
B0086700CM|5.0|your mind will be blown when you buy this game because it is crazily awesome and so so fun you will be very happy if you get this game because it is so fun and it is free!
0345803485|3.0|It was just alright, the romance is the same as it is in every other romance novel, the sex while raunchy wasn't as raunchy as others I've read, and the plot had a lot of promise but it didn't go into it enough, and the writing style was weak and quite repetitive.<br />So now that I have finished my critique. If you read it for the romance you should read any Kathleen Woodiwiss novel same amount of romance but well written, if you read it for the sex read Panic Snap also an S and M theme but great plot and some of the things they do together will make you blush, and if you read it for the plot you could pick up just about any book and get as good of a plot.<br />In my opinion the people who are giving this book rave reviews are people who don't read very often and as such don't recognize the poor writing.
B0086DBE62|2.0|I was disappointed by almost everything in this movie. I couldn't watch past the first 45 minutes, the script was lame. The attempted humor fell flat. This had all the elements to make it a much better movie, and didn't take advantage of any of them. Sorry I paid for this one.

B0036EH3XE|2.0|I was a huge fan of LOST. I managed to avoid watching the episodes when first aired in order to enjoy each season in a LOST-binging weekend, when the DVDs were released.

I continued to watch LOST because of the paranormal mysteries that were hinted of having very normal explanations. Well, maybe not normal but at least logical. What was the Black Smoke? Why is Ben so important? Do the dead resurrect on the Island like Jack's father or dead means dead, like Ben's daughter? Why can it there be no children getting born on the Island? What do the Numbers mean? How was Lock able to walk again and why did he have to die at the end? Why did the statue have four fingers? And what about the polar bears, the one on the island and the other fossilized with a Dharma collar in ancient Egyptian ruins.<br /><br />As it turns out, the creators of the series had no clue whatsoever. They kept throwing PostIts with ancient, urban and and religious mythology on the board and THEN they tried to mold the resulting pulp of ideas into a narrative. This way, something was bound to catch your interest every week. Yet, they had no idea where the story was going. Not even at the end. Well, especially at the end.<br /><br />The problem with Season 6 of LOST was that, during the previous seasons, it had hooked us with so many lines that we expected either a fish or at least some uneaten bait at the end of them. Most of these lines simply ended, never to be picked up ever again.<br /><br />No deeper meaning. No logical explanation that can tie around everything.

I continued to watch LOST because of the paranormal mysteries that were hinted of having very normal explanations. Well, maybe not normal but at least logical. What was the Black Smoke? Why is Ben so important? Do the dead resurrect on the Island like Jack's father or dead means dead, like Ben's daughter? Why can it there be no children getting born on the Island? What do the Numbers mean? How was Lock able to walk again and why did he have to die at the end? Why did the statue have four fingers? And what about the polar bears, the one on the island and the other fossilized with a Dharma collar in ancient Egyptian ruins.<br /><br />As it turns out, the creators of the series had no clue whatsoever. They kept throwing PostIts with ancient, urban and and religious mythology on the board and THEN they tried to mold the resulting pulp of ideas into a narrative. This way, something was bound to catch your interest every week. Yet, they had no idea where the story was going. Not even at the end. Well, especially at the end.<br /><br />I gave the series an extra star because of the very intriguing and absorbing seasons 1 through 5. The problem with Season 6 of LOST was that, during the previous seasons, it had hooked us with so many lines that we expected either a fish or at least some uneaten bait at the end of them. Most of these lines simply ended, never to be picked up ever again.<br /><br />No deeper meaning. No logical explanation that can tie around everything. Just a luminous steampunk spring that \\"is important\\".<br /><br />I could not put it in words until I came across Jonathan McCalmont's Blog, Ruthless Culture: LOST was nothing but CalvinBall. An imaginary game whose rules are made up as we play along. No one keeps score, no one plans ahead, no one wins.<br /><br />I did not expect the creators of LOST to provide serious answers to life's cardinal questions.<br />I did expect them to answer their own d@mn questions, though!important\\".<br /><br />I could not put it in words until I came across Jonathan McCalmont's Blog, Ruthless Culture: LOST was nothing but CalvinBall.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because it is extremely additive.  Everyone I know loves and is addicted to this game.I love it.
B005T87QCI|3.0|this game is awesome but it is to short I would like to give it 5 stars but just cant it is not worth the one dollar now if it was free I would say GET IT but its not soooooooo anyway beat this game in abhor 30 to 45 minutes after download.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book. Simple like that. Loved it!!! Grey is .. everything (and more). Go for it. You won´t regret.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Crashes frequently and unpredictably on Galaxy Nexus. Also cannot update to newer versions, as it is a Wi-Fi only download (even though it isn't that big) and my phone's ability to connect to Wi-Fi got damaged at some point.
1400082773|4.0|One question before I buy this book:  Will it contribute to the Obama campaign ( or his agenda to downsize our great country) ?<br /><br />I'd hate to know that I helped him in any way, as he is on a fast track to ruining America, but I'd like to read the book.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|its lucky to even get two stars don't waste ur time way to money but the movie issue gr8 so all u people out there see the amazing spiderman it is better than it looks
0525478817|4.0|This is the kind of book you are self-propelled to read non-stop until you finish.  I want to say I loved it, because there are so many things that are truly gem-like and they give you the wonderful, emotional feeling you sometimes get when you read really great books.<br /><br />But you must be warned that this is a very sad story, with heart-breaking, sobful moments.  To be fair, there are also a lot of positive relationship moments.  Seventeen-year-old Hazel is dying.  She meets Gus, a bone cancer survivor, and they fall in love.  They have an intense courtship and they know they are short on time.<br /><br />I think John Green does a great job portraying Hazel and Gus.  I have heard others say their conversations are too intellectual for teenagers.  I don't think so and I think he really captures the teenage intensity along with their heightened sense of the loss of time.<br /><br />Although the story is written through Hazel's point of view, Green also shows us what it is like to be parents of cancer patients, and how they must prepare themselves for loss.  And he shows how Gus and Hazel cling to each other and their friend Isaac, and try to have normal teenage lives.<br /><br />There are unexpected plot turns and surprising characters, and the story is nicely tied together, with some open endings to keep the reader thinking.  I think the ending is uplifting and makes the best of tough loss.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|I had to view this for an online class. The service worked great. The only negative would be that it wasn't available for viewing for a longer period.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|This album ROCKS! The first track is the best and the rest are definitely worth listening to. This is Kid Rock @ his finest. He really can sing if he tries. That is unlike so many of the contestants on American Idol. The track with TI is very good. It's too bad iTunes won't carry his music. Kid Rock is an artist in every sense of the word. All in all, Kid Rock is definitely gonna be a legend and with an album like this, it's easy to see why.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing was terrible, the relationship was unhealthy, and the characters uninteresting.  Don't waste your money!  There are sexier books without the silly sex scenes and bad dialogue.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|When I got the free version, I thought it was about drawing things. When I found out it wasn't I was disappointed. But, once I played the game, I thought it is ten times better then I imagined! It is addictive and fun!
B00846REIS|1.0|This book makes me ashamed to be a woman. Give me one of those retarded, 80's, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies over this any day. Please spare yourself this abomination, it's so painfully bad I feel like years have been taken off my life.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great way to stayed organized. on to go lists, easy way to take notes. and the best thing is you can access all of it from your computer and any other device you have android on.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|There I am looking for some light reading; something for the upcoming weekend. I come across the reviews for this little tale and I think this might be good... I couldn't put it down. I was up until 3:00am the first night with a 7:00am alarm set. I love when that happens.<br /><br />This is a well crafted story that takes the main characters from boyhood into adulthood. The editing has kept the story moving, made the book hard to put down, and teases the reader with as yet undeveloped story lines. I have found the story, the characters, the setting, and the pace of the story-telling very satisfying.<br /><br />This was like ordering a hamburger for lunch and being serviced a nice juicy steak for the same price. Oh, there are superior stories within this genre, but not at this price, and not by new authors.<br /><br />The only problem is that 7:00am alarm clock<br />.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|Channel Orange is a timeless album. It's a complex album at times. Something you really need to listen to and not just hear. I like it. Bold and refreshing. Different from the norm. Challenges traditional structure and sound. Simply put. One of the best albums I have heard in a very long time.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I loved so many songs on this album. I will definitely be following this artist through her career. Her music is so layered and complex. The instruments work so beautifully together in such a unique and interesting way. It entertains the mind, but still carries your soul to a beautiful place. Wonderful, wonderful album. 5 stars all the way.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I bought this product for a friends birthday.  She loved it as do I.  The product came in a timely manner and in perfect shape.  I would recommend this company to everyone.  I have used them in the past and have always been happy with them.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|I did enjoy this album slightly. It was sort of interesting, maybe, but for the most part I was just waiting for the next song to come on. And then when that one came on, I was waiting for the next one... I liked parts of \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"Next To Me\\" and \\"River\\" but found myself getting bored more often than not while they were playing. There just wasn't a song that struck my soul or fully captured my mind. It was background movie scene music to me; uninteresting and only there to break the silence. I'm sure her music has its place, and her voice is great, but this album was a sub par offering for everyday listening.
044024238X|5.0|I loved this book .. Relaxing ...easy read. Cute characters and a good story. Gave me something to think about.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love the controls the web swinging and the combat a really great game and a good gameplay and story mode
1878424114|5.0|I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the great customer service. The book that was sent was a wonderful read.
B0086700CM|3.0|Played for like 5 minutes and I was done.  The graphics is good.  The game play could be better.  I did not give it a 1 star because it looks like a lot of effort went into this.
0375842209|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and it is glorious.  I wasn't involved right away, but after a few pages, I was engrossed.  The book is very easy to read, despite the serious subject matter.  The details Zusak reveals and highlights, the way he tells the story demonstrates his masterful skill as a storyteller.  Story is narrated by Death, who reveals his fascination with a young girl named Liesel Meminger, who steals a book at her brother's funeral.  She is being sent to live with foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann in Nazi Germany.  Each parent is beautifully sketched, and I especially love the details of the neighbors.  Liesel is an engaging character, as is her best friend, Rudy Steiner.  There were parts that made me breathless, especially the parts of one's ferocious desire to live, the depth of love and devastation of loss, the intimacy of friends, the slow madness of the confined.  Here are people, who did not ask for war, it was forced on them, and they coped the best they could.  It's a beautiful story, which has longevity.  I highly recommend this book.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|I got this app as the free app of the day a while ago and just started playing it. I was enjoying it but it started getting pretty hard so since I got the game for free I decided to buy the weapons upgrades for $1 and now there really isn't a challenge.
B00074CBIS|4.0|this dvd is very funny. i can't stop watching this movie.<br />I RECEIVED IT IN GOOD CONDITION. IT CAME IN REALLY FAST.<br />I RECCOMMEND THIS TO ALL BECAUSE ONE THING, MY GRAND KIDS<br />JUST LOVE IT.  THEY WATCH IT IN THEIR ROOM OVER AND OVER<br />AGAIN. ( I LIKE IT TOO ) FUNNY, FUNNY DVD...............<br /><br />S HUSSEY
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I'm not an expert chef but I sure do feel like it with these.<br /><br />Also, there's less to clean up with these. The handle is heaver than the end of the utensils and has that little wedge that helps keep the business end off the counter.<br /><br />Because of the material they are made up of, I can use them on our new frying pans and all of our other cooking surfaces. I don't worry about scratching anything and I don't feel like they are flimsy at all.<br /><br />The colors are fun, but they don't really add anything to the overall design. Also, they are shaped a little differently than typical utensils, but again it doesn't really add or subtract to the overall design. Just something to get use to.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I think it has BAD service because it's dum and it shued be free for cut the top. the person who made this game is last.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I can't believe all the positive reviews of this movie that I'm reading here at Amazon.<br /><br />As Ellen Ripley said in the second Alien film, \\"Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?\\"<br /><br />This movie is utterly and hopelessly incomprehensible.<br /><br />It's gross to look at, but not the slightest bit scary, basically because there is zero -- ZERO -- character development.  We don't give a fig about the mother here, her bewildered husband, or their adopted daughter.<br /><br />Producers, just because you CAN make a movie based on a survival horror game, it doesn't mean you SHOULD.<br /><br />Lovers of classic horror movies should stay as far away from this stinking pile of poo as the protagonists here should have stayed away from the town of Silent Hill.<br /><br />If your curiosity overwhelms you, Crackle is currently showing the film, interrupted by idiotic candy commercials.<br /><br />Still, taking in a single free commercial-riddled viewing is far preferable to laying out money for this blood-spurting turkey.<br /><br />Or try playing the original video game, which at least was legitimately scary and creepy.<br /><br />What is our world coming to?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My ex purchased this , still not using it but it works super. Hopefully, she will explore more into it.
034580404X|5.0|The best three books I have ever read!!!! Was trying to save them to read at the beach, and simply could not put them down!!! WARNING: BUY ALL THREE BOOKS TOGETHER, IF NOT YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|If you like Star Wars or epic Sci-Fi films, you'll probably like John Carter.  Unfortunately, it is one of the worst marketed films in history.  I didn't even know what the movie was about from the movie poster I saw in the theater.  Did not even know it was a sci-fi... But the effects were great.  Story was pretty decent and the acting overall very good for a sci-fi film.  I didn't think I was going to like it, and was pleasantly surprised.  I saw it in 2D in the theater, and so when the 3D bluray came out, I decided to give it a try, and it is by FAR the best 3D film I have seen on my TV since Avatar.  If you like Sci-Fi...give it a try!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This film was amazing, the cast is superb and the story is completely engrossing. Unlike many films that attempt to delve into the awkwardness of adolescent first loves, Wes Anderson yet again blasts one out of the park, making you feel like a confused love sick teen all over again.  One of the best movies I have seen in years. Another very note worthy aspect of 'Moonrise Kingdom' is that the two child stars are the age they play in the film, no early 20's kids pretending to be young. That being said for two thirteen year olds to act so well was astounding. This film is a must see/must own.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|it's awsome I make a hole in one on every hole. I love it so much I play it every day.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a game for peopel who like advinture, runing, jumping, and constantly watching to see what is going on.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A great book that is about a world that may be here shortly. Regardless of this fact, the book is great. Every character is fully three dimensional and promotes the proper response without overdoing it.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Amazing record! I have been listening to it for three weeks now and the more I listen the more I like it. Don't pay attention to what some critics say... You'll be rewarded if you give it a chance and leave your preconceptions behind.
B0086700CM|5.0|so many people say its so bad it ain't that bad it dose get a little old but I have had it sinew it came out and still play it all the time &lt;3

0345803485|1.0|Unfortunatly I read the reviews after I read the book. While reading, all I could think of is \\"this is a best seller, really?\\". I agree with other reviews this was written for teens. Don't waste your time if you are an intelligent, grown woman.

B0012TWRAO|4.0|I'm using three of these RAM U-bolt mounts on a Trek DS 8.5 hybrid bicycle.  Although the 31.8mm diameter handlebars have a tapered diamater rather than a fixed diameter, I was able to tighten this mount down securely with no problem by using the smaller of the two U-bolts.  The larger 1.5&#34; U-bolt also fit nicely over the fattest 31.8mm section of the handlebars.  The V notch on the bottom of the mount combined with the U-bolt allows easy tightening against a round surface with increasing diamater.  I use it to hold a Garmin Oregon 450, a Samsung Galaxy Player WiFi 5.0, and a flashlight/headlight.  I appreciate that the U-bolts I received in this kit are painted black:  The black hardware blends better with my black handlebars.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of RAM products in the ball-and-socket joint.  Once you tighten it down, it stays put.  However, there's still a little bit of flex in the rubber balls so that whole setup absorbs some shock.  I appreciate that on my mountain bike.<br /><br />The kit includes (see additional uploaded picture):<br /><br />The aluminum mount with 1&#34; rubber ball<br />2 black U-bolts--a smaller 1&#34; width one and a larger 1.5&#34; width<br />2 nuts with nylon friction inserts<br />2 rubber nubs to cover the U-bolt ends<br />1 plastic adapter insert to narrow the U-bolt down for use on handlebars as small as 1/2&#34; in diameter<br /><br />Be careful with part numbers.  RAM-B-231Z items seem to have multiple configurations on RAM's website.  Some hardware is zinc coated, some is stainless steel, and some is black powder coated.  I ordered RAM-B-231ZU from Amazon retailer GPSCheap and received the parts as indicated above.  I ordered another RAM-B-231ZU from GPSCity and received the zinc coated 1&#34; U-bolt only.<br /><br />The rubber nubs were too loose to use in my application, partly because their inner diameter is too large and partly because I didn't have enough of the U-bolts exposed for them to be very useful or secure.  Also, the kit does not come with washers (-1 star) and you'll likely scratch the mount with the nuts as you tighten if you don't add your own washers.  I added washers in order to protect the mount.  Be cautious when installing:  If you're metal against metal, you may cause some scratching with the U-bolt as you position it.or secure.

B008602KQI|2.0|For the record - I am a HUGE Hunger Games fan and have been of the books for over 2 years. Please do not read this as a rant, but rather a fans opinion.<br /><br />This movie is garbage in the representation of the books. It was created specifically with Twilight fan-girls in mind. The first chunk of the movie is very, very slow and does not explain anything well. If you did not read the book (or books, actually, as the movie jumps a bit ahead on features), I cannot see something really understanding what is going on. At the very least, the true meaning from the book is lost.<br /><br />\\"HEY! Movies can't be exactly like the books!\\" you may say. Yes, I agree with this but to a point. The books revolve around the main fact: the Capital forces two children from each district to brutally murder each other to survive. The film makers took this and decided - for the young children audience - that the kids would fluff each other to death. Deaths magically become fuzzy or shaky, with music or odd sound overlayed to the scene.<br /><br />I went to see this movie opening night at a nice theater - it cost me about $20 a reserved seat which I purchased first available day. It was packed 90% with teenage girls who screamed over the barely-there deaths and gasped out loud over the kiss which, if you read the book, is not a \\"real\\" kiss. Before the movie 12 year old girls were running around yelling \\"TEAM PEETA!\\".<br /><br />Greed took advantage of what had amazing potential. Money was the key factor - young girls will be running out to buy the \\"team\\" shirts and action figure toys. A rated R movie would have been true to the story, but would generate a mere fraction in sales.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|I've been using RAM products for about 10 years.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of their components.  I am currently using three of these standard length arms on my bicycle to hold a RAM universal cradle for a Samsung Galaxy Player WiFi 5.0, a Garmin Oregon 450 GPS, and a Fenix flashlight (using [[ASIN:B003OTYZN2 UNPK RAM BASE FOR 3/4\\" TO 1\\" DIA. RAILS]]).  I like using RAM mounts for two reasons.  First, they are solid, heavy duty, and stay put once you tighten them--even when bouncing around on a mountain bike.<br /><br />Second, the rubber balls provide a touch of flex in the mount to absorb shock while riding.  I used the long RAM arm ([[ASIN:B000WJA5ZY RAM Mount Long Double Socket Arm f/1\\" Ball Bases]]) on my Kawasaki Concours motorcycle for a few years.  While it raised the GPS to a point where I could see it easier, I felt that the long arm allowed just a little bit too much flex and made it more difficult to read the screen while riding.  The long arm is now in use in my car to hold the SGP5 where it isn't subject to as much vibration.  Arm length is a balance between stiffness and shock absorption.  The shorter RAM arms will be very stiff and not provide as much shock absorption (which, admittedly, is just a beneficial by-product of the design).  The longer arm can move more and absorb more shock, but that also means your device will move around more in rough environments.<br /><br />The paint is thick and resilient.  Of the many RAM arms I own (probably about 6), I've only experienced paint chipping on one over the past 10 years.  A 1/4\\" fleck of paint chipped off of the inside of the arm where the ball would touch:  It did not affect performance.  I've also used this arm on my motorcycle since 2002 and it is unaffected by the weather.  The hardware is also sturdy.  It is quite possible to tighten the mechanism down so tightly that the arm will leave temporary impressions in the rubber mounting balls.  No stripping, no backing out.<br /><br />The standard length arm allows me to extend my electronics forward of the handlebars just a bit so that it's easier for me to look down and see them.<br /><br />Two of my favorite places online to check for good prices on RAM products are GSPCheap and GPSCity.The standard length arm allows me to extend my electronics forward of the handlebars just a bit so that it's easier for me to look down and see them.<br /><br />Two of my favorite places online to check for good prices on RAM products are GSPCheap and GPSCity.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|A good single watch - don't absolutely regret watching it, but not rushing to see it again. The story is difficult to follow, so you watch it knowing the basic plot of: the plane crashed, they need to find a way to safety, and ravenous wolves are trying to eat them.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is slow and you'll find yourself feeling it should be almost over throughout many points in the movie. If you don't take it too seriously and can stand a slower pace, it is a decent movie.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Most of these songs are well written Beach Boys songs, and the harmonies are great. However, the autotune ruins parts of it. For example, listen to the beginning vocals on \\"Isn't It Time.\\" Autotune everywhere. I wish the producers/engineers of this album would show the Beach Boys some respect, because they do not need tuning at all. Just see them live... This is the perfect example of how record companies abuse modern technology.<br /><br />Production aside, this is a very good album. You will love this if you like any of the Beach Boys original stuff. The three song suite at the end is brilliant.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I have loved Frank Ocean since I heard about him about two years ago.  When I found out the date that this album came out I was freaking out and I knew it would be the Album of the year.  He is my favorite artist and none of my friends like him so I can rub it in their faces that his debut album has been at #1 on the iTunes charts for the third straight day.  This album gave me chills the first time I heard it because of how deep it was and how it was just so good.  It's better than Nostalgia Ultra and that is hard to top.  I think anyone with ears should get this/
B00005RIKD|5.0|My husband and I rented an apartment in Tuscany in May.  We never listened too much to music by \\"Sting\\", but since there was a very nice stereo in the apartment, we put on the CD.

0345803485|3.0|Received my copy promptly and it was a used copy but looked absolutely brand new.  With all the hoopla over this trilogy, it was not a page turner for me.  My local library has it but the holds for this title exceed 1500.  So that is why I ordered it from Amazon.  I will read the remaining two and have already placed the next title on hold using my Kindle, which I absolutely love too!<br />This book did not offend me at all, but it might for some people. I also don't think that this book is for anyone under the age of 18 due to the language and graphic nature of the book.
0345803485|5.0|Everyone has there own opinion to this book and the series, I honestly liked the love story behind all of the \\"shades of grey\\". If you are someone new to these kind of books you will seriously be alarmed by the way the book is written but by the ending I can promise you it will leave you wanting more...I should know I'm already on book three :)
B006Z9K97E|4.0|Escape from Camp 14 tells the incredible story of a young North Korean man who boldly and narrowly escaped from the total control labor camp where he was born and raised. Shin Dong-hyuk's startlingly account presents the world with an almost unbelievable yet remarkably honest story starting with his heart-wrenching upbringing to his immigration to the States. Former Washington Post correspondent Blaine Harden captures a truly unique testimony hammered out from Shin's own 2007 Korean-language memoir and numerous personal interviews with Shin and other refugees. The spark that motivated Shin's desire to leave his torturous, yet only, home might surprise you.<br /><br />The story begins with Shin's subjection to torture and subsequent witness of the deaths of his mother and older brother. Gruesome, it aptly sets the mood for the unspeakable life he lived behind the walls and electrified fence that lined the camp. It's precisely his blood relation to known defectors during the Korean War that borne him from an arranged reward marriage from a sort of \\"original sin\\" stained couple serving in the camp. This coupling, though, precluded Shin from ever being capable of any real redemption. Having born and reared within the confines of the camp and minimally educated at the guard-run school, the ideological brain-washing that the rest of the North Korean population experienced in primary school was curiously absent and instead replaced with sometimes fatal capital punishment and unquestionable subordinated obedience. Because Shin had no outside comparison to his desolate reality, he lived life largely without ever wanting to leave. More sickening, though, was the daily routine of physical beatings, fear-inducing rule enforcement, and constant murder and rape that he witnessed and accepted as commonplace.<br /><br />When one combines a sheltered mockery of education, a total lack of media (both state-run and international) and an brutally oppressive guard force fostering competition amongst prisoners, this almost powder-keg environment was a proving ground for mindless physical labor and unwavering fear. Shin's revelation of knowledge of a life outside the labor came not from a distant relative, nor a smuggler, radio broadcast or even a religious leader. He heard a rumor of a land were meat was grilled, varied and plentiful. Though he didn't know where this fabled country was, constant hunger drove him to try his luck elsewhere. He is one of the few successful refugees who did not procure escape through a broker. What happened when he gained access outside of the camp is even more extraordinary.<br /><br />Shin's story is amazing, simply put. The book is incredibly moving and unsentimentally objective. A possible weakness in the narrative is that the book is limited to Shin's own experience whereas Barbara Demick's Nothing to Envy charts several diverse stories at once; Shin's experience was not typical of most North Korean refugees. This is hardly a knock at Harden's book as it proudly stands as a brilliant account of the world's most despicable regime's nightmare of a labor camp. Graphic at times but always moving, pay heed to these atrocities by at least hearing him out. Shin's is an original story that deserves your attention. You won't soon forget it.
B0085KGHI6|4.0|This has been circulating among bootleg collectors for years, and finally we get a \\"first gen\\" copy of the complete show with remastered sound. Having seen this before there aren't any surprises. There are a few caveats. Sometimes the video quality is not the best, and sometimes it's spectacular. The performances are very loose and at times chaotic, as musicians jump on and off the low stage with tables right up to the edge. And other times the music is as tight and brilliant as the blues can be. When the Stones show up and begin jamming, the band picks it up a notch, especially the rhythm section that does a fantastic job keeping this from becoming completely out of control. Muddy is not in good health at this time in  his life (he passes away two years after this show), and he spends most of the show sitting on a stool on stage. But when the band rips into Mannish Boy, Muddy can't keep his seat. He's up and jumping like he's a  young man again, and we see a glimpse of the power and majesty that the man possessed. During part of the show, Mick and Muddy take a seat to allow Jr. Wells (not bad, he should play the harmonica more), Buddy Guy (always a treat), and a drunken Lefty Dizz take turns at center stage. Yes, Dizz is drunk, and ends his feature song standing at the edge of the stage, flailing his arms around, saying or singing something to the audience without a microphone. You can't hear what he's saying but the band and the audience's reactions range from amusement to horror. Wells has to take the stage and literally push Dizz off stage. But it's great that whole sequence is included to give you the complete feel of the evening. No, it doesn't really cast a pall on the rest of the show by any means. It's just comic relief. The very best part of the whole video is the guitar playing and solos from Wood, Richards, Waters, Guy, and the guitarists in Muddy's band ain't shabby either. It really looks like it was a fun evening and one that the members of the audience probably are still talking about to this day. I am not a big fan of concert videos, but this one is fun to watch.<br /><br />The bonus features are cuts from the Hampton 1981 PPV and are nice to have, but again this has been circulating for years. The DVD does not include the whole show, and the songs are edited to take out the dead spots when musicians are going on stage and strapping on a guitar in the middle of the song. Be grateful the whole show isn't on the CD; trust me on that.ce probably are still talking about to this day.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|great game. very addicting. it has a Sims or farmville feel to it. I wouldn't recomend letting young children play unsupervised though because there is the option to buy coins with real money using your amazon account. using real money is definitely not needed for it to be fun though!

B005LAII1C|5.0|Keeping this short - this movie was great on many levels.  It was dead-on Boston accents, regional humor, while also appealing to comedy lovers in general!  Growing up in MA, and living/working in Boston for years - this movie is personal to me - but what a funny premise, great use of CG, and frankly great characters throughout the film.  This is on my must-buy list when it comes out!  Instantly a classic comedy in my opinion.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|There are a lot of cheap USB vinyl players and some really expensive ones. But the PS-LX300USB is worth every cent you spend on it! Beautiful sound reproduction and lossless recording. It brought a tear to my dad's eye to head all his old LPs still pitch perfect. But well. nothing can beat LPs for the sound and durability.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Great sound.  Good ole Beach Boys music.  My husband grew up with all that rock-n-roll and really enjoyed the nostalgia and the newness.  Ordered it with Amazon Prime it arrived even ahead of schedule.  Awesome service from Amazon.
B0088TG252|3.0|Very disappointed with this movie.  Denzel (Tobin Frost) was once more good at playing a shady character full of secrets secrets and more secrets.  But he was really the only interesting character through the whole movie.  There is the cliche CIA intrigue, good versus bad, agents with double motives.  Sadly it was all a little too cliche.  If you've seen the Bourne movies and have watched other spy movies then sadly you have seen Safe House.  It doesn't stand out in the genre as I had hoped it would. In fact it fall short of anything.<br /><br />If I had to give a suggestion to anyone if you like Denzel you will like his character in this but the rest of the cast falls short by a mile.  And most importantly don't waste your money buying it because as said before if you own the Bourne trilogy you definitely don't need this on your shelf.  But if you just need a movie to rent and want to watch a movie with a bit of intrigue and tons of action (shooting, fist fighting, running on roofs, etc.) then by all means rent it watch it and forget about it.<br /><br />Three stars just because Denzel Washington saved this movie from being a complete and total waste of time.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Loved it, wish there were more than 3 books. The start was a little slow for me but it soon picked up. Very happy

B0058YPG2K|5.0|Breaking Bad was a show that may have started out with a little bit of a slow burn in the first episode or two, but picked up very quickly to be a must see program.  Season four was an incredible run in the ascension of Walter White's journey from disenchanted chemistry teacher towards evil drug kingpin.<br /><br />I won't rehash everything, but suffice to say that the build up to and eventual show down with gus marked a major milestone in the show.<br /><br />The Bluray set includes a lot of great extra material including fantastic commentary tracks, a ton of cool extra material and some great behind the scenes footage on the making of the show.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of breaking bad and want to have the show in your collection to rewatch at some future date of your choosing, you won't regret spending the extra money for the Blu Ray set.
0547569653|4.0|I first learned of the great Scott Jurek while reading the amazing book Born to Run. I'm a runner and was intrigued when I read about Scott's intense competitiveness, his ultramarathon wins, and the fact that he waits at the finish line of each race for hours on end greeting his competition at the finish line. His ultramarathon successes coupled with great sportsmanship interested me a lot; so I was very happy to see that he had written Eat & Run about his life's journey! This autobiography is extremely candid, thought provoking, and well written. Scott covers everything from his childhood in Minnesota to the start of his running career and his surprising shift from a hunter & fisherman (and avid McDonald's eater) into a Vegan. No stone is left unturned in his story and it's fascinating from start to finish. At the conclusion of the book I felt like I had not only learned about what makes Scott tick, but also came away with some of his wisdom and a want to change some of the unhealthy eating lifestyle my husband and I indulge in. I think that is the esence of a truly exceptional book- when it moves you to be entertained, think and take action in your own life- you know it's good!
B005WFPAU8|4.0|Hi, I'm a Final Destination fan.  I looooove these movies.<br /><br />(Spoiler) Final Destination 5 was a sneak prequel.<br /><br />I read a lot of people complaining that they felt it was a cash grab and that the movie shuld not have been made, etc.  Look, these are my idea of fun popcorn horror clicks with clever mousetrap death sequences that are fun to wathc and always a surprise.  If you are going into a FD movie expecting horror-shakespeare.... well I don' tthink anything can help that.<br /><br />FD5 definitely adhered to their standard formula, hero has premonition, saves some friends/acquantances, they start dying in weird and fun ways, they figure it out, try to cheat death, ultimately fail.... credits.  There's nothing wrong with that, if the movie is shot well, the characters are interesting and the deaths are fun to watch.  I thought as a Final Destination fan that this was another fun romp in their weird little world, but be forewarned, if you were looking for something new or different you aren't going to find a lot of innovation in this one.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Just bought a copy of this incredible album released by the legendary canadian power trio RUSH. It was with great pleasure that I saw our Brazilian edition bringing the lyrics and a very good artwork (the same as the imported CD's). About the band, these guys are playing better and better, year after year. Solid Rock and Roll, as usual. My favourite track? # 9 \\"Headlong Flight\\". Same style as \\"Snakes And Arrows\\", which, for me, is more than enough.
0345803485|2.0|I think this book is utterly stupid because it's just your cliche romance novel with confusing (Christian grey Popsicle. Genius!) ways of explaining sex.  I would have given it one star, but I have to admit.....to my dismay.....that it's an addicting read and you will want to find out what happens between the Submissive and the Dominant.  (ughh)

1439127700|5.0|I read this on my Kindle and really was surprised that this book was not one sided. I learned a lot about the \\"Club\\" and gained respect for even presidents I really did not agree with.  I highly recommend this book for anyone that likes history. I found myself making time to read even more.
B002RHL8DC|4.0|I gave this series a second chance recently and started with the 1st episode and was immediately drawn in. The writing, acting, character and story development and special effects are excellent. Plus I found it more realistic and less campy than the other SG 2 series, both of which I also enjoyed for different reasons. I especially like the theme of a group of people unprepared for where they wind up and having to make the best of it as they muddle through.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked that it is not a family friendly show. Depending on how old your kids are that is true. I wouldn't show it to anyone under 12. But for teens and adults I think it would be very enjoyable especially if you liked the intensity of Battlestar Gallactica.<br /><br />I would love to see a movie version continuing where the series left off.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A very well written thriller, but the ending killed the whole book. I was very disappointed in the last 1/4 of the book, it really took a lot for me to finish it.
B00005A1PR|3.0|The only mistake India made was coming out around the same time as Alicia Keys. That's the only reason why she didn't win a grammy for this album and still remains underrated as far as neo soul goes.<br /><br />I brought this album when it first came out and I'm happy I did. All of the songs have a positive feel to them. No cussing and real lyrics that make sense. Some songs are about self love (Video, Strength, Courage, and Wisdom) and some are about new love (Ready For Love, Always In My Head). My favorites are Beautiful, Nature and Wonderful. India's voice sounds good over the soft beats.<br /><br />Overall this is India's best work to date

0393088774|1.0|I am a voracious reader of economics, finance, and politics. What I love about Paul Krugman, is that he forges ahead despite fully comprehending the subject matter.<br /><br />While the book was interesting to read and the language and narrative were very entertaining, he clearly does not understand the field of global economics beyond his own Keynesian myopic view.<br /><br />If you are looking to affirm your beliefs in consumer-side macroeconomic policy, then there is plenty of cool-aid under the cover. However, if you are looking for ideas based in reality, I suggest looking elsewhere.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I'm chiming in here because Book 4 left die-hard fans so disappointed.<br /><br />Book 4 definitely isn't the same quality as the previous books.  (I think he hit his stride in Book 3: more sex, skillful build up of tension.)  Many of the chapters written from the point of view of the minor characters read like back story that never should have been published.  It's necessary for the author to write that back story to convincingly create such a complex, engaging world, but it doesn't advance the plot and it doesn't belong in the book.<br /><br />As a result, Book 4 lacks the delicious tension present in the previous books.  That is, until the multiple cliffhanger endings which resolve NOTHING.  It's frustrating for the reader and comes off like a cheesy sales tactic to get us to buy the next book.  Whether it was a deliberate strategy to sell more books or not, it's likely that this will work for fans who've been hanging on to every word.<br /><br />Reading from Cersei's point of view might have been tolerable for a few chapters, but as she dominates the book it's hard to stomach.  She's a relentlessly repulsive, conniving character without the tiniest redeeming quality, and being immersed in her cruelty is painful.<br /><br />Still, the book is a good read.  While the story lines meander so much that by the time we're back to the main plot line I've almost forgotten what it was, the new worlds Martin creates for us are incredibly rich and interesting: the temples at Braavos, the bleakness of the Ironborns' existence, the exotic deserts of Dorne.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the previous books, you'll still get something out of it.  Just go in with your eyes open, prepared for a degree of frustration and dissatisfaction.
0060254920|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Our son had a wonderful time reading it.  Loved the illustrations.  Very creative.  Would recommend it to anyone having kids in elementary school.
B00124MCCW|5.0|I've always been a huge Bee Gee's fan and was so happy to hear this release.  Loved the title song and \\"Man in the Middle\\" as Maurice shone.....all the songs are wonderful - refreshingly new sounds.  Also, I decided to get the DVD and it was awesome!  Such a great loss now with the passing of Robin as well.  I will greatly miss hearing the brothers perform.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|While I see there's a need for women to find good erotica books, this is not it. The writing is terrible. I get so tired of her inner goddess making her sound like she has multiple personalities. I did not like to see her keep going back to someone so awful to her. As for the book in general Hated it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a roller coaster of twists & unexpected turns that had me staying up far later than I should have to get through another chapter. If you like a thriller that keeps you hooked till the end, you'll love this book. Flynn's style is very readable and I've now read another of her books & highly recommend it too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found Wool completely gripping, from the short introduction story (Wool 1) through the final story (Wool 5).  A wonderfully executed adventure in the world of a post-apocalyptic vault-dwelling enclave of humanity, with plenty of genre-breaking surprises.  Enjoyable characters, world-building, and story-telling. I look forward to more of Hugh Howey's stories in this world or others.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, Wool sets a very high bar, not just of story, but also for editorial quality for self-published works.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|I read the reviews before purchasing the blu-ray and watching it.  I remember reading to \\"keep an open mind.\\"  I was, and am, pretty opinionated on the events of the first musical.  My only solice for the first part is that it was kind of an opera.  After watching the second part, I am not sure why I should keep an open mind.  I am not sure, even now, what I thought of the ending.  What I can say, is that the story was excelent.<br /><br />I went into the musical thinking how can Andrew Lloyd Webber top the music from the first part.  The Phantom of the Opera has melodies that are beyond words.  That explains the huge success of the first part.  Sadly, the music, IMHO, of the second part, is not so good.  it is okay, but it is not as rememberable and outstanding as the first one.  The glimpses that he gave to the earlier melodies made me smile, but that was a bad thing.  If watching the musical, I yearn for the old melodies instead of being swept away by the new ones, then the musical was lacking in the music department, which is what Mr. Webber did.  The title song was very good, though.<br /><br />I wonder if this second part will catch on the way that the first one did.  Seems the answer is no, but the musical is new, so we shall see.  I almost did not even realize that there was a sequel.  I went to see a movie at AMC, and in the slides prior to the commencement of the previews, I saw a quick slide for a limited engagement for The Phantom of the Opera and the sequel Love Never Dies.  I went to fanthom.com and realized that, wow, there is a sequel, so I purchased the video.<br /><br />The story is good, but I am disappointed that the melody was not superior to the ones introduced in the first part.  Oh yes, the part that I disliked the most was at the opening when they had the carnival at Coney Island.  Those melodies and songs are IMHO forgettable.  I could not wait for that part to end.  Maybe on subsuent listenings I will like it.  To be fair, the first part had Masquerade starting the second act.  That one is growing on me, but it is still my least favorite.<br /><br />The video is definitely well worth watching and a MUST WATCH if you were left hanging from the first.  Mr. Webber said that the first one was left with a cliff hanger of sorts.  I would not have phrased it that way, but the story did not finish.<br /><br />I reduced the rating to 4, because of the music and the Coney Island part at the opening.  The rest of the production made up for the lacking parts, so hence a 4.<br /><br />Will there be a #3?  The story did not really finish with the sequel either.ad Masquerade starting the second act.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this case before I went on my senior trip to ocean city Maryland. It was one of the best decisions I've made. After watching the tutorials online I put the case on. It is very durable. I took it to the beach all seven days. Took it in the ocean burried in the sand even took pictures in the pool. I suggest buying it on here you'll save around $20 for a brand new case! Suggested to everyone! Great buy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game.  I love that you have the ability to change the card backs and background.  I like all the options and the different scoring options.
B00684J49U|5.0|Season 7 lacked the typical \\"Grey's Drama\\" we all love but I guess Shonda realized what the fans really desire and gave us an excellent Season 8.<br />Meredith and Derek's relationship was strained towards the beginning of the season but Derek eventually forgave Meredith and we saw them as a happy family throughout the season with cute baby Zola.<br />The season opener saw Cristina having an abortion, personally, I support Cristina's decision. She just doesn't want to be a mother and Owen knew that before getting into the relationship. Speaking of Owen, cheating on Cristina to spite her was understandable but not forgivable. The whole CrOwen storyline was beautifully written and acted.<br />Lexie... umm... nothing much to say here. She did nothing major this season but Chyler Leigh killed it in the finale with an amazing performance. Farewell, Lexie. You'll be missed.<br />Teddy's world was turned upside down with Henry's death. We all knew it would eventually happen but it was too soon. With Henry gone, we saw Teddy grieve and take her anger out on Owen. Kim Raver too was a powerhouse this season delivering a splendid performance as the grieving widow.<br />CalZona were not seen much this season except the Valentine's Special episode which reminded us why we love these pretty ladies and also seeing Arizona's childhood friend towards the end of the season gave us a nice insight into her past. After getting all the attention in season 7, I guess the writers decided to put them in the backseat this season, which is fair enough.<br />Richard went through hell seeing Adele disappear right before his eyes. Adele's storyline was heartbreaking! Loretta Devine deserves another Emmy. Sadly, Adele's end is not very far. It makes one wonder though, what's left for Richard to do on the show besides play surrogate dad to Mer. A relationship with Jackson's mother would be entertaining to see.<br />Bailey finally got the attention she deserves. Our beautiful Bailey was in the middle of a love triangle with Eli and the returning, Ben. She rightfully chose Ben who proved time and time again that he's the one for Bailey.<br />Alex too didn't do much this season besides being a rockstar Peds surgeon and being there for Meredith whenever he could.<br />Mark had a new love interest in Julia who was likeable but is no Lexie! Slexie's final conversation in the finale brought everyone to tears. With Lexie gone, Mark will definitely need Derek, Callie and Arizona to support him next season that is, IF he makes it alive.<br />April struggled in her position as Chief Resident and finally failed her medical boards and got fired. I would have preferred to see her go instead of Teddy but April will be back next season.<br />Jackson hooked up with April!!! To his dismay, April went all religious on him. He also was Mark's protege, together known as the Plastics Posse. They were extremely funny together.<br />The finale left everyone's fate up in the air. Jackson and Alex are leaving Seattle Grace-Mercy West and April is jobless while Derek, Meredith, Mark, Cristina and Arizona are barely holding on for their life as poor Callie is waiting for Arizona to arrive and Richard is waiting for Mer and Cris at the dinner party. Bailey gets engaged to Ben but he announces he's moving across the country to be a surgical intern. Will Bailey move with him? Teddy is officially gone as well to lead Medcom while Lexie sadly dies in the plane crash.<br />Overall, a breathtakingly great season.

Music Man holds a special place in the hearts for those of us who live here and annually, we have a Bandfest in honor of 'the music man' which was the following weekend.

B004F69J0M|5.0|I was going to give this album four stars instead of five. And then I thought, \\"Why do that?\\" True, at first listen, this album seemed just a bit ... slight to me. Allman offers just one original tune, \\"Just Another Rider,\\" co-written with Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes. And the instrumentation here is not a full-on blues assault, but rather restrained, which isn't surprising considering T-Bone Burnett produced the album.<br /><br />But this darned record just got hold of me and won't let me alone. It's one of those song collections that grows and grows on you. Allman's covers of various blues songs including \\"Please Accept My Love\\" and \\"Rolling Stone\\" are terrific, but what really makes this album special is Gregg's voice. In all his years with the Allman Bros., he's mostly been a blues shouter -- his voice has had plenty of gravel in it, which only made his delivery of emotional pain all the more convincing.<br /><br />Here, though, he almost sounds like a different singer -- relaxed, smoother around the edges. I don't think I'd ever describe Gregg Allman's voice as \\"mellow,\\" but his almost casual approach here is perfectly suited to the songs, which he clearly loves but refuses to treat as museum pieces.<br /><br />I bought the two-disc, heavy-vinyl version, which also included a card giving me a digital download of the tunes. I appreciate that, but the 180-gram vinyl is what I've been listening to -- the pressing is just gorgeous, very quiet and three-dimensional and lifelike.<br /><br />Allman has made perhaps the finest solo album of his career, and one that also stands up quite well to his amazing work with his band.

I was forever yelling in my head for Abby and Travis to make the right decision.  Wonderful love story.  Yes they are college age but who doesnt remember their first love.  I recommend this book highly.

B004PEJ1H0|3.0|I am a great fan of George Michael and I think that he is one of the best interpreter of covers, but this version of the New Order's masterpiece doesn't satisfy me. Hearing his beautiful voice in this 'metallic' version to me is a really waste. I've seen GM's Symphonica tour when he came to Verona and True Faith in the live version really sounds better. Anyway, buy this cd! It's for a good cause and George Michael remains one of the best male singer in the world! Enjoy!

B000002JSN|5.0|\\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" got more airplay, thanks to \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" from \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" is the song that pushed Zeppelin into super-stardom, but make no mistake: \\"Physical Graffiti,\\" Zep's sixth studio album -- and the only \\"double album\\" of the band's career, to use old vinyl terminology -- was the band's masterpiece.<br /><br />I think I've probably listened to this album a couple of hundred times by now, and I just don't get tired of it. Part of the appeal is the range. My guess is that, because they had two discs to work with, Zeppelin decided to throw a bit of everything into the pot.<br /><br />So the result is you get the proto-guitar riffing and sexual innuendo of \\"Custard Pie,\\" but you also get the heavy, traditional-sounding, slide-guitar blues of \\"In My Time of Dying.\\" You get the English pastoral of the instrumental \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" as well as the thunderous travelogue \\"Kashmir.\\" You get the moody, pensive, dark, guitar-soaked \\"Ten Years Gone\\" but also the lighter, ocean-kissed \\"Down by the Seaside.\\" You get ... OK, you get the picture.<br /><br />This album, in fact, feels like an adventure for your ears. Even after so many listenings, I'm always gratified at the many places it seems to take me.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin never made a truly bad studio album, in my opinion, although \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was probably the weakest. \\"Physical Graffiti\\" shows the band's brilliance, aggressiveness, and willingness to experiment with its own sound. HIGHLY recommended.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|Over the last few years it seems that almost every band I like that's been around for 10 to 20 years has released an album, an album that the respected artist claimed was their best work since their best work, yet it wasn't.  In this case, Billy Corgan claimed Oceania was his best work since the Mellon Collie album.  After reforming the Smashing Pumpkins (in name only), he released Zeitgeist in 2007, which was a pretty decent album yet it was met with underwhelming results.  For the last 2 years he'd been releasing one song at a time for the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope collection, which is the first of Corgan's music that I never bothered to purchase because the songs just did nothing for me.  It was also hard to get excited about 1 mediocre song being released online every 3 weeks so I quit paying attention.  Now that Corgan has a new official line-up to his band, it seemed to inspire him to make music that was too good not to be on a real album (even though it's technically part of the Teargarden project).  The Pumpkins' new bassit, Nicole Fiorentino, even stated as a fan that Billy had really tapped into whatever brilliance he had going on during the Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie days.  Oceania has received great reviews from fans and critics alike, and yet this longtime Pumpkins follower wasn't real impressed.<br /><br />This may be Corgan's most bland album since the Zwan project, though this is still better by leaps and bounds.  The album opens with Quasar, an energetic rocker that seems like a blend of Cherub Rock and SuperChrist (if you're familiar with that tune).  The music sounds pretty good but Corgan's singing sounds like he's just going through the motions and there isn't much soul in the lyrics or his voice.  It's as though the band started jamming and he just improvised the vocals rather than carefully writing them out.  The next song is Panopticon, another rocker that's both fun and a possible single.  The guitars have sort of a Siamese Dream sound to them, and this is definitely one of the standout tracks.  The Celestials is the current single from the album.  It's a mellow, acoustic ballad with some orchestral arrangements that struck me as a bit boring at first, but it's slowly growing on me.  One Diamond One Heart has some Enya-esque synthesizers which makes it a pretty song, but it could stand to have a better hook for a chorus.  The title track (Oceania) is 9 minutes, it's epic in length but not in sound.  I love long songs with lots of ups and downs and tempo changes, a good example would be The Scientist's Canvas by the group Stage, or just about anything by Tool.  However, this song just sounds like ideas for several other songs that were never completed so they were just thrown together here.  The direction seems aimless and the different parts just don't mesh well.  This song suffers from something that most of the tracks on here suffer from, and that's Corgan's bored singing, it just sounds like he's making it up as he goes along.  Pale Horse is a breath of fresh air though, it has a beautiful hook and there's a lot of individual sounds going on.  After 7 mellow tracks in a row, we finally get another rocker with The Chimera, which has some good guitar work and a fun beat.  Then we have Inkless which is cool because if nothing else, it has more of those sweet sounding Siamese Dream guitar sounds.  Finally, Wildflower brings the album to a boring, anti-climatic end.<br /><br />I know it sounds like I'm ragging on this album but it's honestly not that bad.  It's just that Billy Corgan wrote many of the most inspiring and important songs I've ever heard, and this was just a pretty mediocre release.  Another reviewer had it right when he said that this isn't a bad album, it just could have been so much better! There's a number of different sounds going on, but I'd say Oceania has more in common with Adore than any other Pumpkins record.  It's possible these songs will grow on me more over time (much the way Adore did), but for now I'm hoping Corgan puts out something a bit more worthy of the band's name for the next release.e way Adore did), but for now I'm hoping Corgan puts out something a bit more worthy of the band's name for the next release.

B000F3A7LO|4.0|I was about 19 when this album first came out, and to be honest, I didn't know what to think of it. It certainly was INTERESTING to me. It was also angular, frequently discordant, mordantly aggressive, and thoroughly intellectual and intimidating.<br /><br />Having had three decades to listen to it now, I can honestly say I love revisiting this album. \\"Exposure\\" is one of Fripp's stronger records, and this is a man who has released some very good albums over the years, both on his own (\\"At the End of Time\\") and with King Crimson (\\"Starless and Bible Black,\\" \\"Thrak\\" etc.).<br /><br />Special favorites here: The menacing rumble of \\"Chicago\\" and the starkly beautiful \\"North Star.\\"<br /><br />I personally could have done without the voice-overs from John G. Bennett, a G.I. Gurdjieff adherent for whom Fripp apparently had a special fondness. Then again, these occasional, spliced-in declarations, such as, \\"it is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering,\\" did, I suppose, add something to the album's eerie appeal.<br /><br />Fripp is one of the most distinctive guitarists of the last half-decade, and he plays very well here. You know, the instant you hear his first note, who he is and what he's about. I absolutely love the tones he can get out of the instrument.<br /><br />Recommended, for those willing to take a little risk.

B005QPGHQU|2.0|I've long been a fan of Amy and Evanescence. I think she has one of the most amazing voices in music and to this point at least, I felt that she was a genius when it came to music and using it to create feel and atmosphere. Unfortunately it sounds like Evanescence's reign as the best of the female fronted bands has come to a crashing end. The lyrics for the new album are not new, inspiring, or thought provoking and the music sounds like every other rock band out there. Amy used to set Evanescence apart from other bands with beautiful, haunting vocals, and piano parts melded seamlessly with rock guitars. Not so on this album. This album could be any band with a female lead. There's nothing special about it.<br />Don't waste your money on this one. Keep playing \\"Fallen\\" and remember the days when Amy's band was something special.

B000063UR1|4.0|Douglas Trumbull is a legend in filmdom -- he was one of the special-effects wizards for Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" which, more than four decades after its 1968 release, still looks better and more believable than some brand-new science fiction films. More recently, director Terence Malick drew Trumbull out of retirement to help with the FX for \\"The Tree of Life.\\"<br /><br />\\"Silent Running,\\" Trumbull's turn as a director, is a really fine piece of science fiction. If the film has a problem, it's that it can seem a bit ... quaint at this point. Made in the early 1970s, it features a Joan Baez song and some decidedly hippie-esque trappings.<br /><br />But it also boasts a superb performance by Bruce Dern, who spends much of the movie acting opposite three diminutive robots (precursors of R2-D2?). And Trumbull's special effects look typically wonderful, despite his not having a budget to work with that was anything near \\"2001.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this movie. Just keep in mind that it was made some time ago.

0330419080|5.0|... that make for a wonderfully absorbing tale then, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer hits one out the park with The Fourth Estate. I'm a huge fan of Archer's and within his portfolio of novels are gems like this one. This story has two main protagonists born at the same time but worlds apart geographically and socially. One a peasant, one a son of opportunity. Both have a common trait, the desire to succeed. Within that desire is a skill with people, a sharp mind and a clear cut vision.<br /><br />Archer colors in his characters by provenance. We follow the characters from their birth through their formative years and as we move with them, Archer teaches us about them. We follow them as they learn their various crafts and finally, when their worlds collide, we know all there is to know about them which allows us to, somewhat, anticipate their moves based on their individual motives.<br /><br />This is the beauty of Archer's work. Obviously a highly intelligent man, Archer writes at a level that draws you in by bringing text alive in your mind and putting you in the rooms with the characters. Maybe I sound overly impressed? Well, I have to admit, he is my favorite author.<br /><br />This book opens with what is, effectively, the last but one chapter then takes us to the start of a wonderful saga that spans many continents and many, many years. High finance is involved as our cast members evolve from humble beginnings to powerful positions in a more modern world. Initially driven by the desire to succeed, they clash over a business deal and one wrongs the other. So starts the feud. The feud fuels both men and, impulsiveness born of the desire to one-up the other brings about eventual downfall but ... who is the ultimate loser?<br /><br />Read the book, enjoy it, absorb it then, go get yourself another Archer novel.<br /><br />First class literature.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|Memento was one of my very favorite movies so I was intrigued when I saw the ads for this book several months ago. After reading the first couple of chapters I knew I had to download it. The premise owes much to both Memento and 50 First Dates, yet is a spell-binding novel in its own right. Christine has a form of amnesia that prevents her from converting her short-term memories into longer ones, which means that each morning she wakes up not knowing who she is or any of the details of her life. On the advice of her doctor, she begins keeping a journal, hoping that she will be able to build on the memories she has uncovered. Yet as time goes on, she begins to wonder if the situations in her journal are memories, or a fiction she has invented, and who she can trust. As the stories lead to more contradictions, she wonders if she will ever uncover the truth, and what kind of life she can live if she has no future and no past. The book is written in first-person through a combination of journal entries and reflections on them. Unreliable narrators are tricky to handle, requiring just enough hints to convince the reader that the truth is out there but not including events that are unknowable to the narrator. The sense of dread was palpable from the first paragraph and the mystery of what really happened to Christine was compelling. It would probably appeal more to \\"cerebral\\" readers as I am not sure I really felt connected to any of the characters, although I did empathize with the fear and paranoia of not knowing who to trust. Christine didn't have much personality to me -- which may be a combination of the narration and the British setting. Even though she occasionally took action, it was usually at the direction of someone else -- Dr Nash, or her husband -- and seldom on her own initiative. I realize it would be difficult to act if you didn't know who you are, but she seemed incredibly passive and to just react to everything rather than initiating her own actions. Other characters were only seen through Christine's eyes, so they didn't become real to me either, although that is what I expected based on the narration. Again, if you liked Memento or that type of book/movie, I think you would love this book as well.

0375507256|4.0|Halfway through this sprawling and ambitious novel which came highly recommended by a few of my friends and I'm thinking two stars, three tops and that it's going to be a bit awkward when I end up panning the thing. On the other hand, never once did I doubt Mitchell's prodigious writing talent. Right from the start I could see he's destined to establish himself as one of the leading novelists of our new age. Indeed, his literary virtuosity really shines in a brilliant spray of flying colors in each of the six separate - and completely separate sounding - novellas that comprise the whole. So there I was, on about page 200 of this 500 page heavyweight feeling so dazzled by Mitchell's brilliant writing I forgot to notice what it was he was writing about. Really annoying. So annoying in fact that for a moment or two, I even entertained the notion of erasing the whole pile of show-offy pretentiousness from my portable reading pod and moving on to the next book on my list. Something I could read without constantly pushing the Kindle's word definition app.  Something more accessible.  Less aggravating.<br /><br />But then I got to the sixth novella (Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After) which is set in what's left of Hawaii many centuries from now after modern civilization has devoured itself. In spite of crossing over to a world of Mitchell's imagining where everything is Total Toast, I started really liking the book. I even learned to decipher the made up pig-English Mitchell deploys to underscore the \\"otherness\\" of this post apocalyptic time and place.  The writing style in this section struck me as being more honestly reflective of Mitchell's own voice in spite of his invented language. Ironically enough, and perhaps intentionally, the echoes of human beings left to cope with this dark new world are more fully and humanely drawn than any of the other characters previously introduced. They are more likeable, with hopes and vulnerabilities any soul-possessing reader living in the early 21st century can take to heart.<br /><br />Maybe it was my improved mood after becoming so completely absorbed in the gripping account of what happens at Sloosha's Crossin' - told as a flashback around a crackling campfire - that made the second half of the novel so much more enjoyable than the first half.  That could have been it.  It also could have been because the sixth novella provides the perspective needed to better understand how all of the novellas are linked to one another. Sloosha's Crossin' helps you to twig onto the common threads and see the wispy clouds that map the journey: It begins with the journal written by an ordinary American guy traveling to the South Pacific in the 1840's and moves next to the personal letters of a ne're-do-well musical composer in 1930 Belgium. From there it's on to an action thriller-type story set in a mythical city in California in the 1970's and into a rollicking dark comedy about a London book publisher who finds himself trapped in a serious mess in the present day. Next the book turns completely sci-fi with a story about cloned slaves in a dystopian future before catapulting to the really distant future with Shoosha's Crossin'. This grim look into what Mitchell suggests is our inescapable ultimate future sits like a mirror in the center of the novel and sets up the resolution of the other five novellas presented now in opposite order starting with the clones and ending where you first began, in the South Pacific.<br /><br />Sounds gimmicky, and perhaps it is - and I sure would like to get my hands on the cover letter Mitchell must have written to his publisher selling him on the whole convoluted concept. I'll bet that was quite something! Here's another thing.  Much of Cloud Atlas is derivative, with heavy handed echoes of 1984, A Brave New World, Planet of the Apes, The China Syndrome, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There's even some silliness thrown in about some comet-shaped birth marks thatkeep on reappearing down - and up - through the centuries.  You go \\"ooooh\\" when you stumble upon them just like you went \\"ooooh\\" when you uncovered the messages and symbols hidden in Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />So why read a novel with themes and messages that have been so ably covered in novels and movies you've already enjoyed?  Why would mere mortals want to plow through a book that so frequently reminds them they failed to score a perfect 800 on their verbal SATs?<br /><br />Why a laudable 4 stars instead of a lousy 2?<br /><br />Because whether or not Cloud Atlas is a gimmicky or revolutionary novel, David Mitchell has the brain power and steeled cajones to take on the human race's biggest existential questions in a way that's never been attempted before. Perhaps also if I were just a little less resigned to and indifferent about the hidden levers surely controlling us ordinary suckers right here, right now, I could get myself more exercised about his vision and warnings.

030758836X|2.0|I listened to this as an audiobook. It was a very strange story with very stereotypical characters. We had the dumpy ex-boyfriend, the ignorant husband, the crazy rich girl wife, and a slew of other non-complex characters. This book is more pop candy than it is a substantial read. It reminded me of a movie you'd see on Lifetime for Women.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love this app!! I'm bad at getting to sleep at night but its really easy with this! I completely recommend the whale noise!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Colorful and improves strategy thinking. Also the sound when you connect is cute and can be enjoyed by anyone (:
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is a fantastic package. For big fans of this movie. This is the package to have to add to your prized collection. Well done.
8866131385|5.0|I am constantly mocked to be carrying around a \\"day planner\\" in the digital age, but what can I say. I am old-school! I struggled to find a day planner that I could use September to September for my school year planning, and the 18 month feature allows you to either do September to September or December to December (assuming you will replace it with another). I picked this particular planner for a couple of reasons. First, I am an avid Moleskine fan, so it was a natural choice. Second, it is set up in weeks, which allows me to scope out my whole week, not just a smidge of days. Third, the addition of the lined, empty page to the right of the week's planner is perfect for my To Do lists for each week.<br /><br />The cover is the soft leather-esque version of Moleskine. It is pretty flexible, but holds together beautifully. I had this planner last year and carried it EVERYWHERE for a year and it didn't fall apart (although the back pouch on the outside cover eventually ripped open on the seam). The biggest change to this year's model is that instead of a one month calender per page in the block format at the beginning of the book, there are two months per page in a column with a line per each day. I kind of liked that traditional block calendar, so it was sad to see the change, but I still love this planner and this small change wouldn't keep me from buying it again.<br /><br />The beginning of the book has tons of unnecessary information, like country codes and conversion charts. I think this is interesting, but I would rather have more blank pages in my book that this information I can pretty easily find elsewhere. Other than that, this is an item I can't live without!
0553584537|3.0|A pretty good read, the book starts off with tension, and it keeps it up fairly well.  There are twists and turns to the plot which held my interest, and the pacing was good.  The main characters all had flaws, and there are some villains who are truly evil, and they pretty much get their due.  A lot of the book was about a strong, beautiful, smart woman who just wants to be left alone, but she is being persecuted by an evil, powerful man - actually several evil powerful men.  To be fair, it had a little more action and a little less anguished emotion than the typical Lifetime Movie, but a lot of it made it seem like I was watching the Lifetime network.
B008133MDK|4.0|Episode 1 is definitely not for family viewing unless your studying female anatomy. lol<br /><br />Episode 2 great plot, but scary for some.<br /><br />Episode 3 Awesooooommmmeeee.  Can't wait for the<br />next season.  Watch out Robert Downy Jr., Cumberland plays an incredible Sherlock and Moriarty's character is acted out the best I have ever seen.  A MUST watch for Sherlock Holmes fans, leaves us with high anticipation for the next season, hurry up and get it done!
B0084BM7GW|5.0|Classic, unfiltered, not over-produced (ARENA) Duran. It's like actually being there. Simon's voice has to warm up. This is filmed not long after he came back. But incredible the rest of the show. BUY THIS IF YOU EVER LIKED DURAN2. Phenominal!

1451627289|5.0|Just finished reading 11/22/63.  Had to save it for my summer break!!  Was so worth the wait!  Could not put it down; especially at the end.  Wow!!  Loved the story; one of Stephen King's best books yet!  I also appreciated his lengthy information on the facts at the end.  A nice history lesson.  A lover of the movie \\"Somewhere in Time\\", I am now eager to read King's recommendation, \\"Time and Again\\" by Jack Finney.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Additive game I love it! Share with your friends and have a great time. I love this game. Enjoyed the family fun.
0345803485|5.0|Excellent Book!  Received on time, actually early than scheduled!  Loved the service, recommend the whole trilogy of 50 Shades of Grey to everyone!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is all that and some more. u can check out the weather for today and the future it tells u the time u should expect the weather conditions to start and end. Not only in my town but for any area I want to know about...good for my kindle fire!!!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This was another movie that I rented first and then had to buy it because it is such a great movie!!!
B0072GPQNG|1.0|Let me start by saying that I really expected to love this movie, but no so much!  The soundtrack for this movie is HORRIBLE and it plays so loud at times you cant even hear what the characters are saying.  There is NO character development for anyone...not even the horse.  The storyline was totally unreal too.  I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so difficult to watch.  I expected more from Spielberg (sp?).  The idea of the story is good and it could have been great but it just wasn't developed enough.  One more thing about the music, it did not match the story at all and was annoying!
B007IQX1G4|1.0|My title says it all and there is nothing more to be said.  You will be sadly disappointed if you watch this movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this app is awesome to kill time or if you want to confuse your brain. is great for all ages.
B004UID2LC|4.0|allows me to download wut ever video I want to see and I can play again when ever I want
B001E90A38|5.0|Perfect story. The movie was well done. Thank you as I enjoyed myself. In fact, I appreciate the presence of my hero, Sean Connery.
B003V5HWWA|5.0|The Disney vault is an outdated concept that is hurting sales, I would love to purchase a digital copy of this for my kids but alas we just rented instead.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|My husband loved this book.  My husband doesn't read books... this is the first book he's read in 10 years - he absolutely loved this book.  He is still talking about it.  He was laughing out loud at moments and making me read excerpts from the book.<br /><br />He really really enjoyed it and will definately be looking for similar books.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Obviously the writer was not going for any literature awards. With that said, I had a hard time putting the book down it was definitely a page turner and the second book was a great sequel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is a very adiccting game!!!!! I got it yesterday and had to make myself put it down!!! its an ammusing game and I definatly recommend it!!!! I luvvvvvvv it ssooo much!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So after reading the first book, I was really unsure if I wanted to read the next. I did, of course, because I wanted to know what happened and was willing to ignore the obvious flaws in the writing. If you read the less-than-stellar reviews, they're all true. I actually laughed while reading them because they are spot on when it comes to the repetitive and unrealistic parts of the story. The user who counted how many times each word was used? Not surprising at all! Although, I would be interested to see how many times \\"heady\\" was used in the next two books...<br /><br />Anyway, to the point. Yes, the book is annoyingly repetitive and completely over the top with obvious similarities to Twilight. And just like the Twilight Saga, I can't say I love the first book. For that reason, I'm glad I read the rest of them. I fully admit that while this is no great piece of writing, I couldn't put it down. I finished all three books in 4 days (while working full time...I am very tired, but I don't care).<br /><br />I rated this book what I did because I'm rating them all together. The reviews on this book will help you decide if you want it or not, and I didn't think it was fair to rate one book out of a trilogy when the following two are much better. Once the characters loosen up and become less awkward, I felt the story got better. I laughed...quite a few times and found myself smiling at the smart remarks and banter between the main characters. What can I say? I'm a hopeless romantic with a love for sarcasm...I couldn't help it. I was engrossed in the storyline. I'm probably just completely oblivious, but I really had no idea where the story was going. Obviously, I knew how it would end...who didn't? But everything else? I had no clue, which is why I'm so tired.<br /><br />Yes, the sex is on practically every page and it's gets old (who'd have thought?). I'm supposed to believe she comes every way, every time, on command, and in perfect unison with him? Maybe I should re-think my marriage!<br /><br />In the end, I liked the books, despite their imperfections. I could somewhat relate to Ana as she gets stronger and more confident. I can relate to her relationship and how it feels to be that in love. (Hopeless romantic...don't roll your eyes, my husband is wonderful!) That's possibly why I liked the books, and why so many people find them annoying. Just like the Twilight Saga, you'll either love it or hate it. But if you decide to give the first book a chance, I really hope you continue to read them all.
0394800389|5.0|I never read this one as a kid but my husband loved it, I have to say it is fun to try and read through this story as fast as possible my daughter thinks it's so funny!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have found this calculator to be great not just on the go-- but also at home figuring bills and doing homework with the kids!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting! I don't know why people rate 1star. If you don't have temple run you should definately download it.
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|This adapter worked great until it broke four months into its use.  I will be trying to get a replacement through warranty, and depending on how that goes I will try to remember to post here.<br /><br />Kind of a pain to have to deal with this.
B002H0S2SI|5.0|Sorry it took so long for me to do this review. I actually did not know I could/should review my Amazon purchases. So here goes - first of all kudos to the seller who did a great job of getting the book to me super fast. I took it on vacation for a week at the beach. Grew up in Geneva and really wanted to read the book because a lot of it takes place in that city. This is a great novel, characters are hilarious (and tragic too of course!).<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who wants a good, long, old-fashioned novel which you will be sad to see end.
B003SI5NX0|4.0|I remembered this from my childhood and my daughter highly enjoyed it, it's not our favorite but it was a nice rental.
0345803485|2.0|I gave it a shot like I gave Twilight a shot when my friends were so adamant about pushing me toward it. I could see what they saw in Twilight and in a way if I shut off that instinctual part of my brain that told me what was good and what was bad I would've liked it. With fifty shades of grey, I put in all my efforts to deaden that voice in me but half way through the book, I found myself skipping through the mundane sentences to the steamy sex scenes. That is what Fifty Shades of Grey is all about--the sex scenes. That's what you would be paying for. Not plot, not character development, but S & M. There's nothing wrong with that, just don't expect to get anything else out of it. It is what it is, and frankly it made my experience depressing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book made my summer. I have read all 3 books and can't wait for the movie. I find myself day dreaming all the time over this book.
0345803507|1.0|I wanted to know what they were going to do about Elena. It was such a huge part of the story, yet in the end it is implied that when a grown woman molests and essentially rapes (statutory) a 15yr old boy, it was beneficial to him. UH I just want to throw up. There is so much awful sh*t in this trilogy, but I don't wish to waste any more time on it. Run away from these books. Overpriced too.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Bought this for my wife, as she is a big Gilmour fan. A very good album in which any David Gilmour fan would enjoy.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|the movie was more descriptive than originally imagined. For adults only. You cannot bring this home with kids in the house. Sad. No resolution given for troubled adults. Alarming to watch if single heterosexual; there is another element of the enemy out there to consider. Its aggressive beguiling and it transcends all sexual realities; very scary.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book is a gem to behold in every sense of the word.  I read this in one sitting.  I cried so hard from laughing in some parts, and cried so hard from not so laugh out loud moments.  This book has it all and I couldn't recommend it enough.  Buy. This. Book. Now.  It'll be the best purchase you've ever made!  Thank you Colleen for writing such a poignant masterpiece.  I'm sharing this book with all my book loving friends, no doubt about that.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|I can't remember the last time I've been so moved by a film -- maybe never.  What's it about?  Everything.  It's hard to think of a major theme of human existence that is not explored in this movie.  What it's mostly about is a teenage girl's confrontation with mortality.  The title comes from a beautiful poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins called \\"Spring and Fall,\\" which is read in the film by Matthew Broderick, playing Anna Paquin's high school English teacher:<br /><br />To a young child<br /><br />Margaret, are you grieving<br />Over Goldengrove unleaving?<br />Leaves, like the things of man, you<br />With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?<br />Ah! as the heart grows older<br />It will come to such sights colder<br />By and by, nor spare a sigh<br />Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;<br />And yet you will weep and know why.<br />Now no matter, child, the name:<br />Sorrow's springs are the same.<br />Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed<br />What heart heard of, ghost guessed:<br />It is the blight man was born for,<br />It is Margaret you mourn for.<br /><br />Even now as I read that poem and recall the powerful closing moments of the movie -- where Paquin weeps and knows why -- a tear comes to my eye.<br /><br />The film has an effortless realism.  The classroom scenes and the lawyers are pitch-perfect.  I mention them in particular, because movies usually get them wrong.  The depiction of smart teenagers (and teachers) -- what they say and how they say it -- is dead-on.  Every character is fully drawn.  You know them all, and empathize.  Some think the movie is too cluttered.  I suppose the Matt Damon subplot is the least successful -- at least in the theatrical cut -- but I did not find the movie overstuffed.  You need it all to appreciate the girl's coming of age as she deals with so many of the usual adolescent challenges, plus the outrageous fact of death.<br /><br />This is a brilliant, spellbinding movie from start to finish.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I gave this book 2 stars because as embarrassing as it is, I did go on to read the rest of the series. I say it is embarrassing to admit because this book was gross, ridiculous, unbelievable, and at many points I wanted to hurl it across the room. Yet I read on!<br /><br />I had such a hard time believing these characters could exist. Many people compare these books to the Twilight series, but let me emphasize that the difference was vampires vs supposedly regular human beings. We can believe Edward is perfect because he is frozen in his prime and has hundreds of years to learn all he knows. I can believe it because he is not real, he is a vampire. However the characters in this book are people without special abilities of any sort!<br /><br />For starters, Christian was an adonis, well endowed, generous billionaire at 26, pianist, pilot, martial artist, well read, great dancer, tough brawler, AND sexpert! What? Really? That was a hard pill to swallow. LOL. There was more I assure you.<br /><br />Let me move on the Anastasia. Who in the USA can get through college without email in the year 2011??? No one. Come on now! Ridiculous. I had this picture of her being pale, skinny, clumsy, red in the face (continuous blushing), chapped lip (all the biting), horny, and on the border of anorexia! She had to be told to eat on way too many occasions. Christian falls in love with her because of her smart mouth and beauty. Oh I can't help but laugh.<br /><br />Then comes the sex. Oh geez! Ana comes not only in every single sexual encounter, she comes multiple times! Christian gets hard, comes, and within minutes he is hard again. He can do this over and over, all the while ensuring Ana comes over and over. Yeah OOOKKKAAAYY. The BDSM was new to me, and I found it disturbing. I get the games, but some of it was sick. I'm talkin EWWW, turned off sick.<br /><br />I am sure I could go on and on, but I won't. The book was overpriced and a disappointment, albeit entertaining! I had toknow how this story would end. That said, I still do not recommend!
B000089RVX|5.0|A very good album that I find myself listening to quite frequently, especially driving to and from work.  Many good songs, the arrangements are outstanding.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I feel you have to want and be able to intellectually involve yourself in a movie from beginning to end in order to enjoy this movie. The acting is awesome and it has a lot of true funny moments and scenes and it involves you mentally. I thought the ending was perfect with Sherlock Holmes besting Professor Moriarty the way he did instead of killing him or sending him to prison for life. My mind absolutely LOVED this movie and ate it up like candy!!! Genius. I have already bought this movie and will watch it again and again.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Strangely captivating, though no work of art.  It should be read when ou are relaxing and have nothing more important to do.  It helps kill time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|sort of entertaining; keeps everything moving quickly. would recomend to anyone looking for an easy game that keeps you pretty busy.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've been a gym rat for many years and love reading, which lead me to purchasing Mike Matthews book \\"Muscle Myths\\". It was so well written and smashed thru so many of the BS truths that circulate around the gym. It was only natural to seek out Mike's website [...] to see what else he had to offer in the way of advice.    I don't cook, and I don't do cardio, so all that was left was to purchase this book, \\"Bigger Leaner Stronger\\". Read it in a day, then attacked it with a hi-lighter. I truly wish I'd read it to begin with! Learned all about the three parts of lifting life; overload exercize, proper nutrition, and resting.    If you are trying to decide which book to buy on your road towards building a better body ... This is the one!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I started to see the pattern emerge of method writing, the story line started to become to unrealistic and unsubstainable, clever this author, the book will appeal to millions of realers how perhaps have not read anything like the before
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Best album I've bought all year.  Tom Chaplin's vocals are again thrilling and comfortable.... the songs are great. I've played it dozens of times and haven't tired of one single cut.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really and truly enjoy this app.  . . I think you probably. would. too. yeah. enjoy. or dint.<br /><br />make it a good day!
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|Ok, where to start?  Asia is a favorite band of mine and I have enjoyed them live many times in the past few tours.  I won't waste time comparing XXX to their debut album because 30 years later it's not really logical.  I am just rating this album as a standalone effort.<br />Highlights; Bury Me in Willow and face on the Bridge<br />Lowlights; Reno (I don't know what they were thinking on this one) and Faithful (sounds like a left over song from the ICON project).<br />John's voice sounds great but it feels to me that all the performances on this album lack any real spirit or power to them (I also blame this on the mediocre production).<br />Geoff' Downes' performance is very boring and uninspiring (it pains me to say that because he is one of my favorite keyboardists). Carl Palmer's sound is very middle of the road mostly to bad production (which pisses me off because live in concert Carl is unstoppable).  This album does not do Carl justice. Steve Howe's performance (I know I'll get lynched for saying this) has a \\"been there, done that\\" kind of feel.  Steve is obviously a great guitar player but with maybe the exception of Ghost of Chance, all of his parts seem very mundane and boring.<br />I really wanted to love XXX but instead I'll file this with \\"Fly From Here\\".
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I found this 3rd book disappointing as it tried to tied up all the loose end,without detail, we didn't really get a sense of Christan's rehab and how he moves on and is (healed).
B008K8H9C6|5.0|If you are a fan of all the Angry Birds games, you will enjoy this game also. I recommend this game to all parents with kids that enjoy Angry Brids
B006XOBFJC|4.0|This is a great deal on one of the greatest musical art works. Sound is good and packaging adequate, but there is no libretto or editorial material about the works.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It's a little derivative, a little confused, sometimes drags and lectures...and who cares? It's fun, sweet, and silly, and I enjoyed it in the same way I enjoyed the movie Galaxy Quest. It's reminiscent in many ways of [[ASIN:B004HEXSO0 Then We Came to the End: A Novel]], if you're familiar with that book. Similar flaws, and similar successes. As crazy as it got, I enjoyed the characters, liked spending time with them, and could hear their voices and personalities particularly clearly. The codas, though, are--forgive me, author--like slogging through drying cement while watching someone navel gaze. Mind you, I liked this book and recommend it for quick reading when you need to get away for a while with an ensemble cast of friends. The deceptively light, snack food of a story had enough philosophical weight and thoughtfulness under its candy coating, without needing to add extra vitamins in the codas--it's a book that should have been stopped by its editor when it was done. Let the readers do their own navel-gazing, as it were. But the ending (of the chapters) makes me feel like the author who I've had such a good time with likes us back enough to give us a final friendly slap on the back, and that's a nice feeling to take away from a story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it, it is so much fun and very addicting. I play it everyday and I find myself going over the time I set myself to stop.
B007L7JY3Y|4.0|I was an iPhone user for a few years and relied on this to keep me on track. when I'll switched to android, I tried several other to do apps until the android version was released.  I like having it back but sorely miss the ability to set email reminders on events. would be perfect if that was added to the android version.
B004GFN11A|2.0|This app is set up nicely, but I still found using it on Kindle Fire to be a challenge. The platform of the touch screen made highlighting things, adding links and photos and adding HTML code to the blog posts a bother. I've only used the app once because it was such a hassle. I would use it again in a pinch, but not if I could get my hands on any other piece of hardware.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is a must have for any sensible knife owner. At $9.00 you get an amazing deal. Comes with slots for both ceramic and carbide, and the diamond rod gets a serrrade to prime condition in no time.

B007STXHTM|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2DXJHZ20WVVW5]]We just finished our first ocean dive trip and thanks to this dive housing really have some great video and pictures to share and enjoy.  This thing works great, we never had any problems and find the pictures and videos to be very realistic and accurate representations of what we saw and also heard.  I am surprised that it picked up the sound as well as it did.  You can hear boat motors as they pass near, and us talking on the surface and so forth.  Even at 30' if I talked it would record it.  When sharing the videos with family and friends we have a very accurate recording of what it both looked and sounded like.<br /><br />I will upload a video taken with the GoPro Hero2 and this housing during a dive at Catalina Island 26 miles off the California coast.  The video was shot in about 25' of water at a place called Ship Rock at Twin Harbors.  You can see how clear and sharp things are, though the camera was moving a bit (we learned to hold it still in our hand as we dove instead of on our heads or gear)  Notice the sound in the video too, that is what it sounded like as it was shot, you can near the ocean sounds the waves hitting a nearby rock.<br /><br />*** I just checked the video and after Amazon \\"processed\\" it, it looks terrible.  The actual video is HD quality, super sharp and looks great.  I'll post it to YouTube in HD with the name \\"Matt following a California Garibaldi fish\\".  You can watch it in HD online.  I posted a dozen more diving videos, all shot with the GoPro Hero2 and Dive housing now.<br /><br />Since the GoPro Hero2 came with the original housing we did some testing in a pool before out trip to the ocean.  Above water you are fine with the regular housing, but the moment you go under, the dive housing is much clearer and sharper, resulting in an image that makes all the difference in look and feel.  It's like having a professional system now.<br /><br />I tested the unit down to 65' over several days of sea water dives and everything works great.  Make sure you keep the inside clean and dry.  For one dive there was a little moisture inside and that causes a problem.  It can also be hard to clean the inside of the flat lens due to how it's mounted.  I just stuffed the corner of a lens cleaning cloth in there and twist it around and that took care of it.<br /><br />We played around with the above to under water transitions and found the camera and housing did great.  It was fun to be in the water and record someone jumping in and them follow them down into the water with the camera as they jumped.  Made for some nice video.  For underwater to surface transitions a little RainX or glass cleaner can help so the droplets don't block your video.  I didn't really have a problem with this and am happy with how our videos turned out.<br /><br />We did find that using the head strap on the camera caused too much jerky motion, guess we move our heads too much.  We got better results by holding the camera in our hand, so now we're looking for some kind of strap that will connect better and work better as a wrist/hand hold to secure the camera in case we ever have to let go.<br /><br />Bottom line, is the housing perfect?  Nope, as you can see they cover some of the screen with the wider lense glass, but hey like you really read it under water?  It's also difficult to clean but the bottom line here is that it works, and works well!  I'm happy with the results, I love the housing so it's 5 stars from me.  Enjoy your camera and with this housing, the resulting under water videos.  You'll love it.  This is a great addition to the GoPro line of products.s and everything works great.

B0051CSIKQ|5.0|Sure, the vampires are horrifying and deadly and there are plenty of great and scary fight scenes between humans and vampires but this film offers something far fresher.  The story revolves around a teenage boy and a gruff man who has taken him under his wing after his parents are killed by vampires.  The man teaches the young boy to toughen up and adapt to a brutal new world.  He acts as a sort of father figure.  The two are traveling north to a town called New Eden which is supposedly free from vampires.  The road leading north is full of vampires running around but the bigger threat are bands of fascistic Christians who want to impose their will on all who come nearby.  They control large areas of what is left of the United States.  In many ways, they are scarier than the vampires.  The boy and older man help other people along the way and soon have their own \\"family\\" that is traveling to New Eden.  The \\"family\\" is short-lived as the vampires and Christians pick them off one by one.  Who will survive to reach New Eden?  The film has a very sad, and bleak tone.  The musical score does a great job of conveying the depression and sadness that the survivors feel.  This is no Hollywood film full of one vampire fight after another.  There is more heart behind this movie and it hurts.
B00884GR0W|3.0|Let me start by saying ive played Minecraft on my Pc and MCPE on both my droid and kindle. Comparing MC to this &quot;clone&quot; is very muttled at the least. A lot of things are the same yet a lot are different. On the kindle fire this game has absolutely amazing graphics. The mining and building aspect takes patience and gets frustrating at time. Implementing rpg elements was a great idea and was executed very well. However, it's very easy to totally ruin the whole game by just a few misclicks. Needs a good once over with some bug spray and polishing compound and its an easy 5-star game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am sure this book was the best of the 3. I hated to finish the book hopefully there is more to come in this series. I doubt there will be another book that will compare to these,,,,baby boom of 50 shades of gray....
B0086700CM|4.0|I downloaded this game and overall it works well. It is easy to play and also very fun for children.
B001FZ0A7W|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dead Can Dance albums.  Its a mix of goth and world music.  Most of the songs have a strong middle eastern influence and sound and Lisa's singing is superb.  The production is done very well and it is easy to be transported to another world in your mind while listening to this album.  A must have for DCD fans.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|If you thrive on concepts and theory then this might be for you.  However I would like to see some examples to backup the theory.  There is only one example and its HTML 4 which is used to point out why HTML5 is better.  The points made are valid and I agree with them but I was hoping to glean more information out of the book than a simple HTML5 is better and here are the concepts and theory as to why its better.  Most of this information, if not all, can be obtained with a simple google search and/or a few blog posts.  But then again it is free.  It may be worth the time to download/read to some people but if you're a web developer by trade then this book is probably a waste of time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down just the mystery of what will happen next it is a pretty heated/seductive book looking forward to book two
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this simple but addictive game.  Longest I've ever kept and played a game.  Play on my kindle fire...great fun and pass time!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The game is easy to play on the Kindle. It has different skill levels, so even the amateur can enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Buyer beware as there is a pop up for match . com.  Game is a basic solitair game with ability to change card backs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I would give this zero stars if that were possible. I made a big mistake. Going on vacation, needed some books to read. In a hurry decided I would buy this one as it was the top seller. I noticed that it was a trilogy so perhaps it was going to be like \\"The Girl With a Golden Tattoo\\". Should have read the reviews! What a huge disappointment and a waste of money. How can people read such drivel and then go on and buy the next 2 books? There is absolutely no plot and no story and the descriptions of the Pacific North West (Seattle etc) is laughable. I thought it was just a young girls fantasies, but then last week, the Daily Telegraph said that E.L.James is actually 48 year old Mrs Mitchell from North London - and her husband is apparently not at all like the hero. You can get better stories in Playboy (and with pictures) if that's what you want. But sex and really well written gripping plots - this is not it. Try Stephen Leather, where the sex is relevant to the story.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|My son is a big fan of all of the angry birds games. This new game from rovio is very fun so far. I like the ability to create and download new levels.
0763631205|4.0|This was a Christmas gift that hit the mark.  The pictures were very good and augmented the story.  It was great to have the original text.
B00004Z459|5.0|Although many thought that rap-rock would fade in 2000, this band brought it to life.  This CD has sold more than 10 million copies in the United States alone and over 28 million worldwide.  Everyone who was in their teenage years at that time grew up listening to this band.  There's not a single track that I could skip over (even the songs they took out that were originally supposed to be in there like High Voltage and maybe My December?).  This band was more melodic than other rap-rock acts at the time and had two frontmen who can both sing/scream and rap.  Chester's vocals in Crawling are probably what won them a Grammy for that song.  I don't think the band can ever live up to this album due to the timing and emotional history they had to make this record, but all this talk about fans wanting Hybrid Theory again makes this album a true classic.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|so true to the books-great scenery, great effects and good cast. cant wait for the next season. loved it!! makes an excellent way to pass away a day
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is the perfect app for a puzzle lover because u get all the fun of doing the puzzle and don't have to worry about what to do with it once its complete.....a ton of puzzles at your finger tips....I.LOVE IT!!
0142001104|3.0|I read the first 100ish pages of this book and I had to put it down for some reason (can't remember).  Since then I have tried to pick up the book at least 3 more times and I get through about 5 pages and put it back down.  This seems to be a collection of stories and that's about it.  If you are in the mood to read some postive stories then this is a good book.  Otherwise it's a pass.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|i like the album he kinda sounds like musiq soulchild to me this my first time really hearing him i mean i heard novocane but never really sat and listened to it
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is my first purchase from Amazon and I'm very pleased with both the product and the overall service I received.  The product as such is of top quality and I can recommend it any time.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  It's easy to use and follow.  I have tried other apps that just confuse me or freeze.  No problems with this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love books that grab you the first few chapters. I couldn't stop reading until all 3 books were finished. Great for fun, summer reading! Hope more to come in the lives of Christian & Ana Grey.
0439023521|5.0|Katniss, Prim, Peeta, Gale, Rue...crochet; all are key players in The Hunger Games.  This book is a slow starter and might make you wonder why you picked it up.  But before you know it, you don't want to put it down!  At the beginning it's hard to imagine where The Hunger Games is taking you as it crochets a pattern of family and survival, love and hate, beauty and grotesque, life and death - each theme briefly hidden and then reappearing like the thread in a crochet garmet.  And finally, it concludes with an ending that leaves you wanting more.<br />  Eulus Dennis, author - Living Between The Line
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I've been playing this on and off for about a month. Graphics are good, story is fun,  rewards and usefull treasures like boss of my own helped me kill the last boss. Going to restart and play again.
B0086700CM|4.0|its that rare kind of game that's addicting but not obsessive its a must have for any one with the time.
0307959856|2.0|I'm not a Jane Austen or Pride and Prejudice devotee, so I read this book for the mystery rather than the pastiche and the historical period. P.D. James never interested me in who done it, why, or how. She ties all ends up tightly, none are left loose, but who cares? This mystery is not a masterpiece but a paint-by-numbers offering.<br /><br />I bought the book as a gift for my wife, a Pride and Prejudice lover, last Christmas. She still hasn't finished it. My daughter had a one-word description after reading it: dull.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun and my kids enjoy playing but the ads are really annoying.  It would be nice if they didn't pop up after every game.
B004U52VPS|4.0|My 10 year old grandson is into Angry Birds anything....He plays the games, likes the stuffed heads and even the candy...It looks like<br />a mindless game to me but I'm not a kid.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this to replace my old cooler when I swapped motherboards.<br />This thing rocks, I have a push pull set-up going with it currently, which seemed to give me the lowest temps.<br />Can't beat this cooler for the money you pay.<br />It performs well, even at high temps during BF3, if you do a custom fan profile you can really keep your CPU cool.<br />Mount is a little tricky at first, but it's solid. Just be sure to tighten everything up well before your try and lock the cooler down.<br /><br />Also, I don't care about how loud fans are, so I'm not even going to comment on how loud it is. I keep this thing cranked so it can do it's job.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so fun! !!!!!!!! On my tablet it plays cityvilles roll!!!!! This game is amazing! It is so fun!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game but it seems like I will run out of thoses cash things soon. the ones u have to pay for. And people say with out them you can get far in the game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was a great companion to the first in the triology.  Enjoyed it very much!  Make sure you read the last one-\\"Fifty Shades Free\\" as well!
1400069289|4.0|Excellent and eye opening book. The book explains the birth and process of habits in an attempt to make the reader aware of his/her own habits. I liked it so much I purchased additional copies for my children.
B00884GR0W|5.0|it is really cool must have app but for me it is kinds hard to throw blocks and I can not make roofs super cool really awesome I can not wait for the next update I hope the add multiplayer that would be awesome
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I had bought this cover for my Kindle Touch and later realized it was for the Kindle Fire. Total oversight on my part. However, I think it fits the Kindle Touch nicely. It's a snug fit, just with a little extra space around the perimeter of the device. This extra space however has been useful for me since it gives me a better grip when holding the device while reading.<br /><br />The construction of the case is pretty good. Stitching looks good, material doesn't seem cheap. The gold leafing looks \\"vintage\\"... intentional or not, it gives it character. The only problem I had with mine is there is a small section on the front that you could visibly see it has separated from the adhesive and hence shows a slight bump. It was like that when I got it and I didn't want to hassle arguing for an exchange, but I would've expected small issues like that not to happen when you're paying $40 for a cover. I guess the novelty of looking like an old book is what you pay for too. Reading a modern ebook reader in what looks like an old classic book? I love it.
B0086700CM|4.0|it's a great game,  but it doesn't always register my swipes in my kindle fire. that gets a lil frustrating after awhile. still, it's free. I've heard there's no end though so it might get boring eventually.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I couldn't put the book down wondering \\"who\\" was the character most off his<br />or her rocker. What a horrible life to wake up every morning and have no memory<br />of anything.<br />It was a very good read but the ending was too \\"story book.\\"
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I absolutely love this case! It's a lot more slender than the otterbox I had before. I've actually already dropped it a couple times, and everything is a-okay. Highly recommend!
B000002LQR|1.0|The quality of this cd was deplorable. It was so damaged that even my computer could not play it. I tried to remedy the scratches various ways without success. I was very disapointed with my purchase.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I opened the box, fished some Corona bottles and wine bottles out of my recycling bin and commenced to scoring. This tool scores glass, esentially weakening it in a very controlled way, so that when utilizing one of the many heating and cooling techniques available, the item separates where you scored. A few bottles did break a little unevenly, but w. more practice and lots of spares, I was able to create a matching set of Corona glasses. Best meathod to separate in my opinion- score, pour boiled tea kettle water slowly over the score line while rotating, then run under already running cold tap water and repeat until the top (or bottom) falls away. I put some cushioning in the bottom of my sink so not to break whatever fell off. It really is that easy. If it's not working for you, you may be doing it wrong after the scoring- the tool works like it's supposed to.
0553801473|5.0|At this point I am really starting to question the reviews I've read for this book (as I did A Feast For Crows), and I'm not just talking about the negative ones on this site.  Something weird is going on here. I see dozens of 1 star reviews but nobody can say anything except \\"boring\\" or \\"Martin has lost his way\\" or \\"the story goes nowhere\\" or whatever. On the flip side of that coin, there are a lot of positive reviews that say the same thing like \\"a real page turner\\" or \\"a great read\\" or \\"can't wait til the next books\\" or \\"hurry up with the next book George\\". Amazon is crawling with these reviews, and people on either side can't specify what they liked or hated.  I get a feeling one side is people really impatient with the time Martin takes between books, and are just being bullies. The other side are people who haven't read the books but want to keep the word of mouth positive on them. Stop with the games and read the books, or just go away and don't read them.<br /><br />Now that I got that out of my system..........<br />There are some legitimate reviews on the site of people who, it seems, have read the book, and while I respect the well written reviews, I still don't understand the hate.  I will try to elaborate without spoiling much for the people who haven't read the book yet.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. The emphasis is more on character this time around (as it was in AFFC), but there is still plenty of action going on:<br />Characters plot and betray as they have from day 1.<br />Surprises abound.<br />Past sins linger in the mind for some, and while others meet their punishment finally.<br />The whereabouts of certain missing characters are revealed. One particular character returns tragically changed and beaten down. The character's story is sad and in typical Martin fashion, you start sympathizing with a character you may have found yourself rooting against in the past. The particular character's storyline also gives us the chance to discover more about another character that is almost as unbearable and repulsive as King Joffery.<br />Dany's Dragons continue to grow with disturbing results.<br />Tyrion returns and his arch takes a strange turn I can't say I saw coming.<br />Jon Snow may be in over his head (in typical Stark fashion) at The Knight's Watch.<br />One or more characters may (or may not have) met their tragic end. One we probably could have saw coming if we thought about it, but didn't.<br />There is more to write about too, but that could take a while.<br /><br />Yes there are a lot of characters but it's not as hard to follow as some would claim. As with the other books, MAKE SURE NOTHING ELSE REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION WHEN YOU PICK IT UP!  It's not that kind of book. None of these books were ever that kind of book. If you don't give the book your undivided attention you will be lost.<br /><br />One last thing: I also don't get all the complaints about Martin's attention to almost every single detail in the world. He has done this in every book, and I can honestly say I have never had a Lord Of The Rings moment where I just screamed because I wanted them to stop singing and leave Tom Bombadill's house.<br /><br />So there you have it. I hope this review helps. The only advice I can give is read it for yourself.  Don't go by the reviews off this site. You may like it, you may not. I don't know. I can only hope I did a service to defend it.  Have not felt this compelled to defend literature in a long time. ADWD and AFFC have brought that out of me.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|Lots have given you the plot so I will not recover that ground.  I have a sister so always enjoy reading about other sister relationships and this one was wonderful. The last section left me with my mouth hanging open.<br />Well done!
0545101417|5.0|I read all three in the series before I knew they were going to be made into movies. Actually, I didn't know whether I'd like them or not, which is why I ordered them one at a time instead of buying the whole series. Each novel pulled me into the next one just as good writing should. I fell in love with this amazing author's style and voice. A wonderful read and a wonderful movie, too! I took my son to see the first movie as soon as it came out.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the best game ever in the world the best game in the world and the coolest game int Thebes world
B000HEWEE4|5.0|One of my personal favorites... a great way to spend a quit weekend bottled up on the sofa with a nice cup of coco, the blanket, & your tv...
1451608659|5.0|Dominique's Off Balance is a telling memoir that engages readers with pre-Olympic, post-Olympic and modern accounts of what she went through as a young athlete and oldest daughter in a complicated family situation.<br /><br />The book is very well written, flowing nicely between past and present stories and truly giving her perspective on all of it. It is both interesting and engaging--the only memoir I have ever read that I couldn't put down.<br /><br />Her book is fantastic and anyone who has or has had any interest in competitive gymnastics MUST read this book.
0446547573|5.0|This was one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks novels. If you love a good story that includes romance, mystery, and elements of suspense without all the trash one normally finds in novels these days, Sparks' novels are a breath of fresh air!
0143119680|5.0|A compelling combination of history and the other worldly. I am really looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B000K7UG34|5.0|Having been there I can honestly say they made this movie as close to the real deal as can be done.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|We loved it.  It was my FIRST Star Trek movie (I know, can you believe it?) and I enjoyed it a lot and didn't think I would.  So, I highly recommend it.  Loved seeing Leonard Nimoy in it too since I remember watching a few episodes as a child with my parents.  ENJOY!
B007V4LKRU|5.0|I have waited long and hard since Nov 78 for something that could at least tie with Hemispheres. The 34 year wait makes this album all the more sweet for me. I give the recording  its just due for the nice guitar /bass mix for starters. Infact  Lee's Bass is everywhere like it belongs in Rush. Alex's lead guitar ,for the first time I can recall, has a live quality in the mix. This kept me tuned carefully to each track listening more intently than any other studio recording thus far.
0307959856|1.0|This is not a Jane Austen story; it is a mystery (and not a very compelling one) using Jane Austen's characters. Badly. There is none of the humor or grace of Austen's writing. Readers looking for an \\"Austeny\\" story would do far better with the lovely [[ASIN:0684843420 Sanditon: Jane Austen's Last Novel Completed]]
0307887448|1.0|This book might go on my least favorite books of all time list. Let me walk you through this.<br /><br />Non-existent characters.<br />The main character likes 80's stuff and is a teenager. He has a best friend, and an online crush. They are aided by two Japanese stereotypes. They fight against a corporate square who kills people. That really is all you learn about these characters. Why do I hate it? No depth. Come on, video game characters have more dimensions than this. This guy makes Edward Cullen seem like he's got the depth of Hamlet. At least Edward had a noticeable voice.<br /><br />Lack of Creativity<br />Every action is based on the work of someone else. Monty Python. George Lucas. Blizzard Entertainment. Having recently written, that's an incredible cop out to me. This guy really hasn't even made a literary world for himself. He just rummaged through pop culture like it was a trash can, selected it, and copied it. Lame.<br /><br />Mary Sue and her Deus Ex Machina<br />I almost puked at the scene that made a villain out of a guy who didn't know 80's culture well. That some sort of joke? Any objective person would say \\"who gives a crap\\" as to what video games came out in 1987. And his bashing of people who call tech support was likewise funny. Can't you look up the problem on the Internet? Uh... That's why I'm calling you. My Internet isn't working. Reminds me of a garbage man who said: \\"you think it's our job to just pick up stuff for you?\\" Yup. It's so obvious this guy isn't able to separate himself from his subject matter. That's to the detriment of the entire book, it makes everything one note. Likewise, everything is \\"solved\\" by the character's 80's pop culture knowledge, which he happens to have in the right amounts at the right times. I'm supposed to believe that 2044 people are obsessed with joust? I can't even interest GTA3 fans in GTA2...<br /><br />Lame Plot Twists-<br />Oh no! Crappy Japan Man 2 died! His trailer park, with a bunch of cardboard cutouts blew up! Just like Star Wars! Eff you.
0399224459|5.0|When I was working at ALA, one of my fellow staff members insisted that I had to read this book.  Right now, during the workday.  This book changed my life.  Right then, I knew that I needed to become a children's librarian!  Not really, but it is fun to share with moms and kids.  It's a natural platform for discussion with young children.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|My mother-in-law recommended this book, and gave it to me in hardback.  It's 933 pages long, so after getting hooked on it within the first 10 pages, I decided it was well worth $10 to get it for my Kindle.<br /><br />I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the book, and it's a nice, even pace.  While the book is set in India, it's not so full of foreign names and concepts that you have to keep a cheat-sheet of who's who and what's what.  I'm also happy to say that the author manages to tell a story without relying on sex, violence, and language I wouldn't use in front of my mother.
1466401885|5.0|Loved the story. Couldn't put the book down!!!  Travis and Abby's story was intriguing and I was hooked in the first chapter.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|This game just tries to be to much.  it gives you so many cheats that there is no point in playing.  the storyline is boring and the graphics are horrid.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Why does it need to update fonts? The other office apps work without having to buy addt'l fonts, not happy with the in-app purchases either, that's messed up!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I am a big Linkin Park fan regardless of critics. This CD was great condition with no scratches. Only downswide was the missing booklet, but other than that, no complaints.
B007SGM084|2.0|I wonder why the kindle edition should cost so much. I probably wouldn't have thought much about it and bought it but a friend showed me that it costs just £9.89 on the amazon UK site (which i had thought would be more).<br />I do want to get the book but, thinking seriously...
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is a terrific, terrific read, a suspense thriller with great characters and a satisfying (if disturbing) story.  Gillian Flynn is the real deal and deserves all the hype she has gotten.  Nick and Amy Dunne, from the outside and at the outset, seem to have the perfect marriage, but then it all comes crumbling apart, just at the time the US economy starts crumbling.  Interestingly, both characters have gotten their wealth through the publishing industry, but that wealth fades, and the beautiful couple must move from New York City to Missouri.  One morning, Amy disappears under seemingly violent circumstances.  Nick becomes a suspect in her disappearance.  The novel is narrated from two vantage points:  Nick in the present and Amy in the past, leading to present day.  Both may or may not be unreliable narrators, but the story they tell is fiendishly compelling.  Gone Girl is a real page turner; quite a terrific read.  Enjoy!
B004H78NOC|5.0|What a great lttle miniseries this is, TREMENDOUS ACTING, NOT ONLY DAME JUDI DENCH, THE ENTIRE CAST IS SO REAL!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|If you want to relive your college years in a \\"hot bad boy\\" sort of way.... READ IT.  YOU WILL LOVE IT.  I did.  I am now rereading it.  Many people are saying it is a \\"teen-version\\" of 50 Shades of Grey.  No. No. No.  This book was a great read reagardless of your age.  Other than the bad language, this did not have erotic scenes in it.  Just simple love scenes.  It is a GREAT READ.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Looks and plays great on the Kindle Fire. Easy to learn, difficult to master. One of the most original tower defense games I've seen.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Quite simply, this is a fantastic CPU Cooler.  Or whatever they're calling it now.  My LGA775 Quad Core CPU was running around 45C idle, and as high as 60C under load (which is stupid hot by the way).  I had decent airflow, plenty of fans, and it still wasn't good enough.<br /><br />I installed this new CPU Cooler after seeing a ridiculous amount of 5 star reviews (over 3,000 on Newegg, and still a 5 Egg Product).  It is now idling at 29C, though I admit I did blow the computer out with an air duster, and may have contributed.  Very simple to install, but the instructions included are a bit 'meh'.  Might be helpful for a novice to follow the mentioned videos (in other reviews).<br /><br />*As an aside, my previous Cooler had the wonderful feature of the 4 Push Pin connection to the Motherboard.  For serious, this is the stupidest and most painfully designed system ever.  (So many bloody knuckles and swearwords as I fiddled with it to get it all set up again after bumping it many times....)  This cooler uses the 'behind the board' setup, so it does not require further adjustment after installation.<br /><br />**Additional note: this is MUCH quieter than my previous setup.  120MM fan, but still quiet!<br /><br />All in all, very very happy with this.
031603441X|5.0|This is a very long book, but very interesting, filled with great stories and pictures of the Rolling Stones and many other famous musicians.  Although a fan of their music, I had heard so many stories over the years about the Rolling Stones and Keith Richards that I had a very negative and biased impression against Keith.  I was not prepared for what at least appears to be one of the most open and honest self-portrayals of a rock star (or anyone) that I've read.  Keith \\"names\\" names and I came away impressed with Keith's honesty, humbleness, musicianship and with a new respect for his role in the Rolling Stones and history of music.  Great story for anyone who is a fan, or for those interested in reading a first hand account of the one of the greatest bands ever.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|With such famous names in this movie one would think it is respectable.  Unfortunately, one must look closer to see that it is produced, directed, etc. by well known adult film and magazine persons.  I was not careful and returned it as I do not want porn in my home.  Others may like it.  This was made long before the famous names became famous.

B0081L37Z0|4.0|There was some style to this film that I was not expecting. Although there was some surreal Lethal Weapon-esque moments I did enjoy the overall humor and chemistry between Jonah and Channing. As a fan of The Office and Parks & Recreation I got the jokes and enjoyed the cameos, you might too.
B00005K3OT|5.0|DVD works great, and the movies great! Chocolat is one of my all time favorite movies - I saw it for the first time when I was on a bus traveling from Lyon to Avignon. And don't worry, Johnny Depp is not the real star here. It's a story about a mother and her daughter and their mystical power on chocolate and people!
B003N6VBQK|5.0|the doctor who series is the best series in the UNIVERSE!! even though the tenth doctor is my favorite the 9th is very kick butt!!!
0743486285|5.0|The book took a little longer then expected to come. That I was not so thrilled about. The book itself is awesome! This book kept me so intrigued that I read it in full in two days. Everything was amazing from the actual material (this is a good book to make someone who wants to try drugs read. They will not touch that crap after reading his journal entries) to the way the material was presented (page design/layout and font color/size). This book is definitely worth your time and money :)
B001NLKT60|4.0|I typically don't like the second book in trilogies, because they largely setup everything for the final book without much happening. This book was definitely not lacking in action and provided answers to a lot of questions I had from the first book along the way. Lisbeth Salander's character growth throughout this story was interesting to watch and though she was largely on her own through most of this book by her own choice, Mikael Blomkvist's loyalty was unfailing and I loved his character here even more than in the first book. I look forward to reading the third and final book in this series, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

1451683405|3.0|Harris tells us all our decisions/choices come to us from our unconscious & that our unconscious is a mix of genetic & previous environmental influences.<br />But isn't one of our previous environmental influences ourselves?  Isn't it possible to currently manipulate our unconscious future?  Harris uses weight loss as an example in book -- that our success at weight loss is dependent on our current unconscious status.  But what if we currently arrange for our future unconscious to accept what will be a surely successful strategy?  We can't?  Then our current being has no influence on our future being & his theory kind of collapses.<br /><br />I also found the promise of revealing some kind of new way of seeing reality to be lacking -- there's no pay-off for knowing there's no free will.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|\\"Banga\\" the new CD by Patti Smith is beautiful, understated, worldly wise and full of childlike innocence. Effervescent in places, dirge like in others the music surrounds the listener like a delicate tapestry. Patti's unmistakable voice is in fine form and her lyrics have lost none of their strange poetic elegance. Founding Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye is still the core of the sound and Television's Tom Verlaine adds his unique vision to the mix. Hard to believe Patti is 65 years old. She is a wise old spirit who somehow remains eternally young.  Welcome back old friend. May your spirit shine brightly for a long time to come.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Terrific movie and a good story line. The characters had good development even the monster. I would recommend the movie to teenagers, adults, plumbers, guy next door, cat owners and families of less than 6.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like this app because you can costumize your restaurant. Also because you can visit other restaurants to tip or socialize or both

B004MPJZ1O|1.0|I recently saw it on Netflix instant and it's not the rape scenes or the horrible acting and plot that makes me hate this flick.It's the ideas Perceived and not perceived;You have a ugly feminist \\"Author\\" who goes to the backwoods and wouldn't you know she gets into trouble.Nevermind that she was skinnydipping in broad daylight and doing the typical \\"fem\\" thing of that era,you know all liberated.(It's worked well huh? Spread of std's,Families nonexistent,Morality is nilch.GreatJob Liberalism).<br />So then what happens anyone with a brain can tell you,they do horrible things that she does not deserve,then of course she flips it out(liberals are all peace and love except when they are part of the SDS or Manson)and ironically she is taking the law into her own hands!(I thought Liberalism was about peace not fighting,she goes all out even killing the Kid who basically has Mental problems.No mercy there.)And the movie ends,The Message-it's not a horror movie nor even your typical slasher flick no it's Yeah,Let's take it to Men in this Movie that should be on AutoRepeat on Lifetime,Perfect for the Woman who does not shave her Armpits.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So many games to choose. Keeps my kids having fun. I enjoy playing when I have time. Love that I got it free.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run! One of my top favorites....what are the animals chasing the hunter?  I have one recommendation, maybe you can make the same one but unlock different explorers like for girls.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I delayed reading it because of the hype surrounding it and ended up loving the entire series. This was definitely my favorite of the 3 books. Great characters and engaging story line.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|a calculator right at your fingertips. very basic and works very well. if you're bad at math like myself,  then this is an app for you! never know when you'll need it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It originally was best. It opened and stayed open where programs were downloading. - more time to rrlook at. the weather. conditions. I get my face into articles and forget the weather. id changing around you. For that original expedience I thank you on this Kindle Fire. robert2muirhead@gmail.com
B008GXHOFW|3.0|it is ok. don't get me wrong it wasn't terrinal but if you have the x box version this is ok
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the entire series!  The ending was a little cheesy,  could have been better but overall I was addicted!
B004LROMWU|5.0|I was not sure about Falling Skies, but to my surprise it is a fantastic series, the human element in the show is a breath of fresh air, not just all CGI and aliens, highly recommended.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like putting puzzles together then you will love this app. This is a fun &amp; easy way to do a puzzle without all the hassle real puuzles cause. I highly recommend.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|The Jet Flash Drive is excellent.  With a great amount of storage space I can take it with me anywhere I go and know my data is safe.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book!! The sex scenes where a bit tame but still good. The sexual tension was almost unbearable and I felt butterflies in my stomach for them! Well written & I highly recommend!!
B004SKJTY6|1.0|It's nothing, don't waste the electrons to download it.  It's nothing more than an advertisement for the movie (which was great).  Shame on Amazon for presenting it as a \\"movie\\".  Total scam
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i am an ten year old girl and i hate reading. But the hunger games is the best and i cannot wait to read the next one. I got this book from  book fair. I got the last one there. love the charactes and the story. Get the book!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not a bad download. fun to try and unlock all the games.  some are harder than other. easy to use. I haven't had any issues with it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this is a really good ammo to have on the appstore and great this to pass the time while you are leveling!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I actually would give this book 41/2 stars ..I read reviews for Gone Girl in People magazine and  a few others. I downloaded a sample on my kindle and was hooked from the first page.The story  begins with a couple on the day of their anniversary.....and what a day it was! Each chapter is told alternately from  each character. You find yourself second guessing the storyline with each chapter...\\" could it have been this character? What about this one?\\".... I could not put this book down. The ONLY thing I was disappointed with was the ending. I t seemed to just drop off and I wanted a few more answers. ...All in all this is one of my favorite books this summer. I have recommended it to all my friends and one of my best friends keeps asking me as she reads it\\" just tell me,  was it the dad? The friend?\\"  I won't tell her. It is fun to just kept guessing and find out. Read this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the game you need to get it! you don't know what you are missing.. I am addicted to the game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Had the app for several weeks. noe and it is working very well Accurate data and spit on radar images. very happy with this app and would recommend it.
0307730697|5.0|This. Book just oozed with a spiritual tone until  Adam draws his last breath. Could not put the book down
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool does something that I love: it raises questions, answers them, and in answering raises even more question.  And not like the TV show \\"Lost\\", where the questions raised are arbitrary bids to stall for time.  Oh no.  Behind every line of this book you can feel all of the different gears and bits working and moving.  The world feels real; there are no convenient moments, no deus ex machinas.  Just very real, human characters knocking about in this incredible setting.<br /><br />Seriously, it's the best book I've read all year.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|In The Amazing Spider-Man you are Andrew Garfield as you swing around the city beating up the Radicals, a ruthless gang trying to make weapons out of the syrum that Dr. Curt Conner's has in the story. this app (or should I say game)  tells the story of Spider-Man and the Lizard. this story is a tiny bit different than the movie The Amazing Spider-Man just a tiny bit. I know this because I've seen the movie twice! over all I give this app 5 out of 5 and the movie 4 out of 4
B007SYWFRM|3.0|my son has this on his ipad and it is awesome.  I am 3 updates behind on the kindle fire. I have half the features.  I don't think it is fair. we pay the same rate for acorns but are completely neglected. you don't have to buy acorns to enjoy the game but I choose to and am angry I don't have the updates.
034580404X|5.0|I ordered these books because my sister had read them & said they were really good. To say that I completely agree with her opinion does not begin to describe how I feel about these books. I absolutely loved them!! They are definitely not for the close minded. The story was incredibly well written & developed leaving no questions unanswered. I absolutely could not put them down until I finished all 3. I will continue to recommend these to friends & hope that the rumor of a possible movie is true!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|It was fascinating and fabulous seeing Michael as he was rehearsing for the tour that sadly never happened.  Loved \\"Thriller\\" and really the whole show.  Unfortunately, I had to turn the sound up and down manually on \\"Earth Song\\" and other places as the sound was that uneven. Other than that, it was awesome.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|fun game. a lot if different types of puzzles to figure out. not to hard and not to easy. just right.I've. gotta write more so here it is ;)
B006KSAPV0|5.0|By far, this is my favorite film by Almodovar. It's an amazing movie for folks interested in the intersection of sex and gender mixed while drawn into the protagonist perverse quest for narasistic revenge. Highly recommend.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|YOU DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THE GUY IN TE BEGINNING. I THINK THE SHOW REFLECTED HOW WE LET PRIDE RUN OUR LIFE AND MAKE BAD CHOICES. THE MOVIE IS LIKE A GREAT MISTREY BOOK CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO THE NEXT EPPISODE.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I liked this book from the first chapter! The title couldn't be more fitting! It was entertaining and kept my interest through the whole book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hours of endless brain teasing fun great for all ages highly recommended i play this games every day all day
B007RKPO84|5.0|My favorite German thrash band returns with more blistering tracks. They show no signs of weakening.<br />Favorite tracks? All, and the artwork is sick. Its refreshing to see these guys still going strong. Crushing guitars, vox, etc. So far this is on the top 5 of 2012. Thanks for ruining my speakers, fellas.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Just like the editorial review of the first season of Falling skies states,There was no shortage of movies and TV shows about aliens invading Earth before Falling Skies came along. Heck, I've probably seen every last one of them at some point. Up until Falling Skies, my favorite sci-fi show of this nature has always been V. What sets Falling Skies apart-however-is the fact that, with each episode, you become more invested in the characters and the tension slowly mounts. You realize that there really is a threat facing everyone now that the invasion has happend and we lost against them. When we catch up to Tom Mason, he and Capt. Weaver(chief soldier, major hard-a$$)are tryng to figure out how to protect what humans are left and how to fight back against a vastly superior alien force, called Skitters(a group of spider-like beings from outer space).  What neither he nor anyone else can figure out is exactly what the aliens' agenda might be. It isn't until the final episode that we finally get some clarity as to what that might be.<br /><br />While the first season is a great one and is worth getting, it does suffer some major flaws in its' execution. One flaw is the fact that there's very little special effects. What FX there are aren't anything to wrote home about. I've seen better in movies on the SyFy Channel, hate to admit. Not only that but most episodes tend to be too talkified with little to no excitement to keep us interested. Course, it goes back to what I was saying that, with each episode-- you become more invested in the characters and want to see what happens next with them.<br /><br />Sure, we've seen this story a miliion times but Falling Skies is worth getting into.
B007Y2W44W|4.0|Been a fan since their debut but this...well it is heavy and melodic but this pales in comparison to their previous efforts. The guitars seem tame and the vocals are drowned out. The precision is off.<br />I loved the sound of Chaining the Iniquitous and Ethno-musicological Cannibalisms but Nile could have done so much better. At least they are doing something different, unlike 99% of bands.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Im so glad I purchqsed this CD. I've been listening to her music on youtube and since I had loved every single one, I figured I'd love every other song on the CD. And I did! About the shipping, it was faster than how I usually get things from amazon. The back of the CD case was scratched 3 times all the way through the thickness of the case by about 3/4 inch each. But since the CD was unscathed Id give this a five. That could have been USPS...
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is very good. There are a wide variety of cardbacks and settings to choose from. The play is easy. The only reason I did not give five stars is the annoying advertisements before nearly every game. I would rather pay than deal with the constant ads.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The first book was interesting and kept my attention. I quite enjoyed it. As I progressed to the other two books<br />they started to read like glorified Harlequin romance novels and I found a lot of the dialogue and situations repetitious. With each book it seemed like the author ran out of fresh ideas. I felt the second and third books just fizzled out. She should have ended the series after book one with a slight alteration of book ones ending.
1439156816|2.0|One piece of advice Stephen King offers in this, his 2000 rumination about the fiction writer's craft as he experienced it, is that a writer can't be afraid to chuck a draft after a couple hundred pages and start again if it's not working. \\"[E]ven when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings.\\"<br /><br />I can't help but think he should have followed his own advice here.<br /><br />During the summer of 1999, in the middle of writing this book, King was run over by a Dodge van. For the next few months, he lived in constant pain, his right leg below the knee described as being like \\"marbles in a sock.\\" With his wife Tabitha's help, he found the will to return to his writing desk, to write this very book in fact. With the experience of writing came the kind of joy and renewed sense of purpose that drove him to endure and prevail.<br /><br />All this would have made a great starting point for a memoir/rumination on the nature of writing, except for the fact King was already well into this book when the accident happened, a book that starts with a lengthy-enough memoir about his discovery and pursuit of fiction-writing in his youth. To chuck all that would mean losing a lot of work, at a time when just sitting down was painful. What is billed on the cover and title as a kind of \\"how-to\\" book becomes instead a short peek behind the wizard's curtain sandwiched by two large pieces of autobiography that use writing more as a lens for King viewing his life before and after he was hit.<br /><br />King makes the point more than once that he likes to write without an outline, with no idea where the plot will go. This obviously works for him but is probably bad advice to the layman. I offer this book as Exhibit A in that regard.<br /><br />When he gets around to talking about writing itself, he offers some good notes (\\"I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs\\") but it doesn't really get to the heart of anything. Most writers won't be able to take their writing to the next level anyway, he grudgingly admits, as what God gives you to work with only can only be raised so high. Since most geniuses are crazy and miserable company, you are probably better off, he offers as consolation, but I don't think buyers of the book were hungry for insights like this.<br /><br />Another signature moment: King says his ideas come to him like fossils buried in the ground, that when a reporter expressed skepticism King told him it didn't matter if he didn't believe him, as long as King believed it. As a reader, I find that a fascinating insight as to how the man works. As a writer, I have no idea what he's talking about.<br /><br />For King's legion of fans, his \\"constant readers,\\" there will no doubt be much to enjoy in King's tales of youthful story rejection (he posted the letters on a nail in his bedroom and treasured the ones which came with a brief personal note of encouragement) and how he experienced the writing of some of his best-known books. \\"The Shining,\\" for example, turned out to have a hidden message directed at the author himself, which he talks about with refreshing candor.<br /><br />\\"On Writing\\" is a pleasant time-passer with some bits of real interest scattered about, but King never seems to find his focus. With many if not most of King's other books, you don't have to be a fan of his going in to enjoy them. Not so here.take their writing to the next level anyway, he grudgingly admits, as what God gives you to work with only can only be raised so high.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|about 2 months I was in a place where I had given up on ever having \\"good sex\\" with my husband. Both of us are each other's \\"firsts\\" and I had come to the conclusion that I just don't like sex or kink or whatever.<br /><br />Then I read this book or rather this trilogy and WOW. I don't want to be too graphic, but we have essentially gotten a hotel room or some other means of getting out of our apartment away from our roommates a total of 20 of the last 50 days... or something like that. ;-) We also visited a \\"BDSM Club\\" - which we loved. And have spent a lot of money on rope, chains, and toys. I LOVE MY LIFE! :-)<br /><br />About the actual book My Man and I found it funny, enjoyable, and oh so hot!!! We would have to put the book down and start making out just to release some of the energy. :) Now, I have a major spanking fetish which we already were VERY aware of, so that may have helped.<br /><br />If you liked this book you may also like Kristen Ashley's \\"Knight\\"
B000JMKQX0|3.0|World War Z has a very interesting concept. A UN official is recording oral history from the recently finished war with the undead. Well, the war that's wrapping up with the undead. Some of the characters get better dialogue than others, some get better characterization than others, but on the whole it's pretty good. I guess the one thing I didn't really care for is that it seems like each character gets a page or two to himself, then it's off to someone else. It's an interesting technique to show a broad slice of an ongoing multinational event, but it leaves you wondering if any of the character aside from the UN narrator have done much developing, and it's harder to find closure.<br /><br />Obviously this may sound like sour grapes on my part, but I don't think Max Brooks minds at all.
0345803485|1.0|I decided to purchase book one after hearing all the talk about the series.  It was not for me. Decided not to read the others in the trilogy.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I cannot say that this book is a literary masterpiece it isn't but for a bit of adenture and fun it was worth the money. The whole trilogy can be read in about a week and it is really enjoyable!!!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I thought this book was excellent.  Read it in one sitting.  Getting ready to read the next one.  Highly recommend
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a well designed, very smooth puzzle game.  Simple but I am only through 20 boards by now.  I will enjoy finishing the game and figuring out the perfect scores on every level.  Very smooth on my Droid X.
B00723NWJE|1.0|I never did throw a cd in the trash, god i was so disappointed, if you love Norah Jones, and the kind of music she did before, don't buy this one, one song after another one were all the same, soooooo slow, i kept thinking the next one will be good, no so boring, maybe she was experimenting but in my case a big flop, very depressing
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the Omnibus (Wool 1-5) in 2 days and then got the prequel, First Shift, and read that in  a day.  Not since The Game of Thrones series (books 1-3) by George RR Martin have I enjoyed fantasy fiction as much.  This is a very interesting premise for a series and I can hardly wait for another offering from this author to find out what's going on in Silo 18, Silo 17, and now Silo 1 as well.
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|The performances in this film are compelling and the cinematography is brilliant. These elements alone may be enough to qualify this as a worthwhile investement of your time. The story is an uneven mix of flash-backs and flash-forwards that only serve to highlight the selfish nature of the protagonist. It became difficult for me to sympathize with Chris as he continued on his journey of self discovery while dismissing the feelings of anyone who formed an attachement with him along he way.Every move he makes is motivated by his own feelings, often at the expense of any who care for him.<br /> The true story this film is based on is covered pretty well, but there are enough factual inaccuracies that i strongly recommend you look up the facts behind the story. If you need Chris to be an inspiration or a hero, the facts may challenge this perception. But if you want to know the truth, you will find that there are strongly divided opinions on the events depicted.
B0079J28NC|5.0|This DVD is even better than the original VHS I had. I love listening to re-mastered music of the Beatles.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not stop reading this book! When some coworkers told me about this book, I wasn't too sure about it. It didn't sound like my type of book. I'm mostly into thrillers and mysteries, not into love stories. To me, underneath all the layers is a love story. I could not stop reading this book. I read it on my Kindle App on my Android. This is a trilogy that I can read again and again. I'm naming my next child if it's a boy, Christian. This book messes with your mind, but in a great way. Would LOVE to see a movie? Maybe starring Matt Bomer.
6304708521|5.0|This DVD is not the best as far as the story line but the music will always be the greatest bt the Beatles.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|I have seen a lot of documentaries of George Harrison but this one is the best yet. George is the one Beatle's that wasn't given proper credit. I think he was just as good as John and Paul.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book!!! can't wait for part2!!!<br />You get hooked right from Chapter 1 and don't want to put it down<br />until it's over!
0738727326|3.0|The artwork of this deck is lovely and shows some creative approaches to interpreting tarot.  Unfortunately, I have found them very difficult to read with due to the combination of their small size and the abundance of pale pink and gray tones.  When I lay the out it looks like a jumble of pale pastel swirls.  I packed them back up and stuck them in my dresser.
0618918248|5.0|Many people criticize Dawkins for being condescending and arrogant. I find there are times when he seems slightly condescending in debates but not in this book. Ignore the messenger, focus on the message (content). This is a great book, very passionate, and is very thought provoking. There is a reason it is so popular!

0062073281|3.0|I love Lauren Conrad. So maybe I'm giving this a better review than what it's worth but I'd probably read it again. I loved the LA Candy series, mainly because I knew it was about Laurens life. The Fame Game was a decent book but I don't think as good as the LA Candy series. I felt that there wasn't much story and it was predictable. I know I said I'd read it again but probably because I love Lauren. Would I recommend it, if your a lauren lover, than yes. If your looking for a good fun read, maybe not so much.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 7 yr old loves this its a game we can play together! just wish it was easier to exit.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. I liked Tidal as well, but found her other CDs disappointing. This one might even be better than Tidal. The music is really original and filled with hooks. I particularly like the last song, Hot Knife. Give it a chance, you won't regret it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If it were possible, I would give this book ZERO stars. I honestly can't understand what the hype is all about. This is the absolute worst book I ever read.<br /><br />The characters are unbelievable and annoying. The dialogue is immature. The writing is clumsy and just plain BAD. The plot (is there a plot?) is laughable. The sex (which I can only assume is the main attraction to this book) is boring. Yes, I said BORING!!! I actually started skipping through the numerous sexual encounters because they were so poorly written. Best seller?! Seriously?!<br /><br />I forced myself to finish this horrible book because I thought I was missing something. The more I read, the more angry I became! I can't believe I wasted $10 on this CRAP! By the end of the book, I wanted to murder Christian, Ana, her subconscious, and her inner goddess (really?!). I also wanted to give the author a good butt kicking for insulting my intelligence!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Save the $10 and read the reviews. They are much more entertaining than this book. I wish I had my $10 back!!!
B008C20TDG|3.0|I find it hard to believe that there are 130+ positive reviews and only 2 negative?  Looking at those positive reviews it seems that there are a lot of Paleo 'followers' who have tried this plan. It can't be that 'everyone' had such a great experience?  I suspect that the authors told their seminar attendees about the upcoming book and to rate it highly.<br /><br />I read the Primal Blueprint a couple of years back and was intrigued by the idea of 'Paleo.'  I'm still somewhat skeptical that somehow our pre-agricultural ancestors were somehow healthier. There can be no solid evidence as there are no cavemen around anymore.<br /><br />Nevertheless I saw this book mentioned on Mark's Daily Apple blog and decided to buy it.  It has very good information distilled into understandable chunks.  I am definitely going to try at least parts of it.  I'm not sure that a 30-day purge is workable for many.  It seems unsustainable due to the discipline and expense. A lot of these ingredients are hard to locate and when you do they cost a bundle.  This still seems to be a diet and diets (as we all know) don't work over the long term.  The authors views contradict some of the ideas in the Primal Blueprint such as total elimination of things like yogurt.  No alcohol?  Wow!! Red wine is an essential staple of the French and Italian diet and I don't see them having the problems that we Americans have.  In fact it seems that the Mediterranean diet regions are those with the healthiest populations.  And they eat lots of bread and pasta, too!<br /><br />I have to wonder if the Europeans laugh at all of these faddish things we try here in the States?<br /><br />And while the authors do a good job of researching and providing information I don't really see their professional qualifications to speak on nutrition?<br /><br />Overall, I found it to be a good educational book on nutrition.  I'll read it again for more pointers and advice.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Wow!  I was afraid to read this but I am so impressed with how Jaycee Lee was able to describe her life as a child from a child's perspective and then to share her growth as a woman, mother, survivor and a beautiful person inside and out.  It's amazing how she learned to adapt to her horrible prison and survive something so evil and come out so smart, loving and amazing. I hope the evil captors are forced to read this or listen to the audible version day after day. After seeing all the failures from the system I think the only way to keep innocent children safe is to NOT give these sick monsters another chance in life. Adults should know right from wrong and to violate an innocent child should never be forgiven or forgotten. They should never get an opportunity to be free again to manipulate the system or any one. They should never be given any chance to harm someone's baby or put a child through this.<br /><br />Our system is wrong!<br /><br />Thank you for finding the strength to share your life with us Jaycee. The biggest thing that I got from reading your story is how precious life is and how beautiful you make it to be alive and appreciate things when you think you have nothing to appreciate. Those sick monsters had an angel living in their \\"back yard\\" and will never understand that.<br /><br />This book doesn't try to focus on the sickness that took place but she does tell the story. It focuses on the survival and growth of a beautiful little girl and how she grew up in pure hell and figured out how to survive from day to day and become one of the most admirable and precious humans on earth.<br /><br />I think sharing her growth after it was stripped from her is a gift from her to all of us. I hope she continues to write more. I believe she will be and do everything she dreamed.<br /><br />It's heartbreaking to think that she cared for their feelings in the way that she did. I hope she can truly learn to be more selfish. I think it's great that she chose to help others and animals. This lady is an angel.  I hope her mother can have some influence on our system to keep pedophiles from ever getting a second chance. It's pretty obvious that these monsters are sick and can not be rehabilitated.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a page turner you can't put it down. It's a great fairytale love story that all women wish we can have.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Had not thought I'd like this movie, but my 10yo son begged for it at his birthday sleepover party. It was surprisingly good, and the boys all loved it. I don't think they \\"got\\" alot of the plot points, but they sure were entertained!
B0086700CM|5.0|really fun and I think that everyone who tries it will absolutely love it and if you do please rate it
0345803485|1.0|I borrowed this book due to my curiosity over all the hype it's been generating. I TRIED to finish it, but my education, maturity, and common sense kept getting in the way! I didn't expect Shakespeare, but I at least expect the book to be somewhat readable, nevermind PLAUSIBLE. Unlike Anastasia, MY inner Goddess has STANDARDS.<br /><br />I have a nagging suspicion that this book was born of a backroom party bet to see if literary crap can be hyped onto the best seller list. I don't know who WON, but I it certainly wasn't ME.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This is a \\"GREAT\\" Cd. So glad We have it as an addition to our collection. With the fabulous<br />Guitar from Derek & the Smokey Vocals of Susan.They also have a great Band to support them too.<br />What a chemistry & some great Blues. Looking forward to hearing about more success's & new<br />release's from them.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I like this cd but I think the jams sound like something that has been done before and somebody did better. Give me some more creativity, and let loose, rather than the slow spacey stuff. Other parts I liked better. Check with Bonnie for some pointers.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Liked the movie. Seeing the shots of the Borg also made the movie for me. Classic MI action and did not disappoint me.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. have on kindle and ipod and just cant stop playing. super addicting but a few glitches. sometimes the run smote doesn't turn, it just runs of edge. lags not bad at all.
B0073XORLU|4.0|Finally a new album with new material! However one has to be a die hard JT fan like me to enjoy it and it requires a while to develop a liking (but so did TAB1). It takes guts to write and publish a sequal to that great piece of rock history TAB 1. Ian Anderson is not only a great song writer but a great story teller and a bit of a poet too. The only regret is that Martin Barre is not playing lead guitar on this album. Florian is a great young guitarist but unlike Martin he has not been influential in Tull song arrangements over decades and is not \\"essential Tull\\". The absence of Doane Perry on drums is also noted. On the other hand, the album cover suggests that it is a Ian Anderson solo project.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get this game!!! I play it sooooooo much!!!! I highly recommend this fun little game or perhaps fun little 101 game!!!!! its free so BUY IT!!!!
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie is awesome. It is one of (in my opinion) Liam Neeson's best, and i love Luc Besson whether he writes or directs. His movies (The Fifth Element, From Paris with Love, The Transporter movies, Le Femme Nikita, The Professional, The Big Blue) are one's that i love to watch over and over.<br /> I only wish there were a lot more of Bryan Mills in the world so they could take out more of these scumbags who kidnap these girls, drug them up and have them turned into prostitutes, and once these girls are of no use to them anymore they throw them away like a piece of trash. All mothers and fathers of daughters need to watch this movie. I would never allow my 17 year old daughter to go alone with her friend and visit a country she doesn't know much about. I am just angered that this is still going on, human trafficking needs to be something of the past. Even in the United States we have human trafficking and this movie just opens peoples eyes to this disgusting trade. If i had the skills and training that Bryan Mills did, i would do the same thing for my child that he did for his.
B005J4ASDG|1.0|Let me say that I love the movies, and I love the soundtrack recordings that accompanied them. I assumed that this would be the movie themes set to a classical symphonic structure, ala Beethoven and Brahms.<br />I assumed wrong. It's nothing more than a mashup of the movie themes, crammed together in the order they were used in the movie, and called \\"movements\\". It might have been interesting if the arranger had given them a different slant, but it's practically a note for note recreation of the soundtracks. And do you really want to hear an Annie Lennox sound-a-like doing Into the West?<br />If you already have the soundtracks, you don't need this set. If you don't have the soundtracks, buy them instead.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love this book.I love nicholas sparks. He writes good books. So good that they turn into movies. I can't wait to see the movie for this book.
B00729GQ0A|3.0|I received this book when the author did a Twitter giveaway contest (which I thought was awesome, it was Hangman!). I was excited to add it to my long \\"To Be Read\\" list. When I finally got to it, I was disappointed with the first 70% of the book. The main character, Sophia, is supposed to be a 22-year-old college graduate, but she acts much more like a 16-year-old girl. It was beyond annoying. The story is written in the first person, so we have the pleasure of copious amounts of \\"telling, not showing.\\" Sophia is attracted to a supernatural man, Charles, which is evident in her actions, but because the reader knows her thoughts, we're beaten over the head with her feelings. How many times can a person tell us about the \\"heat\\" or \\"warmth\\" they feel when someone touches them? I wish this was the only thing that was repetitive, but Sophia feels the need to really make sure we understand every single emotion she's feeling by way of telling us over and over. And when she's not doing that, she telling us exactly what she/other characters are wearing, because that somehow matters.<br /><br />I will say that the last 30% of the book was very well written. The only issue I had was that Sophia's gift to read others' thoughts robbed the reader of \\"seeing\\" how other characters were feeling/reacting because Sophia would just tell us. But for the most part, all of the loose ends were tied up and the action/battle scenes were rivoting. It's almost like someone else wrote them. Maybe the author matured as she wrote the story, but I wish she would have went back and reworked the beginning. The story deserved it and I SO wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it's unlikely I'll read the next in the series or anything else by this author, even though I enjoyed the overall story.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love temple run!! It never gets old! Just like the app on the Apple stores!! Its amazing with the big screen on Kindle Fire!!
0307887898|5.0|Okay, not to get too crazy about this, but I just finished the Audio version of this, and ordered the print version yesterday. It made me seriously reconsider finishing my MBA this Fall. It is that good. It summed up in a concise and much more clear way much of my marketing and entrepreneurship classes. It just makes so much sense. One warning: it will change the way you think about your current operations. I've been recommending it to all of my friends and coworkers. If I had the power, I'd make everyone in my company read it. One of my new favorites.
034580404X|1.0|This is probably the worst writing I have ever read! I couldn't wait to finish it, not because I thought it was awesome like the millions of fans out there that think this is the best trilogy out there, but because I really wanted to move on and read something else! What a waste of my time, money and energy. Please pick something else rather than this garbage to read! EL James is the worst writer out there! How on earth did this trilogy make it to the NYT Bestseller list? Readers who find this trilogy amazing REALLY need to expand their knowledge base and reading level. These books are for suckers!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|entertaining. lots of ads but not hard to avoid. I dig it. there is a good variety of games to play throughout the entire app.
B007SGM084|1.0|Kind of ironic that the main character was involved in editing, as these books were in need of a good edit. By the time I started the third I was annoyed by the repetitive phrases and themes. I think the three could have been distilled down to one fine novel.  If I could do it over I would have read the first and avoided the rest.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I got the game on Thursday and I loved it but on Friday it wouldn't even open up so its an OK app<br /><br />  SO IF U WANT TO GET IT I WOULD SAY MAYBE
B005FDWIGQ|5.0|Great show! No problems downloading onto my Kindle Fire.  The quality was great! Of course, I wish TV shows were a little cheaper to purchase...like maybe $.99.  :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love all the game choices! I haven't been able to play any other game cause this one has me hooked!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian is Jillian! Tough, do it or die trying! But she really seems to care! I did level 1 and struggled a bit because some moves feel like they are never going to end! If you like her, you will like this workout! She will have you kicking your own butt - literally! LOL!

B0000X61UU|5.0|The reason I love celebrity workouts is because they hire really good trainers! You see her trainer every now & then or you hear him in the background coaching her. Here again all new/different exercises! This is a dance free workout that has a very different cardio segment and then ab & floor work and upper body work. It's quite challenging! It's very visual as the scene changes often to different places with Cindy in different outfits. She's not a big talker or motivator but she's inspirational to look at & workout with! She does every exercise in sets of ten (except abs - they are in sets of 20) and then changes to something else. It moves quickly so there is no boredom. The music is good. I really like this workout!!!
0441013597|5.0|I fell into the DUNE universe for about five years back in the 1970's. Since a few years ago I read the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson prequels and two sequels. Lately I have been revisiting the original six Dune novels. OK, so I have a lot of time on my hands. I am a big fan of long form science fiction. I got into it in high school in the 50's with Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series. DUNE is far more interesting once the reader continues beyond the opening story to follow \\"The Golden Path\\". Some reviewer or other said the story was humorless. What could be more humorless than \\"1984\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"?  In DUNE the human race just barely escaped more than a thousand years of slavery under the oppression by their own machines. During the following millennia all human institutions had to be remade. I see the situation as similar to the Renaissance after a thousand years of darkness at the fall of Rome. All authority was in the hands of closely held insular institutions and conflict was only resolved by war or alliances of families. Religions and secret societies ruled for another 500 years. In DUNE Chronicles we get a much expanded and detailed version. As a result of the Machine Revolution and the rebuilding the human race had evolved in unexpected directions and then settled into  a violent form of stagnation. In DUNE an unexpected element appears and unhinges all that stagnation and releases pent-up passions. Thus the human  race begins a desperate race against total destruction by unknown forces. Reading Dune is much like reading Moby Dick or War and Peace, much elaborate dialogue and description building to the occasional climax.
B001E45XT4|3.0|First of all, I found this headset to have great sound quality and I really enjoy using it as a gaming headset. The built in tuck-away mic is also a cool feature and has good clear quality. However, my gripe is that on some days I need to use the headset to make Skype calls that can last extended periods of time, and I find the headset gets extremely uncomfortable because the way the earpieces are insulated can make it really hot and uncomfortable around the ears. Another small gripe is that the headset is actually huge, and way bigger than I expected. Wearing it for a long time can be uncomfortable for this reason also, because of the weight. If it had been cheaper I probably wouldn't have minded so much, but for the value for price I found these little design flaws disappointing.
0345803507|2.0|I started reading this series because I wanted to see what the hype was about.  I've read books in this genre before so I wanted to see why people are talking about this one - is it different than say the Anne Rice novels in this genre?  I had to find out.  Also, I love to read and the storyline sounded like something I might enjoy so I gave it a chance.  I do not understand the poor writing style...I do not understand how these books made it to print.  How old is this author?  I kept asking a much older woman at work, who told me about these books and raves about them, if the author wrote teen fiction because it doesn't seem like adult fiction at all to me.  When people talk about this book and the other two about being, \\"brilliant\\", it makes me laugh.  There is nothing original about the series.  There are some peaks of interest throughout, maybe more so in book 2, but it's basically the same repetition.  It gets tiring.  The sex scenes are boring, predictable and repetitious.  I am on the 3rd book presently and am skipping through most of it just to see how it ends.  Ana doesn't like how bossy Christian is, how overbearing and overprotective he is, making him take her to work, always having to have her phone on in case he calls.  This woman is not allowed to stick up for herself.  No wonder why she acts like a 15 year old.  On paper, that is how she comes across.  Then she says she doesn't care if she is bad because maybe she will get a spanking from Christian later on, and makes reference to how \\"hot\\" he is on almost every page.  It's like, \\"we get it!\\"  In each chapter, or several times in a chapter, she is like this and the same scene replays.  I really hope this isn't brought to the big screen.  Is Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart going to play Christian and Ana?  There is only so much I can take...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good for simple fun. Great while watching TV. Play this when I am tired of more intense games. Just filling up space now.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|There are some basic playlists I have on my mp3 player.<br />Happy<br />Sad<br />Angry<br /><br />This album got filed in \\"unresolved issues\\".  But, at present, at $4.99 it's more than worth it.  This was a great CD and frankley after listening to this one, I didn't like Hybrid Theory as much anymore.  Artists need to change and experiment with new styles and people stuck on the first album need to move on. Yah! H.T. was great, but ask any 80's hair band how their career ended up when they just kept doing the same thing over and over again and everybody sounded like Zepplin.  Does Sticky Fingers sound like the first Stones album?  How about Sgt Pepper to A Hard Days night?  You gotta keep trying new stuff, and attracting a broader audiance.  If you like to zone out and just listen to some rock with a twist, you will like this album.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Allen's characters are always Allen -I kept hoping the yellow tint would go away -No way, even at night.<br />Why? Those reading my review: I am not referring to any Jewish 'tint' or 'tone'. There is none and even if there were I am not anti Jewish in any way.<br /> I am referring to the literal color cast throughout the movie.<br />It is tinted yellow -very distracting -maybe I received a bad copy?<br />Didn't any viewer experience it? The premise was OK -but a stretch.

B0067TGSOK|2.0|It does not really contain useful informations.<br />Moreover it is too much repetitive and after a bit you get bored.<br />I think there are better books to read about the subject.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler master is the best cpu cooler for the price. its so cheap and you get great cooling especially with 2 fans on each side of the heat sink. I got my Intel core i5 2500k 3.3GHz to overclock up to 4.5GHz with it stable and still keeping cool. It also very quiet. It also comes with thermal compound its usable but if you want the best performance go with the [[ASIN:B0002VFXFE Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound Paste 3.5g]] it has better cooling performance.<br />I highly recommended this product to anyone that needs a cheap heatsink for their cpu with great results.

B003UZ46DY|1.0|I should have listened to the other people that reviewed this and not bought this, was not worth the money. Love Incubus's music, but this is not Incubus.<br /><br />I thought there was something wrong with my headphones when I was listening to this, but put it on in my car and same problem. This was not produced very well, a lot of muffled bass notes.<br /><br />I should have just waited for the next Incubus album.
8466318313|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo25XWOYVCSOYWI]]This is one of three books from this popular author that have been selected to be included in \\"The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading\\" which is published by America Reads Spanish: a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US.

B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I read this book because I was looking for an engaging, captivating story.  I loved it from the beginning and stayed up til 4 in the morning because I couldn't put it down!  So, Frey screwed up by saying it was a true story... but that doesn't diminish the fact that it is a great read!
B007P06DJK|5.0|I'd like to add my penny's worth to the chorus of approval this superb reissue is receiving. But would also like to point out that the fantastic sounding CD is no fluke - it's a GREG CALBI remaster from 2011 (an upgrade on his 2004 version).<br /><br />Calbi has a staggering 2,300 mastering, remastering, audio restoration credits to his name across decades - so he knows his way around a tape or two. He was responsible for the audiophile quality of Supertramp's revered 1970's output (recently reviewed \\"Breakfast In America\\") and received unanimous praise for his work on the Bob Dylan SACD digipak reissues of 2004 and Paul McCartney's \\"Band On The Run\\" 25th Anniversary issue from 1999 (for my money better than the Deluxe reissue). Jim White, Whiskytown, Tom Petty, Chris Whitley, Patti Smith, Colin Linden, The Allman Brothers, Willie Nile, John Mayer, Cassandra Wilson, Lizz Wright - no matter who the artist is - he has the deftest of touches when it comes to getting the best out of the tapes.<br /><br />Add the stunning \\"Under African Skies\\" DVD (perfectly complimenting the audio CD), the lovely 3-way card packaging (slightly oversized) and the reasonable price - and you're on a winner.<br /><br />A beautifully handled reissue of a classic and groundbreaking album (I saw the tour at The Royal Albert Hall in London - a cherished memory).<br /><br />On the title track Paul Simon sings \\"...The Mississippi Delta Is Shining Like A National Guitar...\\"<br />Indeed it is - again.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|love the game, its addictive though! it used to close in the middle of my game but apparently that has been fixed!
B003OOWLU6|5.0|This episode nearly made me cry. That one moment when the past Captain Jack asked the Torchwood Captain Jack to dance was priceless. He took Torchwood Captain Jack's words to heart and he didn't care what anyone else thought about him dancing and falling in love with a man. You could tell the room respected him for it even though it was so far in the past where it was basically forbidden or it was horrible to be gay.<br /><br />Torchwood as a show represents many good things. The Torchwood team represents loyalty. The relationships represents many things...it shows it's okay to be gay or bi or straight or (for Captain Jack) omnisexual. It tells people to do what the hell your heart tells you to because, like Captain Jack said, you don't know what day will be your last. Tomorrow you might not wake up, so have a damn good time tonight.<br /><br />The scene was beautifully orchestrated in every sense. The whole episode was top-notch, but what made this my favortie Torchwood show of all time was the ending.<br /><br />Talk about ending with a Bang.<br /><br />Bravo!
0307358658|2.0|At least \\"War and Peace\\" has a character chart to help readers with unreliable memories keep everybody straight. The unpronounceable Norwegian names made remembering who was who a real challenge, and keeping track of them even harder. I'm just grateful the snowmen didn't have names. So many people wandered in and out of the story that I gave up backtracking to see if an old character was back or a new one had appeared, and who had nipples and who didn't, because nipples were important for a reason I would understand if I just kept reading. As for knowing whodonnit from the start, nearly everyone was a suspect in my book except the kid, because the snowman was already there when his mother was killed. I made it all the way to the end only because I was determined to find out how the author would try to finesse his way out of the snowstorm he had created. No cigar, but at least he explained the nipples connection. If you decide to read the book, list the characters and their connections on the inside back cover so you don't get lost in the snow.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Love doing these puzzles. Good variety of puzzle styles and skill levels. Good way to keep your brain working and thinking!
0307951529|5.0|Disclaimer: I am quoted in this book, and count the author as a friend and mentor. Hopefully, that doesn't make this review and less useful in your eyes.<br /><br />I've read dozens of business books over the past five years (think Godin, Kawasaki, etc.) and can say without reserve that The $100 Startup is the most actionable, practical and motivation book out of all of them. Books of this type seem to fall into two camps. One) Dry and checklist-driven or Two) Fluffy and aspirational with no suggested action plan.<br /><br />The $100 Startup left me with two bulleted pages of measurable action items I can use to refine my business.<br />Examples:<br />- Revising the copy of my sites and pitch language to focus on benefits (emotional) vs. features (straight facts of the offer)<br />- Setting aside dedicated time each day to focus on building, improving or experimenting with my business rather than \\"firefighting\\" or responding to emails all day<br />- Focusing on both my core group of customers and a related group, allowing me to reach new people with a different message.<br /><br />Some of these items may sound elementary or even obvious, but part of the book's usefulness is that it is chock full of stories that illustrate microbusiness owners putting dozens of habits/tactics/strategies into practice. This allows you to see the tips in action and therefore getting you to think of how to apply those same tips into action in your business.<br /><br />Whether you are dreaming about doing your own thing or have already started a microbusiness and want a fresh perspective on how to grow, this book will inspire you to action and give you the resources to \\"just do it.\\"<br /><br />So, what are you waiting for? Order it and get to work!
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|A long but gripping book. It provides hindsight analysis for the 2011 Arab Spring, making the argument that the uprising that gripped the region was the inevitable outcome of  long corrupt and weak institutions. Resource rich countries tended to create extractive institutions that did not create inclusive growth. While Egypt is not a resource rich nation, the regime manipulated the institutions to facilitate the transactions of the select cronies around it at the expense of the poor majority.

B0019IB0II|5.0|My Stroke of Insight was recommended to me by a good friend, who is also a pediatrician, at one of our Torah study groups. Dr. Taylor's journey is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of the brain and how we, as humans, engage the world around us.  Not only is her journey engaging, but Dr. Taylor's explanation of the right brain/left brain struggle is fantastic and easily understood.  I give it 5 stars.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I usually don't leave feedback (this is actually my first time) despite the fact that I've been a Prime member for a while. However, I felt compelled to review this movie which I hesitated to get because I was afraid it would be a waste of money. I'm glad I took the risk because this movie is great. I have a wide range of tastes for movies, but one with a good story is a must and this movie delivers a very real and a very human story that people can empathize with. As for the seller, everything arrived, no problems. And getting the movie on Blu-Ray is a must considering I feel the movie was shot in a very raw way and the Blu-Ray only heightens that. The added benefit of the DVD and the Digital Copies mean that you don't have to worry if you have a Blu-Ray player or a DVD player since you can use either or (obviously Blu-Ray is preferable).<br />For a lot of people, this movie will move to slow (It's only 90 minutes, but it feels just like a 2hr movie) and since the movie focuses on the two main characters and not action-oriented events, some people might not like it. But if you love good stories, this movie can't be missed.
1449320104|4.0|This book has it all - Its concise (as name suggests) but at the same time topics are discussed in perfect depth. I recommend this book to any one who is looking for immediate to advance knowledge on C#. However if you are just starting on C#  better to grow you knowledge base using other book(s) before picking this one because this book does require some basic C# knowledge.

B004HD61KE|5.0|In this thriller, Rollins provides a story of a secret 14th colony that was settled earlier by white men and that has been hidden since Thomas Jefferson's presidency.  After an explosion catches the attention of not only Sigma Force but scientist who are studying nanotechnology and of course the Guild.  While this book brings back all the characters we love it also starts to explore more of Seichan's past as her an Gray grow closer.<br /><br />I also know that when I read a novel by Rollins that I am going to learn things about history that I have never heard of and are fascinating.  I enjoy the epilogue as much as I do the book.

I was very skepitcal of purchasing this book, I read some of the other reviews and it did not look good.  However, I am so glad I did and formed my own opinion!  I highly recommend to everyone.  I finished it in two days, and I am happy to say, I also bought book two & three, and I'm halfway thru the 3rd book alrerady.  Can't seem to put them down. P.S. If you are looking to sparks things up in the bedroom, this book is definetly worth the investment!!!  A+++++++++++

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|First, the statement/announcement made on Frank Ocean's tumblr earlier this month...<br /><br />It's significant and quite frankly, `Radical.' Right now, it's almost impossible to write a review without talking about, or at least mentioning, the letter. Read it if you haven't already. It's important. And at the time this review was written, tons of celebrities have already offered their reactions, read: Russell Simmons, Chuck D, Solange Knowles, Stephen Hill, and then, of course Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. And many others, to follow, I'm sure.<br /><br />But enough about the letter. There's music to talk about and questions to answer. Like, is this album any good? Does Andr&eacute; 3000 deliver on the track `Pink Matter?' And, what does the John Mayer collaboration track actually sound like? Let's start by answering all of that right now: yes, the album is very good. Yes Andr&eacute; 3000 delivers (and more) on arguably, and probably, one of the better (if not best) tracks of this record. And John Mayer doesn't say anything because `White' is an instrumental track and it sounds like what you would expect: Frank Ocean and John Mayer, in the studio, jamming together. But the track is chill, virtuosic and pretty damn good.  And for a track that doesn't seem to say much, it says a lot, even without any lyrics. But onto the album itself, as a whole.<br /><br />First and foremost, for those not in-the-know, Frank Ocean is 24, he's an R&B singer, and yes, he is a member of the infamous Los Angeles-based hip-hop collective/crew/group/club (what-have-you) Odd Future Wolfgang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA). And when I listen to the record, I think R. Kelly and Kid Cudi and Kanye West, largely because Channel Orange sounds like all of the good things from all of those artists, (the singing from R. Kelly, the synth-laden soundscapes and beats from Kid Cudi and the charisma, coolness and confidence of Kanye West, albeit a little more low-key) all packaged into one neat little box, or I guess, CD case (or MP3 download or Vinyl).<br /><br />People are probably going to be talking about Channel Orange for a little while. Probably, because of the letter, and also, because of how damn good it is. The most talked-about/hyped album right now, for sure. So again, you may want to know, is Channel Orange any good? In short, yes, it's damn good.<br /><br />This is a solid and cohesive album, 17 tracks in all, complete with intros, instrumental interludes and outros (yeah, we definitely called those skits back in the 90s and early 00s) but everything on Channel Orange sounds focused and with purpose. And I say `focused' and `with purpose' because Channel Orange is not littered with guests. Just Earl Sweatshirt, John Mayer (who doesn't even sing or anything, remember that!) and Andr&eacute; 3000. The track titles themselves are pretty remarkable (I think) and full of gumption (`Super Rich Kids,' `Pyramids,' `Pink Matter,' `Forrest Gump,' etc.) and rest assured, it never drags (55 minutes and then some).<br /><br />Album highlights include:<br /><br />Thinkin Bout You<br />Sweet Life<br />Super Rich Kids (feat. Earl Sweatshirt)<br />Pilot Jones<br />Pyramids<br />White (feat. John Mayer)<br />Bad Religion<br />Pink Matter (feat. Andr&eacute; 3000)<br /><br />As a whole, Channel Orange is, quite honestly, probably the definitive R&B album this side of 2012. And this is what 2012 R&B sounds like. So, Channel Orange is probably what I mean when I write things like \\"timeless music,\\" and \\"summer music,\\" and \\"really good,\\" and \\"this means something,\\" but... in the end \\"i don't know anything & neither do you.\\"e box, or I guess, CD case (or MP3 download or Vinyl).<br /><br />People are probably going to be talking about Channel Orange for a little while.

B004J4WN0I|3.0|As many reviews have mentioned, this series is clearly derivative of Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden novels. Also, as others have mentioned, Atticus O'Sullivan is no Harry Dresden. I've read Hounded, Hexed and Hammered, and am in the midst of Tricked. I find myself frustrated and mildly disappointed. Hearne has sufficient talent as a writer to have kept me going for these four books, but his flaws are just as persistent as his strengths.<br /><br />At age 48, I have acquired a certain perspective that I could not even have imagined at age 21. Things that seemed so important then seem trivial now. From his author pictures on his web site, I'd guess Hearne himself to be maybe late 30s (early 40s? kind of hard to tell) -- old enough to have a bit of perspective (then again, I've learned a lot about life since my late 30s), but I guess not everyone reaches the same points in their life journeys at the same time.<br /><br />I was recently mentioning to someone in regard to another novel I'd read that it is very difficult to write a character who is wiser and more mature than you are. 2100 years is a crushing burden of life experience, a crucible that would leave no man unscathed. O'Sullivan seems to have absorbed little of it. His moral and political viewpoints are those of the arrogant 21-year-old hipster that O'Sullivan \\"pretends\\" to be, not those of someone who has witnessed centuries of human folly. Harry Dresden, by contrast, has enormous physical and mental scars and baggage from his short life beneath the pen of Jim Butcher. Compelling heroes and heroines are flawed, they suffer, and their wisdom, insights and victories are hard-won. O'Sullivan has precipitated world-altering events literally by accident, and so far seems remarkably unaffected.<br /><br />One of the things I find most frustrating is that Hearne is constantly sucker-punching conservative readers like myself with his political/social opinions. I have absolutely no idea what Jim Butcher's or Patricia Briggs' or Kim Harrison's political beliefs are and I like it that way. They're all very respectful of their readers. Hearne's/O'Sullivan's constant snarking on conservatives is profoundly annoying and makes me feel guilty for financially supporting him by buying his books. Does he not realize that there are many fantasy readers out here who are conservatives and that alienating us makes no sense? The attitude I get from the writing is that Hearne/O'Sullivan obviously thinks his leftist viewpoints and great regard for crunchy, hippie greenies is the cool, correct thing and *obviously* the cool people reading his books agree with him. It's hard to respect a supposedly 2,100-year-old Druid whose political and moral philosophy is no more intellectually developed than a 20-something or 30-something ironic hipster.<br /><br />The flippant approach appears in other regards, as well.<br /><br />The deaths of secondary characters pass quickly because they are too shallowly drawn to allow us to care much about them, and O'Sullivan himself seems to grieve little -- about the only thing 2100 years has granted him is a callous indifference to the deaths of others. And, you'd think the death of one god would be pretty much a lifetime achievement, but it turns out that killing gods is like eating potato chips: you start with one and next thing you know you've downed a half dozen. Yes, at once point in Tricked he breaks down and weeps at the enormity of what he's done and how stupid he has been, but it's written in such a brief, perfunctory manner, it's not convincing. So far, there seems to be a distinct lack of consequence considering what he has done.<br /><br />His apprentice Granuaile is superficially appealing, but woefully underdeveloped. She so far serves little purpose beyond chauffeur and attractive cheerleader for O'Sullivan, and that's a shame because she would seem to have great potential, if she could be spared a little limelight. She pales greatly next to the depth ofcharacter that Dresden's friend Karrin Murphy displays (but maybe that's not fair, because I can't say that Murphy's development was as mature after three and a half books), or even compared to Dresden's own apprentice, Molly Carpenter -- Molly has had struggles and character arcs that make her nearly as interesting a character as Dresden himself.<br /><br />I'd *like* to be able to keep enjoying the things I do enjoy about the series: it's fast paced, the dialog is moderately witty, the character of Oberon has developed quite a bit, and we've been given a hint or two that we'll actually get to know the Morrigan as a real, thinking, feeling person, given enough time. Most of all, there's plenty of foreshadowing that all O'Sullivan's many mistakes will catch up with him and he won't be able to keep dodging the consequences. Maybe then things will get real.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I did not purchase this book.  I only ordered the sample.  Please check your records.  It is not on my Kindle
B006XOBFB0|1.0|Don't buy this set. The sound is loud and distorted. My first warning came from a reviewer, while I was researching another CD, who gave this set 1 star because of bad sound. But it was too late for me; I had already ordered it, and it was sitting on my shelf awhile unopened.<br />  So I put in the first CD. The sound was loud and distorted; I let it play awhile, until I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm not going to listen to the rest; I'm not going to use better equipment; I've heard enough.<br />  I was wondering if earlier CDs were better. About the earlier 2006 2o-bit box set on amazon, I found this review at the top of the reviews, by Allan K Betz:<br />  \\"...there is a piercing digital distortion in the mid-frequency range. Between about 2000 and 8000 cycles per second a nasty ring comes out and bites your ears off. It so bad that some notes jump right out of the mix as if their volume were twice that of notes in other ranges...\\"<br />  What about Columbia Legacy? To me, those sounded better than the original CDs. I guess I'm learning the hard way to listen to things as soon as I get them, so I can return them if I have to. But I rarely return CDs; it's too much a hassle for me.<br />  Thank you for my first review, though I did comment a little on someone else's review a few months ago about the sound.<br />  P.S 7/16/'12 -I apologize to Allan K. Betz: I mistakenly left out the word \\"is\\" from my quote of his review. It should be: \\"...It is so bad that some notes jump right out of the mix...\\" Sorry, I'm still clumsy typing on the computer. At times, the vertical blinking bar jumps around and I'm not aware till later.<br />  I'm also saddened that a relatively high number of persons found my review unhelpful. But my conscience is clear. I shouldn't feel too bad. I've seen very learned reviews with only 1 or 2 responses.<br />  I'm indebted to the reviewers and commentators who write-good and bad. I'm learning so much from them, and I couldn't learn these things any other way. Even those who do the tedious job of listing what's on the CD and technical info help me. Often, this is the only way I know what's on the CD. Sometimes I'm looking at the pictures with a magnifying glass. Thanks again. I almost forgot: We're all united in our love of music.<br />  P.S. starting from 7\22\'12  -I'm indebted to those who sell their recordings and video used (I especially like \\"like new\\") through amazon: CDs, of my favorite performers, I never saw at Tower Records stores while they were alive (and I thought Tower Records was the best.), CDs, of my favorite records, I never knew existed as CDs; I had given up hope until seeing them on amazon. Often, I see the re-selling as finding new homes for them. ( I had a Mitsubishi LT-5V turntable. One of those vertical turntables. Oh, how I loved the sound from it. If I remember, correctly, my favorite audio magazine said about it at the time,\\"...benefits show up in a tight, clear bass, remarkably vivid midrange, and delicate highs...\\" But it froze from years of me not using it-convenient CDs came along. I could hardly bare throwing it away. I wish they would make it again, but add a built-in phono amp.)<br />  Though I'm questioning the sound of this set, I do have CDs of historical recordings. I don't expect them to sound so good, but I'm thrilled when they do. Reminds me of Toscanini. To me, Arturo Toscanini was the most intense conductor of the 20th century. (Sorry he was reputed to be a tyrant.) An author of a book about him said concert-goers leaving after the end of Toscanini's concerts said that was the most beautiful sound they had ever heard. But the author goes on to say words, to the effect, that no matter how beautiful the live sound, if the recorded sound is junk, people are not going to listen.<br />  I hardly listen to Toscanini anymore, except for his Saint-Saens Organ Symphony with the NBC Symphony on RCA. When I hear other performances over the radio, I still think of Toscanini'sin my head. Several years ago, I heard Toscanini's Brahms symphonies for the first time. I thought they were the most intense I had ever heard-and I thought James Levine's First with the CSO on RCA, and Bernard Haitink's Fourth with the Concgb.O. on Universal Classics- were intense. ( Haitink is my favorite conductor, but I have other favorites, too-like Giulini, Arthur Fiedler, Markevitch, Dorati, Reiner, Marriner with the ASMF especially playing Mozart, Krips with Concgb.O playing Mozart, Karel Ancerl with the Czech Philharnonic, Alexander Schneider, Charles Gerhardt, Raymond Leppard, Leonard Slatkin, Jaap Schroder, Harnoncourt- I hardly listen to him anymore, but I was enthralled listening recently to his Schubert's 9th, the \\"Great\\" in C major, playing with the Concgb.O. on Teldec [though here it's called No.8, and the Unfinished called No.7], equal to my favorite, Toscanini's playing with the Philadelphia O. on RCA [but I don't like his NBC account], but of course with better sound -JoAnn Faletta, Andreas Delfs [ I remember a concert, a few years ago, with the now-bankrupt Honolulu Symphony, then America's oldest symphony west of the Rockies-his \\"Blue Danube\\" waltz was moving and at times unexpectedly tender. Tears came down my face. But that was a hard time in my life, too. And they played the same composers' \\"Egyptian March\\" -with some of the orchestra members singing.], now I'm discovering Robert Craft with Stravinsky, discovering Christoph von Dohnanyi with the Cleveland O. playing Dvorak, and others....) But try and hear Toscanini's on RCA with the UV 22 Super CD Encoding, if you wish.<br />  But the problem with the Sony Mozart\Perahia sets seem to be the remastering. Maybe Sony should let outsiders-music-loving listeners and musicians-all with good hearing-listen to the CDs before mass-production.<br />  I was re-reading the other reviews. It's like night and day. It's like I'm not even listening to the same product. Is it possible there's manufacturing differences in quality of this product-like about wine, when the same bottles of a wine don't taste all the same, called \\"bottle variation\\"? I don't know.<br />  It's a given it's not likely we're listening through the same equipment. But the exact equipment reviewers use should not become an issue, if the equipment sounds OK to the reviewer.<br />  I don't want to say the obvious: you can buy the earlier, individual CDs, or buy another performer's boxed set. If you must know, I'm a big fan of Mitsuko Uchida, from the first notes I heard her playing a Mozart piano sonata on a CD.<br />  I haven't heard everything she plays; but of the many pieces I heard, there's some I don't care for. Recently, I bought her earlier Mozart piano concertos set used(I was missing individual CDs)- instead of the most recent set-after a reviewer wrote of the later set-the earliest piano concertos aren't performed by her, but by someone else( Ingrid Haebler? I'm not sure.) Also, that set may have concertos split between two CDs. But please read the reviews-good and bad-of both sets, or of whomever performers you are interested in. I'm listening right now to the Uchida set for the first time. I put in the first CD; it sounds fine... I'm in heaven. But I'm not sure if I'm hearing the earliest concertos. I haven't heard those before; and the set doesn't name them by No., but by KV No. Let me figure this out: this set has a booklet; in the Italian-language section, they're listed by No. and K.No. It looks like concertos 1-4,7, are not here. But, wait, No.10 K.365 is listed in the Italian section, but not on the CD list in the front of the booklet; so No.10 is not here, too. This is a 9-CD set compiled in 1993; and none of the concertos are split between two CDs. I find out, later, I'm mistaken: Ingrid Haebler plays the first four concertos with the Capella Academica Wien conducted by Eduard Melkus on Alfred Brendel's 12-CD set, Collector's Edition, 2011 on Decca. But these performances of the first four concertos are boring, and I expected better sound for something recorded in 1973. (I also bought this Brendel set about the same time I got the other two sets.) A reviewer wrote, something like, these first four concertos are not the best compositions-you won't miss them. I could agree with that; but I remember times in the past, I thought I didn't like a composition, untill the right performer, performances brought it alive, or made the most musical sense out of it-(which is one reason why I like Haitink so much- his thoughtfullness brings out the intensity of a piece, but not wring out all the emotions of a piece and not play fast movements too fast, and slower movements too slow. But I don't like every performance he conducts.<br />  To me, the most important thing a conductor can do is choose the right tempos. But what happens when the tempo sounds wrong? To me, musicians should have the authority, by secret vote, to override the conductor. If the conductor can't first convince the orchestra of his or her ideas, how is he or she going to convince the listener?)<br />  Several months ago, I heard, for the first time, a CD by Brendel-Mozart piano concertos Nos. 9, 25, and part of 22., the first CD in a Phillps Duo. I let that CD play over and over again. When I finally stopped, I didn't want to listen to any other sounds; I didn't want anything to distract me from hearing that music leftover in my head...<br />  Both Uchida sets are missing the same concertos.<br />  I bought the Perahia set to hear for myself why two Guides, whose names I'm figuring out I'm not supposed to name on amazon, gave the Perahia set their most highest rating, but not to Uchida's, even though they gave their most highest rating to her Mozart piano sonatas, with another solo piano piece, the Fantasia in C Minor, KV475, my favorite piece on there. My first Mozart piano concerto CD of hers I got, was No.20 KV466 with No.21 KV467(Elvira Madigan). It was so good, I had to get the rest by her., what I could get. I remember playing the \\"Elvira Madigan\\" concerto first, and playing the famous Andante over and over again. Trying to hear for myself, why one of the Guides has, about Uchida's,\\"...individually none of the peformances of the major works here would be a first choice...\\" I've disagreed with the Guides before.<br />  My copies of the Guides are a few years old, so I don't know what's changed since then. But as I'm finding out, I'd rather depend on the reviews on amazon.<br />  If you want to know further-dare I say it?-from the some music I listened to, Perahia's Mozart sounds like... Chopin. But a reviewer wrote Uchida's Beethoven sounds like Mozart.<br />  No one alive now has heard Mozart playing his music on the forte-pianos of his time. Or if Mozart were alive today, after hearing modern instruments and music of the world, how he would want his music to sound. We choose the performances that sing to us( or does it choose us, like how a cat chooses its owner?) within the known wishes of the composer, and other considerations. (Again, I think of Toscanini telling his musicians,\\"Cantare, cantare![sing]\\", but never explain to them what he meant. And Toscanini did not always follow the composer's instructions. I remember reading about a rehearsal of one of Ravel's pieces, Ravel told Toscanini that's not how he(Ravel) wanted it played. I don't know if Toscanini followed.)<br /><br />  If it seems I've wandered off the subject at times, I'm trying to show-I'm a first-time reviewer whose likes in music you didn't know; there's a whole world of music out there-you won't miss this one Sony set; and I'm human -I'm not a sound monster attacking something sacred. Like fairy tales? Imagine the Emperors' New Clothes...<br />  I feel stupid. I found out too late: I discovered when I click on the product, the amazon page shows up with the product details-like what's on the CD, reviews, write a review, sometimes listen to samples (though I don't know how to do this yet) and other info. Before, I was clicking on the reviews(the stars), then clicking \\"used\\" or \\"new\\", which didn't take me to the amazon product page. But many of you probably knew this already, it's me who didn't know. So, please click on the product to get on to the amazon product page, besides reading the reviews. I only discovered amazon in April.<br />  Oh yes, I just lowered my rating to 1 star, because it's unlikely I'll ever hear the rest of this set. And the enlivening Hawaii Symphony Ochestra, made up mostly of musicians of the past symphony, played its first season in April and May, to mostly standing ovations. Under better management-even the musicians say so(and I'm pro-union)-this is a story better told by someone more qualified than me. We here had to learn the hard way: support your symphony. And as my doctor said about this, \\"When something is gone, that's when you miss it.\\"<br />  I'm worried about the next symphony season in the fall. The concert hall is going to be used for a musical. To me, the simplest-sounding solution is to schedule the symphony season before or after the run of the musical, but I'm definitely not an expert.<br />  Thanks, again.e first four concertos are boring, and I expected better sound for something recorded in 1973.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Found myself staying up till the wee hours reading.  The only downside to \\"Wool - Omnibus\\" was the loss of sleep.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I was warned that it started slow but to keep plugging.  I followed that advice and was ultimately satisfied.  But somewhere during the read -- I'm not exactly sure where -- I found myself asking, \\"How much damn coffee do these people drink?\\"  I might be exagerating a bit, but it seemed like someone was drinking a cup of coffee on every page. Generally I thought the descriptions were fine, but there were those that left me weary, and others that had me thinking, \\"Why did you tell me that?\\"  I can think of one instance in particular, although I don't have the book in front of me to quote it.  But it went something like this:  He went out and wiped down the garden furniture and sat and drank his coffee.  He was wearing a white shirt with the collar turned up.<br /><br />So I get that he was sitting there with his coffee thinking about the case.  But why the hell did you tell me about the shirt he was wearing, especially the detail about the collar.  At first, I thought it might be an important detail.  That it would save his life, that a bullet would ricochet off the neatly starched collar, or something like that.  But no.  Unless I missed something, it seemed like a pointless detail for which most students of creative writing would be vigorously criticized by their professors.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the book. Could hardly put it down.  But I was just a bit perplexed and sometimes distracted by the writing.  Maybe it was just a translation thing.
0375703861|2.0|I don't know how Zadie Smith does it. How it is possible that her novel White Teeth is absolutely hilarious and a complete drag at the same time? I have no idea how she accomplished that, but it's quite an extraordinary feat.<br /><br />The novel opens in England on New Year's Day of 1975 with the suicide attempt of Archie Jones. But before you prejudge that scenario to be grim and depressing, the man who finds Archie and saves him proclaims \\"We're not licensed for suicides around here. This place halal. Kosher, understand? If you're going to die round here, my friend, I'm afraid you've got to be thoroughly bled first.\\" The comedic effect is unmistakable, and it continues throughout the novel. Next we learn about the story of Archie's friend, Samad Iqbal, and then one by one, we learn about their respective family members.<br /><br />Using her novel as the vehicle to critique society, Smith tries to tackle all of the following issues: class, religion, beauty, race, God, immigration, uncertainty, war, the past, generational gap, assimilation, extremist groups, family, history, colonization, science versus faith, and relationships. All of those issues? Yes, and maybe even more. Overly ambitious? I think so. Smith makes a social commentary on all of these issues, pokes fun at them, and draws out the absurd in them. It is funny. Seriously laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />And yet, the story is a drag to read. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just me. Is it because I don't like comedy in my novels? Perhaps comedy loves company much more than misery does. The best part about laughing is sharing that laugh with others. Comedies are best on TV or in the movies, in a format that allows you to share that laugh with friends. Not as much fun to chuckle to yourself all alone.<br /><br />Well, that's one theory anyway. Another theory is that the author is too ambitious and by trying to cover everything, she ends up covering nothing. There are too many themes to chew over. Too much all at once.<br /><br />Or maybe I didn't like it because as soon as I started to get interested in one character and one storyline, the author switched to another character with another storyline. In the end, she weaves them all together, but by then I was just struggling to finish the book and didn't care anymore. I was not invested in any of the characters. I had nothing and no one to root for as the novel progressed. Oddly, I could see that the ending was supposed to be gathering steam for the final culmination of the book, but I found myself not caring. I just wanted to be done with the darned thing at that point.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, Smith is an intelligent writer. The themes are thick and layered. I'm sure that a literary scholar would be delighted to parse through all the depth she offers. But for the average reader, I'm afraid the story is too much of a drag and getting through the novel just feels like a chore punctuated with random outbursts of laughter.at once.<br /><br />Or maybe I didn't like it because as soon as I started to get interested in one character and one storyline, the author switched to another character with another storyline.
