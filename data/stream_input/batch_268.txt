B00005NGZX|5.0|Over a year has passed since this CD came out and I still cant  get it out of my player. This is a masterpiece of noise-core brutality and very emotional heaviness, one of the most honest records Ive ever heard.  Jane Doe is an all-out assault to the senses, a perfect mixture of chaos and beauty, in one word: Intense.<BR>I dont think Converge (or anyone else, for that matter) will ever top this album in terms of creativity and intensity. Its THAT good.<BR>This is what extreme music is all about, a CLASSIC in our time.

B00004U2G4|4.0|Jeff Beck's long career as a solo artist has largely been one of unfulfilled promise.  He's never quite managed to capitalize of his fantastic skill as a guitar player, in part because he neither sings, nor writes much of his own material.  \\"Truth\\" is best of the late 60s albums Beck made with a [band] band that included Rod Stewart on vocals and Ron Wood on bass.  Together they sound much like another blues based British heavy metal quartet that was just getting started at the time.  In fact, a cover of Willie Dixon's blues standard \\"You Shook Me\\" appears both here and on Led Zeppelin's debut album.  It's a wash as to which version is better: Zep's is the heavier of the two but Beck and company's version is more melodic.<br />Of the rest, plenty of the tracks stand out.  The covers of \\"Shape of Things\\" and another Dixon tune \\"I Ain't Superstituous\\" are excellent, as are the Jimmy Page-penned \\"Beck's Bolero,\\" \\"Let Me Love You\\" and Morning Dew.\\"  The short instrumental cover of the traditional tune \\"Greensleeves,\\" however, shows off Beck at his most technically proficient but is a warning sign for the egomania that would ultimaetly serve to sidetrack his career.<br />Overall, a near-masterpiece that would be an excellent choice as the first Jeff Beck album in anyone's CD collection.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Beautiful Mind is a  true story about John Nash, a brilliant mathematics scientist with a schizophrenic presonality. His schizophrenic side made him believe that he had a best friend and a top secret governmental job which required him to dicipher secret codes of the Russians from newspaper and magazine cuttings.  He met his wife, who was his stuednt , fell in love with her but never once did he tell about his secret government job,nor introduce her to his best friend meet, His illness was discovered and he was sent to a center where psychological illnesses were to be treated.  He got out of the center after a while and found a small job at Princeton University.  He closed himself up to the world of mathematics.  finally, one day, a student sought his help in math and slowly, Nash opened up to the students and helped tutor them.  His mathematical discovery eventually won him the Nobel Prize and the respect of the world. I was touched by the movie in two different aspects.  First ,it showed me that anything is possible. If someone with a major psychological illness could win a Nobel Prize, how can I not be a far greater person than I am how? second, despite all of the Nash's shortcomings his wife stood faithfully by his side. It further made me believe in the power of love and the divinity of marriage.  Nash could only  have gone through his trials with the love and support of his  wife.  She taught him that love was all that mattered.  It did not matter what others thought of him. I enjoyed this movie.It was very confusing but extremely sentimental at the same time.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As much as I like &quot;The Lord Of The Rings: FOTR&quot;, I still think that Moulin Rouge was the better picture.  (and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; was not worthy of the Oscar).  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a sweeping love story.  A simple and somewhat redundant plot that pulls at your heart every chance it gets.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are on fire here as the star-crossed lovers from different worlds.  Jim Broadbent is wonderful as the owner of the club.  The entire film is an over-the-top fantasy.  The visuals fly at you at amazing speeds and the intricate musical production is amazing.  Did you ever think you would hear Nirvana's &quot;Smell Like Teen Spirit&quot; woven into a musical?  I love the spin on The Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;.  Yes, the movie seems sappy.  Yes, it's unrealistic and maybe even a bit too contrived.  But it's one of a kind, and Lurhrmann let's you know right from the first frame of picture, that this is going to be a roller coaster ride of a film.  A highly stylized romantic musical, that makes you hope that Baz Luhrmann will be making films for a long time to come.
0151006903|5.0|I would not recommend this book to everyone. If you are not interested in the middle ages and have no background in their history, or if you are not interested in gnosticism - you would probably find this book confusing and having too much piled in. <BR>However - for those who do have some background in the history - this is absolutely wonderful. I think this is Eco's best book so far - it is meticulously researched, it is humourous, it weaves together multiple themes (including love, philosophy, adventure) and it has his typical detective edge with a surprising ending.<BR>I could not stop smiling for 2 days after I finished reading it.
B00005AQAW|4.0|SATELLITE NEWS.<br />to tell you the truth, this really isn't a very good album.  compared to the WONDERFUL \\"yesterday went too soon\\", this album seems horrible.  however, this is one of the most important albums that i own, for one reason: satellite news.  i was tempted to rate the album a 5 just because of this song, but i decided not to, because the album as a whole really doesn't deserve such a rating.<br />this song hits me so hard, though.  it's one of my favorite songs of all time (and i've heard numerous numerous numerous songs).  it just takes me.  all of my favorite songs take me.  and usually because they're so sad.  songs that hit me emotionally.  my two favorite songs ever are the only two songs that have ever made me cry.  but this song is different than any of my other favorite songs.  this song takes me in a good way.  a positive way.<br />it starts off with that beautiful music.  so lovely.  and so mellow, and depressing.<br />and then..<br />you will never keep me down!<br />you can never keep me down!<br />i want to lift my self up to the sky!<br />serenade the stars as I pass by<br />wanna leave it all just for a while<br />i'll be satellite news<br />i wanna lift myself above the clouds<br />cut the ropes around me!<br />you'll see me shine!<br />shine like the sun!!<br />!<br />wow!<br />when it changes into \\"you will never keep me down!\\", it just hits me so hard, and then it goes even further into a musical orgasm of emotions, while the ropes around me have been cut, and i'm soaring into the sky.. flying.. free.. and shining!<br />i'd love to tell the singer how much this song means to me.  i wonder if he even knows how great this song is.<br />ok, now that i've discussed that song, onto the other songs.<br />imo, oxygen is the only other song on the album that's really good.  all of the other songs are good, though, with a few which are rather weak, like \\"choke\\" and \\"under the weather\\", and some lame lyrics every now and then.

B00000I07P|3.0|It's about time a new band stepped onto the rock scene and gave it a shot of new energy.<BR>The band was Bon Jovi, the time was the mid '80's and this was the rock album that made them big in the music arena and got  them their first # 1 album on the top USA 200.<BR>If i have to be honest, the album is not an outstanding one, yet the good looks of the guys and a truly chartbusting partnership with writer/producer/performer Desmond Child brought the guys out of anonimity.<BR>You have two absolute hits on this album, YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME and LIVIN' ON A PRAYER, which both topped the singles chart (and how cute was jon in the latter's black and white video??? those ray-ban sunglasses ROCK!), then the cowboy anthem WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE and the big bad ballad NEVER SAY GOODBYE.<BR>In my opinion there are a coupla more tracks could have been realeased as singles: WITHOUT LOVE and I'D DIE FOR YOU...but looks like the label had other things on their minds.<BR>Call it pop-metal, call it glam-rock...to me it's BON JOVI...and i like it!
B00005JKCH|3.0|Nothing like what we people have hyped up our biggest film of the year, now ranking at #5 on the biggest films ever list, has been this undeserving. If the special effects are supposed to be so great, why does Kristen Dunst seem like she's flinging around like she's made of clay while the Green Goblin holds her hostage?<BR>And besides that, how does our hero recover his power so quickly when the Green Goblin pretty much knocked him out? <br />Looking past this, the movie is pretty much predictable but still okay as far as acting and how they can carry it out. One startling moment in the whole film doesn't amount to much, but it's not a thriller, it's an action movie, and if you want to see action, you're in the right movie.<br />Too bad they hired a teenage heart-throb to play Spiderman.<BR>Moving on.<br />If they need this many special features in a DVD to sell it, then maybe they aren't as confident in Spidey over there as we figure they are. I have another record for Spiderman : Most overhype.<br />B-
B000005HNQ|4.0|I`ve just been reading through some of the other reviews<BR>and nobody mentioned this CD isn`t the place<BR>to start, MANDYLION or HOW TO MEASURE A PLANET are more consistant.<BR>NIGHT TIME BIRDS has its moments but it does have a few clunkers, and the long term interest isn`t as strong as Mandylion or HTMAP. I would rate Night Time Birds as the third<BR>Best, but still a must have CD for Gathering fans anybody into Floyd through to Lacuna Coil may also be interestd in checking it out.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This is a miracle. I can watch a movie four times without getting bored. The book to script conversion is masterfully done, with the right changes needed. The special features don't go overboard, either, but they have enough to fulfill Potter's legions of fans. <br />Is there a downside? Maybe the movie drags on at times and seems a little outside of even magical reality, but Rowling can push the envelope and still pull it off.<br />The acting is decent enough, the effects are well done, the plot is incredible, and the entire thing is well carried out. &quot;We expect great things from you, Harry Potter&quot;. Don't blow it come Chamber of Secrets.<br />B+
B000001ES9|2.0|Firstly I am a huge Rush fan , I love nearly everything they do<BR>but this is bad , first album or not its a clunker.<BR>Theres nothing about this I like, and if Peart had been around<BR>at the time I`m sure things would have been different.<BR>Rush are a progressive rock band not a LZ clone act.<BR>Stay away , keep clear, avoid this at all costs<BR>and if anyone trys to tell you its good, try not to laugh<BR>yes it is that bad its almost funny
B00006JDVV|2.0|A typical sci fi plot mixed with decent acting and a script too boring to carry out long, I was half way asleep 30 minutes into the movie. I didn't snap out of my daze until 20 minutes to the end when the action finally kicked in instead of mindless babble between the main characters about how they are going to kill the dragon instead of actually trying to do it. Incredibly mediocre and nothing worth your money. Skip it.<br />C-
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I now own this DVD and I must say it was one of the best ways I could have spent my money. The directing and adaptation from the book are both the best I've ever seen. The movie tells the tale of four characters slowly destroying their dreams by the thing they need most. Jared Leto has never stood out in my mind as a big actor, but after seeing what he is capable of doing in this movie he is definatly a good actor in my mind. Marlon Wayans surprises me with his oustanding ability to play a serious part in a movie, and shows that he can really act. Jennifer Connelly did a good job in acting her part as the addicted lover to Leto. Ellen Burstyn is by far the best in the movie when it comes to acting. Burstyn's character is an addict to TV and speed throughout the film, and Burstyn plays the part perfectly. The film moves your emotions along with the characters right up until the very end. Not for the squeemish, easily disturbed, people who like happy movies, or inconsiderate arrogant cold hearted people. This movie is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B0000640VO|5.0|French films, while often excellent, are something of an acquired taste and some of the essence can get lost in the translation (both cultural and linguistic).  This film, however, transcends such difficulties and is immensely enjoyable and heart-warming.<br />While like many other French films this is very whimsical, it is so well performed and directed that only the very hardest hearted would not find the charm of this film irresistable. Part of the reason for this is down to the remarkable central performance of Audrey Tautou as \\"Amelie\\". Her entire performance seems to be more mimed than acted and seems to do without dialogue to a great degree.  This works well due to her excellent acting abilities as well as some outstanding direction.<br />The plot is based around an unashamedly romantic story concerning our heroine; the acting skill and direction give this film a quirkyness and zest which really set it apart.<br />I enjoyed this film immensely and felt enriched from having watched it.  Definitely one of the filmic highlights of the past year and very highly recommended.
B00005JKPF|4.0|The first Marvel Comics movie i've seen was \\"Blade\\" back in 1998 and hooked on the X-Men cartoons ever since, even though I never read the books.  When I purchased the original \\"X-Men\\" movie on VHS when it first came to stores, I really liked how the super heroes came together to defend the human race from their evil mutant counterparts, even though the humans are afraid and hate them.  I'm looking forward to checking out the sequel next year and buy it on DVD when it's ready.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is very interesting.  I think this movie is a true story and the story is very mysterious.  Dr. Nash is a very sad man because he had a disease because of his intelligence, but he could win the Nobel Prize after he had a lot of experience about his disease.  His wife is also kind to him.  She had been helping him to recover from his disease.  Though he saw some non-real people, he could recover from his disease.  I learned that it was possible to recover from the any serious problem.  I strongly recommend you to watch this movie more than once.
0786868694|4.0|Having only seen Nigella's show once, when someone told me that this cookbook was a good way to get her recipes and narration, I looked into it.<br />I found a cookbook that is down to earth with a breezy, narrative style. I loved the titles of her sections (All Day Breakfast, Comfort Food, TV Dinners, Party Girl, Rainy Days, Trashy, etc.)<br />The photos were gorgeous and I appreciated the chatty introduction to most recipes. I also liked the pages at the ends of the chapters for my notes and comments.<br />I am sure this book will be well-used. All the recipes I have tried thus far have been great.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|This American Recording is different. On this album Johnny Cash (who is now 70 years old) never tries to fool himself or us listeners into thinking that he's going to keep on making album after album after album. Let's face it - the voice is even more ragged and torn than last time (American III) and the lyrics are even more desolate, lonesome, and dark than ever before. But this album of new and old originals & covers is probably one of the most beautiful I've ever heard.<br />Johnny Cash is not a singer. He never was. But without that dark baritone these songs would not have the impact that they do. I could talk about ever individual track on the album - but I'd rather just make it short and sweet by mentioning a few personal favorites.<br />\\"The Man Comes Around\\" - A Cash original that seemed to take a lot of time to get down (coming from the linear notes). Amazing song about that thing called the apocolypse and judgement day. Nobody could do it like Cash. Nobody...<br />\\"Hurt\\" - Johnny Cash takes one of Trent Reznor's (Nine Inch Nails) best songs and makes it even better. Not only does Cash make the song better but he also makes it seem as if the song was meant for just him. Oh, and there is a word change. Where Reznor would say \\"I wear this crown of sh*t\\", Johnny now says \\"I wear this crown of thorns.\\" The change first kinda put me off but then it seems that Johnny's variation make much more sense then the first.<br />\\"Bridge over Toubled Water\\" - just a great cover of an amazing classic. Fiona Apple adds some tender backing vocals that help Johnny along this tune of trouble and redemption.<br />\\"First time ever I saw your face\\" - Just as where Cash left off on \\"Spiritual\\" (from American II) he starts back at with this one. Truly beautiful. Sounds as if they recorded it in a church for Johnny has this amazing echo on his voice. If you don't get tears in your eyes from this one, you're hopeless.<br />\\"Sam Hall\\" - one of the \\"lighter\\" tracks, but still painted inblack. <br />\\"I'm so lonesome I could Cry\\" - I don't know how it happened. They got 2 of the most interesting singers to appear on a country classic. Nick Cave (who's a big favorite of mine) lent \\"The Mercy Seat\\" to Johnny's last American Recording (III), but this time he's lending his voice. Cash and Cave swap lines from this Hank Williams classic. <br />\\"We'll meet Again\\" - so you go through this dark and cold world where people can't even remember how to pray let alone carry a bible and then you come to the end and a smile is finally cracks and some light pours through as the door opens. Cash ends on a positive note and the whole damn Cash family joins in at the very end.<br />Who knows if Cash will record anymore albums. It's hard to tell. The man is in and out of the hospital constantly (or so it seems) and any one of us would've probably called it quits. Elvis didn't make it, Orbison didn't make it, but the Man in Black is still reaching out and touching us. He's still tormented by the feeling that music must be played. He's still not thinking that this will be the last song he sings. He's still got soul and he's still got love.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|What a pleasant surprise this film was ! I went to see it without expecting much and it left me in a good mood for the rest of that day. I guess most movie goers will identify with Hugh Grant's character, some of us in more ways than one.<BR>After viewing it I recommended it to several memmbers of my family and they all loved it ! My recommendation is this: purchase it even if you haven't seen it. Nobody I know has been dissapointed by it so far.<BR>Best film of 2002 by a longshot !
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I think this movie was kind of tricky because we didn't understand until the middle of the story. He met real people and unreal people, but finally it became clear.

B00000IMTH|4.0|Several other reviewers have complained about the production<br />quality of this album....I disagree! I think that it has a very<br />loud, clear and bass heavy production. The sound is much more<br />full on this album. As for the songs, I think LONG LIVE has at<br />least four great songs on it.<br /> For the longest time, I was not too fond of the song RAINBOW<br />EYES, but NOW, at the full ripe age of 35, I completely adore<br />this track. It's very mellow, but also very sweet and sad and<br />melodic and features DIO's most laid back vocal ever. A beaut-<br />iful song which has some very nice flute playing in it and shows<br />off BLACKMORE's love of classical melodies, it's also slightly<br />daring in it's format: it actually stays mellow throughout it's<br />entire seven minutes. If DIO had recorded this song in the 80's,<br />he would've given it a soft beginning then had it ROCK OUT<br />REALLY LOUD throughout the rest of it, something that became a<br />big cliche for 80's metal.<br /> The rest of this album is RAINBOW at their absolute heaviest!<br />KILL THE KING is a very fast paced, speed metal song; LADY OF<br />THE LAKE is a very heavy riff rocker with another very memorable,<br />melodic guitar solo by BLACKMORE; THE SHED, a very bass heavy<br />hard rocker, shows DIO in a very ANGRY MOOD! WATCH OUT..HE'S<br />STREET WALKING!<br /> The album's best song has to be GATES OF BABYLON! DAVID STONE'S<br />synthesizer solo at the beginning is very mysterioso and sets up<br />the very dark mood for the rest of the song, which has some very<br />appropriate string arrangements in it and also has a very long<br />and very high quality and dark guitar solo by BLACKMORE. DIO's<br />lyrics are very scary and not mock scary either!This song ranks<br />right up there with STARGAZER and A LIGHT IN THE BLACK from<br />RISING.<br /> The title track is okay, tho it's a tad on the repetitious side<br />at the end. As with some of RAINBOW's other keyboardists, DAVID<br />STONE is barely heard on this, other than on the songs L.A.<br />CONNECTION and GATES OF BABYLON, but drummer COZY POWELL is out-<br />standing on this, as is DIO and MR.

B00000AFGM|5.0|marilyn manson really grabbed my attention when they performed'the beautiful people,' on the mtv video awards. the timing for them to do such a thing was perfect. it did not come off contrived and self-concious. it was at the end of the show and turned what was a dismally boring popfest on its head!!! i bought 'antichrist' immediately which i'd had before by the way, that i'd traded away as my mind was closed then.it is one of my faves that i'll never let go. it marks its spot in music history, and, is a masterpiece in its own right. when marilyn changed his image for'mechanical animals,' his timing again was spot on...even though he disappointed some if not a lot of his original fan base. but...what he did do was gain a lot more respect from people in the industry as well as gaining manynew fans. since music styles are eternally revisited it was time for glamrock to take another bow and mm did it beautiufully on this cd. this is a sonic work. deep and soaring. he proved himself to be a great singer. their ability to write music to reflect the past(especially bowie)without copying is a tough thing to do. this is one of the best rock discs of the 90's. pleeeaaase do yourself a favor and buy this cd! i like to listen to music while driving.i tend to be the most open then. do the same and i promise... sooner or later it will take you over. if youre not sure upon the first couple of listens..keep doing so..you to will be addicted. even robert hilburn of the l.a. times absolutely loved this disc. come on...go order it...NOW!!!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe, impressive muscle man in Gladiator, became the genius mathematician in this film.  John Nash, the main character, entered in Princeton University. He always njoyed making new theories alone.  One day, his genius was acknowledged, and he took part in solving a password in pentagon.  From this time, he started suffering from an obsession, in which he was always being watched from Russian.  He always had a virtual image every where.

With his wife's self-sacrifice, he overcame the mental barrier occupied with a virtual image.  In last, he said to the man who let him know that he won the Novel prize \\"I'm crazy\\".  Then, many other scholars around him put their pen on the table in front of him, which was expression of admiration for the scholar of greater achievement.<BR>We will see the most impressive scene this moment from the genius looks like abnormal man.

B000068FUS|1.0|I bought this cd believe what I've heard that this band is the next big thing in the y'alternative/&quot;no depression&quot; country-rock scene.  No dice.<br />This album is really tame and boring, nothing at all what you'd expect to hear in a southern rock cd.  It just really sounds like these guys were really bored while they were making this cd, they just don't put any life or emotion into most of the songs.  I honestly wouldn't even have been able to tell you that there was more than one guitar player in the band, most of the time it just sounds like one guy is overdubbing his solos on to the rhythm he's already played.<br />This is just a tepid, bland and lifeless cd.  Most bar bands pump more life into songs than these guys do on this cd.  Very very disappointing...
0385503954|5.0|_Atonement_ begins on a hot summer day in 1935, in an English countryside setting unusual for this author who is often drawn to extreme situations. Writing a quintessentially traditional third-person narrative, McEwan dances in and out of the minds of his characters, members of the Tallis family, cousins and friends. Central to the novel is an adolescent would-be writer, Briony Tallis, whose taste for drama and demand for attention lead her to tell a terrible lie about a family friend, Robbie Turner. McEwan fans will not be disappointed by the agonizing (and extreme) consequences that ripple out of her decision.<br />McEwan is often labeled a cold fish, and not without justification, but in this novel he makes us care more deeply about his characters than in any other that I've read. I personally found it hard to put down the book, I was so worried about the fate of his almost helpless dramatis personae. This is particularly true in the second portion of the novel, which leaps ahead to the early days of World War II. Robbie is in the British Army, in its infamous retreat to Dunkirk, while Briony and her sister Cecilia are nurses in London. McEwan's portrayal of this agonizing period in history is fantastic; Briony describes waking up every morning with an almost excited sense of something important about to happen, and then remembering what it is: a German invasion.<br />I won't ruin the novel's conclusion, and I'd recommend avoiding any &quot;spoiler&quot; reviews, because the shock of the epilogue is part of what makes this the best novel of the year, and the most unexpectedly metafictional. Having presented us with a prose narrative so conventional it is almost Victorian, and proven that the traditional novel retains its power to bridge the gap between people, McEwan trips off a final explosive charge that reverberates after the book is closed.
B00005Y228|5.0|The comeback album United States fans had been waiting for, Fever has once again thrust Kylie Minogue into the spotlight once shining during her all too brief chart explosion here in the late 80's. Garnering three top 40 smash singles, she faded from the US charts, despite retaining her chart impact everywhere else around the world. Many attempts were made to get her career here reignited, including the release and failures of two of her best singles, Better The Devil You Know and Confide In Me.<BR>Then came 2002. Around the world, \\"Kylie Fever\\" struck the year before, due to a little french electro disco ditty, titled \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\". Another groundbreaking single for her, it became her biggest hit. Not only was it magical enough to become such a chart smash, it also managed to have the punch to make this contagious \\"Fever\\" burn up the United States too. She was back. Soon the album went top three, and a second top 40 single was released from it, a more party disco flavored radio mix of \\"Love At First Sight\\". Now after her fifth top 40 release, she's ready to attack the charts again, with the breathy \\"Come Into My World\\". Here's to that being hit number six for the erstwhile Loco-Motion Girl.<BR>The album itself is pure disco pop. The songs are club ready, bouncing along and twisting about, totally carefree. Highlights here include the international only single \\"In Your Eyes\\", the fierce \\"Dancefloor\\", the storming \\"Burning Up\\", the smoldering \\"Fragile\\", and the pop flavored title track. The album is a rarity, in that there isn't a single poor track. All of them are excellent and catchy. Some bonus tracks were also included in the earliest versions, both every bit as contagious as the rest. The track \\"Butterfly\\", also available on the album \\"Light Years\\", was a minor single release also.<BR>This album deserves every last star, it's such a good pop release. Hopefully, if you don't have this, you'll go and pick yourself up a brand new copy. An excellentrelease.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Listened to the new Cash tonight! incredible-  Cash- \\"The man comes around\\"- yes he does. His voice, especially on the first song, the title track, it sounds as though he actually embodies all of the world's frailty, all of it that has ever existed since the dawn of time, it's sadness and pain as well as it's loneliness and despair-<BR>and at the same time all of the strength in the universe! <BR>Throughout, it is so incredibly powerful and moving, spanning from explorations of armageddon and death to exultations of pure, final love and hope. There seems to be a clear presience -awareness- of who he is, and where he is in his life that is singularly wrenching. <BR>He does a Hank, Sr. duet -I'm so lonesome I could cry- with Nick Cave - christ, I felt like I was brought back to my childhood- the power of my mother's voice, singing a lulaby to me. The record is actually on the same label (with American) as Hank III, lone highway... and is simply one of the best records I have ever heard- probably the best of the American Recordings. His cover of Nine Inch Nails \\"Hurt\\" is one of the most chilling and powerful songs I have EVER heard.<BR>And it finishes with one of my ALL time favorites by Vera Lynn - \\"We'll meet again...\\" I could only hope to be so lucky.
B000066NW0|5.0|OK I loved this.I have never even herd of this women before.Where have I been?The intire CD is great.I love Complicated and Anything, But Ordinary.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|OK, he's not THE Man, but after listening to this album, there's only one thing to say: WOW.  What power, what passion...a wonderful production of what may be his most intimate album ever.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The first time that I saw Fight Club, I was not impressed. I missed the beginning of the film and I came to realize after viewing the movie for a second time, Fight Club is a pretty neat movie. I think I was anticipating more &quot;Fight Club&quot; fight scenes rather than a very involved plot that really leaves you amazed at the end.<br />What makes Fight Club a decent movie is the fact that whether you know it or not, you are partially clueless as to what is really going on throughout the movie. Masking this cluelessness was done very well and explained properly in the end. The two main characters were first rate and I really came to appreciate Brad Pitt for more than just a pretty boy after seeing this as well as 7. The whole cast was exellent and between the different action scenes, dialogue sequences and crazy stunts, there was more than enough going on to keep your attention even while clueless. The climax, conclusion and summary of everything leaves you feeling mildly shocked, enlightened and even a bit confused though you think you understand finally; one of your first reactions is &quot;I should watch that again&quot;.<br />Fight Club is an atypical movie that gets the brain to function more than the average flick. The movie is a superb piece in itself and the amount of effort that went into creating the final product is evident. I suggest that the viewer be ready for anything, open-minded, and has time to watch it again. It is a great dvd to get and an interesting experience.
0312263511|5.0|Gene Cernan`s book an near perfect writing about those legendary first days of manned space exploration. For such Apollo maniacs, as me, essential reading. You can know from it, how become an youngster to an naval aviator, then an naval aviator to an astronaut and at last an astronaut to an moonwalkwer. It`s funny to see things through an insider`s glasses. Furthermore styles of Gene Cernan and Don Davis brilliantly complete each other, and the final result is an vibrant, from beginning to end gripping story. Maybe the only one imperfection in the book is those lot of &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;sonofabitch&quot;
0553381709|5.0|GEORGE R R MARTIN IS THE BEST FANTASY AUTHOR IN PRINT SINCE ROBERT JORDAN HIT THE SCENE, AND IN MY OPINION BETTER. THE DEPTH OF THE CHARACTERS HE HAS CREATED IS AMAZING. THERE IS CONSTANTLY ACTION, OR SUSPENCE LEADING UP TO. IF YOU THINK THESE BOOKS ARE GETTING SLOW... BE CAREFUL . SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
B00005JHCP|5.0|This is an excellent conversion from the original David Copperfield book unlike certain other conversions of other books which turn out terrible. The actors play their parts extreamely well and are full of character. The settings are also great they are breathtaking and visually stunning. Even though the video leaves out subplots and characters, they werent needed and if they were included it would make the video even longer than it already is and also might become boring. The video is extreamely accurate and stays with the story line of the book unlike other conversions. Some people might think that it wouldnt be any good because the book and video are a bit old. This is not the case. The book was excellent but the video was even better. It is very nice and fun to watch and keeps you interested. You will probably find yourself watching it time and time again. It is an excellent movie and if you didnt already know the actor for young David was the same actor for Harry Potter. An excellent movie conversion a must see.
B00005JKHP|4.0|First of all, let me say that even as a long-time (20+ years) Star Trek fan, I have never been terribly impressed by the series' feature-film debut. It's rather slow-paced, but I never really had a problem with that - to me, the pace of film gives it room to breathe - gives (as is noted in the audio commentary on the DVD) the special effects guys and composer Jerry Goldsmith room to really show their stuff. The main issue I have with the film is this (not my observation originally, by the way - I think it was speculative fiction author Harlan Ellison who first pointed this out)(***SPOILER ALERT!***): the Voyager probe is taken in by this race of near-divine mechanical beings, right? This race of beings is all-but-omnipotent/omniscient... and they can't figure out that all they need to do is wipe off a little carbon scoring in order to discern Voyager's full name? Come ON.<br />Okay, so much for the film. The DVD presentation of it is EXCELLENT. A very nice widescreen transfer onto disc, excellent 5.1 surround sound, really kewl interactive menus, audio commentary by director Robert Wise, special effects supervisors Douglas Trumbull and John Dykstra, Jerry Goldsmith, and Stephen Collins (Capt. Decker), text commentary by Star Trek Encyclopedia co-author Michael Okuda - not to mention the Director's Edition itself, which does a nice job of tightening up some of the excessively slow parts of the original film while adding some really nice, unobtrusive CGI shots. And that's just the first disc!<br />So, in conclusion - if you're a fan of this film, you're DEFINTELY gonna want to own this DVD. Even if you're not, it's probably worthwhile for you to at least rent it or check it out from your local library just to see all the wonderful extras.<br />Final rating (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):<BR>Film: 2 1/2 stars<BR>DVD: 5 stars<BR>Average: 3 3/4 stars
B00003CXRP|5.0|Tom Hanks performed very well in the movie &quot;Cast Away&quot;. Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a manager of FedEx, who was stranded on a deserted island by a strong thunderstorm when he was going back to Memphis for his dentist appointment. The picture and sound quality from the DVD are wonderful. The extras are also wonderful including the documentaries and featurettes. An excellent movie!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I recorded this whole series on HBO, and I have to say, I have watched all 11 hours of it at least 7 times. This is the greatest World War..wait..WAR movie of all times. Split into diffenerent episodes so you can see a viewpoint from different soldiers, you begin the bond with the mean of Easy Company from episode one. This has very gory scenes in some parts, but the thing that makes it so realistic is how the actors react. I love the actors in this movie. They act like they were in the real war. <br />Believe me, I though Saving Private Ryan was the best war movie ever, but, nevermind that. This movie makes Saving Private Ryan look like a power rangers episode. <br />Mark my word, if you buy this and do not like this show, I will do anything for you. I love Band of Brothers and the story behind it, Im sure you will too!
B00005JGAB|5.0|If you don't already own this albulm in some form, what are you waiting for?  I can't guess how many times I've heard these songs, and it hasn't left my CD changer since it arrived a month ago.  Take some of those over-produced derivative CDs in your collection down to a used CD store and trade them in for the cash to buy this.  These songs will still be part of your mental soundtrack twenty-five years from now.<br />The rest face a tougher call, especially those who have &quot;All the Stuff (And More) Vol. 1&quot;  Frankly, the re-mastering for this release  doesn't make an appreciable difference (in response to another reviewer:  I don't hear the guitar as muted.  Check your equalizer?  The bass is *slightly* deeper, I think).  The 1975 demo tracks are fun to have, and Ramones completists will shell out the price of this CD quite happily for them.  For the average listener, however, the Demo tracks are in no instance a remarkably different version of the song.  &quot;You Should Never Have Opened That Door (Demo)&quot; sounds like it belongs with the rest of this albulm moreso than with the slightly more pop &quot;Leave Home&quot; (as does &quot;I Don't Care (Demo)&quot;, if one isn't too used to it being on &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;).<br />The truth is that the demos (and the single version of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;) are frosting for those of us who want to hear every note recorded by The Ramones in their genre-defining heydey.  For others who own the original or &quot;All the Stuff... 1&quot;, this albulm is not a necessity.
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"I wasn't a hero but I fought with a lot of men who were.\\" So says one of this heroic brand of brothers, the men of Easy Company. This best captures the ethos of this work. And it is an excellent experience and vivid history.<br />This epic runs from July 1942 to shortly after the end of the war in Europe. Starting with the company''s initial bonding experience, under the hot, miserable, days of training under an abusive, \\"chickens--t\\"  first leader, the brothers came together. They learned to hate their leader perhaps as much as the looming Germans; later, this mode of training earned begrudging respect from some of the men. But not before a revolt in their ranks prior to being shipped out to Europe.<br />D-Day offered an early, hard test of their training and teamwork. Their success at knocking out a field battery, I have heard, remains a training example today. Following the own, self-assessment that, if there was a dirty job that needed to be done, Easy Company would be assigned to do it, the brother fight through Holland, the Ardennes, and, finally, Germany.<br />The details of the production fully reveal the $120 million invested. The sepia tones create a wonderful sense of time and place. The large, ensemble cast is magnificent, including David Schwimmer in an unlikely and unlikeable role as the much-despised training camp leader. Damien Lewis, a fine English actor, captures the respect of his men as the focal point Cpt Winter. Each man has something to say, something to contribute. They really are a team, linked by mutual respect and a hard-edged sense of purpose. Watching the men train, struggle, fight and die, I could help but feel frustrated, sympathetic, impressed and sad along with them. I cried more times than I care to recall.<br />This is a fitting, perfect extension of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" As Colonel Chamberlain says in \\"Gettysburg\\", \\"What it comes down to, in the end, is that we're fighting for is each other.\\"
B000066AXE|5.0|The movie is a real story. It shows a great mathematics scientist. His name was Jon Nash. He was so smart and he focused on the numbers. He always studied alone. But he had a problem. He had schizophrenia. He could see three people. No one could see them.  One people was called big brother. He gave a secret job to Jon Nash. Other people were his roommate and his niece, but the people were not real. They just appeared in Jon Nash's mind. <BR>Finally he went to the mental hospital when he worked in a university. Passed that time, he won The Nobel Prize. He also became a respected professor. Because of his wife, he could a success. Her name was Alicia. They met in the university. She was a student in his class. She was so smart and had wisdom. She helped him to notice his problem. He knew that the niece did not grow up. He was different from other schizophrenic people. <BR>I especially like the scene that was in caf. He wondered about his feeling for her. At that time she asked him three questions. After that he was able to be sure of her. And the last scene was very impressive. When he won the Noble Prize he spoke to her in front of an audience.  They loved each other with all their hearts. I couldn't find bad things. I learned how to love and how to solve problems as well.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|When I heard Speilberg had edited out guns and the word 'terrorist' from the original, I was skeptical of this politically correct version.  However, aside from these two scenes I have to admit that the touched-up version is excellently done.  The DVD is a delight for E.T. fans, hours of bonus materials including a live soundtrack version from the 2002 premeire.  The added scenes are a nice bonus, the bathroom scene was good.  And for those of you who just couldn't stomach the PC changes from Hollywood's liberal elites, take heart: the DVD includes a copy of the original 1982 version.  A great addition to your collection.
B000002UA5|2.0|By their own admission, the members of Pink Floyd were searching for musical direction during the period after the departure of founding member Syd Barrett. As bassist Roger Waters said, in his usual blunt way: &quot;We didn't know how to play, so we banged around on our instruments and called it music.&quot; That might be overstating it a little, after all two stellar albums, Atom Heart Mother and Meddle came from that time period...but then there's Ummagumma. This double album set is an interesting showcase of both the worst and best of Pink Floyd. With the exception of Grantchester Meadows and parts of Dave Gilmour's The Narrow Way, there isn't a shred a listenable music on Disc 1. It can't even be called progressive rock because while there's musical &quot;experimentation,&quot; there isn't any virtuosity or even skill in the composition and playing.<BR>Disc 2, however, is another matter. An entirely live recording of some early Floyd concert standards, this disc highlights Floyd's strengths as a band - the moody, atmospheric jams driven by Dave Gilmour's intense guitar solos. Every member of the band kicks in and gives it their all resulting in a tight performance and explosive finish. The sonic quality of the recording is fair to good but bear in mind it's a 1968 recording from an analog source. <BR>It's a shame these two albums aren't available separately. Disc 1: 0 stars, Disc 2: 4 stars for a final rating of 2 stars.
B000055Y0X|5.0|....and great acting too!!<br />This movie has it all and does it all.  The acting is incredibly good.  The storyline is crisp and direct, and grabs your attention literally by the throat and never lets go.  The ending will do much more than rattle you.  It rocks!<br />A US Air Force general, on his own authority, has decided to order his planes to attack the old Soviet Union.  His notion is brutally simple:  he reasons that in order to prevent a devastating counterattack, the US will have no choice but to follow his lead and launch a full attack upon the Russian military.  Well, you know that that doesn't happen.  What does happen is pretty unforgettable.  By the way, this is not a \\"fail-safe\\" ripoff.  These are two very different movies and themes, albeit they share a single common idea--that \\"the bomb\\" might get out of control.<br />This movie has everything.  It manages to present a serious theme seriously, but the humor which punctuates this film like bullets is absolutely hysterically funny.  And if you don't think so, there is something wrong with the purity of your own bodily ... fluids.  (See the flick and you'll know what I mean.)<br />The sense of reality and authenticity of this Stanley Kubrick film is incredible.  When you are up with the B-52s, you KNOW that this is a real B-52. When US infantry goes into action, you KNOW it is the real thing.  This is another black-and-white flick that benefits from this medium.<br />This is a DVD that you'll want to own and watch many times.  It is unforgettable.
B00005JHCP|4.0|If any English Teachers out there are wondering what movie they should play in class next, this is a must. It kept my class of 8W on their seats. As a teenager I thought it would be another boring English Movie. But it wasn't. I enjoyed it because it was bursting with adventure and the story line was always moving along. David was the most lovable character. He was a good role model because even when the tough times were really tough he kept his chin up. There are many lovable characters but with this there are many dislikeable characters. I gave this a four star because of it's lack in balance. There were to many bad times and not enough good. All teachers should get this for there class.
B00004XPPE|4.0|This is a powerful movie about an accidental attack upon the old USSR by a wing of American strategic bombers.  Both sides scramble to avert world war three, as the bombers streak towards their target.  There are no memorable special effects here, but everything looks incredibly authentic.  The effect of reality is nearly total.<br />The movie is in black and white.  This adds subtly to the sense of authenticity that the movie achieves.  I don't know how it would have been in color.<br />I personally did not like Henry Fonda as the President, but that may be a matter of personal preference.  I find him annoying, particularly in this movie.  But no matter--this is a taut thriller that moves smartly to its startling conclusion.<br />One notable thing about this movie is its crisp story line.  Almost every single scene is integral to the story.  No long dreary interludes such as almost every European movie seems to have.  Here, everything we see is there for a reason--the storyline literally races towards the unforgettable ending.<br />This is one you don't want to miss.  Buy it and own it.
076790592X|5.0|An old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson.  In the book Tuesdays with Morrie, Mitch learns some of the most important things in life through his old professor and beloved friend, Morrie.  As the years after college pass by, things change and Mitch has broken his promise to always stay in touch.  Until one night, Mitch is flipping through the TV channels, finally taking a break from work, which he never seems to do anymore.  He sees Morrie on the \\"Nightline\\" show talking about how he's been battling the illness ALS.  Mitch realizes now more than ever, he must find Morrie before it's too late.  After he does this, Mitch and Morrie begin to meet every Tuesday, and only on Tuesdays because they are Tuesday people.  They don't share small talk; they actually have a conversation.  Morrie teaches Mitch the answers to some of life's hardest questions.  In the last class of his life, Morrie teaches about the world, feeling sorry for yourself, regrets, death, family, emotions, the fear of aging, money, how love goes on, marriage, culture, the perfect day, and saying good-bye.  Morrie seems to find such peace and simplicity in such hard topics.  He shares every ounce of his wisdom with Mitch.  On their last visit together, they say good-bye, and Mitch finally cries; Morrie finally got him.  During the burial, as he promised, Mitch tries talking to Morrie through his thoughts, and it seems so easy.  That's when he finally looks down at his watch and realizes its because, it's Tuesday.<BR> I would definitely recommend this book. I've never read anything that had as much meaning and purpose to it as this book does.  In every chapter, I found a page to mark of a lesson or saying that I wanted to share with someone.  I learned so much and gained such an amazing perspective on life that I never used to have.  No mater who you are, what your age, or where you're from, there's something to be learned from Morrie.  It could have been sad, but Morrie chose to make it amazing.
B00004RF83|4.0|This is a wonderful movie.  The subject is simple: at the height of the Cold War there is a military plot to seize control of the US government.  The storyline is complex, but nevertheless does not drag.  The movie manages rather to proceed gradually but steadily to its hard-hitting conclusion. The movie keeps the momentum going without much in the way of extraneous material. Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas both turn in fine performances.  The supporting cast is of similar caliber.<br />The most frightening thing about the movie is that it manages to make a pretty good case that such a thing could actually happen.  Let's all hope the military has enough fine officers like Kirk Douglas in this film to prevent it from happening!<br />This movie retains a wonderful feeling of authenticity.  It is filmed in black and white which possibly adds to that, and also to the 1960s-era theme.<br />This one is a keeper.  You'll watch it more than once.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This HBO series based on the Ambrose novel is an engrossing tale of the men of Easy Company during the second world war, told with cinematic perfection. The action scenes are astounding, and the acting is superb. This series really goes above and beyond any war movie or series ever made. The realism, drama, and action in Band of Brothers is truly amazing. It should stand for years to come as one of the most impressive achievements in war filmmaking along with Saving Private Ryan. <br />The DVD set is awesome. Great tin container with holographic cover and fold out DVD holders inside, and the bonus materials in the set are excellent. Flawless in every way, this set is a must have for anyone who enjoys great filmmaking.
B0000636UN|4.0|Not being a Sheryl Crow fan, I was somewhat surprised when I found myself purchasing it, but I'd recently heard Steve McQueen so how could I resist?  And I was pleasantly surprised - most of the album is quite good.  Laden with guest vocalists, the album is a great listen.  I only find fault in two areas.  First, the production is such that its difficult to differentiate Crow's backing vocals from those of the many guests.  Second, what's up with the Soak Up The Sun song?  This has got to be one of the single dumbest, mind-numbing songs to come along in years.  I'd heard it on the radio several times but never fully appreciated the depth of its stupidity.  Lucky for us, the remainder of the album is much, much better.
B00006JSS8|5.0|The Soul superstar genius Stevie Wonder has enthralled audiences for over three decades now, with his origanal, well-crafted work that demonstrates a genuine, raw talent. From the breathless, infectious pop of Fingertips, it was clear from an early age he was a gifted singer/songwriter and muscian. Fingertips was a sheer masterpiece! Exciting musical arrangements featuring a fabulously effective interlude from Stevie playing the harmonica, this marked the beginning of the musical legends career. Clearly his Motown work was his most compelling from the R&amp;B/Pop sounds of the vibrant, upbeat Uptight (Everything's Alright) to the more raw Superstition, containing an elements of pulsating funk. Stevie was a masterful ballad writer and he scored several hits in the late 1960's with co-writer Henry Cosby on such strong, passionate ballads such as My Cherie Amour and A Place In The Sun whilst continuing his run of infectious R&amp;B/Pop tunes that carry the traditional Maotown sound on tracks like the fabulous Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours, Yesterme-Yesteryou-Yesterday, I Was Made To love Her and For Once In My Life. Like Marvin Gaye, his work steadily progressed from the formulaic sounds of Motown to more creative and indepth material on tracks such as the startling Superstition, the anthemic Higher Ground and the awesome Living For The City, a severn-minute epic about the perils of ghetto life. His work explored social and political issues that deservedly won wide acclaim from critics. Eventually his work settled into the more middle-of-the-road material like the saccharine, I Just Called To Say I Love You, but he still takes credit for writing and recording some of the most remarkable songs that have comfortably stood the test of time and set standards for many younger contemporaries.  This definitive collection is just that - enthralling from beginning to end, it is essential to any casual fan. Recommended!
B000002H2H|5.0|I think this is metallicas best cd, it doesnt have there best songs on it, but overall its better than any of there other cds.

B00006HBUA|4.0|Two years after a clash of egos forced Mystery Inc, to close it's doors. Scooby Doo (Voiced by Scott Innes), Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Velma (Linda Cardellini) are asked to go investigate a mystery on Spooky Island, when the Owner (Rowan Atkison) hired them. But when they get more than they asked, when they see strange going-ons of Pananormal Sightings and Unusual Behavoir with the Tourists. Now, they have to put-thier personal differents and solve the case together.<br />Directed by Raja Cosnell (Home Alone 3, Big Momma's House) made a enjoyable comedy/fantasy film with a delightful performance by Lillard. The cast seems to be having a great time. CGI Scooby Doo is better than you expected, once you see the flick. One of the Biggest Hit of 2002. DVD has an bright Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and on the anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer is sharp. Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound is strong on these two different DVD`s. DVD Extras have two different commentary tracks by the filmmakers and cast. Deleted Scenes with/without commentary. Behind the Scenes footage and more. This is a surprisngly good film for all ages. Pamela Anderson appears Unbilled. Grade:A-.
0385484518|5.0|The novel, Tuesdays with Morrie is a touching and true documentary of the relationship between old friends, Morrie Schwartz and Mitch Albom, the books author. When Mitch Albom graduated from Brandeis College, he had promised his professor and friend, Morrie Schwartz that he would keep in touch.  Mitch did not keep this promise and they grew apart.  One evening while watching Nightline, an interview program, Mitch was surprised to see Morrie on the show.  The show talked about how Morrie suddenly got a disease called ALS.  Their affection for each other was rekindled when Mitch contacted Morrie after seeing the Nightline interview.  Mitch would fly in from Detroit to visit Morrie every Tuesday to talk with him.  They would have deep conversations about many aspects of life such as the world, marriage, regrets, death, family, and so on.  Mitch, with Morries permission, recorded Morries wise words on a tape in order to remember him when his time was up.  However, as the Tuesdays rolled by, Morries health deteriorated.He knew that these were the last days of his life, and soon he slipped into a coma.  <BR>   I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a new outlook on life and a few wise words.  You can share with Mitch, all of the life lessons that Morrie taught him.  It is extremely hard to put this book down once you start to read it.
B00000FBRE|5.0|lagwagon at its best.  i can listen to this cd anytime.  its short, about 30 minutes worth of fun.  all the songs are great and this cd has a great flow to it.  buy it now son.
6304508611|3.0|I first saw Carrie: The Rage II, before I saw this Carrie (1976). I liked it, and thought that the original would be even better, aside from some lesser bad special effects.  I didn't get the chance to see it until after I saw the remake Carrie (2002), made for television just a few days ago.  This blew me out of my mind. The plot was amazing, shocking, and excellent.  The characters were defined and the time was used wisely to get in depth with them.  Carrie herself was believeable, and was rather psychotic, which made complete sense.  I couldn't wait to see the original.  But I was immediatly let down.  Carrie, in the (1976), acts like a backward hick girl, and pretty normal, and the kids don't torment her much at all, and it made no sense for her to create the masscre in the gym.  In the remake (2002) she is obviously crazy, and the whole time she is losing control of her mind and powers, where as in the(1976), it doesn't lead up to her complete breakdown, and it is impactless.  The acting is bad, and all the characters are all underdevolped.  Only the mother is well represented, and done even better in the (2002) version.  Of course the effects in the new one are mind blowing, and creative, and more time is put into the climax, as well as the whole movie. Though it is presently unavailable, I recommend anyone who likes this version, to buy the new version whenever it comes to video or DVD.  It is excellent.  Or Carrie:  The Rage II.  Both are certainly better than the original.
B00000IQC8|5.0|It's black and white, but don't worry - it's not a pretenious independent film. &quot;Clerks&quot; is a defining movie for the early 90's grunge/alternative era. Always vulgar, usually funny, and never pulling any punches, Kevin Smith put his name on the map with this hilarious film.<br />Yeah, the acting is bad. The sound isn't great. And there are no special effects or big explosions. If that's what you need for a good movie; go rent the fast and the furious. But if you want a film that's edgy and truly innovative, check this one out. &quot;Clerks&quot; is one of the best movies of the past twenty years!
B00006IU73|5.0|This might be one of the best albums of this year.  But more importantly, this  is a prog rock influenced album for people who don't like prog rock.  Compared to any other alt metal act at the moment, Porcupine Tree have far more depth.  Yes,some of the songs are too long and the instrumental \\"Wedding Nails\\" really disrupts the flow.  But listen to the songs. Really great.  The excellent song writing and great production value obliterate any of those shortcomings.  <br />And I think Tool fans should buy this album with no reservations.  In a lot of ways, Porcupine Tree have succeeded where the last TOOL album came up short.  And again, the songs are so strong.<br />Go to your favorite cd shop and ask to listen to track 1, \\"Blackest Eyes\\".  If that song doesn't blow your mind or kick you in the [bum] then I have nothing more to say. <br />In Absentia deserves to be a million sellar.  It's that good.  <br />end <BR>kdc
B00005K3NY|4.0|This is a very intelligent horror film. It plays with your mind. Yes there is blood in it, but that doesn't detract from the films power, no far from that, it enhances the power of the film, and creates a very unsettling atmosphere. It's not for everybody though, but if you want something that'll mess with your mind, this is the one to see! Buy or Rent today!
B000006OS2|1.0|McLintock is a great comedy/western; the casting is perfect and the script intelligent and witty.  However, Good Times Video treated this excellent movie with tremendous disrespect and cheated buyers of this DVD badly.  The ancient Greek saying of <BR>&quot;caveat emptor&quot; or &quot;let the buyer beware&quot; fits well here.<BR>Anytime you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video I highly recommend that you pass purchasing that item. Hopefully a REAL version of McLintock will be released by John Wayne's estate soon.  This movie was not one of John Wayne's favorites and was released late for being such a good movie.  Hopefully this had nothing to do with the estate of Mr. Wayne in releasing a crisp (and letter box) version.
0451196716|5.0|I have read Stephen King for the last 16 years or so and am an avid fan of his work.  All are pretty good, many are great.  'The Long Walk' is one of the greatest of the great.  <br />I have read this story three times over the last decade and a half and have gotten more out of the story each time. This story simply gives a lot and keeps on giving.  <br />The characters are unforgettable.  Ray Garraty and Pete McVries form a bond that is so strong they are willing to risk &quot;the Prize&quot; and their lives for one another.  Interestingly, at the time this bond becomes the strongest, the two have only known each other for about two days.  This is only one example of how this terrible contest forges relationships between its many participants.<br />The storyline, while simple, and at times existing only in the minds of the various Walkers, keeps you enthralled and you will find yourself unable to put the book down until the end.  You never know what will happen next or who will be the next walker to be eliminated from the contest.  <br />As a long distance runner I often think about this story while on long runs.  While not exactly the same, the real horror hits home when I think about not being able to stop or slow down and the price to pay if you do.  <br />The ending of the book is a little fast and abrupt but is very disturbing, particularly the last line.  <br />Overall this is one of the first King books (written as Bachman) that I have ever read and over the years I find myself going back to it again and again. It is a short read and an excellent story.  Highly recommended.
B000002UDD|5.0|This is Megadeth's 3rd, and in my opinion most under appreciated album. As most Megadeth fans know, the album &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was critiqued very positively for its complexity and composition. Why the heck did it take them that long!? They should have listened to &quot;So Far SO Good So What!?&quot;! First of all, and I may be biased, but this album is VERY complex coming from a guitar players point of view. Its an ALMOST perfect blend of speed, thrash, mainstream solo, kick em' in the face type of record. It REALLY gets you pumped. Especially &quot;Into the lungs of hell&quot;, the first song, man its an awesome musical feat for Mustaine and former guitarist Jeff Young. The song gives me Goosebumps. And every song has SOME part in it that makes you want to either headbang, or go pick up a guitar and shred! So for a serious Mega fan, this is SO the album for you.
6304938241|3.0|I loved this story by Henry James, it was haunting and yet some of its truths are still very much true even in the new millenium. While the film overall is a little dark that I suppose supported the sordid tale that is being told. The characters were portrayed as Henry James wrote them originally. Although I thought the ending was a bit gratuitous.
B00005JL0I|1.0|Spend your money on popcorn, not this film.  The story is poor at best, acting is so-so, and the theme is awful.  Sellers and Niven are much better actors than portrayed here.  This is a horrible movie.  Nothing to do with a &quot;007 James Bond&quot; type film at all.  Very disappointing.
B00005U18E|5.0|This has to be the funniest chick flick I have seen in ages. While it doesn't follow the book exactly, it does grasp some of the funnier moments and situations. Just the fact that they actually picked Colin Firth to play Mark Darcy is quite humorous indeed since the character was based on Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in the BBC mini series Pride and Prejudice to begin with. I also noticed that they sort of took ideas from both books for this movie, which leaves me wondering why they would think of doing a sequel to this movie. Anyways, this movie is hysterically funny and yet very sweet.
0060977493|3.0|This book got better as its conclusion neared, but it was a long slog. It took me a month to get through it.  Despite the lovely descriptions, the book offerred little reading pleasure. The story is a dark one we've all heard before -- rich woman, poor man, racial taboos, punishment.<br />While I finally accepted the &quot;whimsical&quot; (whimsy with an anvil) language in which the author got across the children's point of view -- I felt all of the characters lacked depth. Everyone is given a thumbnail sketch history, which doesn't really work for me. Later, actions and inner thoughts get a some play, which was an improvement.<br />I was just not engaged in the children's story, though I know I'm supposed to care. The foreshadowing and suspense, practically in every sentence, made what happened at the end anti-climactic. Later on in the book, the author gives us six or seven pages of the brief marriage of Chacko, the children's uncle, and Margaret, his English wife. I could have spent a whole book with these two in their mismatched marriage --because for once cliches were subverted. He (like all the other characters in the family here) is a spoiled Indian of an upper caste, Margaret a solid working class English girl.<br />We are supposed to believe that the traumatic incidents that happened in the book destroyed both twins for life, but I know that things just don't happen that way. They just come off as rich and spoiled. Early on we get a familiar whine -- Rahel's family paid her school fees, but offered no love -- she is so depressed it took her eight years to get through college, when she goes to the U.S., she sits dully in a parking ticket booth. If she'd had to pay her own fees, you can bet she would have made something better with her life.<br />I'm sorry, but these books of the Indian upper class are starting to make me hate that society. Snobs are no more attractive if they are dark skinned than if they are white and Anglo. One older aunt here comes in for a skewering -- but I wonder what the book says about the younger generation, which is so weak and solipsistic here, as represented by the grown up, depressed twins, who seem to lack all bravery and vision. You wonder what you're supposed to be taking away from this book. The after effects of the tragedy are just plain overdone. In the end, it's a sad, soap opera that we've read before from English authors.a skewering -- but I wonder what the book says about the younger generation, which is so weak and solipsistic here, as represented by the grown up, depressed twins, who seem to lack all bravery and vision.

B000002LK1|5.0|I was always aware of DM throughout the 80's through a good friend of mine who only played their records when we went to her place.  I got so sick of them that everytime I saw the name I'd cringe.  I'd simply never REALLY listened to DM.  That is, until VIOLATOR.  I heard POLICY OF TRUTH & got hooked forever.  I must have played this CD so much I almost had myself convinced that this was the only record they'd ever produced.  I soon found '101' in a sale bin & decided they'd be my new obsession. I've since collected everything they've ever produced, finally satisfied.  I even went to see them on their EXCITER TOUR.  I believe I happily suffered whiplash that night from dancing so hard!  It brought me back (I partied in the early 80's in the downtown NYC scene)!! The tunes to check out on this cd are PERSONAL JESUS, ENJOY THE SILENCE, WORLD IN MY EYES, BLUE DRESS & CLEAN. Actually, this cd is flawless. You could loop it & play it endlessly without noticing, it is so seamless!!  Regardless of what detractors say, this is the CD to start with, but DO NOT stop there!!  Hit the earlier works & ULTRA (SORRY!! I love that one - listen again, naysayers!!!).  Also, see them if you ever get the priviledge!!  Peace!!

B00004T8RK|5.0|This particular album is recorded in 'binaural'. It means 2 microphones for each instrument. The aim of the recording technique is to send different sounds to different ears (sort of). There are some songs on this album I truly enjoyed without headphones. Those being \\"Light Years\\", \\"Thin Air\\" and \\"Nothing as it seems\\".  But put on those headphones to really experience the excellence of this album. You are taken to a different place! I am telling ya! Try it out. <br />After listening to the bootlegs that were released from their 2000 tour, I have to say that the songs on this album sounds much better live!  The songs get more life and it is easier to listen to them. I'd give it 4,5 stars, but had to give it 5 due to the average being below that. <br />Try this album out and be open minded!!! (with headphones)
B000002UAR|5.0|Maybe the title of this review is slightly pathetic, but if I had to choose an example of one album that has withstood tests of time without bruises, The Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" would be it. It's not that it was way ahead of its time; why, The Beatles (especially in their later years) pushed pop-music boundaries further and helped define the entire 1963-1970 era through their career. Simply put, this album is as far as ever from being dated, retains melodic quality and at the same time is much deeper than \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" stuff.    On the way from unadulterated pop quality of \\"Rubber Soul\\" to acclaimed Sgt. Pepper's concept masterpiece, \\"Revolver\\" has to offer songs that rank among the most magnificent pieces of popular music ever written. The poignant \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", oriental \\"Love You To\\", melodious \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" and intelligent \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Doctor Robert\\" shine, complementing wonderfully with gems like \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" (and SWING! -- this song always brightens up my day) and endearingly sweet/sad \\"For No One\\".    A taste for experiment pays off nicely with \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", \\"I Want To Tell You\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". The only minor letdowns are minimalist \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (just too simple to fit in) and humorous \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (is it because I knew the 1995 light version performed by British singer Suggs earlier and so am a little bit biased and fail to see the real value of the song?).    Anyway, \\"Revolver\\" is by far the best weapon I know. It is loaded with superb 'cartridges' and every music lover certainly should think seriously about adding it to the collection. Real music lovers have probably done so already.
B000066NW0|5.0|...Avril Lavigne is the best artist charting at this moment in time. I bought her CD the minute I had worked long enough to save up for it.<BR>In my opinion Miss Lavigne did an excellent job writing this album, and some of the best songs on it are the slower ones or the harder-edged ones (like I'm With You or Naked for slow and Nobody's Fool and Unwanted for fast, those happen to be my favorites)<BR>The album is amazing!!!
B00005JKCH|5.0|For all you web fans, you will not be disappointed with this movie nor the performance of the actors, Tobey does a wonderful job as the teenage Spider Man and the story line remains true to the original comic book characters. The suit is perfectly detailed in the movie and the wall climbing shots are excellent. Take a look at this movie and add it to your collection-ASAP.<br />-Raymon Q.

0618077367|5.0|I read this book for the first time last year to a group of four year olds I was teaching. I had to choke back the tears. This book brings the spirit of Christmas and the fun of Santa Clause back to your  heart. One of those books that just touches your holiday heart and  soul and brings you there to the experience this wonderful boy is going through. A MUST for Christmas and should be a family tradition for years to come!!!
B000063V8U|5.0|This season of Star Trek-The Next Generation is fabulous entertainment. It is very strong storytelling, the characters gain more depth than one could have hoped for. Picard is tormented by the Cardassians in the two-part-episode \\"Chain of command\\", possibly the second most notable ordeal in the whole series follwing his first one with the Borg. We get to see \\"Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott\\" from the original series again in the episode \\"Relics\\", who is suspended for about 75 years in a transporter-buffer. This episode is a fine example for how a transitional episode involving a cast member from the original series is done, because the story is about remembrance. Surely this episode invoked tears in some of Star Trek oldest fan-communities. The episode \\"Schisms\\" is sort of \\"Twilight Zone\\"-like, crew members are abducted and medically examined by aliens from another universe or dimension. It has a nice creepy element to it and an ending wihtout many hints or explanations. Prof. Moriarty returns with an elaborate plan to finally exit the holodeck and entering the real world in a very cleverly made episode. \\"Face of the Enemy\\" features thrill and excitement with Troi posing as a Romulan to assist the Romulan underground movement saving some important high dignataries. The cliffhanger once again sets the crew up against their relentless enemy, the Borg. This episode is very entertaining and thrilling, but one has to admit it would have worked maybe as well with another species of cybernetic or robotic lifeform as it did with the Borg. The first two appearances of the Borg brought a quality and richness to them as never reached again in any future-episodes with them, be it 'Next-Gen' or 'Voyager'. At least in 'First Contact' the feeling of what they were and represented is brought back to life, when Picard is faced with his ultimate nightmare-experience with them. But in the end I have nothing but high praise for this season showing once more what good fiction can be.
B000001IPL|5.0|not one bad track    especially got to get away from me
B00005JKNC|1.0|The director of The Majestic also directed my favorite film of all time -- The Shawshank Redemption.  I also really like Jim Carrey, Martin Landau, and the beautiful Laurie Holden.  On top of that, I saw The Majestic with friends at a free screening at the nicest theater I've ever been in.<br />Given the same conditions, I enjoyed seeing A Knight's Tale (free screening, great theater, friends, some funny parts), even though it's a silly movie I would never rent.  These conditions couldn't save The Majestic.<br />With a great director and great performances, what made The Majestic horrible?  It has to be the story.  The Majestic was written by Michael Sloane, whose only other writing credit is co-writing Hollywood Boulevard II.  Ever heard of it?  I hadn't, but reviews say it's bad and monotonous, like The Majestic.<br />The Majestic is a 152-minute flim with a 90-minute story.  After Jim Carrey gets amnesia, nothing happens for a full hour.  I remember seeing the camera pan across the town and appreciating the cinematography for a split-second, but wishing I was tired enough to fall asleep until things picked up.  Eventually we flash back to the evil UAAC people who are looking for Mr. Carrey, and there is hope that something may happen soon, but we immediately go back to the small town with nothing going on for about another half hour.<br />Finally, we get to the courtroom scene, and I'm praying that the movie will redeem itself.  It was ridiculous.  Jim Carrey keeps talking and talking, continually interrupting the judge who is banging away with his gavel, telling him to be quiet, telling him he's out of order, threatening him, etc.  Is he removed?  No!  The banging just goes on and on to the point of utter absurdity.  I eventually expected Jim Carrey to return with, \\"I'm out of order?  This whole court is out of order!\\"<br />What makes The Majestic so truly horrible is that so much talent was wasted on a worthless script.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I went to this show at the Louisville Palace Theatre at the end of April.  We new that they were recording this show for both a CD and a DVD (due out in early 2003), and we were very excited about the prospect of a recording of a show that we went to.  When we arrived at the theater, there was a large camera obstructing our view from about 30 rows back.  Just when I was about to start cursing, the house manager introduced herself to us and moved us up to the front row, center in front of Alison.  True story!!!<BR>  Now, back to the show.  From top to bottom, this show was incredible.  From the lilting voice of Alison, to the rocking jams of Jerry Douglas and Dan Tyminski, every song had the entire audience rocking, tapping their feet, and wanting much more.  The highlights of this CD to me are the foot-tapping jams of \\"Choctaw Hayride\\", the angelic voice of Alison on \\"Bay, Now That I've Found You\\" and \\"Maybe\\", and the Soggy Bottom Boys doing a home-state rendition of \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow.\\"  <BR>  There is a not a weak link on this CD.  The two nights in Lousiville in April 2002 were an incredible experience that you too can experience on this CD and soon on DVD.
B000059HAI|5.0|Much has been made about the events surrounding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in recent months.  With last year's release Michael Bay's melodramatic travesty \\"Pearl Harbor\\", one is made to look at the events leading up to and occuring on that day, December 7th, 1941.  If you want to know the true story about Pearl Harbor, then \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" is the movie to see.  Whereas \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was just using the Japanese attack as a backdrop to tell 5th-class love story, \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" sticks to telling the story as it happened.  The scenes dealing with the United States are filmed by an American director, while the scenes dealing with Japan are filmed by a Japanese director.  Each side is given a fair treatment in this movie.  There is no portrayal one side being good and the other being evil. <BR><BR>   \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" is an event-driven movie, not a character-driven one.  Where some people have seen the lack of some central character, or traditional hero, on either side to be a detriment to the movie, it is really a benefit.  It is truly a movie of support roles, much like the militaries that battled that day operated.  No one single person rose to the forefront on either side.  The purported leaders on either side, Admiral Yamamoto in Japan and Admiral Kimmel in Pearl Harbor, are conflicted, somewhat flawed leaders whose actions and decisions are the product of those who outrank them.  <BR><BR>   This movie does not portray Yamamoto as some raving mad war dog who wants nothing more than destroy the U.S.  He is a conflicted man who wants to avoid war at all costs, but knows that when that route is unavoidable, that he must develop and plan the best attack possible upon U.S. forces.  Some then (and now) have seen his actions as cowardice, but \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" shows that they are the carefully thought out actions of a man who knew the consequences involved.  <BR><BR>   Similarly, history has been unkind to Admiral Kimmel for his handling of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  At the time, and in years since, he has shouldered the blame for unprepared state of the U.S. fleet for the Japanese attack.  Yet, he was the victim of the actions, or inactions, of his superiors much the same way Yamamoto was.  The U.S. knew Japan was rattling its collective saber, but did not believe that it would have the audacity to attack a U.S. target.  The Philipines or Wake Islands was seen as a much more likely target.  As shown throughout this movie, select members of the military began to piece together that Japan was planning an attack and that it was very likely to happen at Pearl Harbor.  However, the ignorant belief among most that this would not be possible led to the institutional failure that prevented the appropriate alerts and warnings to make their way to Kimmel in time to prepare for the attack.  It should be noted that a telegram that was supposed to alert Kimmel that the attack was imminent arrived in his hands several hours after the battle was over.  <BR><BR>   Movies like \\"Pearl Harbor\\" only give the events of that day a cursory treatment, as it seems to get in the way of the next sappy love scene.  Yet, even though \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"'s portrayal may seem dry and almost documentary-like, it is that style that allows for a greater understanding of what happened and why it happened.
B00006ADG8|4.0|Peter Ustinov's exciting movie of Melville's great story is lean, stripped for action & beautiful to look at.  If only it were mean as well.  Melville's triangular tale of evil has been reduced to 2 sides leaving all the nuances excised & the reverberations silenced.  Unlike Melville's tale, when this movie is over it's over.  At the heart of the problem is Peter Ustinov.  His radical surgery removed Melville's audacious suggestion that evil undisguised, like poison, is rendered harmless by its knowability.  But how does one protect one's self from 'pretty poison'?  Ustinov's Starry Vere is everybody's favourite uncle.  No sulphur fumes here.  Melvyn Douglas as Dansker gives such a sly, knowing performance that he seems ideal for the role of Vere.  He might have put back all the ambiguities & nuances Ustinov removed.  Terence Stamp making his screen debut makes a sensational Billy & he earned himself a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.  (Years later he would play a similiar role in Pasolini's THEOREMA.)  Robert Ryan's Claggart is magnificent.  His evil is worthy of Melville; it's almost Miltonian.  In the flogging scene, which had everyone talking when the movie first opened, when he realizes the last stripe was laid on he looks like Jesse Helms learning a cure for AIDS has been found.
B000002AGN|5.0|Brubeck &amp; Co. did the music world a real favor here.  The pianist and his quartet crafted what is arguably the easiest jazz lp to listen to.  TIME OUT is a masterpiece of polyrhythms, piano comping and vamping, and hum-along tunes.  Instead of beating you over the head with chord clusters or solo pyrotechnics, Brubeck leads his group down the energetic, happy side of the street.  They give us relatively simple arrangements (time signatures aside) that remain within the West Coast 'Cool' Jazz style, allowing us to sing along or tap our feet.  The album is most famous for the title tune which works in 5/4 time I believe.  But the fact is, EVERY other song here is just as good, and some I like much better.  &quot;Blue Rondo A La Turk&quot; is a homage to Brubecks time in Turkey where he observed and absorbed some of the odd meter work of traditional Turkish music.  Here he uses this 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-3 arrangement to great effect.  &quot;Everybody's Jumpin'&quot; and &quot;Pick Up Sticks&quot; are two more of my favorites.  There is not a bad note or dull moment on this entire 1959 recording.  It has a momentum all its own.  It is meticulously beautiful and should be one of the first five CD's bought by any new jazz fan.<br />Essential.
0930289331|5.0|This is my favorite Frank Miller book. I've read some of his work on Daredevil (basically what's included in Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller 1, 2, and 3) along with some of his other Batman stories (Dark Knight Returns, Dark Knight Strikes Back), and Batman: Year One outshines the rest. It's simple, it's gritty and I love it for that. <br />Year One follows the first year of Commissioner Gordon (then Lieutenant Gordon) and Batman in Gotham City. Reading about Batman barely holding his own against some two-bit thugs is such a welcome change after reading so many other books where Batman is a figure more invincible than Superman. And reading about Gordon's struggle against a corrupt police department is equally compelling. The book's only [low priced], and it's easily worth it.
B000059Z8J|5.0|For those of you who saw SUPERMAN in the theater, or have seen it since and loved it, this DVD is a must for you.  The only thing we lose here is the big-screen.  But we get so much more; screen-takes, documentaries, etc.  This DVD was produced very nicely, the picture and sound quality are quite good, the dialogue is crisp and the menus were easy to navigate.  Throw in John Williams' awesome score and what is there to complain about!?  The film retains just enough humor (witness interaction between Hackman and Beatty) to remind us that it is after all based on a COMIC BOOK (emphasis added for you detractors...)  How can you not enjoy Lex yelling \\"MS. TESSMACHER!!!!\\" or Williams amusing musical cues for Beatty's character?  Chris Reeves now embodies the persevering spirit of a character he played decades ago.  More power to you Chris.  Enjoyable, life-affirming, and classic.<br />Essential.
B00005T30L|3.0|I kind of liked &quot;Ghost World&quot; but It seems everybody liked it more than me. Thora's character was not that likeable and cursed like a drunken sailor.(Heavy duty F words) Her friend was just as miserable and disappeared down the stretch. There was nothing amusing about Buscemi's character either as he was just as depressing as everybody else. He was a slob too, stuffing his face with fried chicken. The art fiasco I didn't understand because nobody ever mistook me for a mis-guided genius because I didn't much care, like Thora. The movie asks many questions that never get answered, like the meaning of the eventual romance and the sudden blow off. Why. Did he smell? Please rent this movie first and decide for yourself. We all see the world differently.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|Given the paucity of dvds for Wagner's Ring cycle, this release of the complete Metropolitan Opera production should theoretically be welcomed, especially for lovers of traditional staging. Indeed, the staging is a naturalistic one which no only is rather loyal to Wagner's original intentions but can also highlight the universality of this epic drama.<br />Unfortunately, while I like the setting for the operas, the direction itself is quite unimaginative. At times, the singers are left all on their own such that they have to resort to repeating some stock operatic gestures. Some may consider the result to be dramatically pallid and even boring at times. Traditional productions certainly aren't mean't to be static or stylised!<br />Actually, the most disappointing facet of the production is in the performance. While no one should expect that any present-day casting of the Ring cycle can reach the lofty standards of yester-years, the singing is often merely adequate. This is not helped by the wooden acting of some of the performers. James Morris's Wotan is in splendid voice, but his acting is sketchy. Christa Ludwig is past her prime as Fricka, but her performance still possess great authority. Gary Lakes is a rough Siegmund while Jessye Norman is a vocally gorgeous but stage-wise unconvincing Sieglinde. Siegfried Jerusalem is probably as good as one can get for Siegfried these days, his singing full of sensitivity and poise even though he is not a heldentenor in the traditional mould. Hildgard Behrens, sorely taxed by the music of Brunnhilde, is a big disappointment, for her voice sounds threatbare at times, especially in the middle and lower registers and she is unable to ride the big vocal climaxes with ease.<br />The Orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera produces great sounds in the pit and every section deserves the greatest of praise. Levine, of course, is their admirable conductor, although I sometimes find the forward momentum sagging a little from time to time, especially in Siegfried and Gotterdammerung.<br />As I tend to focus more on the singers than the orchestra in opera, I must say that I'm quite disappointed by what I hear on this dvd set. Although I still think that the set is worth getting (every release of a complete Ring cycle is an event), I can't help feeling that the production has been let down by the singers as well as some stolid stage direction., especially in Siegfried and Gotterdammerung. <br />As I tend to focus more on the singers than the orchestra in opera, I must say that I'm quite disappointed by what I hear on this dvd set.

B000002UB3|5.0|What do you say about one of the greatest albums of the rock era?  Do you say that at the end of their career as a group that these four individuals, talented individually and phenomenally gifted as a group, came together to create something magical?  Sure, why not.  But even that would be an understatement.  When describing a performance this good, you get to the point where words along fail.  Artistry with words fails to describe the artistry with music, which is as it should be.<br />\\"Abbey Road\\" was an interesting combination of music.  Much of the album is a collection of songs that was and is the envy of lesser talents, and remains a standard of excellence for others against which to compare themselves.  Part of the album was a grouping of songs that transitioned from one to the next seamlessly and wonderfully, beginning with \\"You Never Gave Me Your Money\\" and ending with \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\".  The Moody Blues had performed similar transitions in \\"Days of Future Passed\\", and overlapping of songs was a tradition for them on all their albums, but to do rock transitions from one song to the next was novel.<br />What songs!  Songs from hard rock (well, it was hard then) such as \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You\\", mellow ballads such as \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", a bizarre synthesized \\"Because\\", and quirky novelty songs like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\".  It was as though the group knew this was the end and was putting out pieces of this and that with exquisite finesse and skill.  The breadth of music on this one album is incredible, and shows why The Beatles remain (in my humble opinion) the greatest rock group of all time to this day.  They gave so much in creating rock music as we know it, and this album was their last brilliant hurrah.<br />There's nothing more to say.  This album is a must-have for any Beatles fan, for any aficionado of 60s music, and for anyone that appreciates the talent required to create the range of songs on this CD.  Throw yourself back more than 30 years and imagine what it was like to have lived in the time when the lads were still young, and music like this was genius.  Enjoy!e range of songs on this CD.  Throw yourself back more than 30 years and imagine what it was like to have lived in the time when the lads were still young, and music like this was genius.  Enjoy!

B00003CWL6|5.0|'American Beauty' is an artistic film that uses a great deal of cinematic skill to underscore the ironies in one man's life, with the ultimate irony being that regardless of temptation, each person will be true to their ideals when faced with ultimate threats to those ideals.<br />Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, who is fired very early in the film. Annette Bening plays his wife Carolyn. Very quickly, the stereotypes begin. One sub-theme throughout the movie is Kevin's desire for a pretty high school cheerleader. However, the real sub-theme is wanting what you can't really ever have. This same theme is repeated for each of the major characters, from Carolyn to their next-door neighbor Colonel Frank Fitts to Ricky Fitts, Frank's son, played by Wes Bentley, to Jane Burnham, Lester and Carolyn's daughter, played by Thora Birch. Each wants something they do not have. To varying degrees, each gets what they think they want, but, and this is the real moral of the movie and the story, what you think you want isn't truly what you wanted, because when you get what you want, it doesn't give you the happiness you thought you were going to get.<br />Kevin spends much of the movie working out, buying his dream muscle car, and lusting after Angela Hayes, played by Mena Suvari. It certainly seems as though his purchases are providing him happiness. However, he is looking for the relationship he once had with his wife. In a pivotal scene in the movie, Lester and Carolyn are in the immaculate living room of their house. Lester has a beer, and begins to get somewhat amorous. Just as it looks as though something might spark, Kevin spills his beer, which causes Carolyn to be more concerned about the expensive couch than their relationship. Is this shallowness a cliche? Yes it is. However, there is more to the story than just cliches.<br />As the story unfolds and each character seems to be making progress toward getting what they want, in many cases the scenes are set up as fantasies, which are beautifully and artfully done. I find one of the most intriguing characters to be Ricky Fitts. Ricky wants his father's unconditional love, and loves his father, but somehow you sense that he knows he'll never get it. Further, I felt that Ricky knew that eventually something bad would happen between his father and him. The sense of impending disaster that Ricky anticipates through his actions and his attitude infects the rest of the movie with the same feeling. Almost as though you were in quicksand and knew a bad end was coming, but it comes so slowly that you don't realize it until it is too late.<br />The real beauty in the movie is at the end. While I will not reveal all the details, I will reveal important details, so if you do not want to know, I'll tell you quickly that this movie is very artsy and well-acted. If those types of movies appeal to you, you will love this one.<br />Near the end of the movie, Lester finally has an opportunity to be with Angela. It is the very last thing Lester has wanted throughout the entire movie, that he has, up to now, been unable to get, and here he has his chance. However, there is a small problem. After Angela's top has been removed, she asks Lester to be gentle because it's her first time.<br />What? Hasn't Angela been telling Jane Burnham throughout the movie about her sexual exploits? Yes. Here's part of the sub-theme once again. Angela in fact has wanted to have the experiences to match her bragging. Now that she has the real opportunity to have it happen, she is fearful. Lester realizes that he cannot take away Angela's innocence, and tells her to get dressed. Both realize continuing would be a mistake for both. An incredible, but very correct decision for each. The movie brilliantly puts a most incredible temptation to two people, and they both realize that getting what they thought they wanted would make neither happy.<br />I'm not going to reveal what happens next. I admit I was surprised that Lester would resist temptation, but proud of him too. He was tested, if by no one else then by himself, and he passed. He proved that he was stronger than nearly all the other characters in the movie. Of course, this scene sets up the final irony.<br />A brief word on symbolism. The rose is used as a part of Lester's fantasies throughout the entire movie. Remember that the rose is a symbol of many things, love and purity being only one of them.<br />The visual beauty of this movie is used to drive home the theme. The movie is not only ironic in the way the characters and the scenes are played out; the movie is visually ironic as well. To explain that irony would require giving the ending away more than I have. One other thing: This movie does not condone 40+ men having sex with under 18 girls any more than 'Pretty Woman' romanticizes and fosters prostitution. If you believe that this movie is all about one man's fantasy with a young girl, you missed the point. Try once more and hang in there, the meaning is deeper, and subtler. However, you have to watch to the very last scene and think about the symbolism of everything you saw. This movie is truly beautiful, very well done, and an instant, very artistic classic. I would rate this movie more than 5 stars if I could.ld resist temptation, but proud of him too. He was tested, if by no one else then by himself, and he passed.

0375414053|5.0|Here is a book that captures with humor the countervailing forces that pull mothers today apart -- to keep their hard won career and continue to accomplish professional goals and earn money, and to be a good mother to their children.  But as this book so deftly shows, society cuts mothers no slack, work expects slavish obedience, and there aren't enough hours to do it all.  The compromises required leave us guilty and sad.  <BR>Kate Reddy has the added disadvantage of being English, and working in the London's financial center, a place that is years behind the U.S. in maternity policy and sexual harassment law and even more riddled with sexist, boorish men than our own Wall Street.  (Believe it or not!  From my experience she does not exaggerate.)  Kate works hard, travels incessantly, misses her children, loses touch with her hapless but kind husband, not to mention her friends, and observes her own frantic life with a wry wit.  Her observations on the primary role women play in the home, even when they are the chief breadwinner outside, are on the money.  Men who leave work early to attend their daughter's class play are showing a wonderful fatherly interest.  But if a mother does the same she is shirking and overburdened with her home life.<BR>But Kate is always sympathetic -- all mothers will understand when she gets exasperated with her husband when he refuses stock the house with paper towels as requested because he can't bring himself to ask for the brand: Kitten Soft.  Or when she reflects with regret on how she left her first child to return to work too soon, before she and the baby had a chance to settle in together.  Or when she gets upset with herself because when she tries to cook she is a stranger in her own kitchen, and when asked her daughter's eating preferences, finds she doesn't know.  No successful working father would have to deal with these issues or the guilt and regret they cause.  Kate's love for her children is palpable, which is what makesthe book work.  <BR>Read this book, whether you work or not.  You'll find things you'd been thinking reflected here, but in a funny and entertaining style.
B00006GFAB|2.0|I've been faithful with KISS for years now, and I've fought for their respect on the Elder album, and I'm watching history repeat itself with the constant change of who plays on stage. But one thing KISS needs to do is stop putting out these &quot;Best Of&quot; albums. This album should have been Alive IV... I agree with other reviews saying their song choices are the same ones that appear on the other compiliation albums. What the fans want is new material or the Famed Alive IV. I for one did not buy the album because I own all these songs already. What this album needed for me to buy it is actual bonus content. The &quot;That 70's Show&quot; Rock and Roll all nite, is just the Alive! version of it. Which is old and no longer &quot;Special&quot; or &quot;Bonus&quot;... This album is for those who have not followed KISS strongly enough to buy their albums, though like a few songs off this disc. But who cares about them, if you are in this Army, you should be a little bit more then upset with our &quot;Superior Generals&quot;...
6304675348|5.0|So, \\"Scream\\" is a \\"postmodern slasher movie\\" which \\"cleverly deconstructs horror films.\\"  These are certainly weighty accomplishments because tossing around concepts like \\"postmodern\\" and \\"deconstruction\\" will usually confuse the heck out of people on this side of the Atlantic.  Actually, I do not find \\"Scream\\" to be terribly postmodern, at least not in the sense of being self-reflexive, which is the usual shorthand meaning of the term in media studies (the sequels are considerably most \\"postmodern\\" than the original).  However, the film certainly does reference the teenager horror/slasher film genre, which makes the idea of deconstruction more palatable.  Then again, maybe we can use Occam's Razor to offer a simpler explanation.<br />\\"Scream\\" works for three basic reasons.  First, it is clear that each of the victims in this film is being slashed to death by an ordinary human being (please appreciate how delicately I phrased this part of the sentence) and not a person possessed by the spirit of Samhein, reincarnated as a killer corpse, or running around in our dreams.  Instead of the killer being a monstrous \\"other\\" this time around the killer is essentially...someone...like...us.  Scary notion, that.<br />Second, the script by Kevin Williamson is, if not literate, at least hip.  By this I mean to reference the dialogue and not just the idea that the threatened teens in this film make use of everything they have learned from watching \\"reel\\" horror films.  Of course, Williamson has proved this ability to an even greater degree on \\"Dawson's Creek.\\"  In \\"Scream\\" we wince at what is being said because we are supposed to, not because it is an involuntary response.  However, I would say the comparison between Williamson is not with Quentin Tarentino (\\"Pulp Fiction\\"), but rather with Joss Whedon (\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\").  Along similar lines I would add this is a horror film where the suspense is not maintained by the soundtrack, which may well be the most under appreciated warning sign of a bad horror film.<br />Third, the cast for this film is well above average.  I mean, this is a film that throws away Drew Barrymore in the opening sequence; go back and look at the splatter flicks of the last twenty years and find a better damsel in distress what Drew does in her absolutely riveting moments on screen.  This is a film that offers Neve Campbell and Rose McGowan in terms of young actresses instead of Adrienne King or Heather Langenkamp.  You have to go back to \\"Halloween\\" with Jamie Lee Curtis and P.J. Soles to find scream queens this bankable.  This is also the quality that has extended itself for both of the sequels in this series as well as all those \\"I Tied a String Around My Severed Finger to Remind Me What You Did Several Summers Ago.\\"  Horror films that off up Sarah Michelle Gellar in supporting roles are a good sign for the genre.  Good actors with decent dialogue; what a revolutionary concept.<br />Consequently, I view the preoccupation of fans and critics over the rules of slasher flicks articulated by Jamie Kennedy's character to be something of a smoke screen for what is really going on here, which, in the final analysis, is just basic good old fashion solid movie making.  I think the credit ultimately goes to director Wes Craven, who used his credibility off of \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" to put these pieces together.reciated warning sign of a bad horror film.<br />Third, the cast for this film is well above average.

B000003CMD|5.0|This is the one!<br />What a great emotional, rewarding, musically brilliant album.<br />Everyone who I play it to somehow feels something special is happening.<br />Not a bad track on it.<br />'Jessica' would have to be the highlight track.<br />It's a shame there isn't any out-takes from these sessions at this time considering the amount of Re-Mastered CDs that are coming out with extra tracks.

B000002534|3.0|I loved the first 3 Santana albums plus a few other things he has done, but this one needs time to grow on you. After some time I am changing my review on this CD and give it a better review.<br />It's a jazzy album that has some great moments.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Upon first listen, this album will seem lame, boring, and awful except for the three classics, My Name Is, Stan, and The Real Slim Shady. These songs define rap, especially Grammy-nominated Stan about a sickly obsessed fan of Eminem. Upon a second or third chance, this album will become a part of you, with nearly every song being near perfect. Some flaws include Remember Me and even Criminal, but the rest is pure fun all the way! This album has everything, zany humor, shocking lyrics, and great vocals and beats that every Eminem fan is sure to enjoy. It is also better than Eminem's other albums, especially Slim Shady Lp, and those are terrific as well! Buy this album, it is terrific!
B000056NX4|1.0|Hated it... just hated it!
B00006LWSF|4.0|Eminem, first of all, is a great artist. He has the best beats, lyrics, best everything! Eminem doesn't disappoint with his songs on the album, but the other songs, kinda stink. My favorite rapper is Eminem, but I like other rappers too. I am disappointed that Dr. Dre is not on the album, along with hardly any other big names in rap, except for Xzibit and maybe Jay-Z. Favorite tracks for me are 8 Mile, Love You, and, of course, Lose Yourself. These tracks really bring out the film, and take us all back to Eminem's earlier albums like The Marshall Mathers Lp. A big change from his latest album, The Eminem Show. These songs definitely do not disappoint! They are superb. The other songs are worth a listen, but don't satisfy completely. Eminem's tracks will leave you hungry for more of them, and the other songs lead you away feeling, \\"That was good, but not great.\\" Above all, get this album if you like Eminem. Otherwise, maybe download it, or borrow from a friend.
B0000024JN|5.0|Almost every song off of the Beastie Boys' first and most popular album, Licensed to Ill, is recognizable (&quot;Fight For Your Right&quot; and &quot;Brass Monkey&quot;). Even though the production is a little outdated, it is still a worthy listen to get a reminder of how traditional b-boy old school hip-hop was back in the day.
B000021YQV|3.0|I hated metal, and I still do. It hurts my brain, the obnoxious screaming, annoying beats, and guitars so loud, it rocks the house if loud enough. But this defies metal, and makes other metal look like ... . The classic, Chop Suey!, is just great, simply put. I am a rap and rock fan, and always will be, but this song is excellent! The rest of the album is good, but to me, it sounds like these guys are testing out their equipment on a Saturday morning with nothing else to do. Every other song is pure metal. The hippie-style drug references, the religious aspects, and the dead cow sound is all classic metal. You may like this album, you may not. It all depends on your point of view.
B00000294R|4.0|Big L had loads of potential. He had a great delivery, sick metaphors, and a signature voice. Pretty much everything an MC needs to be successful or at least respected. Unfortunately Lamont Coleman aka Big L was gunned down in his hometown before he really got a chance to show his talent. This was his best effort before he was killed, and although it's not spectacular, it will have to do. One thing can be said, and that is that Big L was definetly nice on the mic. He is what holds this album together and earns all 4 stars from my rating, not the production. As a matter of fact, the production is what holds this album back. On only one track, &quot;MVP&quot; would I consider the production good however the rest are put together well enough and with Big L rhyming over them, they deserve a 4 star rating.

B000069HK2|4.0|I first heard of the used from a guitar magazine and decided to check out their new catagory of music, now being dubbed, SCREAMO.  I bought their cd and after listening to it i was dissapointed, but like several cds, the more i listen the more i liked it 'til I was hooked on the used, they dont have alot of tuned down guitars (which can be good) but they do have some of the catchiest riffs and amazing screaming vocals.  If you are a metal fan or a punk fan check out the used and some of the other up and coming screamo bands like Glassjaw and Thursday.
B00006IU73|5.0|There were three discs which I simply thought could not be equaled or paralleled -- \\"Lightbulb Sun,\\" \\"Stupid Dream,\\" and \\"Signify.\\"  Those three discs of Porcupine Tree are the quintessential brilliance of this band and Steve Wilson . . . . and then along comes \\"In Abstentia.\\"<br />As difficult as it was for me to believe that anything could ever be as great as those three discs, \\"In Abstentia\\" is just as fabulous!  <br />To start off with \\"Blackest Eyes,\\" I thought to myself, \\"Ah, it has the same grab you by the throat attention-getting as does 'EvenLess' from 'Stupid Dream.'\\"  And then \\"Trains,\\" of course, is beautiful and poetic.   \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" has that heavy, brooding overtone which characterizes so many of PT's greatest heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching songs.  \\"Wedding Nails,\\" \\"Prodigal,\\" and \\"Dot Three,\\" they are all great, wonderful, powerful songs.  \\"Strip\\" has that same brooding intensity as \\"Gravity Eyelids.\\"  <br />One of the many things PT does so brilliantly is ending their cd's with those beautiful, softer pieces which cool you down after the intensity of their disc's earlier songs.  \\"Dark Matter\\" ending \\"Signify;\\" \\"Fadeaway\\" at the end of \\"Up the Downstairs;\\" and \\"Stop Swimming\\" at the end of \\"Stupid Dream\\" -- they are all perfect bookends to complete and close POWERFUL cd's.  Well, PT does it again by ending \\"In Abstentia\\" with the haunting and yet beautiful \\"Collapse The Light Into Earth.\\"  Wonderful, perfect placement.<br />Now, there are a number of songs which I did not mention, but trust me, what I failed to mention in this review, they are all still wonderful!<br />Porcupine Tree is absolutely a force to be reckoned with, and we will (hopefully and thankfully) hear much and much more of them in the future.<br />GET THIS DISC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003W8NM|4.0|But the twist in this is way different than the book's. Edward Norton plays the role of an unnamed character who makes his living inside a cubicle taking memos and his home-life revolves around the Ikea catalog and trying to improve his life materialistically. He learns through the movie that his life's priorities were controlling himself and that society's lies causes him and others to feel bad about their lifes. A tad nihilistic and some holes are in the plot narration, the same fault in the book, but by its end you understand the main character's new view on life. This probably ties with Se7en for Brad Pitt's best performance and is a great step for Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, to gain light on his interesting style of narration. I recommend reading the novel before watching the movie though, as the novel's plot is quite different and some minor characters are altered, so if you watched the movie first you will be confused by the masterpiece novel--which you will want to read after watching the movie. Check out Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club and Survivor, now!
0783211856|5.0|A gripping and gut-wrenching no-holds bar account of probably the darkest chapter in human history, it is no exaggeration that watching \\"Schindler's List\\" in one sitting is near impossible. Keeping in mind the subject matter is neither fiction nor entertainment, its reality - the unspeakable depth of human devastation inflicted by man himself as perpetrated by Hitler's Third Reich, i.e., the Holocaust - will force the viewer to get up for air. From its \\"entertainment\\" perspective, the film earned Steven Spielberg a richly deserved and belated Best Director Oscar, and Oscar-nominated Liam Neeson, as German industrial Oskar Schindler trying to spare his Jewish factory workers from Hitler's death camps, is at his best in his craft. Beyond that, this film is so gripping that its glutches refuse to let us turn from its brutal reality but compels us to keep watching to remember so as to never let this human carnage occur again. In the end, we do get some redemption, some hope, because human kindness was not completely obliterated. More specifically, though, this film is a horrifying monument to the evil that man can do. But it is also a magnificent tribute to the memories of the 12 million victims who didn't make Schindler's list. This film ought to be mandtory viewing.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book. Me and my friends have passed this around work and everyone there loves it. I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves novels. Also I would like to recommend another book that has inspired me recently--Dreams: Gateway to the True Self is what it is called.
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't know if Avril is claiming to be a real skater punk or not, but I do know that she has one of the best CD's out there right now.  Whether she is punk or pop, she has a whole CD full of songs that are good and fun to listen to.  <br />I wouldn't say that this CD has changed my life or anything, but I have had this in my car for a few weeks now and listen to it everyday to and from work.  She has a great voice, is having fun and her music is way better than any of the cookie-cutter stuff being put out by Britney or Christina (both of whom seem to be trying WAY too hard).

1587990717|5.0|This may be the best book I've ever read on the importance of intellectual competence, rigor and honesty in devising trading and investment strategies. The author makes clear that as opposed to other disciplines such as medicine and science, the effects of low-probability scenarios (so-called &quot;random events&quot;, not random at all) must be incorporated into investment programs. By the end of the book, it is impossible not to share his respect for probability.      <br />The author's points regarding the risks of ignoring randomness are, by the end of the book, irrefutable; his presentation, in which his deeply intellectual mind shows through, is fascinating and entertaining. <br />This is an 'investment book' only in that investment scenarios can sometimes offer clear examples of the dangers of misunderstanding probability and randomness. Unlike many 'investment books', this author doesn't insult readers by offering trading strategies that are sure to be arbitraged away by the time they are read. Instead, he offers his unique perspective, in order for us to improve our discipline and processes in developing trades. <br />I encourage you to buy this book, read it, then take a long walk and think about it. Whether or not you extend the author's points to your portfolio and trading, I think that he has illuminated a pathway to improved critical reasoning ability.
B00005NTN5|5.0|Okay, I loved the movie. It was so many things at once. Funny, suspensful, sexy, clever, etc. But so many other reviews go into detail about all that. I'd rather talk about the audio commentary by the directors and stars of Bound.<br />I've recently fallen in love with dvd technology because of all those wonderful special features, and I find myself, while reading amazon reviews, wishing people would talk more about the special features included on dvds. So without much further ado...<br />The Bound DVD... has no deleted scenes (which is a pity) but it does have either one or two trailers (I forget presently) and the reason to purchase this dvd is for the audio commentary by the directors and stars of the movie. They explain much of the cut footage and they give the story behind the story in many scenes.<br />The audio commentary turns especially entertaining when Jennifer Tilly shows up and rambles on in her Jennifer Tilly way about the movie. Then Gina Gershon shows up, and the banter among the men and women is so delightfully entertaining. They tease Joey P about wanting to drop the towel so he'd be naked in the movie. Jennifer T. talks about how her open mouth won her a oscar nomination in Bullets Over Broadway. They talk about injuries on the set, and all in all, I just love these actors and directors. Especially Jennifer T. I never really liked her before listening to the audio commentary to this movie, but I swear I just wanna crawl in bed with her myself, and I'm not even gay. She's just too funny. You can tell, they really had fun making this movie.<br />The movie, of course, is wonderful. But the DVD is even better.
6305428352|5.0|This film always tugs at my heartstrings; I think it best shows the love and dedication our public school teachers have for our children. Tying together the emotion produced from music, and interpersonal relationships. Richard Dreyfuss has an amazing character, which reminds me of one of my history teachers in high school. I feel for the dilemma educators have when deciding what they should expose kids to with limited budgets, this film demonstrates that not all which is important to life can be found in the three R's (though the inaccuracy of that phrase still gets be today, but then I suppose that RWA doesn't have the same ring to it.) At any rate, those who love music and life will love this film.
B00003CXTF|1.0|The only resemblance this film has with the 1940s, is the old and dated storyline. This movie is a maudlin tale wrapped in what is supposed to pass as history. Throw in an excess of special effects, shake well, and you have this disaster.<br />The love triangle between Rafe, Evelyn, and Danny is mind numbingly vacuous, and none of the characters manages to generate interest. The writers must have been targeting teenage females, since I don't know of anybody who would take this sappy mishmash of boy one meets girl - boy one is reported KIA - girl hooks up with boy two - boy one returns alive - girl gets pregnant with boy two's child - boy two is KIA - etc., seriously. Who wrote this stuff anyhow?<br />Dorie Miller's story is clumsily grafted on like a second head, and it seems as if Cuba Gooding Jr. really has nothing to do. Jon Voight is better than I expected as FDR, but the politically correct ending rang as hollow.<br />This movie disserved Pearl Harbor and WW2 vets by sanitizing Imperial Japan's motives for attacking Pearl Harbor, and presenting Jimmy Doolittle as a foul-mouthed Cro-Magnon. Some of the battleship sets were impressive, but the excessive computer special effects made the combat scenes seem like nothing more than an arcade game (planes flying between ships on Battleship Row? Come on).<br />If you want a decent film about Pearl Harbor, watch Tora, Tora, Tora. If you want to watch junk, then this film is for you.
0871294273|5.0|In a time around 2941, in an area called The Shire in Middle Earth, there lived a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.  Like most hobbits, he was a very respectful yet tiny creature, but he despised adventures. <br />      One day, a wise and powerful wizard named Gandalf shows up at Bilbo's home, requesting that he go on an adventure with dwarves to recover their ancestors' treasure which is guarded by a dragon.  After initially refusing, Bilbo agrees, deciding to show that he is stronger than everyone sees him. <br />      They finally begin their long journey in which he, the dwarves, and Gandalf are to travel from The Shire to the Lonely Mountains where Smaug, the dragon, lives.  Bilbo and the dwarves travel to many different areas on the way, some of which are threatening to their lives.  At one point, Bilbo is accidentally left behind inside of a mountain and he discovers a magical ring that has the power to make the wearer invisible.  He uses this ring to escape from imprisonment by many different enemies.  <BR>      <BR>      Upon escaping one of the most disastrous predicaments in their adventure, he and the dwarves find their way to the town Esgaroth, which sits at the foot of the Lonely Mountains.  The final and most intense part of their long journey lies ahead of them in the dangerous mountains of Smaug (the dragon).<br />      Based on the intensity and suspense I discovered in The Hobbit, I believe this book would appeal to anyone who enjoys adventures.  J.R.R. Tolkien proved his potential in this book with its imaginative design and well-written plot.  The characters come to life as you are taken into a story that will not leave your memory for a lifetime.
630280082X|4.0|As a cinematic work, Crossroads is nothing special. Except for Joe Seneca who was great as the aging blues-legend on the run from the devil, the acting is awful. Ralph Macchio is decent, except that he's doing the EXACT same character he did in Karate Kid. The love interest between Eugene and Frances is silly, shallow and simply doesn't work. The screenplay, above all, is terrible. The directing and photography are good, which makes the film at least bearable.<br />But the film is just an excuse for one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard. Classical guitar, Robert Johnson classic blues, Muddy Waters electric blues and hard blues rock run throughout this film wonderfuly; for bluesmen and guitar lovers, Crossroads is a must. The ending with Steve Vai, above all, is one of the greatest scenes I've seen and makes the whole movie worthwile - and both Vai and 'Eugene' play a KILLER guitar (I think Stevie Ray Vaughan plays Eugene's part). Overall, a very mediocre movie and for many probably boring, but a cult classic and a musical masterpiece.
B00003CX95|4.0|This much over-rated film, while strong on filming techniques, is weak on history. Mel Gibson's direction ensures that not only will William Wallace be handled like a fantasy, but the film will also suffer from a total anti-English bias which distorts the movie. England's Edward I was one of the most impressive monarchs of the Middle-Ages. But of course you would never know that after Mel gets through turning him into a Nazi of the 13th century! While he was certainly no saint, Edward I labored to make England one of the great kingdoms of its day. He deserves better treatment than he receives here. I don't know what Mel's problem is, but he seems to hate the English to the point of absurdity.<br />The battle scenes, while impressive visually are flawed and inaccurate. Stirling was more like an ambush with the English being caught on a bridge. Falkirk did not have any Irish changing sides or boiling oil on the battlefield. The actual battle was just a slaughter as the English archers mowed down the Scottish Schiltrons. And of course with superman Wallace it looks like he can just cleave up the English army single-handed with his cohort of super-Scots!  Nonesense! The made-up romance between Wallace and the Princess of Wales is total fantasy. There is so much historically wrong with this movie that it almost detracts from its fine production value. I think if someone more balanced than Mel Gibson had directed it we could have gott'en a more historically accurate, and still entertaining work.<br />The tragic thing about pretencious movies like this is that viewers emerge from the theater thinking they have seen real history. Unless they balance what they see on the screen with actual readings then they will forever be ignorant on the subject. Directors like Gibson do a dis-service to viewers by distorting history so. The real history is every bit as compelling, and does not require the anti-English propaganda of Mel Gibson to be made real. We should not be surprised with this because Mel does it again with \\"The Patriot\\" which is even worse historical farce.<br />As for his portrayal of Wallace, we know little of him. He was not a 13th Century nationalist, but likely more of a brigend who was made into a legend by poets like Robert Burns and Walter Scott. William Wallace is like El Cid, a national hero that was created in later times to celebrate a dark moment in a nation's history. The real person was doubtless not as appealing as we see on film here. Enjoy Braveheart for what it is, an entertaining Fantasy with a lot of impressive scenes, action and some moderate acting. If you think its real history, then you have a lot of problems.<br />The DVD version has some interesting production scenes and contains Mel Gibson's prattle about how the movie was made and its attention to historical detail! Take that with a grain of salt!with this because Mel does it again with \\"The Patriot\\" which is even worse historical farce.<br />As for his portrayal of Wallace, we know little of him.

B00006IUNN|1.0|This movie was terrible. It was about a Marine without a personality (Nicolas Cage's character) and had very little to do with the Navajo code talkers. The Navajo characters had to state what they did in monologues because the movie did such a poor job showing it. The director John Woo has little understanding of how Americans act. When was the last time you walked into a bar and saw everyone, and I mean everyone singing the same song while raising beer mugs in the air?<br />I heard Dan King, who is an expert on WWII Japanese equipment was hired as an adviser and it showed. The Japanese uniforms and weapons were among the best I've ever seen in a movie. But it looks like Woo decided to plan the battles and fight scenes himself. They're totally unrealistic. All explosions were gasoline enhanced and no Marine ever wasted a shot, since every bullet fired hit its mark. Cage kills so many Japanese he should be awarded the Medal of Honor. Soldiers casually walk upright in open fields in broad daylight while being pounded by machine guns and explosives. They looked like they were walking to a cafeteria, not through a raging battlefield. The characters remain cheery and fresh thoughout the horrific campaign as I became dishearted and diappointed as I watched them. <br />John Woo should stick to the hoaky action flicks he's used to. Leave the war stories to those who are good at it. The current crop of war movies have raised the level of realism and Woo is not up to the challenge. This movie stinks. I should have rented it before I wasted my money buying it.

B000002L9J|3.0|...P>I would recommend this to Smiths fans ONLY.  If you are just getting acquainted with this band, I'd recommend you start with ANY of their other albums or compilation records.<br />The Smiths were a unique band that achieved quality via a bizarre mix - Marr's monotonous compositional artistry and outstanding guitar style, and Morrisey's incredibly self-pitying lyrics.  If you don't think that monotonous melodies coupled with whiny lyrics doesn't sound like a winning combination, I understand, but it was.  The band really came up with some great music.  However, as you might imagine, this approach created a fine line between quirkily good and just flat-out stupid.  All of their albums contained a few of the latter.  This album contains a record number of clunkers, and that is the reason I can only recommend it to Smiths fans.<br />Examples?  Songs two, three, and four on side one.  In fact, these are just plain horrible.  If I were trying to convince someone that the Smiths were as good as they were, I'd be embarrassed if that person stumbled across these songs.  \\"Vicar in a Tutu\\" is pretty dumb but all in good fun.  The rest of the songs on this album range from decent to good.  However, there are no standouts like \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\" or \\"Miserable Lie\\" on this record.<br />As bad as newspaper reviews usually are, I read a good one for this album when it came out.  It said that the record sounded like an outtake compilation of other Smiths sessions.  And so it is.  I would recommend the first album (although it takes a while to develop a taste for that one), \\"Louder than Bombs,\\" or the last album over this.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Cash starts with a bang in \\"The Man Comes Around\\".  You believe he's mean as heck when he's \\"Sam Hall\\" and get on your horse ready to ride when he sings \\"I Hung my Head\\".  He paints a picture of death that is realistic, dark and sinister. Like the other Cash series, he delivers in this one.  When he sings songs like \\"Hurt\\", \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" and \\"I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry\\", it's not like hearing the words to the song.  It's like seeing into the soul of a man who has been around.  He ends with a beautiful up tempo version of \\"Tear Stained Letter\\".  In all Cash still has it.  Another great CD for Cash and Rick Rubin.
B000069HK2|5.0|all i can say about the used is WOW their riffs r unbelieveable the lead singer berts vocals n screams fit in perfectly and they are all around a killer band. i would recomend this cd to anyone who has so anger they just want to let out, bert prooves that he has some anger he wants to let out in nearly every song....if u dont get this cd you will have no idea on the world of creativity that you are missing out on.

0321127420|5.0|This book brings together the collected wisdom of the J2EE and .NET communities in a single volume that shows how you design and build &quot;real-world&quot; enterprise systems.  The patterns themselves are classics -- for instance it's great to finally see all of the basic patterns of object-relational mapping in print -- but what really ties this book together is the connecting text that links the patterns together into a cohesive whole.  Martin has successfully shown how to use patterns to link together all of the parts of an enterprise system -- drawing from the work of John Crupi et. al. in &quot;Core J2EE Patterns&quot; but going far beyond the scope of that book. I think this book will have the biggest impact on the OO community since &quot;Design Patterns&quot; and just may make patterns &quot;cool&quot; again!
0780624890|5.0|i really loved blade 1. it pulled off what most other movies based on comic books couldnt. it was rated R and had a very serious note. i know that its not actually THAT serious, seeings that its about a vampire slayer. but it just has something about it. its very dark and VERY stylish. the villains are super-evil. i have to give props to stephen dorff. he was the best part of this movie. this movie didnt have much comedy. and i liked it like that. i think its better left dark and scary.<BR>    now blade 2 on the other hand......what in the hell were they thinking? its like they took blade and sent him on a vacation in the bahama's and he came back as a completely different person. he is totally different. he's got a sense of humor and he smiles and laughs. whats that about? blade is supposed to be tortured. what happened? and then they bring in thse....things....reapers or something? they drink blood like a crack head snorts coke. if you recall that idiotic scene when the main reaper sticks a vial in some guys neck and drinks it through the vial.<BR>    the soundtrack was pretty bad... though... but i liked the mixture of techno and hip-hop. kinda making a downbeat trip-hop. i liked 2 things about blade 2. 1: the effects(not counting the ones where they make the mongol vampires climb around like monkey's)i liked the reaper effects. when they opened they're mouths. now that was cool. 2: this sounds dumb but i really have to give norman reedus props for pulling off the role of \\"scud\\". lol. he was hilarious. they made a mistake of using him though because i saw him and immediately thought it was stephen dorff. they look alot alike.<BR>     anyways.....punchline: blade 2 was a [bad]. we hope they dont make a blade 3. blade 1 rocks.

B00001OH7V|5.0|\\"Heroes\\" was the first ever Bowie album i listened to back in 1998; also it was the first ever album i listened to that wasn't new and current (up until that point i was only buying new albums like those by Blur and Supergrass). My only knowledge of Bowie was the obvious singles like \\"Jean Genie\\", \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and \\"Lets Dance\\", as well of course \\"Heroes\\", which i fell in love with when i heard it. The strength of that single tempted me to borrow a copy of the album from which it came from. For a few weeks i never gave the album as a whole a chance, preferring instead to only listen to the title song and nothing else. I couldn't get enough of it; it was and still is a beautiful, beautiful song; no dismal cover versions or the fright of hearing it used on building society adverts could dispel its power. The vocals, those gorgeous synthesisers, the lyrics...it is a masterpiece, transcending the restrictions of being a mere song; it's a thing of sheer beauty.<br />Then, one day, I listened to \\"Heroes\\" in its entirety. One of my more smart moves, i should say. It opened my ears to the fact that there was more to Bowie than just memorable singles. He could make damn fine albums too, if this was anything to go by. Nothing else on it topped the title song, but wow, most of it came close!<br />\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" kicks things off, a lean, formidable start with an insistent rhythm that sets the edgy, energetic mood that is to come.<br />\\"Joe the Lion\\" starts off with an utterly twisted guitar from Robert Fripp, a song that is still quite unique, with completely crazy lyrics about nailing people to cars or whatever. I didn't get it then, i didn't care; it sounded brilliant!<br />\\"Heroes\\" i've already told you about. Since then, I've discovered other Bowie songs that i love even more than this, and after hearing it so many times, it no longer has the exact same effect on me, but once in a while, i fall for its magic and listen in complete awe.<br />\\"Sonsof the Silent Age\\" is the worst song here, it sounds a lil' bit like the lovely \\"Drive-in Saturday\\" from Aladdin Sane, but it's all a bit over-the-top and silly, especially Bowie's vocal on the chorus (which never fails to provide me with unintentional amusement)and the backing vocals which sound like they belong on an advert or something. Still, not awful by any means, just a bit cheesy.<br />\\"Blackout\\" is plain crazy, with the most mental Bowie vocal ever except for the one he does on \\"It's No Game Part 1\\" on Scary Monsters. The bit when he yells \\"GET ME TO THE DOCTOR!\\" is insane. Like \\"Joe the Lion\\", it's laid down with music that is accessible yet wildly experimental.<br />\\"V2 Schneider\\" is the first of four instrumentals on what would have kicked off Side Two on the vinyl version, and this is where the album starts to sound more like Bowie's preceeding album, the masterpiece Low. It also sounds a little like Station to Station's title track (the first five minutes of it anyway)too, the way it sounds like a moving vehicle that slowly picks up steam before finding a repetetive and arresting beat. <br />\\"Sense of Doubt\\" is a lot darker than any of the instrumentals from Low, with its pounding, end-of-the-world piano lines. It's a bit too heavy handed to be completely effective but is definitely atmospheric and has a chilling synthesiser interlude about two and a half minutes into it. This segues into \\"Moss Garden\\", a beautiful, celestial piece that follows no real rhythm and sounds utterly heavenly and ethereal. If only it went on forever, but it dives headfirst into another very dark track: \\"Neukoln\\" which is a better attempt at conveying melancholy than \\"Sense of Doubt\\", with its wailing, haunting saxophone, funereal syntheiser and epic guitars. Now, if this was Low, the album would have ended here, all pessismism, uncertainty and darkness, but decides (in the album's most striking moment)to switch gears completely and deliver the stunning \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\", a very exciting and dreamy slice of ambient funk that feels very weird at first after experiencing,and falling for,the hypnotic effect of the last four tracks (it also feels weird to hear Bowie's voice again!)which ends \\"Heroes\\" on a glorious note. Great vocals, a very catchy beat and a terrific fade-out.<br />The version I've got of \\"Heroes\\" adds a couple of bonus tracks which is annoying because they feel tacked on (which of course, they are) so i always listen to them separately and never as part of the actual album. The first bonus track, \\"Abdulmajid\\" is a very atmospheric instrumental that seems years ahead of its time, and the other is an inferior new version of Joe the Lion that isn't really worth bothering with.<br />As good as \\"Heroes\\" is, and it really is something special, it isn't even the best Bowie album, or even the one of the best three. The best three are Station to Station, Hunky Dory and Low. \\"Heroes\\", along with Ziggy Stardust, are both superb, both 5-star albums, but just not as good as the top three (which i would give higher ratings than 5 if i could!).<br />The second in Bowie's collaborations with Brian Eno (who didn't produce any of the so called Berlin trilogy, by the way!), a welcome shot of adrenaline and optimism after Low, but also a beautiful, utterly captivating and original album, the last truly great album Bowie would ever make (follow-up Lodger is only occasionally very good, and Scary Monsters is, while often excellent, strangely overrated as a whole). You've gotta have it.<br />PS: Also, see the great film Christiane F, because not only is it brilliant, it also uses some of the songs from \\"heroes\\" to staggering effect (as well as material from Bowie's other mid-to-late-seventies output).
B00005N9CV|5.0|WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS ARTIST SOONER.  GREAT CD.  BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND STYLE.
B00001OH7X|3.0|Lodger is the worst Berlin/Eno album by a country mile, but if any album was half as good as Low or Heroes then it would still be a peach. Alas, Lodger isn't even half as good as those two Bowie masterpieces. I bought Lodger with the knowledge that it wasn't supposed to be a very good album, but I was nevertheless very curious about it, as i instantly am with all of Bowie's seventies output, one of those decade-long periods that borders on truly glorious. Plus, i just had to get Look Back in Anger because it's absolutely stunning.<br />When i first heard Heroes i was amazed by it. The first time i heard Low i thought it was pretty fine, a few more listens later i realised i was listening to a total masterpiece (better than Heroes). The first time i listened to Lodger i thought it was the second worst Bowie album I'd ever heard (the worst being Earthling). I just thought it was so dull, full of half-hearted experimentation, completely dislocated, uninvolved and completely lacking the coherence, beauty, emotional kick and chemistry that made Low and Heroes such addictive albums. I still loved Look Back in Anger though, one of the best Bowie songs ever in my opinion, full of energy and power, at odds with everything else on Lodger, except for the hilarious Boys keep Swinging, more on that later. It did not feel like an album, it felt more like a collection of B-sides.<br />Over the three years since first experiencing Lodger, I've warmed to it a bit more. That's not to say i don't think it's flawed, because it is. I still think it feels more like an album of songs that were simply dumped along side each other in the vain hope that it would form a coherent whole. This is none more obvious than on the first side, a collection of songs that have no idea where they are going and despite starting off quite interestingly in a couple of cases, cop out towards the end. The two best songs on Side One, Fantastic Voyage and Red Sails, could have been a lot better were they workedon a bit more. The former, which contains some of Bowie's best vocals, fades out a mere three minutes into it, just as one was starting to really enjoy it, cutting short what could have been one of his most epic songs, instead becoming a merely pleasant number. The latter is one of Lodger's more interesting songs, quite funky and full of exciting guitar effects, but after an exhilarating first couple of minutes doesn't seem to know what to do with itself and simply fades into an inconsequential noise.<br />Side Two is a lot better; DJ is a fine single with a memorable chorus even if it does go on a bit. Not a classic, but quite okay fun. <br />Look Back in Anger is three minutes of watertight pop brilliance; Bowie sounds extraordinary throughout, the guitars are thrilling, urgent, the only time Bowie and his band sound on top, classic form. <br />Boys keep Swinging sounds like a faster version of Fantastic Voyage, with great, funny lyrics and some great hooks. However, it does trail off into a weak fade out. <br />Repetition lays down a repetitive (oddly enough) beat complimenting a story of domestic abuse which is one of Bowie's more direct and stark lyrics. Again though, this song doesn't seem to go anywhere, just the same unremarkable riff for about three minutes. Great string bit about thirty seconds into it though. <br />Red Money is a reworking of Sister Midnight from Iggy Pop's great Bowie-produced album The Idiot, which isn't as good as Pop's version but does have a good instrumental about a minute into it. But again, it trails off into nothingness and is easily the least effective closing track of any of Bowie's seventies albums. <br />And then of course, there's \\"African Night Flight\\", \\"Move on\\" and \\"Yassassin\\" on the first side, which have some mildly diverting touches but reek of lethargy and pointlessness, exeperimental without being remotely exciting or interesting. <br />Still, Lodger is an okay album that I won't get rid of, because there are the odd good touches here and there, and Bowie's vocals are as superb as ever. It's a frustrating work, only Look Back in Anger is astonishing from start to finish, but six of the other songs all have something about them, a flawed, unfinished quality to them that makes them strangely appealing.<br />Bowie has said that his heart wasn't 100% into this album, and it sounds like it. A relative dissapointment after a rollercoaster ride that spanned eight years of masterly work. His next album Scary Monsters, while no masterpiece, would be a far more successful, confident and powerful work.

I think that there is a lot a band can do with acoustic sets if they put the effort into it and it is apparent that Mana has because this is one of their best albums. Mana is really at the height of their musical talent on this album especially with songs like No Ha Parado De Llover, Perdido en un Barco, Oye Mi Amor and Cuando Los Angeles Lloran. If you do not have this album and are a Mana fan get it because it shows a new side of Mana, is highly enjoyable and one of the best albums ever put out by any band.
0375414053|2.0|It all seemed so everyday, a bit trite and neither so horrid or so glorious to make me feel that I was reading anything other than a woman's magazine take on things. A bit much &quot;poor me&quot;. Unlikely and pat ending, the type available to only to those who really do have pretty much everything. <br />If you want the real, real picture .. sharp, human, true and although the humour is dry and a touch cynical,also funny,  .. take a walk back in time to Fay Weldon writing decades ago, but still ringing true for this age.

B00006JDVV|2.0|Reign of Fire sounds like it could be a sci-fi/action/fantasy thriller for the ages.  In the near future, man is destroyed by dragons and what few humans remain must live in fear and hiding.  Then they plan one last stand against the dragons to determine who rules the planet.  Sounds exciting, huh?  Well, I'm still waiting for that movie.<br />Reign of Fire is a surprisingly slow and sluggish post-apocalyptic actioner that features very little action.  Just as bad, there are hardly any dragons to speak of on screen.  If my memory serves me correctly, there are a grand total of three dragons the humans fight, and it's all one at a time.  Three fight scenes, in a movie that's just over 100 minutes long.  Damn, the stuff in-between had better be compelling.  Too bad it's not.<br />Unlike The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, this film fails to gel its apocalyptic premise in-between the action scenes, which are admittedly quite thrilling (and more on them in a moment).  Instead, we get a lot of mumbling dialogue spoken among the survivors, very little of which is interesting, and it eventually grinds the pace to the equivalent of a turtle (albeit, a faster than usual turtle).  <br />Things do liven up a bit when Matthew McConaughey arrives, but he's actually less interesting than Christian Bale, who plays our protagonist.  What captured my interest with mConaughey is that wild, unkempt look he sports, that completely shaved head, and the dazed look in his eyes.  This role is a definitely first for the man, and he pulls it off convincingly.<br />Structure-wise, there are quite a few resemblances to Pitch Black (which was far superior), not only in the form of flying beasties but as well with Izabella Scorupco.  Anyone else think she's almost a dead-on for Radha Mitchell from the aforementioned film (though, for some reason, I find Mitchell a lot hotter) (must be the tight tank-top and pants she wears in Pitch Black)?  <br />That aside, there also the action scenes which are fairly thrilling, but also don't hold a candle to the excitement of Pitch Black.  Basically, watch that movie instead, is my advice.  Yeah, Reign of Fire has some good action and special effects, but it's otherwise slooowww pace, head-scratching script, and dull dialogue mar this picture.  I haven't been this disappointed in a while.
0805209999|5.0|Well, I've just finished reading The Trial for the sixth, maybe even eighth time, and as usual my brain is buzzing with all the unanswered questions and unspoken quandaries that this book embeds in the reader's mind.<br />An aside - this is the first time I have read this particular translation, having read the Muir's work before. Perhaps this translation is a bit livelier, and the chapters, or sequences, are grouped a bit differently, but the general experience of reading and digesting this book was much the same as with the Muir's version. One caution, if you are a first time reader do not read the introduction first. The author gives away much too much of the story and ending in the introduction.<br />Now, back to the book itself. As &quot;they&quot; say, the mark of a true classic is that you can reread the book several times and always find it fresh. This is most certainly the case with The Trial. I always struggle with the question of K.'s innocence. The reader is told, unequivocally, that the Law is attracted to guilt. Is this an illustration of the unreasoning, monolithic madness that<br /> so often surrounds totalitarian states, or is Kafka tellling<br />the reader indirectly that K. is guilty? I think most readers,<br /> especially me, want to like and identify with the central<br /> protagonist of a novel, but on this particular rereading<br />I noticed that K. is really a pretty nasty character. He is<br />arrogant beyond belief, selfish, treats women and most everyone<br />else as objects, and is even potentially violent. He alienates<br />and insults people who have the desire and the means to help him<br />navigate the formalities and uncertainties of his arrest and<br />trial. Or, is he an essentially decent fellow who, beset with<br /> unrelenting frustration and anger at being accused and arrested<br /> for a crime he didn't commit, decompensates into irrational<br />actions? Don't expect easy answers from Kafka. He is not going<br />to wrap everything up in a pretty bow, fully resolved, so that<br />you can feel good. It's a damned disturbing, sometimes bizarre,<br />and ultimately amazing novel. What is noteworthy is how<br />deceptively simple the construction of the plotline is. First,<br />the novel is short. Second, there are no parallel or<br />simultaneous plotlines occurring. There is only one plotline,<br />that of K. as he is initially arrested and subsequently tries to<br />make sense of what the charges are and how to deal with them. K.<br /> is in every scene. There's no ,&quot;meanwhile, back at the<br />courthouse, Inspector Smith was...&quot;. So the story, if this novel<br />can be said to contain a &quot;story&quot;, moves along quite quickly.<br />Kafka's prose style is crisp and unadorned, as you might expect<br />from someone educated in business and law in early 1900's<br />Prague.And it's a good thing that he writes so clearly, because<br />the story itself contains not only some astonishingly bizarre<br />scenes (the flogging in the closet springs to mind) but dizzying<br />explanations of the procedures and logic of the court, the Law,<br />the judges, and lawyers. Imagine a writer like Tom Robbins, or<br />Don Delillo, with their hallucinogenic segues and refusal to bow<br />to consistency and logic, trying to pull off the &quot;Lawyer&quot;<br />or &quot;Painter&quot; sequences. It would be a soggy mess. But Kafka with<br />his precision and austerity makes it breathtaking.<br />It's funny, when my friends see me reading Kafka the initial response is almost always surprise and some variation of &quot;Yuck!&quot;<br />Of course, they haven't read him, but everyone &quot;knows&quot; that he is weird and dark and disturbed plus the book is old and doesn't probably even have a happy ending. Oh well, their loss.<br />I really want to take a class on Kafka, ideally focussing on the Trial. It is puzzling and unsettling and I'd love to hear other's thoughts on the symbolism and meaning contained in the book. In fact, if you're a Kafka scholar, or just someone who likes and has given some thought to this book, email me with your thoughts.<br />I unhesitatingly recommend this novel. It is important. It is certainly important to me.<br />ngscholar, or just someone who likes and has given some thought to this book, email me with your thoughts.<BR>I unhesitatingly recommend this novel.

B00006HBUC|2.0|There are probably people out there who will appreciate Scooby-Doo's \\"charms\\" more than I will.  Namely, this would apply to kids.  I have a hard time seeing a middle-aged adult who, regardless of whether or not he was a fan of the old cartoon series, actually enjoying this picture.  This live-action rendition of Scooby-Doo manages to be even sillier than the show it's based off of, and somehow, it's even more boring.  <br />Mystery, Inc. consists of a group of teens who go around solving, well, mysteries, usually involving ghouls and monsters, though the truth usually reveals itself as a human in disguise.  There's arrogant Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr., who's actually perfectly suited for this role), nerdy Velma (Linda Cardellini), vacantly pretty Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), bumbling goof Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and of course, Scooby-Doo himself, appearing courtesy of the latest and most high-tech in special effects.<br />After a two-year separation, the team comes back together to solve strange things going on on an amusement park island.  The kids who arrive at the park come out like brain-washed zombies and the owner wants to know who or what is behind this. And extremely ludicrous stuff happens from there on out.<br />Yes, I realize I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously, but it fails at the most basic level of entertainment.  The jokes aren't funny (in fact, a few of them are cringe-inducing), the acting's mostly pathetic, and the proceedings simply lack a good sense of fun.  Sure, there are a lot of slapstick action sequences, fights with monsters, booby traps, and secret doorways, but it's all brought down by Raja Gosnell's lackluster direction and the cast's inability to appear or sound like anything more than a bunch of actors desperately trying not to be upstaged by a CGI-dog.<br />And when you get right down to it, that's the only reason this movie exists; to showcase a silly Great Dane with cartoonish CGI.  On that level, I suppose there's some satisfaction to be had.  Scooby-Doo himself is a fairly impressive special effect.  The obviousness of it is definitely intentional, and the dog himself, while never actually provoking any genuine laughs, has a few amusing moments.  <br />The same cannot be said for the actors.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. is easily the worst of this cast, taking what should be a relatively simple role and still managing to seem rather flat.  Linda Cardellini is probably too busty and nubile for the role of Velma, but I guess she's okay to the extent playing such a character can afford.  Sarah Michelle Gellar can be a decent actress, and while she plays this vapid role to a tee, this doesn't change the fact she's incredibly annoying.  Matthew Lillard is also hard to watch, particularly in a fart contest that will probably have the kids rolling in laughter.  He does, however, make a pretty fair imitation of Kasey Kasem's voice.<br />Scooby-Doo, the movie, has one fittingly enjoyable segment, involving protoplasm and body-switching, of all things.  For about five minutes, I actually found myself perking up from dullsville and even chuckling a few times.  But once that segment ended, the film went straight back to the garbage bin, particularly with a twist ending that's indescribably silly, even for a live-action cartoon. <br />This is another strike for director Gosnell, the only other movie of his I've seen being Big Momma's house.  But does it even matter who directs a movie like this?  So long as the CGI dog is around, the kids'll rush in droves, and this will soon be a franchise that will milk all its money's worth before disappearing in cinematic oblivion.  But that won't be for another five years.<BR>* 1/2 out of [5 stars.]
B00005ATQM|5.0|I think that is one of the most exciting things I bought the last 9 years. It was a kind of excpecting this feature to come back with this super essential DVD-Audio recording! Of course the company could do it better at 192/24 sound format but the 96/24 doesn't leave me with my mouth and ears wide opened!! I strongly recommend this DVD-Audio edition of \\"The Black Album\\" to Metallica fans!! You will not regret it!!! If only all Metallica albums come out to DVD-Audio format1 Thanks for read this folks!!! Tasos from Athens, Greece.
0440178002|5.0|I get really annoyed when people bash historical fiction as being inaccurate.  That, people, is why it is called FICTION!  Of COURSE there was no real Toranaga, or John Blackthorne, and no, Japan did not get unified when Mariko opened up all of Japan by saving some hostages.  Surprised?  People with half a brain will understand that this is a novel, a fiction, a story.  They will also know that James Clavell spent 10 YEARS researching Shogun.  He lived in Japan, immersed himself in the culture and history, and understood and accurately depicted life in feudal Japan in a thoroughly convincing narrative.  So when some freshman with ½ a semester of history behind his belt comes along talking about how wrong the portrayal was, I cringe; because that is to ignore the absolutely wonderful, creative, well-written and exquisitely crafted STORY that uses the historical backdrop.  This is a fantastic love story; a fantastic war story; a fantastic story of intrigue and plans and couterplans, of betrayal and revenge and spirituality.  It is, simply, a fantastic story.  <br />It is NOT a fantastic history book.<br />Wise people will understand and appreciate the difference, and to them I say:  Read this book - you will not be disappointed.
0446677450|3.0|While I enjoyed this book it was a bit of a time waster.  Perhaps the author wanted to make the book look bigger than it was, but he said the same things over and over again.  This book could have been 1/3 the size if he would have been just a bit less verbose in his writing style.  That said, it was an interesting book and certainly changed our approach to our finances.  We have become fanatical about not touching assets, and learning new ways to increase our asset column while decreasing our liabilities column.  I'm glad I read this book, but I wish I'd bought it used!
0784011222|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I like bad movies. I watch all the Freedy Krugers, and Dumb and Dumber, Ace Venturas, Tromas, ect.  But this one is awful. The worst! Especially to see it now! You expect to see Bin Laden show up to shake Rambo's hand. Now that we know that Rambo and Trautman put el Quaida and the Taliban in power, I generally root for the Russians! Yes, it's that BAD! And the worse part is, it's true, America did do this, and now our guys are back there fighting the same evil that faced the Russian boys. Will Rambo go back?

B000001F29|5.0|I owned this on vinyl back in '81 and had completely forgotten about it. An eclectic selection of songs that is sophisticated and delightful. &quot;The Friends of Mr. Cairo&quot; and &quot;I'll Find My Way Home&quot; are two of the best songs of the early 80's. Buy it and enjoy!
B00006CXXU|4.0|I am totally shocked... Christina has come back and with such a great album. When I bought this CD my expectations were very low, as was the price (the reason I bought it.) When I started listening to the CD I automaticaly fell in love with a two of the songs; \\"Can't Hold us Down\\" and \\"Impossible\\". My favorite line of the whole CD: \\"A guy gets all the glory the more he can score, while the girl can do the same and yet you call her a Whore!\\" Christina wrote all but two of the songs (that being one she did write), and was an executive producer. ... It is one of the best Cd's that has come out in a long time. As a matter of fact I am listening it to it right now. So if you are a fan, or even if you aren't spend the [money]... it is definatly worth the money!
B00006IU73|4.0|Yes its song oriented; yes it has touches of, gag me, nu-metal; yeah the Ptree purists may recoil...but this is hands down a great record.  It has barely left my player since I bought it.  Do the same.  You will be glad you did.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was rather skeptical when I went to purchase Aguilera's new album, \\"Stripped.\\"  Upon hearing the first couple of tracks, I knew that this CD was something special, something different.  Aguilera's voice is in great condition, just very rich and moving. She displays a huge range, hitting high notes with ease and style.  The beats range from soulful R&B to cool guitar riffs, making you want to either get up and dance or wallow in the pain she is expressing.  You can tell from various songs that Aguilera has been through a lot in the past couple of years, and singing about it seems to be her form of therapy. She screams, moans, cries, laughs, experiences an emotional revelation about life and love, all wrapped up tightly into one CD, Stripped.
B00006JKOL|5.0|I own the original ablum but when I saw that this release was available I couldn't resist. I have not been disappointed. A fantastic job has been done in cleaning up the sound on this classic album. And the bonus tracks are a wonderful little present to long time fans.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok, I have her first CD with the whole &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; and I didn't really like too much of the rest of the CD. But THIS CD is wow! I can't beleive how good she is. I agree with another rating buddy that it's not about her looks, which, she needs help, but regardless the gurl can SING. I love this album! Go buy it and jam.
B000002J1L|5.0|Nursery Cryme is a very good CD from the early days of Genesis. Nothing like Invisible Touch, NC is a beautifully crafted work of art with Peter Gabriels intelligent storytelling lyrics, Steve Hacketts acoustic guitar playing, &amp; those awesome Hammond Organs. Phil Collins also takes a lead on vocals for the first time on the acoustic ballad For Absent Friends which is a pretty good track. The production is very lousy and while this CD is great, things really fell into place with the following album, Foxtrot. Definately a worthy CD of having.
B00004ZD69|3.0|Yes, you could say this is original but that doesn't mean it's good. So there's someone banging on a glokenspiel at a campsite in Rhinbeck. Big deal! There are a few good musical moments here but they are hardly worth the stamina you need to get there. Overall it kind of ameteur. I'm obviously not one of those brainwashed fans who claim that 'this disk changed my life'. Someone suggested it to me because I liked Sigur Ros. By the way, no comparison. Oh and It's not that I don't like experimental music. I've been listening to that kind of stuff for 20 years. All this said, I give them credit for going down this path. I don't think they need to worry about 'selling out'.
B00006C79E|4.0|FINISTERRE is the follow up to band's delicate SOUND OF WATER. Whereas WATER's music was glossy and tranquil the new record is more of an energetic romp with touches of analog sounds. Also, unlike WATER, FINISTERRE stays afloat and keeps you on your toes throughout it's entire 45+ minutes of music.<br />The upbeat \\"Soft Like Me\\" is likely to raise much controversy among Saint Etienne fans. It stands out from the rest of the music on FINISTERRE both lyrically and musically, and could easily pass as a Spice Girls song (Arrrgh!) with it's \\"shopping-mall\\" pop meets hip hop delivery. That said, it serves as a lighter counterbalance from the moodier songs found elsewhere. \\"Soft Like Me\\" is one of the few Etienne tracks that sounds tailored as a calculated move to put the band on the charts, so it will come as no surprise when it is released as a single.<br />Impressively the rest of FINISTERRE recalls the greatness of Etienne's early work. The between-song banter of the narrator that pops in from time to time is similar to the random media samples Etienne used on early records like SO TOUGH. \\"Action\\", \\"Shower Scene\\", \\"New Thing\\", and the title track all have solid dance tempos that show the band still at the top of their game over a decade into their career. \\"The More You Know\\" mixes the brooding soundscape of Portishead and brushes it with light flourishes of Mouse On Mars. \\"B92\\" is retro synth-pop all the way. \\"Amateur\\" is jittery, bouncy, and little odd lyrically (\\"Don't pull the choke chain\\" (?)). \\"Language Lab\\" is the only real downer of the new bunch, as well as the record's sole instrumental track, tinkering with woodwind instruments without any direction or purpose.<br />My personal favorite of the FINISTERRE tracks is \\"Stop and Think It Over\\", a slow number that sports a beautifully melancholic melody not unlike the great break-up songs that girl groups sang in the 50's and 60's. The song has both a real heart and real hooks, and easily stands among Etienne's best ballads.<br />I definitely recommend FINISTERRE as a \\"Must-Buy\\" for Etienne fans, as well as a good starting place for newcomers!
078062369X|4.0|This is an action movie , don't get me wrong, but this movie should've cut down the movies screen time by atleast 15 minutes or so.  This movie is about 110 minutes or so, and it has about the same amount of action that a 90 minute movie has.  That extra 20 minutes aint helping it...Most good action ,movies have a pre-fight where the hero encounters the villain , but none of them dies, they just test eachother's strengths and weeknesses, like in blade 2, blade and Nomak meet and have a fight, but none of them is elimated.  In face/off, the 2 characters meet several times, but never kill eachother until the end.  They could've added the bad dude into the fight so blade and him could've gotten a taste of eachother before they actually killed eachother.  But anyways, could've been better.

B00006L7XQ|4.0|To have Johnny Cash recording such an important work of art is simply worth everybody's while, to say the least. Yet I still think he should leave some of the songs off the album, the ones that add nothing to it (f.e. Sam Hall or I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry - he recorded much, much stronger and convincable versions in the Sixties). Of the American Recordings series I still think the Unchained CD is his best yet, if not his best album altogether, but on this fourth studio effort for American he comes around very much as he is: more fragile than he used to be, yet as strong and straight as ever - he is simply Johnny Cash.
B00000I8NC|5.0|Just thought you might like to know that those shapes on the cover are actually two words in Hebrew taken from the bible. In the first chapter of Genesis (the book that is...) we are told that God created the sky and the earth and that the earth was in the form of total chaos. That is exactly what those words mean - &quot;Total Chaos&quot;. In hebrew it sounds nice &quot;TOHOO VA-VOHOO&quot;.<BR>The circles and dots abouve the letters are marks, written all over the bible, that tells one the &quot;melody&quot; or the way to sing those words, as all the bible can also be sang.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the thinking person's action thriller. A high degree of education and cultural literacy helps a great deal, as does an appreciation for action-packed violence.    For a real trip, wait until the screen says \\"Tracing Call\\" and then turn off the sound while turning on Miranda Sex Garden's \\"Fairytails of Slavery.\\" If you have the DVD version, time it so the music starts exactly 50 seconds into the movie.  Make sure the CD player is set on Loop. You will find many strange synchronicities. It's more fun than \\"Dark Side of Oz.\\"
0446310786|5.0|Most of the \\"classics\\" are 100 year old novels or older. Any number of books can be hailed as classics, but I'm talking about the books by Twain, Dickens, Verne, ect. Their are few books from the 20th century that can be called classics yet. The Grapes of Wrath, and Of Mice and Men, can claim this. The other in my opinion is this book. It is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. If you have not read this, you must read it at least once in your life. It is one of the best of the elite group of books known as \\"the classics\\".

B00004R99L|5.0|The all-time best Disney movie.  A classic!  It's hard to describe just how enjoyable this dvd is.  I was born 18 years AFTER this movie was made.  This is not a periodic flick.  This movie holds up, and holds up beautifully.  Young children will adore the characters in this movie and adults will also, as well as seeing deeper meanings that were pertinent for the time (the 50's).  Buy this dvd!  There's not much more that can be said about this movie....
B000066NW0|2.0|In a world overflowing with manufactured pop, youthful boy bands and a severe lack of creativity, many stars achieve success, yet most fail to make an impact on the culture in a way that music used to. For a generation content with competing to be the same, rather than different and who have set such low standards in everything from songwriting to production, Avril Lavigne's \\"Let Go\\" is, in a word, satisfactory. One thing; one unique quality, however, truly sets Lavigne apart from all the Britneys, Jessicas and Christinas of today's pop wilderness: the girl can write! \\"Let Go,\\" featuring pop hits like \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" contains the contemporary, hard-edged pop sound that has become so common in today's youth music culture. Good for Lavigne for creating material that sounds like everything else on the market. Her attempt at pursuing an audience with what could be considered meaningful lyrics and a bold new perspective on a judgmental society (\\"Sk8ter Boi\\") is admirable, but unfortunately insignificant in terms of today's popular idiom. As for Lavigne, the girl has phenomenal potential as a songwriter and performer, and hopefully the world will see greatness out of her in years to come.
B00006950W|3.0|\\"Resident Evil\\" is yet another in a very long line of video-game movies. It ranks somewhere in between \\"Street Fighter\\" and \\"Super Mario Brothers.\\" The plot is this: an underground office known as the hive is infected with a strange virus and all the people as well as a few dogs turn into zombies. Yes, it's as pathetic as it sounds, but there's some pretty good action. For the most part, though, the film fails to generate the intense frights that the video games have. The zombies really aren't that terrifying, but the special effects and makeup are very well done. As for the story, it's only mildly interesting and very obviously incomplete. The ending is the best part of the film, gearing audiences up for a possible sequel. I hope they make a \\"Resident Evil 2.\\" I found myself enjoying this one.
B00005BCOK|4.0|\\"Westworld\\" is Michael Crichton's first foray into the theme-park-as-hell genre which he followed up more successfully in \\"Jurassic Park\\", but it's a very good film on its own.  Here we have James Brolin and Richard Benjamin, two bored yuppies, starting their holiday in Delos, billed as the ultimate theme park, \\"where nothing can go wrong\\".  Yeah, right.  Customers pay through their noses to spend a vacation in one of three areas of the park: Romanworld, Medievalworld, and Westworld, where they can live out their fantasies and it's fun for all.  Brolin and Benjamin choose Westworld (what American boy has never played cowboy at some time in his childhood?) and for a few days they have the time of their lives shooting up bad guys, starting barfights, and drawing a bead on deadly rattlesnakes.  But it's all harmless fun and games -- everything's computerized, the bad guys, the ladies of easy virtue, even the rattlesnakes; and there's a state-of-the-art computer lab to keep everything running smoothly.  Nothing to worry about...<br />...until the computers develop a virus that sends them off into a learning curve that screws everything up.  The first hint that something might be amiss happens over in Medievalworld, when a robot harlot decides she is tired of being a sex object and smacks a customer across the face when he tries to seduce her.  Meanwhile, back in Westworld, the bad-guy-in-black robot challenges Brolin and Benjamin to a gunfight, but instead of being shot dead as he is every night, the bad guy decides to turn the tables.  Oh boy, maybe it's time to cut this vacation short... but that's easier said than done when all of the robots have gone berserk and start whacking not only the customers, but their programmers as well.  Murphy's Law has proved itself once again with a vengeance.  Is there any way out of this mess?  See for yourself.<br />Brolin and Benjamin are fairly good in their respective roles, nothing to write home about; but what makes this movie special is Yul Brynner's terrific portrayal of the bad-guy-in-black; a soulless robot with the dead eyes of a killer.  The special effects are interesting in that they show us how far special effects have come since this movie was made; this was strictly a low-budget film, but it's a lot of fun for all that.  It's pure Crichtonian escapism.special is Yul Brynner's terrific portrayal of the bad-guy-in-black; a soulless robot with the dead eyes of a killer.

B00006CXXU|5.0|We've been waiting a looooong time for this and it is finally here. \\"Stripped\\" from pop-queen Christina Aguilera. Don't be fooled by the cover and her \\"Dirrty\\" video. This is not \\"Stripped\\" as in [bare]-naked Christina, but emotionally bared and this album does just that. The album starts off with a kick-[tail] intro (which is later continued) which has her apologizing for not being what the media wants her to be. The beat is just sick and Christina sings with a hint of honesty (reminds you of Alicia Key's intro for her \\"Songs In A Minor\\" album) but better. The album has a mix of flavors which throws you off from time to time but the standouts are definately....<br />1) Fighter (She went through a major breakup with her management team and this is basically her stress reliever song, very powerful and the climax at the end is worth this record alone.)<BR>2) Impossible (You have never heard her sing like this. Sounds like it would fit perfectly on Alicia's debut but Aguilera sings the hell outta it, herself.)<BR>3) Walk Away (A little long and repetitive but the bridge screams ARTISTIC MATURITY)<BR>4) Cruz (Hands down! Best song on the record. Best song she has ever recorded! One of the best songs I have ever heard. Very personal and to anyone who has ever felt like leaving and escaping, you will relate. Has a Shania/Leanne vibe to it and....amazing)<BR>5) The Voice Within (Mariah and Whitney are kicking themselves in the ass for not recording this song.)<BR>6) I'm OK (We cannot emphatize with her situation but you can definately feel the pain in her voice. About her childhood)<BR>7) Keep On Singing My Song (Reminds me so much of \\"Can't take that away from me\\" from Mariah Carey but this is alittle more upbeat and that note she holds for 12 secs is amazing)<br />Really, this album is amazing. Not the best I have ever heard but it's definately up their with some of Mariah's best and clearly the best cd ever created from a pop princess. It debuted #2 on the charts this week after Eminem and I do not know how it will do in the coming weeks with records coming out from Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z but Christina should be proud, regardless. Because this is an artistic triumph.

B00004YW6I|5.0|As a crossover fan of nearly every genre and a range of artists from B.B. King to Mozart to Royal Trux to My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult, I've noticed one very interesting thing: fans get mad when an artist changes production styles.<br />This is a much more smoothly, shinily-produced PJ Harvey than we've all known in the past. You know what? It works for me. The music is beautiful. It's mature. It's stirring. Only now, it's also easy-to-swallow pop music.<br />If you're very genre-absorbed and can't possibly like a good pop record, then this isn't the record for you because the production in these songs is decidedly pop. I personally love older, more raw PJ works and I also love the melodic sounds of \\"Stories.\\" I find that while her older discs are cathartic in a kind of tense, clawing way that I very much like, \\"Stories\\" is both soothing and beautiful enough to at times raise a few goosebumps, especially on windswept, U2-esque tracks like \\"A Place Called Home\\" or the (aptly described by other reviewers) second coming of Patti Smith (and perhaps even Chrissie Hynde) of \\"Good Fortune.\\"<br />Naturally, if you hate U2, Patti Smith, or the Pretenders, this may not be the record for you. But if you like these artists and you've been a PJ Harvey fan as well, you'll definitely find something to get excited about here.
0684833395|5.0|I usually prefer the English classics (eg. Dickens, Austen, Brontes etc.),but thought due to a friend's recommendation that I would give this a go - it was well worth it.  This book is unique, with its gently facetious humour and the darkness which becomes more and more prevelant as the novel moves on.  A situation strikes you as hilariously funny in one part of the book, but later it is presented in a light which makes you feel incredibly guilty for laughing first time around.  This book plays with your emotions on a grand scale.
B00000GV55|5.0|Every recording made by Henry Cow over the course of their career has its own distinct personality - and every one is full of intelligent, challenging and (gasp!) emotional music.  I place that `gasp!' in there because too many people mistakenly believe that `progressive' or `serious' music, especially that with political overtones, is void of emotion.<br />LEG END is easily their most accessible recording - it's the one that owes most of its style and `feel' to jazz.  As in all of their work, it pushes the envelope - there are elements here of rock &amp; roll, modern composed music, along with a healthy dose of free improvisation.  I once played this for a co-worker (who's also a musician) - he asked `What's this?  Jazz cacophony in any key?'  It's not as unstructured as his comment might imply - but it's not something you're liable to hear played on a station that features `smooth jazz', either.<br />The band is made up of `typical' rock instruments, with important and influential additions.  There's the rhythm section of John Greaves on bass (also playing piano, whistle, and contributing vocals) and Chris Cutler (calling him a `drummer' is a grossly unfair and misleading understatement).  They work here with the amazing and (now-) legendary Fred Frith (guitar, violin, viola, piano and voice), Tim Hodgkinson (organ, clarinet, alto sax, piano, voice) and Geoff Leigh (saxes, flute, clarinet, recorder, voice).  There are compositions here by individuals or combinations, plus two pieces that are credited to `H.Cow', group improvisations.  There is only one extended section of lyrics on this album, in the final track, `'Nine funerals of the citizen king' - it hints at the band's political consciousness, with lines such as `...if we live, we live to tread on dead kings'.  Politics became the assertive center of the Cow's music with the release of IN PRAISE OF LEARNING in 1975 - I'll discuss that recording in its own review.<br />The listener unfamiliar with the work of this group might think that `group improvisations' means `noise' - but that's not the case here.  There are talented musicians, and very much `in tune' with each other, both instrumentally and mentally.  The work they produce in this way is much more organized and flowing that might be expected.  The composed pieces (which also contain some elements of improvisation) are simply stunning in their imagination, construction and execution.  Strains of the opening track, Frith's `Nirvana for mice', played by the full group, can be heard played on his guitars in `extract from \\"With the yellow half-moon and blue star\\"', track 5.  Throughout the album, themes appear and disappear, from track to track - they jostle each other for dominance, for the listener's attention - they emerge side by side, starting with one instrument, and are subsequently taken up by others, sometimes separating again, sometimes joining together into a full-fledged orchestrated arrangement.  Present in this recording are power and restraint, strength and delicacy, in tandem and side-by-side.  There is a distinct `jazz' feel to this record - as I mentioned above, each successive album by this group (recorded from 1973-1978) has its own distinct personality, due in part to changes in personnel, in part to changes in the `groupthink' undergone by musicians who were constantly challenging not only themselves but their listeners as well.  This musical integrity asserted itself in a statement the band released announcing their demise as a working unit, in 1978:  `...we refuse to reproduce our past in order to earn our pensions'.<br />That integrity was embraced - and lived - by this band throughout their career as a unit, and into the groups that emerged from their demise (Art Bears, The Work, News from Babel, &amp;c).  The members of Henry Cow have remained close, and have worked together in other amalgamations since the group's split in 1978.  This is not top 40 music - it's not meant for consumption bythose used to the force-fed diet featured on AOR radio - but if you're interested in music that will make you think as well as entertain, check it out.  The albums they recorded are - in my humble if very biased opinion - every bit as innovative and fresh today as they were when they were released.y those used to the force-fed diet featured on AOR radio - but if you're interested in music that will make you think as well as entertain, check it out.

B000001EGE|5.0|On the CD cases of Elton John's remastered CDs, several of his albums from the early-mid 1970s(everything up to Rock of the Westies)are labeled \\"The Classic Years.\\"  This album certainly lives up to that billing.<br />The album is solid all the way through. There are several standouts, however. \\"Honky Cat\\" is a solid opener and a fun, upbeat little number. \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" is an intriguing contradiction; relentlessly upbeat melody combined with rather depressing lyrics. \\"Rocket Man\\" needs no introduction.  \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Slave\\" are both powerful songs with a message.<br />In my opinion, this album, along with Madman Across the Water and Don't Shoot Me,I'm Only the Piano Player stand out as his best works.  Yes, even better than Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.
B00000IQW3|4.0|I remember seeing this film when it came out in 1984 and enjoying it. I liked it then, and I liked it again when I saw it recently on DVD. There are two reasons why you might enjoy The Last Starfighter:<br />(1) You are looking for a movie to watch with kids aged 8 to 14. This movie has a simple, straightforward storyline that holds attention and enjoyment for its 101 minutes. My daughters (10 and 12) loved it, though they noted that the special effects were a bit obvious (see also reason (2)). It was a nice family treat.<br />(2) You want to see a bit of film history; this one has two attractions. It was the first full-length motion picture to rely entirely on computer-generated graphics for its special effects, arguably blazing the way for the CGI industry of a decade later. From the perspective of 18 years later, these effects are pretty obvious, but they are not primitive. They work well. And they were done on computers that were less powerful than the laptop I'm typing this review on.<br />The second bit of film history in this movie is that it was one of the last films to co-star Robert Preston, in a role that is deliberately modeled on one his most famous (and enjoyable roles), that of the outrageous flim-flam man of The Music Man. &quot;Centuri&quot; (Preston) is the reincarnation of Professor Harold Hill in outer space. If you are a fan of Robert Preston, you'll enjoy his performance in this movie. It is obvious that he enjoyed doing it.
0790731452|1.0|What can I say about this movie? I guess it just didn't do it for me. I found it dull and unentertaining. I went in expecting to laugh at satire of alien invader films; instead I got what seemed more of a tribute to cheesy alien movies. There were attempts at humor throughout the film, but with me they missed their mark.<br />I will admit that in general I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton movies. I just don't GET his weird dark gothic worlds. I didn't think he ruined Batman, but I wouldn't necessarily have envisioned him that way. This movie, in my opinion is the worst of the Tim Burton movies I've seen. I almost swore completely off his movies after this, but that would have been a mistake since he does manage to find stories that fit his weird style, like Sleepy Hollow, occasionally.
6304595247|2.0|but at least it restores E. Bronte's hopeful ending. Read the book instead.
0060194995|5.0|Very simply put, EVERYBODY should read this book. I am 32 years old and can't believe I just read this book for the first time. I am so overwhelmed by this book that I can hardly put into words how it made me feel. On one hand I wish I had read this book in high school. On the other hand, I think this book had a much greater impact on me, reading it as an adult. <br />If you haven't read this book...read it. You won't be sorry. <br />td
B00004RFCM|5.0|The characters on this first season of \\"Sex in the City\\" take on lives of their own.  The situations are funny with a string of love affairs for all.  Carrie's love affair for Mr. Big takes up much of the season with particularly hilarious episodes revolving around her busting in on church, dropping the hymnal from the balcony while she's supposed to be doing stealth snooping on Big's religious habits.  Red haired Miranda is my favorite with her edgy cynicism always at hand.  While it is a bit tedious to see the opening again and again, I guess that's why God made fast forward!  The episode where the girls all watch the couple in the apartment building across the street through their open window doing gymnastic love making is hilarious.  This is a great disc, one not to overlook as the show's seasons go by.
044022425X|4.0|I loved the first three book in this series, with the first two being particularly special to me.  But I have to say, this installment just isn't as good, and it's all the fault of Brianna.  What was Gabaldon thinking?<BR>Brianna is supposed to be an historian, but she runs around Colonial America saying things like, &quot;I don't need a father for my baby!&quot; and insisting on wearing pants, as if she has no idea what kinds of real-life consequences awaited illegitimate children and unfeminine women at that time.  Anyone who knows anything about that time, as an historian would be expected to do, would know that it wasn't the 1960's, but Brianna just blithely goes along, not caring what the consequences may be.  I was so irritated with her I almost gave up on the book several times.<BR>Luckily I didn't, because it is a very good story otherwise, and I particularly like Roger Wakefield, although I couldn't understand why he would be in love with someone as irresponsible as Brianna. John Gray is indeed a great character, and Claire and Jaime, while maybe not as exciting as they once were, are still a great couple.<BR>A solid read, but needs less of the daughter and more of her parents.  I also want them to go back to Scotland.
B000006UNG|5.0|Just a quick word about the first track, Happiness Is Easy: Simply one of the greatest songs of all time. It's STILL completely ahead of its time. Trip-hop and modern chill-out BOTH owe a HUGE debt to it and to this whole album in general (although maybe not the guitar bits). The track stars with one of the most crisply-produced, rhythmically-intricate beats you'll ever hear, and apart from the piano and organ parts, every other element (acoustic and electric bass, acoustic guitar, sax, trumpet) are results of some great improvisations, cut-up and intersperced throughout the length of the song like so much pixie dust, giving way to many jaw-dropping, blink-and-you'll miss-it moments (The richocheting snare at the beginning, small throbbing globs of acoustic bass, swirling guitar phrases). In essence, Happiness Is Easy remains THE late-night, driving-in-your-car track of ALL time. Anyone interested in brainy, intricately-but-not-over-produced avant rock that's still remarkable easy to listen to (like Doves and The Flaming Lips)shoud not miss this album. Be wary of further exploration of Talk Talk, though: The two albums preceding this are New Romantic synth-pop and the two succeding are challenging neo-classical concept albums with labourously-built, complex structures. Not for everyone, then. Lead-man Mark Hollis' sparse, fragile solo album from '98 ought to do the trick.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I have 3 children-6,5&amp;2.  It is really hard to find a great Family movie that everyone can enjoy.  This made the kids laugh until there sides split and also made them a little less worried about the under the bed and closet monsters!!  I have been getting more sleep!!  This is a must have on dvd widescreen,the games are fun!
B000069HSP|5.0|I've seen alot of war films and I have to say this is probably the best one that i've seen yet.  The movie basically drops you into the middle of the battle and lets you experience some of what war is. <br />This is a DVD I would recommend for anyone to add to their collection.
B000002H70|5.0|This album along with Pornography and Bloodflowers make up what is called the Dark Trilogy of Cure albums.  This album possesses a dreary and thoughtful atmosphere.  The lyrics and mix of instruments showcase Robert Smith's (the lead singer) brilliance.  This album is best listened to at night or on a rainy day.  Songs like 'Prayers for Rain' and 'Same Deep Water as You' are beautifully charged with emotion yet at the same time almost peaceful.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie is absolutly the most thrilling exciteing war movie i have ever seen! (MY ADVICE IS .... own surround sound before veiwing!) DTS sound track helps bring the war to ur house in the most advanced digital sound technology. the clarity or the dvd is amazeing and the action seens are intense. some people may think twice about buying a movie that is around 100 dollars and up to ten hours long but trust me u will regret not buying suh a master peice.   <BR>    this movie is the type where u have to sit and watch every episode in order, u must pay attention to every seen and not be disracted in anyway when watching. it tells the vital rolls our soldiers played in ww2 and really shows the hardship that they had to survive through.... it is really exillerateing and it should deffenetly get on a five star scale 10 stars!
0345448898|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this trilogy. A friend gave me Compass, which I loved. I promptly ordered the next two books which were even better. The type that I read just a little bit each night, savoring the story, until the last part of book 3, when I just couldn't put it down anymore. This is quite a compliment, as I usually have a hard time getting my feeble mind to embrace and follow stories that are not written in first person.  Follow Lyra and Pantalaimon on their journey to the North. With them, meet the many terrifically developed characters that make this story such a joy to read.
0553381709|5.0|I don't read these types of books, but I have read all three within the Fire and Ice series. This is saying alot. The characters and the sweeping, ever-arching plot lines and forever engrossing. I just wish he would write as fast as I can read them. Friends of mine have read and re-read them over three times now. Wonderful books!
B00000K0EA|5.0|Blasting on to the screen with undeniable charm is Pierce Brosnan in his 2nd and one of the best James Bond movies ever! When powerful media mogul Elliot Carver is anxious to get his media rulings all over the world he takes it to the extreme. His idea is to star WWIII between the UK and China so he can increase in his media popularity in China. Considered by many and myself to be one of the best villians in the series. He also has an array of evils working for him. First their is the Aryan bodyguard Stamper who brings back memories of the towering Red Grant, there is also the techno-wizard Gupta and the psychotic Dr. Kaufmann. The new girl is chinese agent Wai Lin, who  finally equal to 007 in every single way. Paris Carver is Bond's old flame who is now married to Elliot Carver. This film really has the one-liners packed, especially from the villians like, \\"There's no news like bad news.\\" and \\"Let the mayhem begin.\\" This film is truly full of axction, like the fantastic car chase and motorcycle chase! This title song is majestically performed by Sheryl Crow and k.d Lang gives us \\"Surrender\\" an end-title song that brings back the days of Shirley Bassey. One of the most enjoyable films in the series and definitly one of my favorites!!!
0385474547|5.0|Note: If you haven't read this book yet, I wouldn't read this review if I was you as it reveals what happens in the end.<br />Two thirds of the book is about everyday life in Okonkwo's village, and was the part of the book that was most interesting, colorful and the part that I really liked best. Achebe's great style of storytelling really made the life in Umoufia so alive in my imagination, and my sympathy for the in many ways cruel and hard Okonkwo grew throughout this first part of the book.<br />The last third deals with what happens when the Christian missionaries infiltrate the independant village that you by now know so well, and you understand the name of the book, and you understand how Okonkwo's world and proudness literally fall apart. What happens in the end is a very powerful and symbolic representation of colonisation's effect on Africa and it's people - splitting, uproaring and overriding their traditional, proud lifestyle and beliefs. After reading the book I asked myself &quot;why did this happen?&quot;. Why didn't the Europeans have more respect for this people's believes and lifestyle, which you after reading this book understand had been working for them just like our community works for us. I only wish that the last third of the book hadn't been there, and that life in Umoufia had continued undisturbed..
B00003CXXI|3.0|But not as great in my opinion as some say. That doesn't mean you wouldn't enjoy it though. It's a pretty funny movie and there're some moment that'll make you burst out laughing, but I felt that Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy's performancer her toned down. These are two of the funniest men in hollywood and if given the freedom, they could have made one of the funniest films ever, but that's not the case. Not that they're bad in the roles. They both do fine jobs, just not up to their usual stanards. John Lithgow is a wonderfully incomptent villian. His role let him really strut his stuff and show of his comedi skillsThe graphics in this film are really nice. They remind me of video game graphics  in their style, but they're much smoother and more detailed In my opinion, the best part of this movie were the stabs towards Disney and the totally twisted takes on fairy tale character (the interigation of the ginger bread man in priceless)All in all, this is a good film to kill a couple of hours, it's fun and a decent film for the entire family
B00005JKCH|5.0|When I see over 500 reviews on a title, I normally won't write one. However, I felt I needed to comment on a couple of items. I hope I don't repeat too much of what's already been said.<br />First off, this is a great movie. I relate WAY too much to Peter Parker, and I'm reminded of many personal issues while watching the movie. Yes, the characters have some depth in this movie adaption as well as in the comics. J. K. Simmons is great as Jameson!!<br />Only one Spider-Man trailer is on the DVD, and it's one I had never seen. It's not the trailer that showed Peter on the school trip taking photos of MJ. I think that one was the original trailer (not teaser) that was on the Spider-Man web site. The trailer on the DVD used the same music that was recently used in a Toyota Camry ad. The Spider-Man TV ads are also ones I had not seen. Not all of the promotional ads are included. The Cingular ad that used Spider-Man is here. Trailers for other movies are included: XXX, Men In Black II, Mr. Deeds. ...and a couple of others.<br />I do feel the DVD menu could have been done better. It's not very clear which item is currently selected on the main menu. On the sub-menus, it's better except for items at the bottom that match the format of the main menu. You have to look for the little dots next to the item which will show it's selected. Nothing is highlighted, just those dots.<br />The Pop-up Factoids are nice. They provide much background information about the movie and comics. Different graphics are used depending on which is being discussed. There is a black & white drawing based on the comics used as a border for anything related to the comics. Everything else uses a blue box with a color drawing of Spider-Man on one of the borders. There are a few typos like a \\"w\\" missing from the word \\"wrestling\\" on one. Proofreading could have been better, but it's not that bad. The typos mainly involved missing letters.<br />There was one error that I found in the Factoids. Just after Aunt May mentions that everyone knows how Peter feels about Mary Jane, there are a few facts about the use of phone booths in comics. The BBC series, Dr. Who, used a police box, not a phone booth.<br />Technical issues aside, Spider-Man is a great movie. Things that were changed for the movies can be debated, but I can understand the reasons for the changes. Green Goblin's suit was changed because it was the suit worn for the glider which was for a military contract. It needed to look like armor, not the original purple and green fabric. The glider suit didn't seem to include any helmet in the earlier shots. Although it wasn't as obvious, the Goblin wore a mask in the comic too. The idea of the mask becoming more of a helmet for the armour makes sense.<br />It would have been nice to see the comic book version of everything, but I'm not totally against the updates. (I'm only familiar with the older comics - mainly reprints of the original ones from the 1960s.) Some details need to be changed because of the times. The public attitude toward radiation isn't the same as it was in the early '60s when the movies would show us all kinds of monsters and mutations created by it. Today, genetic engineering makes more sense.<br />This is a great movie for fans, and the human issues make it more than simply a comic book movie. I would recommend the movie highly to fans and non-fans.<br />Trivia: Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) also appeared in the Batman TV series as the villian, Shame.ter Aunt May mentions that everyone knows how Peter feels about Mary Jane, there are a few facts about the use of phone booths in comics.

B0000524CY|5.0|This is the scariest movie I've seen so far. Seen all the other \\"scariest films\\" Rosemary's Baby so-so, Psycho it's okay, Silence of the Lambs give me a break, This is the one that takes top honors. As of now, I've seen most horror movies, and this is by far the scariest movie I've seen yet. This is also based on a true story, and that makes it even scarier! This is the movie to buy! Watch it alone in the dark, then you'll see what everyone else is talking about. Watch it with an open mind please! Don't try not to get scared, try to get scared! This is the only scary movie that messed me up for a long period of time. You have to see this movie. This is true horror!!

B00006L7XQ|5.0|The last 8 years of Johnny Cash's nearly 50 year career are without a doubt his best. This album American IV: The Man Comes Around is just another testament to his gunius, stamina, and soulful tone. Much like the last 3 albums Cash covers some of the music industries giants, NIN, Sting, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, Hank Williams, and the Eagles. Covers are always a great addition to any artists albums, however with Cash he always seems to reinvent the song and clearly make it his own. We have seen this in the past on his American Recording alubms, with Beck's Rowboat, Tom Petty's Southern Accents and I Wont Back Down, Soundgarden's Rusty Cage, Neil Diamonds Solitary Man, and even U2's One. Once again he has captured the ability to take these songs and make them his own, mix that in with some new origanals, and traditional folk/gospals, and it puts together one hell of an album not just for a Cash fan like myself but also a music fan of any generation or genre. High points of this album include the title song The Man Comes Around(Cash), Bridge Over troubled Water(simon,garfunkel)[performed with Fiona Apple], In My life(lennon,McCartney), and Tear Stained Letter(Cash). The entire album is a musical experience, and it is not easy to rate any track above one another, I recomend sitting back and enjoying them all. Once again Cash has continued to expand and grow with his music, this is certainly a must have for music fans young and old.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of Spidey until I saw this movie.  I agree with all who say that it is probably the best comic book adaptation available.  It isn't overly dark as the original Batman was, but it has it's moments.  The Green Goblin/Norman Osborne actually has some dimension to him.  In other super hero films, the bad guy often overshadows the good guy, but not so here.  Let's all pray that this series doesn't go the way of Batman and Superman and slide into the sewage as the sequels begin.
0783225849|5.0|This is definately not the scariest movie ever made! I just wanted to state that. This is scary, don't get me wrong, but to call it the scariest movie ever made is a bit of an exageration. It is Hitchcock's scariest movie, but not the scariest movie ever made. Buy or rent, I'm sure you'll be pleased.
B00006L83N|5.0|I must admit that I was a tad hesitant to purchase this album. I mean, after listening to V and Divine Wings of Tragedy, how could they do better? Lucky for me I took the risk. This album is one of the best purchases I've made in 2002, besides Opeth's 'Deliverance', but that's a different story. 'The Odyssey' sucks you in right away with Inferno, featuring some of the best riffs I've heard in quite a long time. It doesn't stop there, keeping you hooked with hit after hit. Accolade II is a beautiful song, completely living up to the first Accolade. The rest of the songs were completely mindblowing as well, and then you come to Odyssey, the title track. I used to think Divine Wings of Tragedy's title track was good, but I have to say that this song destroys it in every way.<BR>In conclusion, buy this album. Now. Best thirteen dollars you'll ever spend.

0375414053|5.0|A very funny book. It is a parody of course. Kate is the ultimate extreme career woman, but there is not one working woman out there who does not relate to the essence of Kate's struggle. I honestly laughed and cried. Author Allison Pearson hit the nail on the head. Sometimes a little too close to home as I winced in recognition. Other times I got to congratulate myself on not being quite \\"as bad as Kate.\\" But I loved it. It is a good story with an ending that provided food for thought about some of the choices I have made with my life.
B000005JA8|5.0|I bought this album in the early 70's and have always loved it. It is indeed difficult. It's art! I guess it's not for everyone. It's not a sofa painting. It is challenging. It pushes some boundaries. It must have done something right to still [irritate] people off after all these years. Just imagine what it was like in 1969!  Favorite Song: Frownland

B00006V9A0|5.0|this is probably the best of all nirvana songs (obviously as it was meant to be) with the exception of two or three songs. the opening track &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; is an explosive track which is, in my opinion, nirvana's best. It then goes on to play some of the songs from their unplugged session. this cd is a must have for any nirvana fan. i hope you enjoy it as much as i have.
0812513495|5.0|it was the greatest sci fi book ive ever read!
0792101448|5.0|I adore this movie!  I first saw it at a special showing at an independent theatre in Scotland, where it took me on a fascinating and exciting voyage.  I've loved it ever since, and everybody whom I've practically forced to watch it has loved it as well.  (My father in particular, who's been a fan of westerns since his childhood.)  This was the first western I had ever seen, and I must say that I haven't seen any since that meet the magic, beauty, and drama of Once Upon a Time in the West.  It's really too bad that it's virtually a cult film, and not to be found easily.  <br />Obviously, I would highly recommend seeing this film if you haven't already.  I've seen it over a dozen times and have yet to tire of it.
B000059H9E|5.0|Victor, born in the midst of public transportation, has recently met a young woman for a one night stand in a public bathroom and now has strong feelings for her.  He enters the woman's apartment when she thinks it is her drug dealer and it turns into an unpleasant incident where two police officers are involved.  One of the policemen gets shot during a struggle over a gun and he later marries the woman that Victor is in love with.  Victor is put in jail where his hatred cultivates and he passes the time by studying the bible.  Years later, when Victor is released he runs into the woman again.  Live Flesh is a strong film with a message of love and affection concerning individual choice.
B0000640S1|5.0|You will not look the same way at law enforcement.  When some kings**t cop puts a parking ticket on your car you may ask him, &quot;Why you keep pushin me?&quot;.<br />Tell your nagging wife to, &quot;Let it go.......let   it   go.&quot;<br />Put on a burlap bag for a shirt, sharpen your knife and watch this flick 5 times a day.
B000069HKH|2.0|I just don't get the fascination with the boss. This has got to be the most over produced cd I've heard in ages; it's so heavy, the music is constantly attempting to breath but there's no open airwaves. Having said this, Bruce remains the best live act I've seen. Try Nebraska instead or another artist altogether. I'm confused.
B00005JK8K|3.0|Nicholas Cage is usually good in anything he does and John Woo did a good job of directing. The war scenes are riveting and could not be done better. We see some introspective in five of the characters, Sgt. Enders, Yahzee, Sgt. Anderson, Charlie Whitehorse, and Chick. The rest are poorly developed. We hope to see the story of the Windtalkers but it is never truly developed completely. We see there is a Navaho code developed, and Tank is Turtle in that code. Then we see Cage told he must defend his code talker and the code itself above all. Most of the rest the movie is battle scenes but we periodically see a sprinkling of code talkers telling enemy coordinates to one another for support or shooting the breeze about what is happening in their company. Although very interesting it doesn't touch us emotionally like Private Ryan did. I think with a little more character development, especially the Indians, it would have been a great movie. When Yahzee gets mad at Sgt. Enders and runs around wildly killing Japanese without concern for those trying to protect him, it didn't endear me to him. I think if they had cast Wes Studi also, it would have been even better. This said this is still a movie worth owning. I certainly bought it on DVD.
0385484518|5.0|I loved this book because it teaches us many lessons.  It teaches us about the importance of life and how not to let it pass us by.  It also teaches us about death and not taking life for granted.  Morrie was a teacher and he was dying.  He taught his last lesson and that was how to die graciously.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've had this album since '96 and I didn't really get into it until I saw them live the following year. The album had to grow on me because I didn't understand what the band was trying to do with this album. This album will make you think, about the music its self and the lyrics. My favorite songs on the album are \\"46&2\\" which talks about evolving into the next step of existence and \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" which talks about \\"loyal\\" fans calling them sellouts because they've changed. Overall this is a great album. If you're into dark music with good musicianship and good lyrics than this is the album for you.
B000000WCX|4.0|I really like this album, The songs on it are vintage bowie, wistful meditations which somehow make very vivid sense, mixed with other songs which are very different.<BR>Looking for satellites is an excellent repetitive tune, which evokes spacial infinities and wobbling gravities and contemplations on the place of religion and god in this age of genetically engineered ears and triple carbon re inforced space suits.<br />Dead man walking is perhaps my least favourite song on the album, its too commercially dance techno, without bowies trademark lyrical excellence, however its STILL good.<br />Telling lies is a fiesty little hornet! Again in keeping with the many techno influences on this album its pacy and well timed.<br />Law Earthlings on fire is a dance track with Bowie crooning &quot;i dont want knowledge, i want certainty!&quot; many times, another bowie voice (sounding submerged in custard)comes in with other words that i guess must make sense somehow! A good song, the music is ethereal but pacy.<br />Im afraid of americans is a black sheep on the album, its a rock song not a dance track, but its a great little song nonetheless.<br />Little wonder is a great song, im sure you all know it so i wont elaborate.<br />Seven years in tibet is a classic! I love this song, it starts off slow but reaches an amazing climax as bowie shouts &quot; nothing ever goessssss away&quot;, the best song on the album.<br />Battle for Britain is a good song, with much to recomend it.<br />The weakest song on the album is &quot;the last thing you should do&quot;.<br />Verdict, not quite as good as outside but better than hours.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|This is probably Bowies second best album (after station to station), i would juggle it with LOW for the number two spot.<BR>Ashes to ashes is a legendary piece of music, filled with haunting electronica and excellent drum sounds, we hear bowie moaning gloriously about the major tom character (who has become a junkie).<BR>Teenage wildlife is the best song on the album, full of changing moods and very fast vocals, glorious.<BR>Scream like a baby is a fantastic song with incredible vocals and weird sound effects that work brilliantly, again bowie is sympathising with the underdogs, the outcasts.<BR>Its no game is a stinging attack on modern values, Bowie quips bitterly &quot;i am barred from the event, i really dont understand the situation&quot; possibly referring to how we in the west are cushioned from understanding what is truly going on in the greater (third) world, ie we bury our heads in the sand.<BR>I like its no game part 2 the best of the two versions.<BR>Kingdom come is very uplifting, about the spiritual resistance of a man in a hopeless situation.<BR>Because your young is another gem, the guitar work on every song on this album is crazy amazing, but particularly on this song.<BR>Scary monsters is the second weakest song on the album (to me anyway), it is still good though, but to me it sounds too halloweenish and gimmicky.  <BR>Up the hill backwards is probably the weakest song on the album, but it is still very good, in it bowie sings &quot;up the hill backwards itl be allright..&quot; perhaps suggesting a fear of failure was creeping in. But that would be only to be expected because his work up to and including this album is so good it would scare the hell out of me!<br />Oh and this is NOT bowies last great album, i would urge people to also check out outside, black tie white noise, earthling and even hours! This man is the best musician of all time.
0553381407|5.0|This book feels like and works like therapy, and thats a good thing because therapy is expensive. If you had any kind of parental abuse and would like to explore it, this is a very good start.  My therapist said she  recommends this book to many patients.
B000000W9Z|5.0|This is a classic album, it is as good as anything he did in the seventies. <BR><BR>It is interesting when bowie makes a concept album he never hits a wrong note, its only when he submits to market pressures is when his manna turned sour.<BR>Positives<BR>a number of really good songs.<BR>Voyeur of utter destruction is a sharp insight into the media age, it satirises those who are enthusiastically drawn to the misery and suffering they see played out on their TV screens and read about in newspapers (well thats what i thought at first) now i see it as the boasts of some kind of sensate, who is a voyager in human experience, seeking ever new perversions and challenges, the lyrics go \\"research has pierced all extremes of my sex, call it a day call it a day\\", which suggests this individual is only living his life so he can study himself as he experiences something, very arty, one of my fav tracks on the album. It contains great lyrics, with sly puns eg \\"for the reeking flesh is as romantic as hell\\".<BR>I have not been to oxford town contains the confessions of a thief in prison. The title suggested to me possibly more of bowies famous skill at using layered multiple themes and metaphors.<BR>Thru these architects eyes is about the thief character explaining plaintively why he does what he does \\"to leave the job when you you know the moneys from day to die\\", i love this great song, wow apart from the segues there isnt a bad song on this album.<br />We prick you is a fast drum beat which is very good to listen to, not sure what its about though.<BR>Im deranged boasts a wonderful techno paranoia sound that is seriously good and haunting blurry self effasive lyrics. Im deranged is one of the gems on the album.<BR>Strangers when we meet is the most easily absorbed (and commercial?) song on the album, but forgiven for that its a great track, i love it.<BR>The title track is an uplifting almost symphonic piece, with impressively uplifting changes in tempo and lyrics.<BR>No control ties in well with \\"im deranged\\", it is a funky little number with lots of strange fatalistic insights eg \\"every single moves uncertain\\" and \\"sit tight in your corner, dont tell god your plans\\".<BR>The hearts filthy lesson is a great song, full of atmospheric vocals and avenging drums, snippets of meanness cruelty and self obsession reign throughout, this song is about a suicide cult were the leader encourages her devotees to experience the \\"fantastic death abyss\\". This brilliantly creepy and haunting song i never tire of listening to. Again double meanings such as \\"O Ramona , if there was only something between us...other than our clothes..\\" which seems to suggest he wants a relationship with Ramona but actually means he is afraid of her and wants to escape from her presence. Brilliant.<BR>Small Plot Of land is an eerie uplifting mostly instrumental song that is one of the best on the album, the tempo builds until it becomes almost hypnotic and menacing.<br />Negatives<BR>Though innovative and funny, the numerous segues make the album more prone to dating and being fixed in its time and within the borders of its themes, these are excellent songs regardless which can stand alone. I do like the segue baby grace (a horrid cassette) though, and algeria touchshriek.<br />Like all Bowie works i would advise you listen a few times and let the music sink in a bit, Bowies music is more sophisticated than disposable pop detritus or false rock regurgita and so deserves this.<BR> <BR>If you pass this baby down, you dont know what your missing.
B00005JG6R|4.0|Anyone who is even slightly familiar with Japanese animation has heard of AKIRA.  You almost have to write the title in full caps.  Superhuman powers have seemed to always be a favorite of the japanese.  This movie has it and more.  A wonderful story of friendship, sadness, and a disturbing theme of human experimentation by the government, all to achieve the \\"ultimate weapon\\" mankind has always been searching for.  In AKIRA, we have no further to look than ourselves for the power to destroy entire cities with a thought.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the english dub version of this movie confuses an already confusing storyline, not to mention the fact that it does tend to drag a little in the middle.  For someone who hasn't read the manga version, this movie can be extremely confusing.  Thankfully, the japanese language mode with english subs helps a little bit with the confusion.  So a word to the wise: If you wish to understand the storyline, don't watch this movie in english!
B00001OH7U|5.0|This is David bowies best work, the fact that there are only sixsongs was probably because he was perfecting each and every one, and boy it shows! <BR>The title song is a grand sweeping rock epic that is really three great songs in one.<BR> <BR>It is the best song ever written.<br />It was written about a train journey but typically bowiesque it can be interpreted in many ways, eg the movement down the tree of life, from &quot;kether to malkuth&quot; symbolises the transition from pure spirit to pure flesh. I would compare this work of genius to beethovens ode to joy (only more varied daring and enjoyable). Led zeppelin eat your heart out!<BR>Word on a wing is my second favourite bowie song, bowies vocals on this song will bring tears of awe to your face, as he questions his relationship with god religion atheism. <BR>TVC-15 is an incredibly contorted song supposedly about a dream his friend iggy pop had about being eaten by a TV! Its really a good song too.<BR>Stay is one of bowies very best, but equal credit goes to Fripps amazing guitar work on this little funky beast.<BR>Wild is the wind is a truly haunting and beautiful melody, which is another example of bowie doing a cover and making it sound better than the original.<BR>Golden years is the weakest song on this album (crazy how bowie tended often to headline an album or release a single from an album and used the weakest song on the album aw well) but it is still a great song.<br />Buy it.
B00004WIBW|2.0|I had great expecatations of this film, based on Burton's reputation and some of the glowing reviews I'd read here. But this was a grim tale. In spite of Burton's wonderful visual imagination, I found little to enjoy.<br />I think I must agree with the reviewer from Los Angeles who wrote that Burton has trouble picking good scripts. That, along with trouble getting the best from his actors, must be the problem. He had wonderful talent in Depp and Ricci, but he didn't seem to know what to do with it. Depp was a particular disappointment. It was as though he wasn't given enough to work with. However, whoever cast the child Ichabod did an amazing job. You can imagine a child Johnny Depp looking like him.<br />Two technical points: I though Burton made a big mistake showing us the face of the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) right away. This removes suspense and mystery from the story. Also, the part about the baby was truly distasteful. Seeing the slit in the widow's stomach is quite enough to tell the viewer what  they need to know. Carrying it further is pointless. As a woman viewer I was really put off.
1573227978|5.0|I am a person who is quite critical of books and that finds flaws easily. When I got The Beach, by the end of the first page i was immersed in Alex Garland's amazing narrative and storytelling. I found that before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. This is the only book I've ever read where I found that I can't find a good spot to put it down. It seemed that whenever I wanted to stop, I was always in the middle of a &quot;good part&quot;. I reccomend this book to anyone, and I mean anyone.
B000065U1N|1.0|What, those soldiers killed over five hundred villagers,  including women and children, in a FOREIGN, INDEPENDENT country, and now they are heros in a movie?
B00006V9A0|4.0|I only give it 4 stars because it's nirvana, and for all intents and purposes, they were just great....\\"in utero\\" was definitely not an attempt to alienate his audience.  Steve albini produced the album, and kurt told him right off the bat that he wanted it to sound like The Pixies' \\"Surfer Rosa\\" (at least, production-wise).  Keep in mind, the pixies were one of his favorite bands, long before he achieved any fame.  If Following an artistic vision that's been with you all along (he did love sonic youth) is considered trying to alienate your audience, then i guess he did.
B00006LLNU|3.0|I like Sigur Ros. That being said, I feel they have so much more to offer than they're giving us. These minimalist \\"soundscapes\\" can be very rewarding with repeated listens, however 3 songs through the record and you're not sure anything has happened yet. It also seems to me as a regression of sorts from their previously megahyped \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\", which was more rewarding overall and a bit more fleshed out, soundwise. I will enjoy this record for what it is, realizing that this band hasn't even begun to tap their overall potential, while at the same time wondering \\"what if\\"... Kevin Shields had produced this record.
0060934700|5.0|Very rarely do I read something that proves emphatically the author is smarter than me. I know this sounds conceited but its true, I'm rarely challenged but &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; was just that a challenge. From the first word I was reading with my whole mind, soaking up the brilliance of the prose and complex simplicity of the ideas. Thank you Mr Gaiman please keep creating.
0316666343|2.0|I finished this book in about a day, it's a fast read and you are drawn into the personality of Susie Salmon. I thought the concept of having the main character dead throughout the entire book was interesting, but the other characters did not captivate me with the same energy.<br />The father was supposed to be a tragic figure, but felt incredibly two-dimensional, quickly decomposing from a passionate defender of his daughter to a miserable waste of space. Her sister was boring and uncharismatic, and I could care less about her relationship.<br />The mother I loathed throughout the book, and I never understood why everyone clung onto her. She was immature and selfish, becoming infuriated when the attention was diverted from her. Buckley, Susie's little brother, had potential, but his character was wasted on some sort of apathetic statement. <br />Ruth was condescending and at times irritating, and Ray, well Ray was there. I didn't really feel much for him, and I have no clue why Susie wasted her time on earth having sex with him. The ending plot twists were cliched, using a hospital to reunite the family. <br />The concept of the novel was captivating, with a character you really grabbed onto. But as the book progressed, all the characters seemed to mesh into one flat, two-dimensional entity for a rushed and unappealing ending.
6303407188|5.0|This is my absolute favourite film. It is sweet, funny, sad and uplifting. While the characters in the film including Ed Wood himself must have been far more horrible in real life Tim treats them gently in his opus. Ed Wood's reputation as the worst director ever is examined here but the real message is that if you have a dream pursue it no matter what. Though Ed, his career and friends are all lovingly mocked they are given a sense of dignity they were denied in life.
B00006F2TV|4.0|Beware!! Spiderman is here stronger than ever!! This movie is a really good transfer of a lot of children's childhood hero to the cinema and that is shown by the box-office success!! Director has picked really good parts of Spiderman's story to include in the motion picture and i think that the choice of the specific actors was really wise... Tobey is exactly the right person to play Spidey as he is around the same age as described in the animated series and is also really natural.I think the actions that Spidey takes in the movie are really demanding, although a lot of computer work has been done, but of course a lot of patience is needed by the actors and that makes the protagonist deserve recognition ! Generally a movie that is worth having! Especially the scene where Peter Parker beats up the \\"handsome\\" of the school is the part that every child would like to watch! Spidey is great and.... BE WARNED! Spiey can throw web and disarm all of you! He is the greatest super-hero ever and this is a fact! Bravo to the producers who decided to make such a good investment! Bravo to the actors and especially to Willem Dafoe who took part in this film! Well done to everyone in the cast and crew! A thrilling movie...for the ones who are original fans os Spiderman!! Keep on with a 2nd movie with more of your adventures Spidey! don't let us down...!
6301763041|5.0|i'm just gonna come right out and say it...i love this movie...i have watched it since i was little and my cousin watched it all the time...people tend to say that it's stupid. but the truth is...it's actually a great movie..they used Depp because he has that James Dean look to him...and even though some people don't believe it...THIS MOVIE HAS A PLOT!it's a semi-realistic look on how things went back then...and i am told that by my friends grandfather..who loves this movie by the way...so in conclusion..i'm just gonna say this...if you don't like the movie..that's ok just don't mess it up for the rest of us with your bad remarks...if you do like it..then you have my mark...- jenks
B000063DI9|5.0|He sido un fan de Iron Maiden desde 1986. Y Seventh son of a seventh son es el mejor album de Maiden desde mi punto de vista.<BR>Canciones como Can I play with Madness?, Moon Child o Infinites Dream y Seventh son of a seventh son los puntos mas altos de este magnifico album.<br />El incluir guitarras sintetizadores, le da al grupo un nuevo aire, muestra una evolucion musical en comparacion the Pieces of Mind o Power Slave. Una lastima que su siguiente album No prayer, no siguieras la evolucion musical de este.
B00005JKCH|2.0|Ok, some of the movie was good, but the story line was really bad. The action scenes were kinda cool but I would have rather seen another movie.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I really did not like the book.  I did, however, enjoy the film.  There is something to be said for a film that stays true to the material on which it is based, and this film is very faithful to the book.  There is also something to be said for a film that manages to be as good or better than the material on which it is based.  So why only 4 stars out of 5?  The film is simply too long ... it could have been cut by 15-30min.  Other than that, no complaints whatsoever, and that is coming from someone who did not like the book.
B000002A46|5.0|&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; is quite possibly the best Christmas album ever recorded.  Mariah's voice is phenominal and it shines like a star on songs like Oh Holy Night (which I never cared for until I heard her version), Hark! The Herald Angel, and Miss You Most.  Then, when thinking of the album, nothing grabs your attention and makes you wanna jump up and scream &quot;Amen!&quot; more than &quot;Jesus What A Wonderful Child.&quot;<BR>The CD is breathtaking.  The power of her voice is amazing.  Get this CD---and while you're at it, get one for your friends...nothing says Christmas like a CD that fills you with the Christmas spirit.
0345357116|5.0|As with all of Tolkiens books, this is one book that any devoted fan must read! Not only will it answer many quetions (although they are relatively simple ones for us lore masters) but it contains, many stories that are in a relatively coplete narrative form. <BR>The first of these, is the tale of Tuor's coming to Gondolin. This is a much longer account of the six page one given in the Silmarillion, and unfortunately stops quite suddenly (however, the rest of the story can be found in the second book of Lost Tales and The Silmarillion).<BR>The second story, in my opinion, should be a book it's self. It is in complete narrative form, from beginning to end (except for one part which, disapointingly, is found only in a more condensed form in the Silmarillion). This is the Narn i hin Hurin, or the Tale of the Children of Hurin (Of Turin Turambar in the Silmarillion). This major portion of the book includes, as do most of the tales, an informative appendix. This is one of my favorite, if not my very favorite tale by Tolkien (Yes, even before Lord of the Rings).<BR>After this, much information considering the Second-Age of Middle-earth is given, including a beautiful tale (Whi about a Numenorean King and his wife, Aldarion and Erendis. Following this, is the history of Galadriel and Celeborn, which includes the trajic yet beautiful tale of Amroth and Nimrodel (Legolas sings a part of this tale in The Fellowship of the Ring). This section also includes the tale of the Disaster on the Gladden Fields and Isildur's death. <BR>Following thit are the tales from the third age which were not included in the Lord of the Rings (or perhaps in less detail). These are mostly just very short stories and notes, yet still they feed your knowledge, and leave it begging for more (and yes, more is available). They include The Oath of Cirion and Eorl (Steward of Gondor and first king of Rohan), Gandalf's account of how he sent the dwarves to Bag End, The Hunt for the Ring (telling of the journey of the Nazgul while they hunted Frodo) and The Battles of the Fords of Isen, telling of the battles of Rohan with the forces of Saruman during the War of the Ring.<BR>The fourth part includes three essays, The Druedain, giving much information on the \\"Wild men of the Woods\\", such as the people of Haleth and the men of Ghan-buri-ghan. The Istari, giving very interesting information on the backround of the five wizards, and how it came to be that they were sent to Middle-earth. The third is several notes and short writings about The Palantiri, the seeing-stones.<br />Having given this book so much praise, I know would say that it should only be read by the serious Tolkien fan, because this is not your ordinary fantasy book, it's a history. Not only that, but it's written in such a way that anyone who has not read The Silmarillion, the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, would be quite confused.<BR>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to feed their knowledge of Middle-earth.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is an excellent album of massive porportions and a must own for any fan of intelligent metal. This may be critized for its &quot;darkness&quot; but for those of you that are tired of the singers who spew forth about relationships and running away this is the right album for u you. Highly Highly Reccomended!!
B000002549|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim and didn't expect much. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. When Barbara Striesand is good, she's divine and on this CD she showed what technique plus talent can do. This is a little jewel of an album.
B00006AW2G|5.0|It's not the best Stones album (that honor still belongs to Beggar's Banquet)nor is their most ambitious (Exile on Main Street)but it still rocks. It's the first Stones album where Mick, Keith and the boys expanded on their sound in a meaningful way. They weren't following leaders (nor were they following parking meters), instead they became the leaders.<br />With the dissolution of The Beatles and the 60's petering out, The Stones came back with album that defined an era and generation. Let It Bleed is as much about the 60's and what really occured as any other concept album by any other band. It's probably more cynical but also more accurate in its depiction of the world. Mick & Keith wrote all the material again but chose, perversely, to re-record Honky Tonk Woman as Country Honk vs. putting it on the album. It was standard practice not to issue (at least in the UK). I enjoy the band tweaking the music industry and themselves with its inclusion on the album.<br />Monkey Man and Midnight Rambler are two of the weakest tracks on the album. Both have their moments but the former tune is all bluster and doesn't really go anywhere. The later tune is a rambling cliche. It apes Sympathy for the Devil without its style or class.<br />The handful of great songs more than makes up for the two ordinary songs. It's not the best Stones album (and, no, Exile doesn't quality for that either) but it's a darn good one.
B00006YXE4|5.0|Perfect set list, perfect audio (2.0 Surround, 5.1 Dolby Digital, and DTS), and perfect video quality and editing.  I bought the CD / DVD combo.  What a deal!!!  Also, I'm a drummer and a huge Steve Gadd fan.  It was really great to see him in Eric's band for this release.  This purchase is a no-brainer.  Even if you're a casual fan, pick this one up today!
0316666343|4.0|This book draws you in and takes you on an emotional ride--you should definitely have your Kleenex on hand.  The novel offers compelling insights into how families deal with grief, but it accomplishes more, it illustrates the complexity of relationships and beauty of life.  It stirs up painful emotion while at the same time being uplifting and inspirational.  The ending feels a bit rushed and contrived, but all and all &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is a very satisfying read. The device of having the narrator speaking from beyond the grave works well, and if you find this compelling, you may also enjoy Alice Walker's book, &quot;By the Light of My Father's Smile&quot; which uses this technique in a different way by telling the story from the point of view of a deceased father who is trying to make up for his misdeeds in life.
B00006V9A0|5.0|... There is only ONE thing to do if you have been waiting for YEARS, like the rest of us, for the release of this album: JUST BUY IT! ... You will NOT be disappointed. It SOUNDS great. ... I have NO idea what kind of mastering magic the great Bob Ludwig may have applied to the original, multi-track, analog, master-tapes of all of these songs ( if he even HAD them to work with! ), but whatever he did ( 24 Bit / 96 kHz - or even higher - sampling rates used to digitally remaster original 2-track stereo mixes, or some other crafty use of precision, studio wizardry? ), it WORKS! These songs JUMP OUT at you, sound fresh and clean, and sing in your head like new-born flowers in Spring! All of these songs - SONICALLY - sound BETTER here than on their original releases. Just listen with superior quality headphones, and you will HEAR what I am talking about. ...<br />... As for the MUSIC itself? ... Man, it ROCKS like an avalanche off Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills during an apocalyptic revenge of the spirit of Crazy Horse! ... I have seen a LOT of bands in my life - but seeing NIRVANA play live in the Fall of 1993 during the IN UTERO tour, at the Fitchburg Civic Center in Fitchburg, Massachusetts with my good buddy and fellow bandmate, Johnny Butler, was one of the greatest thrills of my life. Those guys ROCKED! They were just as good live - if not BETTER - than on record. I can vouch for that with unquestionable certainty. ...<br />... A big, fat THANK YOU to Krist, Dave, and Courtney for putting aside all the political nonsense and allowing this music to be presented to the public in all its raw power and simple beauty. ... The only regret I have, retrospectively, is that IN UTERO was not left alone and untouched and allowed to be released in its entirety the way Steve Albini had originally recorded the band in his sacred and simple way that he had intended on capturing them. They could have always re-mixed the songs later - as they did here for this album - and released the alternate mixes on future BOX SETS, like the one we are all STILL passionately waiting for. In any case, this is absolutely a wonderful, little treat of a Greatest Hits album with the perfect simple title: NIRVANA. ... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kid
B000002AZ8|3.0|First off, allow me to announce this. Upon buying this album and basing it on mixed opioins I bought this as open-minded as humanly possible, and willing to except anything pretty much what this album had to offer, but appearently, that did not happen. If any album of pearl jam's lacked more focus besides binuarl it would be this one. Wile vitology had some of pearl jams most carrer defying songs like corduroy,better man, it also had it's share of filler. It also has it's share of quality rock tunes. So many thoughts to share, and assuringly coming from a pearl jam fan aswell. I have absoltely no problem when a band goes onto new musical rhealms and experiments, but not when the end product come out as a bunch of off key vocals, diss jointed gutar riffs and chord structures. But, not all of vitolgy is as bad, it does make all the filler up with other songs. Songs like \\"not for you\\" \\"last exit\\" that relaxing balad \\"nothing man\\" and one of my favorites \\"corduroy\\" \\"better man\\" \\"whipping\\" and \\"immortallity\\" with it's cool doors vibe to it. Altough \\"hey foxymophandlemama, thats me\\" or aka stupid mop does strangly remind me of tool's third eye. How to give the slightest bit of a helpfull review? well, If you were to be new to pearl jam, I would wait and ease into this one. But who knows, my opioins could change in the future and find some more redeeming qualitys with this album I have not yet found, same thing happend to me with superknown.
B000005HLV|5.0|I own this album yet a long time, but I want to give my opinion because I can't agree with people (black metal fans) who don't give 5 stars to this album. This is one of the best black metal releases ever, along with Battles in the North and Fatherland (Ancient Rites). A must have for everyone who is into black metal, because of the excellent drumming and sic vocals. Attila's vocals are the best I've ever heard, beats Nocturno Culto, Abbath, Varg, ... by far. <BR>TIP: If you like MDS you will also like \\"CURSED AGAIN\\" from FROST .... It's pretty much the same style but quite different. Necro Black lives !
6300216403|5.0|In the 1970s, director, Peter Bogdanovich was at the top of his game contributing a number of classics to that particular golden age of filmmaking. His masterpiece of course was the brilliant movie, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, which deserves all its accolades.But one film, which I do not feel has recieved its proper due, is his wonderful nostalgic comedy, &quot;Paper Moon&quot;.This is among one of the best comedies to come out of the early '70s. &quot;Paper Moon&quot; takes place in the dust bowl Midwest at the height of the 'Great Depression'. Bible salesman/con-artist, Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) stops by the funeral of an old female acquaintance to pay his respects. He is immediatly talked into delivering the deceased women's little girl, Addie, (Tatum O'neal) to an Aunt in Saint Joseph, Mo.This episodic film then becomes a road trip movie. At first Mos' and the precocious, little girl (she smokes and swears) are at logger heads. But soon he discovers that Addie is smart and just as good a con- artist as he is.The two team up together and devise various scams to part a variety of fools with their money. Along the way in their adventures they meet up with crooked cops, bootleggers, grieving widows, gullible store clerks,a carney dancer &amp; her valet and even a family of rasl'n hillbillies. Bogdanovich has created a wonderful nostalgic film that is full of both humor and pathos.We laugh as we watch the cons unfold and the twosome (most of the time) get away with their crimes.But their is also a certain melancholic atmosphere, throughout the movie as Bogdonovich shows us a rural America, which has been descimated by the effects of the dustbowl and the Depression.This is greatly aided and highlighted by Cinematographer, Laszlo Kovacs's brilliantly stark, black &amp; white photography.Kovacs's photograhy shows us both the harshness of the midwest's barren landscapes and the pain indelibly etched into the faces of the inhabitents of this place.The photography along with the costumes, set design and music give this film a really authentic feel for the 1930s era.The acting in this movie is first rate! Father/daughter acting team of Ryan &amp; Tatum O'Neal are  fantastic in their comic screen roles, giving probably the best performances of both their careers.Compliments should also go to actress, Madeline Kahn for her wonderful supporting role as Miss Trixie Delight, a hilarious carney hootchie-koo dancer who runs a bit of a Con of her own. This is a great classic movie of the '70s, which will give you hours of entertainment! I highly recommend it!ong with the costumes, set design and music give this film a really authentic feel for the 1930s era.The acting in this movie is first rate!

B000000WZ4|5.0|I've been a fan for years and absolutely love every song on this CD. It stays in my disc changer and haven't grown tired of it yet. The songs stay with me afterwards &amp; have recognized some played in the TV show La Femme Nikita on the USA network. Ultra is different than the 80's DM CDs, but I love those as well, but enjoy Ultra even more.
B000070IXT|4.0|I've been a huge fan of video game-based movies from \\"Super Mario Bros\\" to \\"Mortal Kombat\\", but I strongly think that \\"Resident Evil\\" is one of the best game-based movies out there.  The monster in the film looks like something from \\"The Relic\\", but without the eyes, and it's absolutely terrifying.  The mutant dogs were pretty graphic too, but just as cool.  The cast (Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriguez) does an excellect job playing members of a commando unit, sent in to investigate a viral outbreak that turned all employees into zombies.  I wonder how the sequel is gonna be like!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is one of the most talented vocalists of the decade.  I was amazed at how much she has growm vocally and by her versitility.  Her neo soul influenced &quot;Loving Me 4 Me&quot; blew me off my feet.  &quot;Beautiful&quot; lives up to its name, simply breath-taking.  &quot;Impossible&quot; is incredible.  I can't express how happy I am glad that Christina is letting her true colors show.  What we saw from Christina up to this point was nothing.  The album is one of the best of the year.  I was thrilled to hear that she realized that &quot;singing&quot; isn't all the runs and vocal relays she did before.  When you are as talented as she is, all of that is totally uncalled for.  She has a beautiful voice that is displayed at its best with live instruments in what I call the musical effort of the year.

B00006LHYC|5.0|From The Inside is a hotshot debut of Italian-born Diva Laura Pausini. The album covers the demographic waterfront, representing every trend from so that anyone can find at least one track to his or her taste. Laura's powerful voice and emotional performance and arrangemets make From The Inside a great album, full of very good songs from '70 Rock, to Pop, from R&B to Latin, Laura always hits. This album is simply from the inside...
1586210912|5.0|I have been a CPA and an investor for some time and it always amazes me how people can be offended by, in this case, an author, explaining the simple concept of financial literacy. The book was written for people who want to understand why they are killing themselves in a system where they have not been taught the correct economic rules of the game.  It also proves his point relating to how many individuals have been conditioned into believing that traditional ways of investing are safe.  Mutual funds, 401K's and the like are some of the riskiest investments around.  Have you ever wondered why banks will not lend you money to buy Mutual Funds?  Kiyosaki's simple, yet effective message should be taught from the 4th grade forward. In a world where the state confiscates close to 50% of your income before you see it and the value of money is based on paper and consumer confidence, educating our kids about finacial literacy should be top priority.  Being jealous of Mr. Kiyosaki for selling millions of books only shows one's small mindedness.
B000002KCF|5.0|In 1973 Michael recorded an album on an independant label and had a minor hit from that album titled &quot;Can't Seem To Shake This Rock And Roll.&quot;  The song marked time, it features a killer wah wah guitar solo.  The album lacks direction and formula; it makes for an interesting study of Michael and creates a bigger sense of awe when listening to &quot;Art Of Tea.&quot;  Each album couldn't be more different than the other. Where Michael penned and performed songs reminiscent of Folk storytellers Cat Stevens and Harry Chapin on his debut, &quot;Art Of Tea&quot; has a musical cohesiveness to it, along with Michael's play on words lyric.  &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot; has become Michael's signature tune and his most covered by other artists. Next to his original, my favorite version has to be the one cooed by Diana Krall. &quot;Eggplant&quot; is another one of my favorites, along with the ballad &quot;Mr. Blue.&quot; The entire album, as previously mentioned, was recorded live in the studio; something not done these days by too many artists and if a live recording is done usually it's just one or two songs with a rhythm section and vocal. The cd qualty is unsurpassed, makes me wish all of Michael's albums up to 1990 were mastered this well. After this album Michael took a musical turn to Brazilian pop/jazz, so if Michael is new to a listener, I'd start with his &quot;Backwards Glance&quot; disc to get an overview, then build a collection starting here.
1577311523|4.0|The idea is simple yet immensely powerful. Living in the \\"Now\\", the \\"present\\". I've tried, and yes a lot of life's problems can be solved. If God gave us messages, this message would be one of them. On the other hand, maybe it was God who made Mr. Tolle give this message to us. It is so true and so powerful. However, this book would be even more powerful if it was half the length it currently is, and if it was written more simply. The message itself attains its power from its simplicity, so why not make the delivery of the message as simple as possible too? That is why I have suggested Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch in addition or insetad of this book which contains such powerful messages in such a simplistic voice which is the sign of a Godly message. As a sidenote: I am very impressed by Mr. Tolle's powerful experience that led him from suffering to where he is today. It truly helped me understand what he meant in the book.
0446608955|5.0|Landon was an average boy in high school. Landon Carter was best friends with the most popular guy in school. He lived a good life, until one day in drama class he was picked as the lead in a school play. Landon never wanted to take the lead role but he had no choice. The nicest, sweetest girl in school, Jamie Sullivan, asked him to take part in the play...and although he did not know those features about her yet he chose to participate.<BR>Jamie was not the normal, average girl. Jamie was special in many different ways. She was the daughter of the town's Baptist priest; she carried the bible around everywhere she went; she did not care about her outside appearance, she wore the same sweater everyday, wore her hair up everyday, she also helped everybody who needed help. Every month Jamie would go to an orphanage to help out, she would raise money for the children. These characteristics are what made Jamie stand out from all the rest of the children. One characteristic that stood out the most was that Jamie had been diagnosed with Leukemia, although nobody knew. <BR>   Jamie and Landon met while doing the play and they fell in love. Jamie finally told Landon, and the town about her illness. They had the sweetest love until, Jamie finally passed away. Before doing so Landon had proposed to her and they got married by her father. Landon loved her then and always will love her.<BR>   This book was a very romantic love story. One word to describe it would be \\"bittersweet\\". This novel was bittersweet because it was such a sweet love story but sometimes in the novel was bitter because it was so sad to see what happened to Jamie because she was the sweetest girl.
B00003CXQX|4.0|Emperor's new groove is a break from the traditional Disney animated features. This movie is more like the studios animated shorts. &quot;The Emperor's new groove&quot; is a fast paced slapstick movie about a vain emperor, named cuzco, who is turned into a Llama by two servants. He recieves help from a large kind hearted peasant named pacha in returning him back to human form. The movie is pure silly and never takes itself seriously.
6305537321|5.0|i absolutely loved this movie. the era, clothes, furnishings were fabulous. the characterizations were very interesting and kept getting better as the movie went on. my favorite scene was the party scene. it was non-stop drinking, action, and lots of goofing off. would love to have been there.
B0000542D2|5.0|Well, I'm from mexico, and then may be my english isn't so well, but I will Try to give you my opinion about this DVD.<BR>I think is so great. We had to wait a lot of time before it. And the sound I think is not too bad. Is very well, may the person who said the sound is bad. Don't Really like the beatles music, I really enjoy watching this Movie.<BR>We spend our money in other kind of dvds about beatles, and prefe spend in this. You won't be wrong.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I just love this new cd by Johnny Cash. It is a perfect cd to enjoy the music, the lyrics and his voice! Though you can hear that his voice is getting somewhat weaker, this makes his music all the more pure and fragile. The 15 songs are all 15 very different. My favorite songs are Bridge over troubled water and Danny Boy. This CD is a must have for any Johnny Cash fan, but if you're open to listening to a good cover this CD can also be a very nice surprise!
6303471714|5.0|I bought this video when it first came out and absolutely loved it.  I used it for 3 months and actually saw definition in my stomach muscles!  I really liked the music and found the length and pace of the tape to be motivating.  I liked this video so much I lent it to a friend.  Unfortunately, she never returned it.  Now, after having two kids, I want to get back into shape and have tried some of my other tapes without any satisfaction.  I am going to buy this video again right now!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie since I saw it at the theater, then again when it came on TV years ago (am I showing my age yet?)<br />My kids had heard about it and even saw some of my old ET toys (I collect toys, comics &amp; music) and asked me a thousand questions about it. Once they finally got to see the entire movie, (the original and the edited version) they loved it. The edited version was much better for abo 95% of the movie, but for a few scenes, you could tell that they REALLY edited ET's movements a tad too much. Either way, I would highly recommend this movie, as it's a classic. (My youngest son LOVED when YODA appeared while the kids and ET were walking in costume/halloween!)
6303942830|5.0|The best part of the movie is when Lewis has to leave Stowe because they will all be captured and all killed so he is forced to abandon her.  He turns to her and tells her \\"Whatever you do, stay alive!\\" More powerful than telling her I love you, more powerful than any passionate proposal.  The compelling part of the film is the chase and running of the film and the complex racial and political issues.  This is a terrific film, its an excellent interpretation of the book and a great film to boot.<BR>Madeline Stowe, as always is a beautiful, compelling actress who uses her abilities of both beauty, strength and compelling emotion to the Nth degree here.  This film first turned me on to them and while Lewis got an Oscar, Stowe has yet to receive hers but she deserves one as well.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|My kids really liked the movie, as well as all the games and additional scenes, etc that came with the 2nd DVD. I can highly recommend this movie (and contrary to what you hear about disney putting hidden sexual subliminal messages, I saw - or didn't see - nothing.  Either way, it's a really nice movie for kids. Just be warned, the younger kids (under 3) might get scared by a few scenes with the beast.
B000055QBX|5.0|Dear Readers,<BR>    I know that At The Drive In is one of the greatest bands ever.  But you are sopposed to rate an album on how that album is not comparisins to its counterpart just because of the price.  I myself would not buy it for 30 or 40 dollers, but please rate the way you are suppost to.  Thank you for your time, Have a good day.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a GREAT Movie! I HIGHLY recommend it to EVERYONE!  This movie is just hilarious. My kids love the Profiles, the games, the additional scenes, the online games, etc. I just can't priase this movie anymore than I already have. It's a great film! BUY IT!
B00005M4JS|4.0|This is a very good movie. I got to see a conflict between Vivien the chocolat making lady and the officials in the small town. The mayor is strongly opposing her presence and business in town. So he tries by all means to find a way that can make the community to hate her too. Since majority of the people are strongly Catholic religious, he influences the priest to preach that Satan will come to them in a form of chocolat. By so doing, driving the customers away. Even though she is been hated by almost all in town, Vivien continues to love everybody the same way.<br />There is also Josephine`s abusive husband, who takes hide from alcohol. After a series of abuse, Josephine found refuge in Vivien`s house and help her with the chocolat making. <br />Overall, the chocolat brings everybody together.
6302752337|5.0|this is the most real movie about hippidom (is that a word?) you will ever see. yea, it has great scenery, great tunes, and an interesting plot, but the reason the movie is so great is that everything is so REAL! every time they smoke up, its real weed. even alot of the actors were pulled off the street. there were no sets, they shot as they travelled. i dont see how people can enjoy movies like \\"half baked\\" and yet havent even heard of this one. it was just a few stoner hippie film makers with a limited budget who put this on, not big budget hollywood with their fancy special effects that work against realism in films. and the persecution of these men who just wanted to be free reveals alot about human nature<br />i dont think there was ever a better film or even book made about the 60's counterculture<br />a work of art
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is more than i expected. She really knows how to sing and she shows her vocal range. There is a little bit of everything for everyone!...
B00006NSGX|4.0|The first live album since Unplugged, Clapton really delivers.  I have not been 100% favorable to the superflash production work on his latest albums, and it is quite refreshing to hear the best songs from those albums stripped down (almost) and live.  The live sound, while not overproduced studio, is very full and vibrant showcasing some great musicianship.  All the songs get some creative reworking and come to life in a new way on this album.  Don't miss out, you'll regret it!!
B000065U1N|4.0|...  Black Hawk Down contains some of the most intense combat ever captured on film.  Imagine the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, where they land on Omaha Beach, now imagine it lasting for two hours.  This is the best way to describe Black Hawk Down.<br />The events of the story, which are sketchy in the film, are based on actual events that occured in Somalia when a sting opperation by U.S. Rangers went extremely wrong.  To be honest, the events are not important.  Apparently the filmmakers agreed, there is very little development of the sory or the characters leading up to the action.  This can be confusing at times, but I think it also serves the film.  The question could be raised in general, what were we doing there?  The film opens with some shocking images of the face of war, innocent victims, but this gets sort of lost.  Despite it's weaknesses Black Hawk Down is a powerful film. It is a film about battle.  And man is it amazing.  I could try to describe it, but no words can do Ridley Scott's team justice.  It must be seen.<br />...  There are a lot of characters in this film and often it is difficult to tell who's who, but that is the point.  There is another scene in the film in which Tom Sizemore's character radios in a message to Sam Shepard, the general, that a dead pilot is wedged in the wreckage of his chopper.  \\"No one gets left behind,\\" says Shepard despite the fact the men are still taking fire from gorilla gunmen. In war it doesn't matter which guy is which, they are all the same guy.  They are brothers in arms.  Each death is equally traggic, even if an audience can't decipher who it was.
B00006L83N|5.0|I thought like this, V was incredible.There's nothing in this world that this guys can do to top that one. And then came The Odyssey. How can I even begin to describe how great this is. It's just amazing how great the music on this cd is. Being blown away just doesn't describe the feeling enough. I won't waste my words on describing the greatness of musicianship as we all know that when it comes to Symphony X it's always at highest level and beyond. About the songs I will say just one thing: Accolade II. It's got to be, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest songs ever from any band and not just Symphony X (and it's a sequel :) ) . Now don't get me wrong, other songs are also great especially the jaw-dropping title track, Wicked and King Of Terrors (again it's just my opinion) but Accolade II stands out. It practically shines out from the cd :) . At the end of this review I can say only one thing that it's now official: Symphony X are the greatest band today. This is turning out to be one of the greatest years in music ever. It all started with DT's Six Degrees earlier this year through new Vanden Plas, Star One, Blind Guardian, Spock's Beard, Threshold, Porcupine Tree (sorry if I forgot someone :)) and now Symphony X, I couldn't imagine a better way to close this year. Go out and buy this now. In fact go out and buy more copies because you will soon wear out your first copy :) .
B00006CXXU|5.0|I liked Lane23's idea on giving an Individual comment on each song and i will proceed with doing so... (not including the intro's and interludes.)<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down..I love this song. Excellent lyrics that our really true. The part with Lil' Kim is the only part of the song i don't like. 8 stars / 10<br />3.Walk Away.. this is truly a good song. Christina overdoes it a little but the words are amazing. 8 stars / 10<br />4. Fighter.. just like most of the songs on this album the words are amazing. I love the little part near the end very suave. 8 stars / 10<br />6. Infatuation.. I'm not big on this song but i still like it quite a bit. The latin flavor is a very nice addition. 7 /10<BR> <BR>8. Loving Me 4 Me.. ehhh. Christina tries out alot of new things on this album and this particular singing voice she uses in this song i don't like. 6/10<br />9. Impossible..Nice work Ms. Keys. I love her part in this song. I'm giving props to Christina as well, however i don't like the words to this song. The word Impossible is said about 100 times. 6.5/10<br />10. Underapperciated.. this song doesn't stick. I mean while I am listening I am enjoying it...but is like the only song can not remember unless i listen again. 6/10<br />11. Beautiful.. And the album gets a hell of alot better then you could have thought from this point on. This song is my favorite song on the album. This song is so beautiful! 10 / 10<br />12.Makeover.. Another new thing from Christina but she gets it perfect. I love this song's edge and music. Christina's voice in this song is cool! <lol>. 10/10<br />13.Cruz.. Wow this song is great. I can idenify with the wrods and Christina's voice on this song is in tip top shape!! 10/10<br />14.Soar.. Christina gets a vocal Workout and it was a damn good one. touching words wrapped with Xtina's voice makes this a great song. 9/10<br />15.Get Mine get Yours.. Sexy lyrics. Makes you think back on your crushes and wonder if you ever felt this way. 9/10<br />16.Dirrty.. I know alot of people don't like this song but, hey I do. I don't know what it is. Its very very catchy and i have adopted it as one of my favs. 8.5/10<br />18. The Voice Within.. Wow she sounds really good on this one. Great words..a lil similar to Soar but it has a totally dif. sound. 9/10<br />19 I'm Ok.. Everyone knows this song is touching. The emotion i hear in her voice lets me know that she is 4 real. No other way to say it then..10/10<br />20. Keep On singin my song.. A great end to a excellent cd. Great lyrics and near the end Christina hits the most amazing note...so listen for it. Also listen for the hidden outro in this song. 9.5/10<br />*Overall I give this cd a 9. Christina is true in all her lyrics and the deliverance is a show stopper for sure. Christina finally coming out of her shell to reveal her real self is a beautiful thing. I can't wait to hear what's next
0060977493|1.0|Readers were enthralled by this Kindergarten book, just because it won the Booker Prize, run by SHOPKEEPERS. The language used is absolutely childish and maybe readers understand abused usage of English lingo. I would say, and I know that Booker Prize is very controversial. There is one South African Writer who keeps getting this politicized so called prize. Anyway she failed as a screenwriter and learned the ropes of getting a Booker and in the process made her a millionare. I'm sorry even Kindergarten kids laugh at the sentence structure, syntax, world play---which one reviewer calls &quot;Jazzy&quot;.It sure is Jazzy as no good writer can write so badly.
B000063CMK|5.0|this album is one of the best releases of the year and decade, is brilliant, and has everything that a prog album should have, but to my opinion the best part of remedy lane is the forth track A trace of blood, it´s overwhelming, and i think is one of the greatest songs ever... but right now a question emerges: Is remedy lane a better album than the Perfect element? .... maybe<br />this is a must for everyone who loves progressive rock
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this movie and the special features on the DVD are out of this world (I highly reccommend the &quot;Work in progress&quot; version of the film...amazing).  The one thing that bothers me is that somewhere in the high-definition digital transfer, the original richness and vibrancy was lost.  The colors in this DVD edition seem to be muted and rather lackluster compared to my original VHS copy.  If you've seen the original, you'll know what I mean.  The limited pallette is really my only complaint for this DVD edition.  All the fabulous extras make up for it.
B00005JGAF|5.0|You need the albulm, in some form or other.  On this, the third of the first four classic Ramones albulms, every minute is relentless early guitar punk brilliance.<br />But choosing between this Rhino re-issue and \\"All the Stuff (And More) Vol. 2\\" is going to be difficult for first-time buyers.  The re-mastering available here highlights some craftsmanship in \\"Rockaway Beach\\", \\"Sheena...\\", and other tracks that careful listeners will appreciate.  Older fans might be surprised to hear \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Well\\" almost foreshadowing the uberproduced \\"End of the Century\\".  Is this able remastering a worthy exchange for \\"All the Stuff... 2\\", which contains the entirety of \\"Road to Ruin\\" (the fourth albulm)?<br />The best of the 'bonus tracks' on this albulm, \\"Slug (Demo)\\", is also available on \\"All the Stuff... 2\\", which makes it even more difficult to recommend this release over the earlier two-albulm collection.  The booklet, with its touching Arturo Vega salute to Joey Ramone, certainly cannot contribute that much to this release's value, although it's up to Rhino's excellent standard of producing breathless nostalgia-laden hymns to the artists they clearly love as much as we do.<br />In the end, I'm forced to say that \\"All the Stuff... 2\\" is the better buy for most.  Truly dedicated fans will, however, want to pick up this albulm for the remastered quality and the four previously unreleased/unavailable tracks.
B00006F7XJ|4.0|As has been the norm in the last three Camel records (Dust and Dreams, Harbour of Tears and Rajaz), Nod &amp; A Wink is that type of record that you can place in your cd player and enjoy from beginning to end. You don`t feel the urge to star skipping songs, as I often  do with many others &quot;concept&quot; albums like, for example, the last Spock`s Beard record, &quot;Snow&quot;. I find very difficult to decide which of the formentioned Camel record is the best, due to Andy Latimer`s consistency in producing beautiful, envolving and rythmically challenging music that had to please any fan of good progressive music. My only little complaints in this record are the abscence of keyboardist Ton Scherpenzeel. His keyboard playing and selection of synthezisers sounds for Rajaz were simply beautiful and stunning. The actual keyboard player was too laidback and almost unnoticed.  Also, to my ears, the voice of Andy Latimer is losing clarity. I always had thought that, with another singer, Camel music could go to another level (that`s why I gave four stars, instead of five). But don`t let my opinion in these matters stop you from getting this record. You will enjoy it, as a said, from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Alright, I dont write many reviews but as soon as I saw this album fall to four and a half stars, I felt it was my duty to take action. Its appaling to me that an album of this enourmous magnitude and genieus cannot reach the five star plateau.I can't stand the fact that indie music fans, sick of this album's hype, are willing to rate it so poorly knowing well how great it is.<BR>Simply, this album was my personal renaissance. I didn't really enjoy listening to radio or buying cd's, but when I heard this cd I was so moved that it led to a renewed interest in music. Now, I can't stop exploring new artists and expanding my musical horizons, and I owe it all to this album. If you haven't heard this album or any other of Radiohead's works, then you owe it to yourself to go pick it up or at least give it a few listens. Thanks.
B00006F7XJ|4.0|As has been the norm in the last three Camel records (Dust and Dreams, Harbour of Tears and Rajaz), Nod &amp; A Wink is that type of record that you can place in your cd player and enjoy from beginning to end. You don`s feel the urge to star skipping songs, as often I do with many others &quot;concept&quot; albums like, for example, the last Spock`s Beard record, &quot;Snow&quot;. For me, is very difficult to decide which of the formentioned Camel record is the best, due to Andy Latimer`s consistency in producing beatiful, envolving and rythmically challenging music that had to please any fan of good progressive music. My only little complaints in this record are the abscence of keyboardist Ton Scherpenzeel. His keyboard playing and selection of synthezisers in Rajaz was simply, beautiful and stunning. The actual keyboard player was too laidback and almost unnoticed.  Also, to my ears, the voice of Andy Latimer is losing clarity. I allways think that a selection of another singer could take Camel music to another level (that`s why I gave four stars, instead of five). But don`t let my opinion in these matters stop you from getting this record. You will enjoy it, as a said, from beginning to end. Highly recommended.
B000069HKH|5.0|\\"The Rising\\" is nothing less than an enduring interpretation in musical lyric of a pivotal moment in world history, a new age inaugerated by it, and what it means to be alive now.<br />\\"The Rising\\" is at once intimately personal, deeply reflective, and globally balanced in its lyrics and music.  It conveys at the same moment, penetrating anguish and inexhaustible hope for the world to come.  The hope conveyed is not something cheap or easily won. It is something that demands to be seen honestly, through pain and through a glass darkly. Yet even so, is affirmed as a bottom line resource, eternally relevant to the human condition. <br />\\"The Rising\\" is lyrically articulate in its existential anguish, most directly portrayed perhaps in \\"Empty Skies\\" and \\"You're Missing.\\" At the same time, it is precisely through the life path of this existential anguish and uncertainty that \\"The Rising\\" conveys a deeply spiritual sense, or intimate sense of \\"something more.\\"  At the same time, \\"The Rising\\" never preaches and in spite of the hard contemporary realities it addresses, is in the last analysis, playful. We see this poignant interweaving, for example, in the lyrics, \\"Lord, as I stand before your fiery light, I see you Mary in the Garden, In the garden of a thousand sighs, There's holy pictures, Of our children, Dancin' in a sky filled with light, May I feel your arms around me, May I feel your blood mix with mine, A dream of life comes to me, Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line.\\"  <br />Bruce Springsteen's appeal to renewal of the human spirit is not new something new to this album. It's always been there in the face of hardships, as in \\"Badlands,\\" \\"This Hard Land,\\" \\"Living Proof,\\" or \\"Land of Hope and Dreams,\\" for example. But the contemporary harshness of life, and hope in spite of it all, takes on a special poignancy here.  Springsteen's lyric's of prayer for faith in \\"My City or Ruins\\" may be unprecedented in his writings for their persistence and insistence.  Yet, what now seem clear, is that any of his work may ultimately be incomprehensible apart from faith, hope, and love -- not in some abstract form -- but as a meaningful search amidst the pain, injustice, and concrete messiness of life.  <br />The mood of \\"The Rising\\" ranges widely from a deeply appreciative anguish for our new American heroes, those who ran \\"Into the Fire,\\" to finding relief from the pain through deeply intimate passion in \\"The Fuse,\\" to starting again in \\"Skin to Skin,\\" to a hard-won rather than simply naieve light-heartedness, particularly appropriate for a post 9/11 world, portrayed in \\"Waitin' On a Sunny Day\\" and \\"Mary's Place.\\"<br />For what it's worth to new listeners, I'd have begun and I always listen to this album by leading off with its quietest piece, \\"Paradise.\\"  No song does a better job of setting context and mood, and in no song does the power of the lyrics come through more simply and directly than in this clear, plaintive, and in the end, uplifting lyric.  It's a beautiful lead-in to \\"My City of Ruins.\\"  I then like to let the CD continue at its beginning with \\"Lonesome Day\\" and to ease through each of the powerful pieces on this album, taking one on a journey from despair and dashed hopes to spiritual depths and everyday joys.  You will probably find your own way of listening.  More than an album, I recommend \\"The Rising\\" as an uplifting and enduring work of art.

B000002BHE|5.0|Celine shines with her unique set of pipes on this CD. Frankly in pop music, she is a circle of one.<br />All the songs on this disc are single worthy and not over-produced as would be expected considering Dion's success to date.<br />She worked hard to get to this point in her career. Her talent and voice prove she deserves it!
6305358567|4.0|Even if the movie is not very accurate from the true story of Elizabeth I it's still a wonderful movie to watch, just for the beautiful costumes and atmosphere.The performance of Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth is great, she go threw the young, fragile girl to become one of the most powerful woman in England.All the actors are very good in this movie!
B000031XCR|5.0|I love this cd!!! I play it over and over again. Why does an artist put out a 'best of'? For those of us who want to hear a greatest hits package!<br />I have news for the naysayers...we are legion!
B00005NB8K|5.0|\\"The Doors\\" is the greatest of all rock movies, in the years since it was first released in 1991 it has gained a weird kind of cult status, it is popular among young rockers and teenagers as it is among the adults who belong to the generation first grabbed by \\"Light My Fire.\\" The film is directed by cinema madman and virtuoso, Oliver Stone, who was a Doors fan when serving in Vietnam and here conceives a movie that is big in scope and excess, in other words, it stays true to the spirit of it's subject. People (including Doors organist Ray Manzarek) have attacked Stone and movie for dramatic license and fictional inventions, but the Morrison myth has grown so large that it is hard to even trust the accounts of people like Manzarek (who enjoys pouring gasoline into the myth's fire) and so the movie should be taken for what it is, a MOVIE. And man, it is one of the great rock spectacles ever dramatized on film. Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance, dressed in the black leather pants and long hair, he gives a stunning performance because we never doubt it is Jim Morrison dancing around on the screen, the effect is even more enhanced because Kilmer sang most of the concert scenes (in the DVD commentary, Stone informs us Kilmer sang ALL of the 1969 Miami concert sequence) and as a performer, he has a pretty good voice. The movie captures not only the madness of Morrison, but also the atmosphere and lore of his music. The movie uses no score, it imploys the Doors songs to create the mood (while squeezing in \\"Venus In Furs\\" by Velvet Underground and the classic opus \\"Carmina Burana\\"). There are moments of insansity and excess that create a hypnotic intensity driven by the rich, dreamy photography by Robert Richardson, and there are even, amidst the sex, drugs and rock n' roll, some moments of romantic sweetness in a poetic way when Morrison rhymes for his girl Pamela Courson (played by Meg Ryan). Stone used completely live audiences for the concert sequences, which areexhilarating and stunning, especially a gothic sequence in San Francisco when the band performs \\"Not To Touch The Earth.\\" Any Doors fan will love this film, especially since the soundtrack, featuring all the greats like \\"Break On Through,\\" \\"Backdoor Man,\\" \\"Light My Fire,\\" \\"Strange Days,\\" \\"The Crystal Ship\\" and \\"Five To One\\" pulses with the Doors sound, and hearing Kilmer deliver his own performances is a treat no Doors afficionado or rock enthusiast should miss. \\"The Doors\\" is thrilling, hypnotic and a fiery experience of great rock n' roll.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes blew me away...so lyrical, so funny, so brutally honest!<br />I've loved debating with people who've told me, \\"enough with the whining already McCourt.\\" Get a grip...if this is whining, give me more Mr. McCourt!<br />It was inspiring, descriptive, captivating. A delight from start to finish.<br />Daring. McCourt created his original style of writing. We need more of you to lead the way!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love Christina's new album \\"Stripped\\"!  It is exactly what I wanted her to do...grow up and sing about real, personal issues.  You can tell, by listening to her new CD, that there's a lot more too her than a nice body and good hair (something Britney gets way too much credit for!).  Perhaps other singers should try Christina's approach w/ a little more talent and a lot less worrying about their image and what other people think.  I haven't taken this album out of my CD player since the day I bought it.  I love every track!
B000021YQV|2.0|I bought this release based on the merits of the two singles which made the airwaves.  When I first heard them I was psyched that here was a band with a great new sound that was powerful, raw, and original in a world of mediocrity.<br />Then the CD came.  Boo.<br />Aside from the two singles the rest of the album delivers the same old same old... yelling and screaming about injustices in the world and overcrowded prisons and displaced youth, blah, blah blah.  I couldn't tell where one song ended and the next began.  Look, if these guys ever did spend time in an overcrowded prison or got hit with rubber bullets, then I'll raise the rating.. or maybe if they reveal that half their record sales from their record deal go to amnesty intl. then OK they get a four out of five.  But c'mon.... Rage Against the Machine did this already.  We don't need anymore preaching guys, let alone screaming nonsense about the government.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Jerry Bruckheimer is the worst name to put next to any film.  Aside from Joel Shummacher that is.  I saw this film 4 years ago except it was based on a meteor almost crashing into earth.  This must be a sequel to that movie except instead of taking place in space it takes place in Pearl Harbor.  Let's see....something major takes place meanwhile Ben Affleck is kissing some girl before he heads off into some hero mission.  We think that he's gone during the movie but winds up showing up in the end to get the girl.  Now I don't know what those men and women who died during that attack did but I don't think they deserve such a kick in the face.  Personally I'd rather be mugged on the street than have to sit through this film again.  Ben Affleck is turning himself into nothing more than a piece of meat on film.  This film takes the last 45 minutes to show the attacks.  HELLO?!?!  Isn't that what the film is supposed to be about? Not some weak love story that only a trained ape can come up with. I guess the butchers who came up with the concept must have forgotten what the story was supposed to be about.  Either way I learned after Armageddon (or Pearl Harbor Part 1) that I should stay away with anything related to the name Bruckheimer.  He makes film for the truly stupid.... If you like sap.. Own this film, if you like dribble...Own this film.... If you have the I.Q. of tree bark...Own this film, if you need a door stop for that pesky door that keeps on closing... You definitely need to own this film.  I've seen better acting from a pair of shoes.<BR>Maybe this Joker will produce a movie on WW1 and we can call it Armageddon 3 and Bruce Willis can come back as a man saving this country by drilling a hole in the enemies land.  Lord help us.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|First of all, let me say that a lot  of what Eminem raps about is trash.  Some of it is just ... disgusting.  However, I own all three of his albums as well as this soundtrack because what he says doesn't take away from the fact that Em is a creative genius.  He does what no one else can do, and the funny thing is, he's white.  No one ever expected the next big thing in rap to be a white guy.  It sure as hell surprised me anyway.  I can't get enough of Eminem.  I simply love his music.  Mostly, I tend to stay away from rap because I'm usually not drawn into the lyrics or what the rapper is trying to say.  And how many records can you hear about some guy who likes money, women, drugs and SUV's? Seriously, they all start to sound the same after awhile.  Eminem is different though.  His lyrics are engrossing, even if they evoke feelings of revulsion in you, you cant tear yourself away.  That, to me, is a sign of genius.  Of course, the other artists on this disc blew me away too, hence the five out of five rating.  Go buy this album, as it is with all of Eminems work, its pretty damn good.
0312243022|4.0|Three women from different eras share the commonality of the female of the species.  Book editor Mrs. Clarissa Vaughan, nicknamed &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;, struggles between her professional life and her personal life in modern day New York as she plans a gala event for a friend.  In 1923, Mrs. Virginia Woolf begins writing her novel Mrs. Dalloway, but by 1941 the specter of war leaves her distraught and thinking suicide.  A decade later, California housewife Mrs. Laura Brown reads Woolf's classic Mrs. Dalloway as she wonders is that al there is to life at least with her perfect family.  These three women from different ages of the twentieth century that share much in common as they encounter a haunting tedious existence as the mainstay of their daily living.<br /><br />Rotating points of view, Michael Cunningham provides an interesting look at historical parallelism focusing on the more things change, the more they remain the same.  The three women are clearly the keys to this tale.  The two fictionalized protagonists cleverly persuade the readers to believe that they were just as real as Mrs. Woolf was.  Though some passages seem winded, fans of deep character studies will feel that THE HOURS is the Holy Grail of the sub-genre with its insightful yet compassionate look at three women through their stories that interact yet stand alone as reflections on their lives.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B000001ES9|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Rush per say. I've always respected them and I've enjoyed some of their work, but I could never really get into them. Prog-rock is a good genre in my opinion, but I've never really been able to get into it. I'm just a metalhead at heart, so this album is perfect for me. The musicianship by the legendary Lee and Lifeson is still top notch here (when isn't it?) and I actually ENJOYED Lee's vocals rather than just listen in spite of them. The drummer is also quite good. If you're a fan of prog rock, this album may disappoint you and, yes they do sound a little like Led Zepplin clones, but even Rush's 1974 debute demonstrates plenty of creativity on the part of its members. If you like straight up hard rock, you really ought to pick up this little known gem.
B00006L9ZT|4.0|Just in case anyone is unclear as to the content of this set (at the time of writing this, there were no technical details or official reviews here), the performances are from the June 1990 PBS broadcast from the Met, using their 'traditional' Ring staging.  These have previously been released on laserdisc and VHS.
0316286443|5.0|I bought this as my very first book about make-up. I already new the basic techiniques as I am slowly trying to master this art. I found &quot;FaceForward&quot; to be very interesting and I definitely learnt many new things. Kevyn Aucoin was definitely a forerunner of make-up and he was one of many who made this an art. <br />I am sure that this book will continue to be of help to me even in my future studies.
0395645662|4.0|The Giver is a very good book.  No, a realy good book.  I loved it.  It kept me wondering, I would try to guess what would happen next.  Things that kept on appering in my head were questions such as: what exacly does this mean? it might be a lie!  whas this right or wrong?  could it be better?  The Giver is a very exiting book that kept me on my toes.  The story is about a boy named Jonas who was chosen to hold all the memories of the past for his community.  His community is a town were everyone is the same.  However that doesn't mean that they just are all equal.  They had the same of everything, same school every thing in their lives were the same.  People got assigned jobs at 12 and were given every thing they needed.  There were strict rules such as 1 boy and 1 girl per family.  They didn't even have their own kids they had to apply for them and like \\"UPS\\" would deliver them to your house which was exacly like everyone elses. Anyway, I didn't like the ending.  It just sudenly ended. Jonas ran away!
B00006CXSS|5.0|No matter your feelings on war, and the settling of conflict through military might, this is one of the most important pieces of film to ever be produced.  At a time when the brave men and women of the greatest generation are quickly dying off, this production stepped in to ensure that their sacrifices and contributions to peace are never forgotten.<br />Unlike Pearl Harbor which was overly romanticized, and the Thin Red Line which was little more than a collection of cameos by major stars in a vain attempt to emulate Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers takes a collection of relatively unknown talent and tells the story of one group of soldiers through the European campaign.  The fact that the actors are relatively unknown allows you to focus on the story and see them as the characters they protray rather than Hollywood marquee actors playing their latest role and attempting to live up to their own hype.<br />While this collection is expensive, it is a small price to pay to ensure that children of today are well versed in this important period of history, especially since they are not getting it in their schools.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I loved this film when I heard Russel Crowe say \\"on my singal unleash hell.\\"  This movie for me was fun.  I enjoyed seeing the rise and fall and rise of Maximus the great.  The whole time I was hoping that he would evenge the death of his family and kill Commodus.  It showed the strength of the human spirit and a man with a good soul will be able to be at peace with himself in the end of the day as Maximus was when he was dying.  The only criticism people have of this film was that was not historically accurate.  I am not one of those cinema fans who expect movies to be exactly accurate.  My God it is an entertaing movie and with a great plot.  If you want to know about the history of Rome for historical accuracy read a book.  Some people watch movies for messages, I on the other hand watch movies to be entertained!
1567184855|1.0|If you are interested in understanding what it is like &quot;in between&quot; one life and the next, this is the book to read. There are several good books on the subject, and this is certainly one of them and a &quot;must read&quot;.<br />As soon as his next book &quot;Destiny of Souls&quot; was published I read it with anticipation. I was pleased with the continuation of Dr. Newton's recount of many of his patient regressions.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I know that people have loved this film or hated this film.  There seems to be no middle ground.  I personally loved this film.  I enjoyed every moment of David's journey through the human world.  Throughout the whole film it gave me many thought provoking questions.  What makes a person human?  Is man going to be build technology which will ultimately be his own downfall in the end???  The question posed to the audience by this film was how can love?  Haely Joel Osment was robbed of an oscar for his performance in this film.  He is by far the best child actor, better than many adult actors also.  I get annoyed by people who bad mouth this film, if you didn't understand that is one thing, but making a bad comment about something you do not understand is stupid, oh well ignorance is bliss for a lot of people!
B00006IUL7|1.0|I was trilled when this movie came out to rent because I had wanted to see it. I mean, it had Al Pacino and Robin Williams in it, so it had to be great, right? Well, after watching it I was wrong. This movie was totally predictable from the start, and had the same basic plot that I have seen in 40 other movies. I guess that my one star rating might be extreme, but the plot did [was bad]! I guess it might be worth watching just to see Robin Williams in a role that is non-comedic, but as to buying this movie?? I suggest going and renting it for $$$ and buying something else.
B000001FS3|5.0|The Joshua Tree is undoubtedly a classic, and it represents the culmination of an era for U2, who took an entirely new direction with their next CD, Achtung Baby. Regardless of which U2 sound you prefer, if you don't already have The Joshua Tree, I strongly recommend you get it. The songs are very powerful, highly accomplished both musically and lyrically, and the CD has an overall sound that's really tough to to beat. There isn't a single song on it, in fact, that isn't impressive.<br />The CD starts off with the exhilarating &quot;Where the Street Have No Name,&quot; one of my all-time favorites. If, for some reason, you haven't already heard this song, it is worth buying this CD just to hear it. Next up is &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; followed by the slow, beautiful sound of &quot;With Or Without You&quot; and the more political, angry &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky.&quot; After that is &quot;Running To Stand Still,&quot; which features one of Bono's best vocal performances, and &quot;Red Hill Mining Town,&quot; one of the lesser-known tracks. &quot;In God's Country&quot; and &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot; are probably the lightest, catchiest songs on the CD, and perfectly complement the moving, emotional &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and the dark, angry &quot;Exit.&quot; Lastly, in the U2 tradition of slow, calming moving songs comes &quot;Mothers Of The Disappeared.&quot;<br />Anyhow, if you are even a casual U2 fan and don't have this album, my question is: what are you waiting for? The Joshua Tree is one of U2's masterpieces, and has a place in every collection. Enjoy!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|I bought this CD for my 15 year old son, but find my hubby listens to it too. It has lyrics we all may not like, but overall, it's a great cd for those teens who LOVE Eminem.
B000001DTM|5.0|After their first masterpiece, The Joshua Tree, U2 dared to do something few, if any, successful bands do at their peak - totally change their image and revolutionize the sound of their music. The creation of the album was certainly not without its struggles (the band almost broke up as a result of the radical changes Bono and Edge were pushing for) but, as the results show, the decision was certainly a good one.<br />With this CD, U2 changed from the sincere, idealistic boys from Dublin into a much more complex, confusing band. Regardless of which style of U2 you prefer, Achtung Baby is a must-have - its dark, powerful reflections on jealousy, loss and desperation blend perfectly with lighter but equally potent songs like &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses?&quot; Bono sounds great, especially on the beautiful ballad &quot;One&quot; and the rest of the band is in top form as well.<br />Anyhow, I very strongly recommend Achtung Baby - from the opening tones of &quot;Zoo Station&quot; to the calm, powerful &quot;Love is Blindness,&quot; this is U2 at their best.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Defenders of the Faith is an excellent album. It retains much of the heaviness of its predeecessor, Screaming for Vengeance, except without a standout hit single. Freewhell Burning is a fast, heavy, melodic rocker with excellent vocals. Jawbreaker is another excellent track. The lyrics are obviously homosexual content, but who cares? Rock Hard Ride Free is a solid effort. The Sentinel is one of the best songs on here, and it has an interesting break. Eat Me Alive is another sexual song, but it could be for either sex. Some Heads Are Gonna Roll is a classic mid-tempo rocker that is sooo Judas Priest. Defenders of the Faith is a classic.
B00005OAIE|5.0|As a teenage girl, sometimes the world can seem confusing and unfair.  John Mayer speaks of all these in his songs in my favorite cd, room for squares.  Not only do his songs sound amazing, they speak of real life issues and help me discover my inner self.  All I have to say is; if you want a talented guitarist, a fanastic song writer, and easy to listen to songs, John Mayer is all of that and SO MUCH MORE!
B00005K9LK|5.0|Screaming for Vengeance is a classic from the first notes of Hellion. Hellion, a masterful instrumental, leads straight into Electric Eye, which is a comment on how society is becoming more and more technologically dependent. It is a classic. Riding on the Wind is one of the funner songs on this album. Bloodsatone is a memorable mid-tempo rocker. The title track, Screaming for Vengeance, shreds. It's the fastest and heaviest song on here. Look at how high Halford gets towards the end. You've Got Another Thing Comin' is the most famous song off Screaming for Vengeance, and it rules. Get Screaming for Vengeance if you're a fan of true metal.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|I am a huge Eminem fan, and have been since I heard his Slim Shady EP.  He has improved so much over the past 5 years, and he deserves so much recognition.<br />I was excited to hear that Eminem had 3 new songs coming out on this 8 Mile soundtrack.  The 3 he has are great, but the rest are...well...iffy.<br />1. Loose Yourself - Eminem: The main track for the movie.  This is possibly one of Eminem's greatest songs, lyrically and beat-wise. <br />2. 8 Mile - Eminem: What a great beat this has. It's very catchy, and my favorite on the whole disc.<br />3. Run Rabbit Run - Eminem: Why wasn't this put onto the movie? This song is all about Rabbit, so I'm suprised it wasn't put somewhere into the movie.  It's face past and makes you really wanna nod your head. Another great song.<br />4.  Love Me- Obie Trice, Eminem, 50 Cent - I hate this song, and I hate Obie Trice even more. His voice is so bad.<br />5.  Places to Go - 50 Cent: This is a pretty good song. Pretty catchy. It has a good beat. Again, why wasn't this put into the movie? Hmm.<br />6. Wanksta - 50 Cent: One of the top 3 songs on the album. Awesome beat, 50 Cent really proves himself on this one.<br />7. Rap Game - D12: This is a pretty good song, sounds a lot like other D12 stuff. Catchy chorus.<br />8. You Wanna Be Me - Nas: Ugh, Nas went down the sh-t hole with this one. His voice is great, but his beat sucks. I've only listened to this maybe one time.<br />9. 8 miles and Running - Jay Z and Freeway: I can't stand Jay Z, but this track is alright.  He is a great songwriter though, and the chorus is awesome.<br />10. That's My Ni99a Fo Real - Young Zee:  This song is terrible, why it was put on it the soundtrack I may never know. Bad, bad song.<br />11. Battle - Gang Starr: Awesome beat, again, why wasn't this put into the movie?!?! Grr, great beat, he raps awesome, his voice is awesome too.<br />12. Spitshine - Xzibit: This song is OK, definitly not one of Xzibit's best songs. His voice is still one of the best in the game though. =)<br />13. Time of Your Life - Macy Gray: I hate Macy Gray, but this song is alright I guess. Shoulda been put into the movie too. Kinda of a contrast song to the rest of the soundtrack.<br />14. Wasting My Time - Boomkat: Another contrast song, yet it sucks even more than Macy Gray's. TERRIBLE song.<br />15. R.A.K.I.M. - Rakim: Another GREAT song on the soundtrack, Rakim is definatly one of the best cats in the game. I sing this chorus all the time, its so catchy.<br />16. Adrenaline Rush - Obie Trice: Obie Trice sucks. Period.
B00005R62K|5.0|Stained Class is a classic. It is also notorious of allegedly inspiring two Nevada kids to commit suicide with the subliminal message \\"do it\\" on Better By You, Better Than Me. Exciter is a classic and the most memorable song on here. White Heat, Red Hot has a memorable chorus. Better By You, Better Than Me is a slower song with interesting vocal work. The title track, Stained Class, a true gem. Invader is a decent rocker. Saints In Hell is pretty cool. Sabage is about the Native Americans losingb their land. Beyond the Realms of Death is a ballad about suicide. Heroe's End has probably the best riffs on the entire album. Stained Class os a classic that shouldn't be missed.
B00000J2SQ|3.0|This album is the best Rainbow album featuring pop-metal singer Joe Lynn Turner, no doubt about that. This singer, owner of a potent and beautiful voice, unfortunately uses it mostly for singing pop metal tunes talking about love (in a kind of Steve Perry style).<br />Blackmore hired him with the clear intent of breaking mainstream America. The first result of this union was the catastrophic DIFFICULT TO CURE. Blackmore and Glover thought things over and decided to go back to hard rock. The result, STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, is a very efficient album, not one to make you stunned, but a really good album.<br />Blackmore is playing free and relaxed in it. His riffs are catchy and intelligent, albeit very simple. The nine songs are good, and there's not a feeling in any one of them of being a throwaway or filler.<br />Recommended for Rainbow fans.
0553502271|3.0|When John Grisham tries to rise to the level of serious literature, he misjudges his ability.  He can render nasty people, in this case Troy Phelan and his heirs, very capably.  He does middling well with his alcoholic attorney, but he cannot give character to a pure-hearted missionary. Furthermore, plausibility takes a nose-dive as the novel concludes.  I was most interested in the description of the great Pantanal Swamp.
B00005QK39|4.0|Some people say this is the best Marillion album. I disagree. For me, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD fills this position.<br />In SCRIPT FOR A JESTER`S TEARS, Marillion still sounded too much like GENESIS for my taste, but it was obvious since the star that the guys had something special, mainly their singer, Fish (Derek William Dick). This guys sing with passion and it does not sound a fake passion.<br />The tunes are all regular and keyboard driven.
0385503954|5.0|I was very satisfied with this book. Likely to appeal to anyone who has a fondness for English stories set in the pre to post World War Two period, with the lush rendering of upper middle-class country house life.<br />More than just a family saga, it explores some universal themes of truth, forgiveness, loyalty, redemption.<br />Th narrative is divided in three parts, closely resembling 3 linked novellas, but each is in fact dependent on the other for the resolution - although even there the author teases with a denouement that takes this into the realm of unresolved fantasy (popular amongst movie-makers nowadays - from Memento to Mulholland Drive, though personally I think the clues are well enough laid by McEwan that it is a little less ambiguous than some).<br />For me, the second section, recounting the story of one main character and another in the retreat from France that culminated in Dunkirk, is the strongest component. The evocation of that aspect of war - the fleeing columns of humanity being aerially strafed by the German forces is different to anything else of have read set in wartime.<br />A satisfying and not difficult read for those who like something lyrical and literary.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I expected to find this overhyped, but instead, loved the movie and the extras.  Who knew that a big blue 'kitty' could be so enjoyable!<BR>Still playing with the DVD extras, which are both informative and enjoyable.
B000069CWE|1.0|Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory in 2000.  Two years later, these hard working musicians manage, not to provide thousands of fans with a new album, but remix the songs from their debut album.  No one in the history of music has ever had the balls to indulge themselves this much.  Get off it guys!  Time to write some new music; people WILL NOT stand for recycled ....  This is something a band does after achieving a career's worth of success, which says alot.  Time to step it up or fade away.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|What is there left to say about Shrek that has not been said? Who knows? My own feelings on the movie are like an onion.<br />First, I love Mike Myers as Shrek. He is a disagreeable yet lovable hero. From the opening shower seen to the closing song, this movie is dependent upon Myers as the lead--and he does not falter.<br />As for Murphy and Diaz, this is the best movie from either of them in a long while. The eagerness of the Donkey fits nicely with Murphy's talents. Diaz does pretty well as the straight man (straight princess I guess).<br />The true joy for me in Shrek were the (fractured) fairy tale references and the subtle (and not-so-subtle) digs at Disney. In particular the scene where Shrek and Donkey arrive in Lord Farquaad's realm cracks me up. The photo is priceless.<br />Enough of my rambling though. Shrek is a funny, funny movie. If you haven't seen it--I suggest you do so. I know I'll be watching this one again.<br />I give Shrek my heartfelt recommendation.
B00004RFFM|1.0|To call this film preposterous is to add a new definition to this word.  To call it bad is to single out a film that Ed Wood would have been embarrased to make.<br />Every movie requires a certain suspension of disbelief.  I have accepted warp travel, pyrokinesis, and time travel more easily than the hokum of this film.  The sharks are ridiculous, the plot preposterous beyond belief, the setting asinine, and I found myself cheering, actually cheering, when Samuel L. Jackson, a world-class actor, was eaten by the shark JUST SO HIS CHARACTER WOULD SHUT UP!  The dialog is beyond painful to nauseating.  The special effects are laughable.<br />I have never been so upset spending money on a film in my life.  If you value your pocket book, your latest meal, and your belief that movies can tell a decent story, do NOT buy this film.<br />You have been warned.
B0000640VO|5.0|There are a lot of movies in this world that I would call good, or even great, but very few that I would call beautiful.  Amelie is beautiful.  The cinematography has a painter's touch, as the colors seem more vibrant and warm than in life; and yet the settings never struck me as being artificial.  The characters are also crafted with a similar flair; even minor characters seem like portraits having unexpected familiarity...  The soundtrack to the movie complements the action and the characters, and is a work of art in itself.<br />The only negative aspect of the DVD (at least on mine, I bought it elsewhere) is that one can't view French subtitles, only English or Spanish.  The French would be helpful for anyone interested in learning French...  But that is a minor detail.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Since Stan Lee was involved in the making of this film, it has stayed close in many respects to the original story, at least in so far as Spidey's inception. A fun action film, Toby definitely captures the spirit of Peter Parker, growing and learning to deal with his powers while growing into a man.<br />Great flick!
B000069CWE|4.0|Even without me being a huge fan of linkin park [I love LP!], I could tell you this album was really good. I thought it showed another side of LP than that of Hybrid Theory.Many people will contest and say that LP is purely a rock band, and they sold out on this cd, but the truth is they are not entirely a rock band-thus the emcee and the dj.LP is a blend between rap/hip hop and rock. Reanimation really showed the lyrical and production skills of Mike Shinoda, LP and all the other guests on the album. Truthfully, some songs I felt were diced up a bit too much-but the beats, lyrics and some kuts overpowered that fault so overall the album is hot. Go get it! <BR>P.S. Joseph Hahn is soooo hot! ;)
0345441184|5.0|Nearly everyone is familiar with the ancient stories of King Arthur and the Round Table, but for anyone who has ever longed for deeper investigation into the hearts and minds of the characters (and especially the too-often ignored female characters), Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon is a breath of fresh air.  This epic novel, which is based the traditional Arthurian legends, primarily Malory's Morte d'Arthur, retells the classic saga through the eyes of the women involved.  <BR>The story is told primarily through the eyes of Morgaine Le Faye, Arthur's half-sister.  Traditionally, Morgaine was considered Arthur's nemesis, a pagan, power hungry fairy-woman who caused distress and mischief in the kingdom.  This is not so in The Mists of Avalon.  The novel makes Morgaine the heroine, and develops a deep, loving, complex, believable relationship between her and her brother.  Zimmer Bradley also tackles and further develops the traditional legend that the two have a child together, taking the controversial subject to a deeper, more introspective level, and replacing ancient assumption with stimulating, new ideas.<BR>A major theme of the novel is the tension between the newly introduced Christianity and the old, Mother Goddess religion.  Even in the traditional Arther legends there is evidence of this conflict.  In some stories, Arthur is the quintessential, pious, Christian King, while in others (including Morte d'Arthur) he is taken by the Lady of the Lake to the pagan isle of Avalon after his death.  The conflict and convergence between the two theologies is exquisitely expressed in this excerpt from the book: \\"...a dying man in need of the Mother's aid, where all men come at last.  Even the priests know this, with their ever-virgin Mary in her blue robe; for she too becomes the World Mother in the hour of death.\\"  Zimmer Bradley develops a vivid, in-depth depiction of the religion of Avalon, and raises interesting questions about the influence of both this and Christianity in the lives of all the characters.  <BR>Marion Zimmer Bradley brings to life many of the Arthurian women who were once nothing more than names.  The story opens long before Arthur or Morgaine's birth, with the conflict of their parents, especially their mother, Igraine, who struggles with her dedication as a priestess of Avalon and her marriage to a Christian man.  Her sister, the Lady of the Lake is shown as a real, human woman obsessed with the preservation of the religion of the Mother Goddess.  Even Gwenefar (the original spelling of Guinevere) is developed in depth.  A dedicated Christian, she struggles with the pagan ties of her husband and his sister and despairs that she is unable to do what a good, Christian woman should - bear her husband a child.  The famous love triangle between Gwenefar, Lancelot, and Arthur is also intricately developed with a few added twists...such as a threesome instigated by the King...<BR>The Mists of Avalon is a brilliantly captivating novel, for those who love the classic legends, hate them, or even know nothing about them at all.  It is an epic achievement of love, violence, loyalty, lust, power and enchantment.  The multi-dimensional characters come to life on the page, forcing the reader to care, feel, and think about their lives and the relevance their struggles still have today.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a gripping tale filled with the excitement and power of the human experience, which is, all at once, so very magical and so very real.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is best understood in terms of Romanticism. The movie embraces the imagination. The viewer finds himself reliving his childhood. The sounds of popping bubble-wrap, of rain on water, of marbles flooding pavement, are heard as though for the first time. The movie penetrates our senses--eyes, ears, tongues, skins--and rekindles our memories (much of this accomplished through dazzling cinematographic techniques which defamiliarize reality).<br />A previous reviewer calls Amelie (the character) a simple girl. This is true. Because Amelie experieced no childhood, she retains a kind of innocense. Her imagination persists in her adulthood despite the mechanistic existence of adult life. Despite this, she isn't able to share her world with those around her. She makes a decision: to remind people of their childhoods, to remind them what it's like to play. (It is through this act of giving that she is able to receive. . .)<br />Lastly, the viewer finds himself able to play. The world, even if for a moment, becomes something new, colorful, resonant, open to imagination.<br />Perhaps the reader finds this review too sweet to the taste.  Delete these words. Watch the film. Write a cloying review of your own.

B000000OAN|5.0|This album really shows the diverse side to Queen.  It demonstrates their talent beyond the well known favorites, such as We Will Rock You, and We Are The Chamions.  This album is absolutely fabulous.  I originally purchased it for the song Bohemian Rhapsody, but have fallen in love with all the other great songs.  The variety of sounds and lyrics is great.  Perfect album to listen to.  Highly Recommended if you're a Queen fan. :)
B00006L83N|5.0|The masters of symphonyX did it again with THE ODYSSEY, when it comes to a band that I love I usually do not bother to read or write reviews I just buy it and let my ears be the judge and it's very much true with Symphony X since you can't go wrong with any of their CDs every one of them is a master piece, I guess they just have it and all that is left for us to do is to enjoy their music,<BR>So if you want to treat yourself to great music just buy it, you won't be disappointed here,<BR>They are just amazing, individually every one of them is a master of his domain but together to reach even higher, they play so good together there's no weak point here like in other bands,<BR>I just hope they'll continue to create Music forever.
B00006JIA4|5.0|One of the most successful British rock groups of the seventies and eighties, Queen started as a quasi-glam rock group but evolved a style all their own, combining elements of pop, rock, heavy metal and a few operatic touches.<br />Bohemian rhapsody, their biggest hit, was twice a UK number one hit - first on its original release and second on its release to raise money for AIDS charities, following the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury due to AIDS. The song also made the American top ten twice - first on its original release and second following its use in Wayne's world, a few months after Freddie's death, when it made number two. This classic song, seven-minute mini rock opera, overshadows everything else that Queen recorded, but they made plenty of other great music.<br /><br />Queen had two other UK number one hits - Under pressure (with David Bowie) and Innuendo. They also had five UK number two hits (Killer queen, Somebody to love, We are the champions, Crazy little thing called love and Radio gaga) and three UK number three hits (I want to break free, A kind of magic, I want it all) as well as some other UK top ten hits including You're my best friend, Another one bites the dust, It's a hard life and One vision.<br /><br />Freddie Mercury has a great voice, many of the songs are great, the arrangements are exciting, and there is no other band like them. Apart from his music as lead singer of Queen, Freddie recorded a few other hits, also featured in this collection. These include Barcelona (a duet with Montserrat Caballe) and a great cover of the old Platters classic, The great pretender.<br /><br />Queen were truly unique - it's not often you can say that about any singer or group - and this collection contains all their classic tracks.
B00000254Q|4.0|Although Amigos is a strong album, you can hear, in the weaker tracks, the beginnings of Santana's decline.  Having followed his classic trilogy of Latin Rock albums with three quasi-jazz-fusion albums, Santana wanted to come back down to Earth and rediscover his pop roots.  He was mostly successful on Amigos, but subsequent albums fell off dramatically in quality as he continued to flounder in search of the right middle-of-the-road groove.<br />However, on Amigos, the superb material is more than worth the purchase price of the CD.  Dance Sister Dance and Gitano showcase a new facet of Santana's Latin roots, and Europa is probably Santana's finest composition, featuring his most powerful and moving guitar work.<br />Let It Shine is an OK rhythm &amp; blues pop song that became the minor hit Santana was looking for.  Tell me are you tired is the worst track on the album, a dopey &quot;lecture&quot; song that, regrettably, was a harbinger of things to come.<br />It's worth buying this record for &quot;Europa&quot; alone, since none of the live performances I've heard come close to matching the studio original for shimmering, sparkling beauty and emotional resonance.  As a whole this is a solid piece of work and at the current budget price is well worth it for any Santana fan.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay. Yeah, first album was pleasant enough, saw them live, blah, blah, blah. Didn't jump on this one until a few months after the release date. <br />Whoa, what a mistake, or, perhaps, a blessing for my many other CD's since this album has infected me. Two listenings a day. How did this pleasant band produce this amazing album? Were they kidnapped? Did they encounter a higher creative power? I am floored. 'Clocks', 'Daylight', 'A Whisper'... who is this band?<br />Only one clinker in the batch, the country-inspired &quot;Greeneyes.&quot; But one caress of the up button and we're happy to gently brush that small, and I mean small, green worm away from this plump glistening luscious apple. <br />Oh,I am in lust. I filed Coldplay somewhere below Doves, Goldfrappe, Grandaddy, yeah, I filed them under pleasant and spun &quot;Parachutes&quot; once in a while. Now they do this to my aching brain. Sneaky lads!<br />Come join the addiction. Just don't tell me the heartbreakingly beautful break in 'Amsterdam' doesn't send a tingle up into your soul. I won't listen, cause my ears are weeping.<br />Pure alchemy. How wonderful in these times of musical lead.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|This film was something else. The producers had clearly thought long and hard about the cultural resonances of the vampire myth, and as a result there were lots of deep red curtains and carpets, tasteful blood-red works of art hanging in the background, and assorted vampires talking to each other in a variety of middle-European languages. The special effects were fantastic, with the new 'Reaper' vampires opening huge, tendril-filled mouths for our edification. I thought that the film was a valid contribution to the legend, although I could have done without the swearing, especially as we watched the DVD as a family, with Grandma keeping up a running commentary!
0802130208|5.0|This book is a gem. I can't describe how interesting it was to read. The main character of this book is the slob, bum, obese, yet strangely pedantic Ignatius Reilly.<br />Ignatius is the protagonist of the story, and he is the whole mass of the story's bulk. We meet Ignatius in the beginning, described in a language that has yet to be emulated. We hear of his \\"supercilious blue and yellow eyes\\" and his mannerisms. <br />From the beginning the reader will be entranced by this towering giant of a character. And the language that Ignatius uses! It's too good to be true. It's not English really. It's just Ignatius's language. <br />That's one of the best things about this book. The way that the character's talk is one of the hallmarks of this book. It's what sets this apart. This quirky New Orleans story features hilarious depictions of characters in the debauche French Quarter (where Ignatius has many a wild adventure!).<br />I am at a loss with words now, I think my valve is starting to close! If you never read this book, you will soon understand what I mean! I have no more words of wisdom save one: read.
B00005KHJM|5.0|\\"The Wicker Man\\" is one of those films that I had heard great things about for several years before it finally came to an art theater in town and I was able to see it.  My initial response was one of disappointment, not because I found the film to have major flaws or anything, but simply because my expectations had been raised to the level of something like \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"The Seven Samurai,\\" or at least \\"Psycho.\\"  In retrospect, the problem is more that the film is characterized as a horror film (Christopher Lee has a major role) and \\"The Wicker Man\\" does and does not fall into that category.  Certainly very few horror films take place so much during the daylight hours.<br />When Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) of the West Highland Police comes to the isolated Scottish island of Summerisle to search for a missing schoolgirl, Rowan Morrison, he finds that something a bit more disturbing that the secrets kept by the locals.  Howie, a professed Christian, is repulsed by the open devotion of the people to the Old Gods, complete with pagan rituals and open sexuality.  Even worse, these abhorrent practices are endorsed and encouraged by the local Lord.  They also refuse to help with his investigation, more out of a sense of detachment rather than as a concerted effort to keep Howie from discovering the truth. He wanders the town and the surrounding countryside, and it from this footage of the Scottish highlands that you get the sense there are things older than civilization and Howie is an interloper.<br />Howie's suspicion is that young Rowan was sacrificed by some sort of cult headed by Lord Summerisle (Lee), but he is half-right in that horrible way that becomes suddenly and tragically clear at the film's climax.  The grand irony of the film is that Howie is being judged and found wanting, just as he is doing the same of others.  Besides the climax, the most memorable scene in the film is when the local sex siren, Willow (Britt Ekland) keeps the sergeant awake by dancing naked outside his door (I have to point out that a body double was used for some of this scene and that Ekland's voice was dubbed in the film).  Howie obviously suffers from a repressive idea of Christianity where his carnal desires torment him even more than the horrible crime he suspects has been perpetrated.  Another delicious irony of Anthony Schaeffer's script is that the character of Howie, who obviously cannot handle the sexual freedom of the Sixties, is confronted by its implications in a remote village that harkens back to the old days.<br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" is a rare horror film since the key person in its success is writer Anthony Shaffer (\\"Frenzy,\\" \\"Sleuth\\"), whose script takes ancient Druid practices, pagan rites, and the origins of the celebration of May Day to give the story a sense of authenticity bound more in fact than fiction (cf. Dracula/vampire movies).  The script also takes advantage of our expectations that Howie is the film's \\"hero,\\" so that we become victims of the storyteller as much as the main character.  In fact, this film works so well because it violates certain key expectations we have about horror films while seeming to embrace them.<br />I know it will be seen as heresy, but I think \\"The Wicker Man\\" would have benefit from casting someone else other than Christopher Lee.  While the actor's presence is obviously strong, just looking at him makes you think that \\"The Wicker Man\\" is going to turn into a Hammer monster movie at any moment.  I mean, because it is Lee, we are not surprised that his character is even weirder than the townspeople, the same way that we are not surprised Eklund is running naked at some point in the film.  In a film which works best when it works against our expectations in terms of the story, should follow the same logic with the casting as well.<br />FINAL WARNING:  If you have never seen \\"The Wicker Man,\\" avoid watching trailers or anything else before you screen it for the first time.  When you go back and watch these things after the film you will know why.go back and watch these things after the film you will know why.
B00006V9A0|3.0|to tell you the truth a was a little let down, by this cd. I mean the new unreleased track is great, I love it, but the whole CD just seemed a little empty to me I mean dont get me wrong all the tracks on here are great but, it feels like this cd was thrown together in a day or so just to get some bucks.This CD was made to be the dummy's guide to Nirvana, like some kid that just discovered them made a burned CD of their &quot;good&quot; songs. I would say for people like myself that love the band dont bother buying this cd. If you havent heard you know you you're right then go download it off the internet and save some bucks. For those of you that havent heard Nirvana and want to get into them, start off by buying Nevermind and work you're way up, trust me it would be better that way. I give it 3 stars for the unreleased track...but it should have more of them.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit &quot;Memento&quot;, earning him this shot at the big time.  For the most part, he proved himself up to the task.  &quot;Insomnia&quot; provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino).<br />The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs.  This serves as a foundation for the two storylines.  The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs.  The second, of course, is the murder investigation.  After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin.  Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.<br />The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner.  Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.<br />Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension.  The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majesctic Alaskan and British Columbian locations.  While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.<br />Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice.  He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character.  Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, &quot;to sleep&quot;, a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.<br />Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos.  He follows up his sociopathic performance in &quot;1 Hour Photo&quot; with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist.  Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part.  This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part was also much too physical for him.  He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy.  That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor.  Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.<br />This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino.  The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers.  I rated it an 8/10.  Definitely not a snoozer.
0385508417|4.0|I see that so many reviewers disliked this book.  It is just a quick read that was laugh out loud funny.  Of course it is not Grisham's usual genre- but it is a cute story that really put me in the mood for the holidays.<br />It was funny- the descriptions of upscale stationary &quot;boutiques&quot; and nosy neigbors are caricatures, but very funny ones.  Grisham captured modern America quite well.  He satirizes the cost and lack of meaning in too many Christmasses, realy making the reader think (while laughing).<br />The happy ending was truly heart warming not at all contrived.  Yes it does seem a little like a tv movie (W/Chevy Chase) especially when Luther finds himself hanging from the roof by Christmas lights, but you need a few of those moveis every year- they make Christmas waht it is.  I am glad that I ignored the negativity and read this.  It was fast- two sittings and very enjoyable!
B0000062GK|3.0|First the good: this disc musically is a lot like Satriani's earlier releases, and that's a good thing.  Now for the bad: the sound quality is pretty bad.  No highs, no lows, mostly midrange.  Sounds like a blanket is thrown over your speakers.  Did anyone listen to this before it was released, especially Joe himself?  I think not, if it was me I'd demand it be remastered.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Though this lead singer is (by conventional vocal standards) horrible, this is a GOOD rock band.  These songs sizzle with intensity, the guitar parts are beautifully crafted, and the grooves are second to none.  Check out the minor to major modulation on The Dead Heart, the pulsating urgency of Put Down That Weapon, and the cool arpeggiated opening of Warakuna.  If you're a fan of great, intense, burning radio-rock, you'll love this album .
B00006F2TV|5.0|Spider-Man is a good movie, and the special effects and all are pretty cool eye candy. The one big thing that most people will hate about this movie is how predictable it is. You can always guess what's going to happen next. But besides, that, it's amazing to see everyones favourite web-swinger swinging around and beating up the bad guys. If you liked X-Men, you'll like this one. It's a good buy.
B000068TPN|5.0|A must see for anyone who went through the Viet Nam experience.  Hard to watch without bringing back memories and emotions.  Makes one very proud to have been a military member during that time, regardless of the politics of the war.
B00000099Y|5.0|Personally I find this to be some of Tools greatest work. However, the average joe that simply wants to pop in a cd and recieve instant gratification may not like it too much. I find Maynard's voice to be quite addictive and nothing short of amazing. This cd has not recieved near the acclaim it should from the general population. I've heard a lot of people bash the album simply because it sounds too dark or confusing. Granted, if you're looking for something happy go lucky to let the kids listen to, this may not be the thing for you, but it's really not quite as drab as many people think. For example, look at the track Die Eier Von Satan, while it sounds rather evil, is really just a recipe for cookies. Ahtough that particular song is not as threatening as it may seem, there are some less innocent tracks which could be offensive to some. In short, I've found that this is an album for artists (or those that can actually appreciate art). If you want to listen to some oddly melodic sounds, and are willing to dedicate some time I can almost guarantee that this cd will grow on you. If not, maybe you should tune your radio in to the local pop station and save your money.
B0000028UK|5.0|Nothing tires me more that all the listerers who dismiss Vs. as merely &quot;good&quot; but refuse to place it among more cautious albums such as &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Binaural.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, those records are great, if not superior, but Vs. is has what those albums lack: courage. <br />Instead of making another conventional album, Pearl Jam took a chance.  Much like Radiohead did with &quot;Kid A,&quot; Vedder and crew risked their obviously sucessful grunge rock for a more eclectic sound that ranged from mellow to downright hard.  Whereas &quot;Ten&quot; was radio-friendly and not as moody, &quot;Vs.&quot; sends you into another plane of existence.  Perfect in its imperfection, Vs. is a classic, one of the greatest albums of the 90's, and the best statement Pearl Jam has ever made.  <br />Buy it.  Listen to it.  Listen to it again. And again.  And again.
B00006FXB6|5.0|QotSA's new album is a breath of fresh air (sorry for the cliche). Most bands under the rock umbrella are concerned only with yelling about family problems and turning up the guitar amps as high as they can go. The approach of the Queens is different. Instead, they focus on actual melodies and harmonics, musicianship, experimention, and even find the time to mock commercial radio. How can you beat that?<BR>   This album is surely one of the best releases of the year. If you're looking for something good, or something different, treat yourself to a listen of Songs for the Deaf.
0767802470|5.0|When I watched the film \\"Das Boot\\" for the very first time, I was very excited what kind of film would that be. My father (who watched it before me) said that it would be \\"a very haunting and superb film\\" so I took advice and watched it. And I wasn't disappointed: I definetely LOVE this film beacause it is so impressional and interesting. I watched it the day after because the film was always in my mind, I wasn't able to resist! That's why I give FIVE stars.<BR>So, \\"Das Boot\\" is my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE FILM 4 EVER!!!!

630438551X|4.0|This is an incredible movie. I saw Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge before this movie, and once agin Baz Luhrmann blew me away. He weaves modern-day setting and attitude in to this brilliant old-age play. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes give spectacular performances. I also found it interesting how they also added some modern words with the old English. He also stayed true to the story, and added upon it. It is the basic story of two star-crossed lovers born from two rival families, the Montagues and the Capulets who take their lives on one fateful day. The only flaw is in some parts, they talk way too fast, but other than that this movie is one of the best.
B00005JCAA|5.0|A westernized conception of a Buddhist or a Hindu theme; or maybe just a 20th Century version of Pluto or Osiris on vacation in New York. <br />Some dialogue could perhaps be considered far-fetched, but Anthony Hopkins delivers his usual brilliant magic.  Brad Pitt pulls off a difficult role following 'Seven Years in Tibet'; and Claire Forlani exudes a touching, even slightly naively romantic innocence as the younger daughter/doctor. <br />The director, Martin Brest, does something of a King Lear knockoff here with the daughters vying for the king's/magnate's attention and favor; including the sly fiance who has his own plans.<br />If one sign of a good movie is to make its audience think, this one qualifies in my opinion.
B00005R2BG|5.0|PACE RATING(out of 5):<BR>P-Plot: 5, a great story about love and betrayal.<BR>A-Action:3, great fast-paced dancing scenes and also the abuse scene with the Duke.<BR>C-Characters:4.5, Beautifully developed and acted characters.<BR>E-Ending:4, A tragic ending following up one of the best stories ever told.<br />Average Score: 4 or 4.5, an exquisite movie.
1586210912|5.0|Seems Robert Kiyosaki has become a lightning rod for people's attitude is about being \\"rich\\".<br />Robert Kiyosaki doesn't claim to be giving more than basics, so to anyone who already knows them, it's not meant to be a revelation.  What he IS trying to do is show the world of financial literacy to those who have not been educated.  And to those who believe his point of view is cold, you again have to admit his point of view is valid.  <br />Much of his book is motivational.  If you consider what readers this book is targeting, this makes sense. I have also found that most people who do not know how to handle their finances are both intimidated and wary of the subject.  What he's trying to do is get people with a \\"Poor Dad\\" attitude to see how their point of view is skewed, and that they can logically plot their own course to financial stability and beyond. <br />This is not a \\"get rich quick\\" book.  It constantly hammers that true \\"financial literacy\\" takes years to learn, and that to be a solid investor in any field you must first understand the field in which you're considering investing.<br />He uses many people as case studies in how people have become rich, and doesn't analyze the moral implications the way some people would liek.  Don't like Ray Kroc?  Fine.  But he was extremely wealthy, and he legally built up the largest restaurant empire ever.  I think the author would hope like I do that somewhere there is an organic farming expert who could build up an empire equal to McDonald's.

B0000062GE|5.0|For some people it was Wither, Blister, Burn + Peel and for others, it was Ungod, that introduced them to Stabbing Westward. For me, it was Darkest Days. The summer of 1998 was when I was introduced to this depressingly excellent band. This CD still remains my favorite Stabbing Westward album, although they are ALL excellent (yes, even their last-ditch effort to gain mainstream attention with their final, self-titled album, was great). There is quite range of music going on here. You have the hard-hitting and pounding \\"When I'm Dead\\" and \\"Torn Apart,\\" the hopeless \\"Drowning\\" (which paints an experience similar to actually drowning) and the ones that just plain rock like \\"Save Yourself\\" and \\"Haunting Me.\\" I have owned this CD for over four years and I have managed to get quite a bit of mileage out of it. I have never tired of it, and it never loses its effect. Although it is extremely depressing, it is also extremely invigorating and exciting. With this album, Stabbing Westward proved they weren't just some NIN clones and developed a style that could be called their own. It really is too bad that they broke up, their music will be sorely missed by me.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I've been a fan of Christina for a while, i liked some of her past singles but didn't really like her debut cd that much. When I heard that she was releasing a new cd I knew i had to check it out... and I have to say i'm glad i did!<br />1. Stripped Intro: starts the album off<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down: great anthem for girls! and i really like the beat to it<BR>3. Walk Away- I LOVE this ballad, she has so much emotion through the song! its awesome<BR>4. Fighter- this song has so much rock influence in it, and you can feel the anger of the lyrics in her voice.. its excellent as well<BR>5.  Primer Amor Interlude:another interlude in spanish gives a good start to the next song..<BR>6. Infatuation: This song is great, i love how she wrote the lyrics to be a story.. and the latin influence is cool to hear.. definately a fave!<BR>7. Loves Embrace Interlude: don't really listen to this so i don't have much to say..<BR>8.. Loving Me 4 Me: A nice ballad<BR>9.. Impossible: Alicia Keys wrote this, and its a beautiful song<BR>10.. Underappreciated: i like this song definately a topic people can relate to!..<BR>11. Beautiful: by far one of the most beautiful ballads i've heard.. Christina's voice really shines in this one!<BR>12.. Make Over: I'm also an alternative fan, and I really like this song very different to hear Christina sing like that but its cool!..<BR>13. Cruz: I like this song, nice melody and she sounds good<BR>14- Soar: this song is oh k<BR>15: Get Mine, Get Yours: very sensual song, but its catchy<BR>16: Dirrty: This song didn't really fit into this cd, but its a great \\"party\\" song makes you want to dance!<BR>17: Stripped Part 2: another interlude<BR>18: The Voice Within: this song is pretty, its cool how Christina uses her vocal talent but softly to suit the song, the girl can sing!<BR>19: I'm Oh K: this song makes you want to cry, you can feel the pain of the experience throughout.. very haunting but beautiful..<BR>20: Keep On Singing My Song: This song is oh k, once again shows Christina has an awesome voice!<br />In conclusion Stripped is by far an excellent cd- I'm a singer myself and can be pretty picky of vocal arrangment but i can't say anything bad about this cd:) so buy it you won't regret it!

B00006LJ6X|5.0|When I heard that Rhino was re-releasing all of Chicago's albums on CD, I made it a point to find out when this one would be available.  This was the album that reaffirmed me as a fan of Chicago when it was released in 1974.  I was happy then to see that they had returned to their more album-oriented, jazzy roots (however temporarily).  I'm surprised at how well this album has held up over the years; these guys were (and are) fantastic musicians, composers and songwriters.  This re-release has been mastered beautifully, sounding as I remember the original vinyl did.  The bonus selection, a rehearsal of Terry Kath's \\"Byblos\\", has a warmth and intimacy about it that is so touching, I had to listen to it a second time.  His untimely death in 1978 was a terrible loss.  This album is a \\"must-have\\" for all Chicago fans!
B00005UEAR|4.0|I would pass up a night of intense candlelit passion with my beautiful young wife to listen to just the second disc of this set.  Now do you know what I mean by WOW ????
0792835700|1.0|Some people love this movie.  It has Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse, two fabulous dancer/performers and I was eager to watch them.  Sadly, it's not really a dance movie and what dancing there is is pretty bland, as is the romance between Kelly and Charisse.  I found myself sympathizing with the Brigadoon resident who wants to leave---everybody is trying to stop him: if he leaves the spell will be broken and the town of Brigadoon will vanish.  I'd feel trapped there too.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I was one of Christina's biggest fan BEFORE this album came along!I have to admit that i liked her old image (cute!) and i enjoyed her music. Her albums,such as Mi Reflejo and Christina Aguilera were the No.1s on my List. So, without any hesitation, i bought Stripped the first day it was released. <BR>No doubt the album was the complete opposite of her debut album, mature i supposed,but did she have to change so much? Although this album would attract the adults,but what about her fans since Genie in a Bottle!There arent even many fast tracks available!Most of them are so slow and draggy!Beautiful, the much talked about song from this album,did not live up to the hype!I was pretty dissapointed with this album.It did not live up to my expectations at all. I was hoping for more catchy tunes from her, but i guess that's over,huh? <BR>Also,why does she has to uncover so much flesh? Believe me,the photos in the booklet are DISGUSTING!I can't even read the lyrics because i was too disgusted to see the pics!!!!<BR>As a long-time fan, I feel Underappreciated!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|we thought that the 8 mile sound track is the best it should be sound track of the year..,all the artists on this sound track are all very good,well i think this is the best !...
B00006YXE4|5.0|Aug 2001, just before Sep. 11th, Eric Clapton made a live at Madsion Square Garden in NY.  The live was excellent!  Moreover, he chose the last song 'Over the rainbow'.  After the Sep. 11th, our life in NY was in mess, however, the song 'Over the rainbow' always reminds me of 'HOPE'.  I like this album.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is by far the best album I purchase this year.  Reanimation is not just another remix album.  Reanimation takes it to a whole new level.  Even the art work on the CD packaging is just amazing.  If you want a CD that kicks [butt], Reanimation is the CD you want in your collection!
6305327084|5.0|Just saw this on dvd, and was reminded of why I dragged all my friends to the theater to watch it with me so many times when it was released!<br />I was in my mid-twenties and in grad school at the time in Boston.  Remember thinking at the time that I'd never seen a movie that captured so many of the things that I felt about girls, beauty, attraction, etc so well.  What more can I say?  It still speaks to me. =)
B0000542D1|5.0|The prelude to modern music videos/DVD's.  It captures John, Paul, George, and Ringo at their early peak of 'Beatlemania'.  They swept the U.K., the U.S. and, yes the world, and started the 'British Invasion'.<br />We will never see another band like this in any lifetime, or another rock collaboration team like Lennon/McCartney( and don't forget Mr. Harrison also). Their music and far-reaching influence are proving to be timeless!<br />I bought the DVD on it's first release- the movie and special features are well worth the price to any music fan.<br />A great special feature is the interview with George Martin - the Fab 4's technical master.  How he engineered and blended those early sounds and lyrics with the recording technology of the mid-1960's, is beyond me.  Yet, they remain musical treasures, and dare I say, creative masterpieces of their time.<br />I can't wait for 'HELP' to be released on DVD!<br />'All You need is Love' - - Take Care!
B00006V9A0|3.0|If I was to review just the songs on the CD I'd give it 5 stars. Every song on here is awesome. But 14 songs? Come on, I don't want to dish out $15 for ONE new song! The Beatles put like 30 songs on one disc and Nirvana has barely half that. Where is Something in the Way, Polly, School, Drain You, or Dive? I really don't get it. If you can put thirty songs on a CD then do it. Don't waste your money if you already have all their other CDs. Just download You Know You're Right or something.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Wow, no honestly, wow, just amazement...there used to be only one song i could listen to over and over again and that was the theme from m*a*s*h, now there are 2, i'd buy this album for karma police alone. Really this is just like an evoulution of Lou Reeds Berlin, there should be more music about real feelings, and the deepresion and disolusion on this record make it real enough for suicide...no suprises reminds me so much of my bus journey each day its scary. I'd heard Kid A, and only liked a couple of tracks, but when I heard this it instantly became one of my favourite albums, and radiohead my new favourite band.
B000066F6H|2.0|I left it my playlist but . . . the next next big thing it's not.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is a talent that can never be reproduced. \\"Stripped\\" is definitely the raw emotional outpouring of this 21 year old.  Hands down this is the best album of the year.  Why?  I can't put the cd down. Powerful Vocals, Dynamic Writing, and the best production I've heard in awhile make this my number one choice.  \\"Stripped\\" has a smooth evolution that takes you high and low. Linda Perry and Christina score a hit with \\"Beautiful\\".\\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" brings Christina to the status of legends such as  Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and Ella Fitzgerald.  Its mellow, smooth, and has the vocal stylings of someone well beyond 21 years. \\"Make Over\\" is the only song that I have problems with.  She's yelling.  Yeah she has great range, but she's no rock star. Overall \\"Stripped\\" is one for the record collection.  No longer will Christina be called a manufactured Pop Star, but a dynamic and poignant figure of music.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Not since \\"Homicide: Life on the Street\\" has a cop drama so thoroughly sucked me in.  Mike Chiklis greatly departs from his warm and fuzzy character from the former series, \\"The Commish\\" and becomes and intense, ferocious, dirty cop named Vic Mackey.  When I say he \\"becomes\\" him, I mean it.  Just like the early day of H:LOTS, the main character is surrounded by great supporting characters played by talented actors.<br />The jist of the show is Vic Mackey is dirty, and he is the leader of a strike team that is just as dirty as he is.  The Lieutenant knows he's dirty and wants to nail him(plus he has much political ambition), but is never able to get enough on him to do so, this all leads to some thrillingly intense television and departs from the typical, \\"cops are heroes\\" mentality.<br />Remember when \\"NYPD Blue\\" was considered the most intense cop show on TV?  Forget those days. . . .they're over; 'Blue looks like Romper Room compared to this.<br />Oh, and Andy Sipowicz is no longer the baddest cop on TV.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the awesome series I have ever seen. I'm a woman. I hate war movies. There is PLENTY of war in this movie, so close and seemingly \\"real\\" to one who has never been in a war (other than a bad marriage). But war is portrayed in such a way that even I was riveted. This film is about the friendships/relationships developed by those who live and die day to day and must trust and care for each other. When in mourning they must go on with no time to mourn. It is a telling of a \\"band of brothers\\" who never lost courage and drive no matter how dark and bleak their days appeared. <BR> <BR>While what we see today in America can, at times, leave us wondering where our country is going, Band of Brothers is a reminder, along with 911, that there is a true American spirit that is human and fallible, yet unique and noble with unending spirit.
0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones is  highly  original,  creatively imagined , and  a very beautifully written story of an adolescent rape murder victim and those she leaves behind. As Susie relates her tale, she is watching the rest of the world go on living with a remarkable sense of detachment which only a victim could feel. Having suffered the emotional trauma following rape, the author, Alice Sebold, must have understood and know this feeling all too well. While one might expect the book to be overwhelmingly sad, this  is not the case. We witness the deceased  Susie happily existing  in her own custom made heaven with an ability to  visit  and  to feel in  close proximity to those she loved on earth, albeit undetected.  She also lacks an ability to  intervene or interact with them and to experience life  beyond her fourteen years.<br />   The story is very touching and certain scenes will linger in each readers&#146; memory. Especially moving  is the conflict Susie suffers when her critically ill father&#145;s life hangs in limbo following a heart attack. Susie, feeling lonely in her heaven, really wants his death but  realizes how selfish her wish is. The author finds a particularly heartwarming resolution for this chapter. <br />     The chilling rape murder scene, which opens this novel  has the potential to be very gruesome.  The event occurs  in an underground room (symbolically foreshadowing a  &#147;grave&#147;) which is hidden in a cornfield. The unsuspecting Susie is lured there by a neighbor on her way home from school .By having this awful scene narrated retrospectively by an already deceased and emotionally detached Susie who is still  &#147;alive&#147; only in a different form ,  much of the terror ,tragedy, and pain she must have experienced and felt  are successfully removed from this narration. Written in simple prose , but conveying  deeply felt emotions, this book will affect the reader long afterwards.
B00006CXXU|4.0|She did really well on this album.  Most of the songs are incredible.  Although, Dirrty is an absolute silly perverted song, I just skp over it.

B00006L83N|5.0|Whereas _V: The New Mythology Suite_ was a meticulously crafted work that slowly drew its listener in, _The Odyssey_ returns to the Symphony X strike-and-recoil, where one fierce song comes quickly after another. With a cursory evaluation, it has more in common with _The Divine Wings of Tragedy_ than _V_. The huge keyboard orchestrations are mostly gone, but there are certain striking moments that lend credence to the band's name.<br />The good news is that although _The Odyssey_ does recall past Symphony X works, the band also pushes their boundaries and expands their musical palette. Specifically, all of the band's familiar elements have been heightened -- the metal side is heavier and the symphonic side is more, err, symphonic. And one thing is for sure, this album's was tempered for serious heaviness. Michael Romeo's guitar distortion sounds heavier than a sumo wrestler on a wooden toilet seat. The guitars, bass, and drums are stacked in such a way that they lays on thick cement slabs of metal that hurts so good. Romeo's unique, odd-metered riffing style has grown so refined that it makes everything before sound like a measly prototype, and it is more complex than ever. Rhythmically, the band is a lot more eloquent and complex, especially drummer Jason Rullo, who is a monster on this disc.<br />The album is not shy with the heavy, visceral lashes like \\"Inferno (Unleash the Fire)\\", \\"The Turning\\", or -- the apex of the album's heaviness -- \\"King of Terrors\\". This one is a vicious, carefully synchronized, odd-metered monster where the jackhammer riffing and Sir Russell Allen's vocals are as vicious as they come.<br />Without a doubt, listeners will find that the prevalence of keyboards has been toned down in contrast to the richly symphonic _V_. Keyboard maestro Michael Pinnella does still enhance the music appropriately, adding color and atmosphere. \\"Incantations of the Apprentice\\" is a song spearheaded by very aggressive drums (Rullo, you demon) and riffs, but also a mystical atmosphere enhanced by lyrics and creepily invigorating symphonic strains. On the topic of keyboards, Pinnella's lead tone is much, much better than before on this album. His ability is brought to the spotlight for \\"Awakenings\\", where his piano playing rages from thunderous (during the interlude) to beautifully florid (near the beginning)<br />Keybaords are also very dominant in \\"The Accolade II\\", an extension of the fantastic epic from _The Divine Wings of Tragedy_. It is lengthy piece that blends fresh ideas with some familiar melodies, but very intelligently and subtly integrated. The keyboards on this song are a definitely standout -- all lovely pianos, bells, violins -- but everything in this song is stunning: the vocals, the melodies, the story. The lyrics tell of a knight living in the wake of his father's death. The band makes all this work nicely because they are the most eloquent poets in the world of writing fantasy/medieval lyrics. When Allen sings, \\"I wish to stay, to be here with you -- you were my strength, how can I go on?\\", the vocal harmony and melody are heartbreaking. Romeo's guitar solo in this one is just unbelievable -- more emotional than anything he's done before. If the title track isn't your favorite song on the album, it will probably be this one.<br />So what about the 24-minute title track? Does it justify the cheesy (albeit supra-cool) power metal-esque cover art? Hell yes. Soundscapes so \\"symphonic\\" you'll think The Enid is back in business, amazing metallic maelstroms of guitar/keyboard heaviness, and an overall sense of grandeur suitable for Homer's epic of Greek mythology. The music and lyrics do an amazing job creating the sensation of a perilous sea voyage. Instrumentally, it creates the heave of the sea but not quite the salty ocean spray. The final movement has one of the most uplifting choruses I've ever heard -- \\"Triumphant, Champion of Ithaca!\\" This song is so good it's sick...without a doubt, it is one of thebest metal epics ever recorded. Yep, it's true. \\"The Odyssey\\" isn't the only song on the album based on another story either. The aforementioned \\"King of Terrors\\" is about Edgar Allan Poe's _The Pit and the Pendulum_.<br />If you get the limited edition (which you should), you get a beautiful slipcase. I don't know who did the cover art, but the colors they put into this thing are nearly hypnotizing in bright light. (Best fantasy cover art ever!) The booklet is also expanded with great studio pictures and band commentary for every song. Finally, there is the bonus track \\"Masquerade\\"  the remake of a song from their debut. Naturally, with Sir Russell Allen on vocals and a much better recording, the song is pretty darn awesome. It is also the only taste you'll get of the band's old Queen-like vocal harmonies on this disc. (The song originally appeared on the rare _Prelude to the Millennium_ compilation.)<br />I'm not sure what everyone will think of this. It's less elaborate than prog metal but (much) heavier and more embellished than johnny power metal (even the good power metal like Sonata Arctica). Symphony X fans will enjoy it, either way, I think - at the very least, I'd put it as an equal to the amazing _V_, perhaps better. That's saying something, I think.best metal epics ever recorded.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm writing this mostly to increase its rating, but the only thing I have to say is, before writing a review you should listen to the whole album at least two times, that's the only way you'll realize why it's so brilliant and IMHO the best album of the 90s and one of the top ten ever.
B00004STUL|5.0|This is one of the best movies you will ever watch.It has everything,laughfter,sadness, and most of all action.the first time I watched it, I thoght it was awsome but the second and third time I watched it became one of my all time favroit movies because I understood it a little more. Will smith and Martin Lawrence (which are my favroit acters) were outstanding. I got this DVD about 3 weekes ago and Ive seen it about twnty times and Im still not bored of it. I have seen almost every movie for Will smith and Martin Lawrence and this is the best acting Ive seen from both. Best of all there both togeher and they make an awsome team.

B000002H2H|5.0|I just dont know where to start. This is the first thrash album I ever owned and I must say it blew me away. This cd is a nice getaway from all that crap on the radio nowadays.People think that Avril Lavigne has talent? I have to laugh. These guys could blow her clear into the sky after playing one chord. Kirk's awesome riffs, Cliff's eerie bass, Lars' tireless drumming combined with James'gravelly voice is just excellent. Here are the tracks:<br />1.Fight Fire With Fire-The mellow chords in the beginning are just classic.Then comes the thrash part.This was the first thrash song I ever heard and I knew then I would be a thrash fan. Kirk's solo and James saying \\"We all shall die\\" after the first chorus only helped more.<br />2.Ride the Lightning-All about how bad the death penalty is. Co-written by Dave Mustaine of Megadeth(another awesome band).Kirk's solo is stunning at almost two minutes long!<br />3.For Whom the Bell Tolls-The eerie bells at the start are just timeless. Cliff turns his bass way up on this one. I dont know if you can bang your head to this one but its still an excellent track. Youll sing the chorus in the shower.<br />4.Fade to Black-This is a classic, plain and simple. It starts off with an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar going at the same time but its pretty mellow so dont start moshing yet. Then it goes into the slow-paced but catchy song about suicide. Then the song picks up the pace and Kirk plays what is probably his best solo ever.<br />5.Trapped Under Ice-Some say this song is filler. I couldnt disagree more.The song is just so frantic-paced, you cant help but thrash your room to it. Kirk's playing is simply wild. I like the line \\"I am dying to live\\" in the chorus because thats the way I feel in my life.<br />6.Escape-Even James said this song was worthless. I dont know what it is but I love this song. Probably because I can relate to the lyrics. Its not a jaw dropping song but it teaches a good lesson. The line \\"Life's for my own to live my own way\\" says it all.<br />7.Creeping Death-C'mon you all know this song kicks a**. Kirk's solo makes this song even more complete. I like story being told in the song. It gives it more depth. \\"So let it be written, so let it be done, to kill the first born pharaoh's son, im creeping death.\\"<br />8.The Call of Ktulu-This is an awesome way to end such a killer album. Excellent instrumental that clocks in at almost nine minutes. The reason its so good is probably because Dave Mustaine helped write this one too.<br />So there you have it. One of the best thrash albums in existence. You are not a true metalhead until youve listened through this thrash masterpiece. A great way to start off a Metallica (or any metal) collection. All hail thrash, the true musical talent...
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This warm, lush recording of Dire Straits third, and to most fans, best album, is an almost continuous wall of beautiful music. Mark Knopfler, probably all of 30 when he penned this classic, plays guitar and writes songs that will break your heart. I suspect that most of this music was recorded live, with little dubbing, so powerful and moving is the sound. The lead song, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; is a bittersweet ode to love and loss. Most of the other songs have love story elements to them. I think I was 15 when I first heard this music; it's as moving 21 years later as it was then. Buy it.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is a film to meditate while watching it. Try to be alone, no phone callings, relaxed... and enter into this vivid picture of our world, the best and the worst. There's a sacred vibration all along (&quot;baraka&quot;), your intelligence is accounted as spectator/witness with no need to send you judgements of what-is. You see for yourself and understand.
0316666343|5.0|This book was an amazing novel.  It was an easy yet emotional read and just a wonderfully written story.  After you read it, you want someone else to read it so they can experience what you've just experienced.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I just don't like Gwyneth paltrow.  She bothers me.  Perhaps that's why I did not enjoy this version of Emma as much as \\"Jane Austen's Emma\\" with the stunning Kate Beckinsale in the title role.  Kate has a spirit that Emma possesses and Gwyneth lacks.<BR>Both are faithful adaptations of the book, but I just found the other one had more true spirit.<BR>Also, while Mark Stong, who was Mr. Knightley in the Beckinsale version, is not as classically handsome as the very cute Jeremy Northern (or Northam?  I haven't got my copy with me to check) I found him to be much sexier.  He also seems to exude manliness in an almost palpable way, giving me all kinds of interesting thoughts.  Northam, again, is very handsome, but too droll for the forthright Knightley.<BR>I have compared the two twice now, and found that this version is just blah compared to the Beckinsale/Strong one.
B00006LLNU|5.0|When you never thought Sigur Ros could make another CD better than &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;, they did it. I am talking about &quot;( )&quot; the new musical production from Sigur Ros. I could judge this as Sigur Ros's most beautiful and well done CD, the songs are spectacular and at least I have cried every single time i hear them, it touches something in your soul. And it is that they mix all the most strange instruments with the singers awesome voice that transport you in a fascinant journey. I personally like a lot this group and recommend this CD to anyone who likes excellent and different music like no other. That is Sigur Ros &quot;( )&quot;
B0000560X0|5.0|I've been a George Benson fan for many years. This is a Great live recording that accounts for many different styles of George Benson's music.  He recorded this concert over a period of a few days and the accompanying musicians changed for different styles.<br />This has some of the newer music as well as some of the old standards you would expect.<br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the video includes a Wide Screen anamorphic video that is very well done.  If you have a nice home theater, this will impress you.
052594527X|3.0|I picked up this book because I had read other books by this author and enjoyed them.  THis book was the same--a very fast read, easy, if somewhat implausible story, and an interesting story idea.<br />Vermeer's household hires a new maid, Griet, to clean his studio and help around the house.  Griet has &quot;wide-set eyes&quot; that seem to attract attention from everyone.  Vermeer becomes entranced with having her sit for him for a portrait--&quot;Girl with Pearl Earring.&quot;<br />This is a story that shows what might have happened, or what moved Vermeer to paint this picture.  It's ok, but not spectacular.
0767020308|5.0|I reviewed the Gwyneth version and stated my antipathy to Ms. Paltrow there.  I just don't like her, really, and found her sadly unconvincing as the high-spirited, myschievious, and slightly smug Emma.<BR>Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, was totally believable and pretty enough to make us believe that she had reason to be smug.<BR>I just found that this version had a spirit the other one lacks.  Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley was perfect, I found him incredibly sexy without being so handsome that you couldn't understand why Emma had never even thought of him \\"that way\\".  He was a MAN in a way the other Emma's Knightley, while very handsome, just wasn't.  And Mr. Knightley was quite a man in the book as well.  Strong's chemistry with Beckinsale is very compelling, as well.<BR>This version is also more atmospheric.  Most indoor scenes are fairly dimly lit, making us really feel as if we are in the candle-lit room, instead of watching a movie.  The scenery is beautiful and the secondary cast-particularly Prunella Scales-interesting and fun to watch.  We really feel, in this film, the social structures of the time.<BR>Aso, the script for this film does not attempt to \\"improve\\" Jane Austen's work, as the Paltrow version does.  There are no added scenes here simply for effect.<BR><BR>All in all, I found this version delightful, and have watched it many times.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Prior to this album- I thought of Christina Aguilera as a commercial pop singer (ie-kind of boring) with a phenomenal voice. Just the songs she was singing were really nothing special. This album does away with any negative thought I had.  Her voice is amazing-nearly all the songs great (somne ballads, some funky, some rock &amp; roll).  I would compare this album to Nikka Costa's &quot;Everybody Got their something&quot; (another great album)&amp; Janet Jackson. Christina Aguilera-with this album- has so far outclassed Britney, Mandy Moore &amp; Jessica Simpson (all often grouped together in articles)-its not even worth mentioning those other names in the same sentence.  A purchase you will not regret.
6303965415|3.0|~~<BR>Storyline: <BR>(Past story) Rich Girl meets Navy Boy, they fall in love. Nosy stepmother-figure decides he's not good enough for her little angel; Girl dumps Boy. <BR>(Movie, present time) Eight years later, Wentworth returns a wealthy Man.  Anne, now extremely pale(someone throw a little sunshine her way) and unwanted, is forced into a re-acquaintance when spendthrift effeminate father has to lease family mansion to Wentworth's relations. She's packed off to her married sister's place while daddy and the beloved sister waltz their way to Bath. <BR>Anne spends the next forever (7? 8? hours) moping around while Wenworth makes a play for an empty-headed cheerleader-type. Cheerleader throws herself off a walkway for the joy of it and Anne takes control while everyone else goes into hysterics. Wentworth (suddenly looking at Anne in a whole new way and realising that maybe the dominatrix fantasies aren't out of the cards with English women after all) runs for it while the girlfriend's unconscious. Anne returns to her father (in Bath), and surprise, surprise, but Wentworth appears soon after. Man and Woman are reduced to Boy and Girl again while they tiptoe around the fact that they're itching for a shag. But life ends happily and all is well; boy and girl settle for a public kiss (scandalous stuff) and riding off into the sunset on the trusty horse.....er, ship.<br />Personal impression: Book was better. Movie went too long, and this is coming from someone who fell in love with the 1996 version of Pride and Prejudice, which has 2 tapes and goes for longer than Gone With the Wind.<br />I made the mistake of watching the movie before the book. Don't. If you're going to watch the movie, read first so that you'll understand all the little nuances that don't really explain themselves. Overall, I've seen better, but also worse.
B000001Y42|4.0|First off, I know rap/rock has gotten a bad rap from idiot rock purists, but let me remind you that if R&B and blues didn't get together, there wouldn't be any rock and roll. Enough of that, on to the album. Limp Bizkit and their mentors Korn would launch the second wave of rap and funk influenced bands on the music world with their debut Three Dollar Bill Y'all. This is plain FUNKY! Aside from their big hit Faith, there is great material on<BR>this album. Limp are what the Red Hot Chili Peppers use to be before they became sensitive. Even though they would become bigger with their next two albums, Significant Other(their best and my favorite) and Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water, this one captures their raw energy. Go get it!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is incredible! It has been stuck in my stereo since I bought it! I like it more everytime I listen to it. Forget everything you have ever read or heard about Christina and listen to this CD. You will have an entirely different opinion and won't be able to put it down! This girl can sing! My personal favorites are &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot;. This CD truly shows how versatile Christina is and how truly talented! Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed!
B00005N9CV|3.0|Most of the reason, I suppose, that I'm as frustrated as I am with this album is that I really LIKE Diana Krall. Unfortunately, however, she seems to lack whatever is necessary to make most of the songs on this album worth even trying to listen to. In some cases, it's a lack of playfulness. In others, it's a lack of saucy attitude. In general, it's a sad lack of enthusiasm, resulting in a generally dead, monotonous collection of songs. It can certainly be relaxing, but if I weren't paying close attention, I might take the album for one incredibly long, slow song instead of the ten that it is.<br />I found &quot;S'Wonderful,&quot; &quot;I Remember You,&quot; and &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well&quot; almost painful to listen to. They're just sung in such a dead-pan manner that they almost seem like a parody of themselves. I think she does adequately well on songs like &quot;Cry Me A River,&quot; &quot;Besame Mucho,&quot; &quot;Maybe You'll Be There,&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love.&quot; The diffference is subtle, but I think she's considerably more emotive in these tracks than she is in most of the others.<br />Over all, I agree with other reviewers that it's time for Krall to snap out of her daze and put a little more passion and attitude in her songs.
B00006CXXU|1.0|Boring and pathethic. The songs are boring and the change of image is pathetic. Does an \\"artist\\" have to come up with a new image everytime he or she comes up with a new album? They should know by now that ONLY Madonna can do that! Anyway, \\"Stripped\\" is highly recommended for those who have insomnia. As for Christina, if this is her concept and understanding of \\"maturity,\\" goodness, I'd rather be immature.  And one more thing -- you're NOT \\"Beautiful,\\" girl.
0920236251|5.0|This is one of the most stupendous books ever written.  Really.  The princess is no-nonsense in a way that should teach most adults a lesson and the pictures and characters will endear themselves even to avowed book-hating children.
B000002572|5.0|This is quite simply one of the top 15 rock albums ever recorded. Case closed
B000000W6X|4.0|I hate pop.  I hate rock.  I hate rap.  I hate country.  I hate boy bands.  I hate girl bands.  I hate anything I hear on the radio these days.  <br />But I LOVE Massive Attack.  Their music takes multiple genres (pop, soul, dance, R&amp;B, etc.) and blends them all into dark, hypnotic tunes that sound so much more intelligent than the mainstream stuff.  After listening to a few samples of their music, I knew I had to get one of their CD's.  &quot;Mezzanine&quot; sounded a bit too heavy for my tastes, so I decided to get &quot;Protection&quot;.<br />I love the title track; it's got a classy drum beat, a throbbing bass, Tracy Thorn's searing vocals, a brilliant use of rain-like sounds in the end, and surprisingly meaningful lyrics.  My other favorite songs are the two instrumentals, both of which feature Craig Armstrong's sweeping piano work: &quot;Weatherstorm&quot; is the perfect song to play in the background during a dinner party, and &quot;Heat Miser&quot; is one of the top three most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Just picture embers crackling and smoke rising from the fireplace on a cold winter's night.  <br />Normally, rap is the last thing I want to hear while I do my studies.  &quot;Karmacoma&quot; and &quot;Eurochild&quot;, however, featuring 3-D and Tricky's whispered raps, with a low, melodic baritone that is not overpowering like the all-too-familiar gangsta rap I hear.  &quot;Karmacoma&quot; features earthy reggae-driven beats, while &quot;Eurochild&quot; has an instrumental chorus as spellbinding as the rap itself.  <br />Nicolette's songs are terrific too.  Her seductive voice shines in both the groovy &quot;Three&quot; and the lyrical &quot;Sly&quot;, the latter of which features an amazing orchestral composition by Craig Armstrong.  Additionally, Tracy Thorn pours out her voice again among a distorted but pleasant tune in &quot;Better Things&quot;, and while &quot;Spying Glass&quot; took a while to grow on me, I began to like Horace Andy's raspyvocals in this groovy downtempo dance tune.<br />The one song I didn't like--and I'm sure you've heard this before--is the live cover of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; at the end.  In it, Horace Andy's vocals don't sound sophisticated at all; just annoying and out-of-tune.  The drum beat is somewhat engaging, but just when you think the song is about to come to a good part, it totally falls apart--as if the band was experiencing some technical problems.  Overall, this track sounds like a broken TV set.<br />If you can ignore this last track, however, I'm quite sure you'll love this CD.  It may take a while for you to get used to this different style of music, but it grows on you over time.  Next on my shopping list: Massive Attack's debut album, &quot;Blue Lines&quot;!
B00002E23E|5.0|To judge this based on the technical work alone is to be lacking in the concept of what it was all about. This clearly showed two different worlds of Led Zep.. (maybe even 3)There was the real world, aka working the the 40 acre spread..the family, the stream, the memories...Then there was Led Zep, the band, the performance and what we all expected... a band that held their own through the waters of time. Between all that, was the mystique... The lords and wenches, the castles, the desires,and the downfalls.. This will always be my fav band of all time and I hope that destiny serves them well wherever their ships may sail.
B00006FXB6|5.0|After the winner &quot;R&quot;, one could think the QOTSA would start a downward spiral and start doing bad music or repeating themselves.But this record (almost) reaches perfection.A great piece of it goes to the gamut of special guests.From Natasha Schneider (Eleven) to Paz Lenchantin (APC), they add a special flavour to the songs.Even Twiggy Ramirez is there! (although only as a D.J.).But the best addiction was David Grohl.His drumming sets mathematically with the guitar and bass.He was never been so good, even in his Nirvana days.His intention was to play only three songs initially, but he eneded up doing the whole record, even touring with them for a little while.The singer/guitarist Josh Homme is an inspired songwriter.Delivering pop gems like &quot;No one knows&quot; and &quot;Go with the flow&quot;, or taking the walls down with &quot;A Song for the Dead&quot; or &quot;Sky is Falling&quot; he practically makes no mistakes.We cannot forget the bald madman bassitst Nick Oliveri throwing a beautiful tantrum on &quot;6 shooter&quot; or being calm on sort of a punk love song &quot;Gonna leave&quot;.The misterious and dark Mark Lenegan's vocals appear on some songs, given them a gloomy atmosphere, specially on &quot;hanging tree&quot;.The sad tune &quot;Mosquito Song&quot; closes the circle, making you want to listen to the record all over again.This is the best rock record of 2002 so far.Get the limited special edition while you can,you won't be disappointed at all.And there is an easter egg: Rewind the 1st track to find a hidden song! ( the real song for the deaf).
B00006HBUA|5.0|I don't understand why all the critics were so hard on this movie. I thought it was one of the best movies I saw all year. The movie is cartoonishly fun and doesn't take itself seriously unlike Spider-man.(Which was also excellent.)The movie was made to be a nostalgic good time. As a long time fan of the cartoon, I loved how they were able to recreate the cartoon characters without trying to change them. Oh sure, there's a bit of potty humor in it, but geez, this is the age we live in. Frankly, it wasn't nearly as bad as some other movies employing the same technique. It was quite mild. The cast was incredible. Sarah Michelle Gellar can play virtually any role she wants and make believable. She's great as Daphne. I couldn't believe how dead on Matthew Lilliard was as Shaggy, he even got the voice right! As for the all the people who dissed this movie for whatever reason, why don't you enjoy something for what it is, a light-hearted adventure.
B0000009SI|5.0|Whenever anybody asks me what the best album to buy as a first Zappa album, I tell them either \\"We're Only In It For The Money\\" or this one, and I usually give this one a little higher boost.<br /> Why? Because this is the album that got me into FZ at the tender age of 11 years old. By accident....<br /> One balmy spring day in early '75, my (then) uptight, Catholic, ex-John Birch Society mother came home with a stack of records from the local Ridgecrest library that she thought looked appropriate for kids. My sister and I looked through the stack until.....Apostrophe! We looked at each other in shock: Mom brought home a ZAPPA record! At that time, only kids with hipster bros & sis's had heard his records. We knew the rumours: he talked about \\"naughty\\" things on his records! Was mom \\"letting her hair down\\"? No. She just thought that \\"the guy on the record cover looks like a jazz musician with a sense of humor\\", and \\"the song titles are funny\\".<br /> Cool! Diane & I ran to the record player & were therein initiated into the universe of Frank Zappa. Of course we giggled through the obligatory scatology of \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\" & the adventures of Nanook, but there were other songs here that made some slowly emerging gears in my 11 year old head start to turn. What was so important about \\"St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast\\"? What was \\"Cosmik Debris\\", and why was the man \\"jiving\\" him with it? Why did I like the instrumental \\"Apostrophe\\", and why did I feel in my gut that it was different somehow that other rock solos? Why did the man have the argument with the dog after the discussion of the importance of personal hygene in \\"Stink Foot\\"? My pre-adolescent brain began to burn with one of the most subversive things that rock n' roll ever did to kids. Sex? No (well, okay, maybe a little..). Drugs? No.<BR>The frightening answer was......questions!! I was beginning to THINK FOR MYSELF, stimulated by Zappa's imaginative absurdity!!<br /> Now, as an adult, I 've figured outthose answers. \\"St. Alfonzo's\\" is a satire about religious hypocrisy & behaivior.<BR>\\"Cozmik Debris\\" is a stab at mocking the \\"new age\\", and its voodoo b.s. \\"Apostrophe\\" is a solo in the Lydian mode, highly unusual. And the dog & the man were arguing about semantics.<br /> Thanks, Frank, for making this guy think. Too bad, other adults didn't get warped like I did.<br /> It's not too late. Buy Apostrophe.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Catapulted by momentum from \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", the astounding achievement of \\"Band of Brothers\\" was badly undermined by its ill-timed September 11th premiere.  Based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose, this HBO series follows Easy Company, an elite American airborne (parachute) company, all the way from training camp to German occupation duty.  The death toll amongst these men was horrific, and reverence for their sacrifice clings onto every frame.  Scattered hopelessly across Normandy, this unit wrenched the crucial town of Carentan from ammo-starved Germans, participated in the massive airborne debacle of Operation Market Garden (rescuing many British paratroopers), suffered horrible losses in at the Battle of the Bulge, held off an \\"offensive\\" at Haguenau, and finally seized the \\"Eagle's Nest\\", Hitler's personal luxury perch in the mountains.<br />The highly effective style pioneered by \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (steady-cam with washed out colors) suffuses the entire series with a gritty documentary feel.  Occasionally an obvious CGI or studio shot will clash with lush location shooting, but overall the production values are staggering.  Even minor historical details are studiously reproduced, but, like \\"Private Ryan\\", the camera never wallows in indulgent spectacle.  The miniseries format is used to full advantage to present a truly comprehensive account of war from a wide variety of viewpoints that normally can't be appreciated.  Since the events of history itself do not neatly line themselves up in the sort of dramatic arc viewers are accustomed to, some may leave the series with a sense that it is dramatically uneven.  Each episode, usually a bit over an hour long, is elegantly introduced in both mood and content by interviews with actual survivors from the company.  <br />Like the best of war films, the emphasis is not on bloodshed and action, but on human relationship and suffering within the company.  The performances, by a dedicated cast of largely unknown players, are uniformly excellent, but very little help is given to the first time viewer in identifying the multitude of war-weary faces (often, even after several important appearances, a character's full name is never mentioned).  While this can be frustrating for new viewers, it allows for dialogue unencumbered by forced introductions and creates immense replay value, with new insights appearing with every viewing.<br />The character confusion is alleviated nicely by some of the DVD's reference features.  Accompanying each episode is a picture gallery of the important names and faces in that episode, as well as a glossary of terminology and the general locations within Europe.  A somewhat less useful timeline is included, and a few of the most important characters are given nice dramatic collages (perhaps used when promoting the series).<br />The DVD offers 5.1, DTS, and surround sound, all of which are richly spectacular.  Only Spanish is offered in subtitle, and (unfortunately) no commentary tracks accompany any of the episodes.  A 30 minute \\"Making Of\\" feature briefly describes techniques used in filming in a promotional sort of way, but it is not as promotional as a feature describing the gala screening at Normandy (very few of the veteran's reactions are shown) nor as obnoxious as a Jeep advertisement that somehow snuck onto the disc.  <br />Two further wonderful additions are provided in the DVD: a full and moving documentary, consisting solely of the gripping interviews of Easy Company's survivors, and Ron Livingston's (Office Space) thorough and very likeable video diary of the actor's boot camp.
6305841861|5.0|Being a teenager and into horror movies in the 80's was great. You had 'Dawn of the Dead/Day of the Dead' etc. from Romero, early 'Friday the 13th' movies and plenty of great older flicks like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.<br />The beauty was that, in those days, the special effects were more like works of art.. tactile ones. Not always good ones.. and certainly not general admission - but they were great for their time. CGI wasn't readily available in those days.. so when you saw 10 gallons of blood - it WAS 10 gallons of real fluid.. not some souped-up Amiga 3000 Video Toaster shot.<br />Anyway - back then Raimi ruled the schlock horror genre with this one and Bruce was/is one of the best the B-Movie leads ever - great delivery of his cheesy Arnold-esque one liners.<br />Check it out if you like tounge-in-cheek and horror. It's not unintentionally funny like say 'Bloodfeast' or over-the-top stupid like say 'The Toxic Avenger' .. just a fun and well done horror film.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album has inspired a generation of Metal. If Nirvana had not released this album, we would all be in a very different artistic scene today. In fact, we would be engulfed by thousands of materialistic, manufactured bands like Hearsay and Liberty X.<BR>Some die-hard fans and critics of the band maintain that Nirvana saved Artistic expression from a slow and painful death.<BR>Whatever Nirvana did for us all, this is just a fantastic album. <BR>From the brutal slamathon of \\"Smells like teen spirit\\", to the slow burning throb of \\"In Bloom\\", this album rocks and moshes like a kangaroo on Prozac.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Well, The Thing is Carpenter's masterpiece, but The Fog is a criminally neglected great horror movie. Everything about it is perfect--the California coastal town that feels like it's in New England, the marvellously atmospheric effects of the fog, the terrifying but sympathetic villains, the themes of encroaching and inevitable danger and recurring, miasmic guilt, the sense of isolation reinforced by the sea, lonely ships, lighthouses...the ways that a terrible danger manages to unite disparate people...even Adrienne Barbeau turns in a superb performance here as a funky and increasingly distraught yet always resourceful radio-show host, trapped alone in her lonely radio-tower-lighthouse....i cant believe this incredibly elegant and frightening movie has received such little fanfare. This SE DVD is excellent all around and well worth owning.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I have never heard anyone address the issues of aging and death as compellingly and poignantly as Johnny Cash does.  The music is passionate, the new compositions are very strong.  Even covers of other artists songs I never cared for are revitalized for me. If the man is anything like his songs, he is a man of integrity, complexity, honesty and character. I have no reason to believe he isn't. Can't wait for American V.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Austin Powers 3 really could've been better. I was cracking up, but I was also thinking as I saw it \\"How perverted!\\" If you think disguisting things are funny, you'll love this movie. I thought it was hilarious, but the movie without the jokes, was pretty bad. It was mostly \\"potty humor\\" and my sister who is 10 didn't get any of the jokes when she saw it, and I don't recommend it for kids 11 or under. <BR>   The first two Austin Powers movies were way better than the third. It had a bad storyline, and a really bad/predictable/cheezy ending. I think mainly one of the villains made it worse. Goldmember. If he hadn't been in it, then maybe it would've been better. <BR>   On the other hand, I hope they make another one with Beyonce. She did really well. I hope that was her big break. She was great as Foxy Cleopatra. She fit the part well. <BR>   When Fat... returned, that was bizarre as well. He was a sumo wrestler, and I don't think he'll be returning in these movies. I know they will be making another one though becuase of how it ended. The beginning was rather weird as well. Now I'm not going to spoil it for you who've not seen it, but if you plan on seeing all the austin powers, but have heard really bad reviews on this one, to get the next movie, you probably will have to see it.
B0000027G6|5.0|This score won an academy award and with good reason. The music is heartfelt, captivating, and leaves you breathless. It is a majestic epic score with stirring themes that make it a true classic. The main theme titled &quot;The John Dunbar Theme&quot; is a dramatic sequence with gorgeous string lines. It appears in several other places throughout the score. There are also adventurous parts in the score as an addition. &quot;Pawnee Attack&quot;, &quot;Journey to Fort Sedgewick&quot;, &quot;Ride to Fort Hays&quot;, and &quot;The Buffalo Hunt&quot; contain bold brass lines along with the usual strings and percussion. I really don't have much to say about this one because it is so good. Just buy it and take a listen. The music will describe itself.
B00005RDSM|5.0|Peter Pan is one of the greatest films Disney has ever made. Whenever the name &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is mentioned, virtually everybody thinks of Disney's version of Peter, Tinker Bell and Captian Hook. The story has never before been told so well. I loved this movie when I was in kindergarten and I love it even more now that I'm an adult. This movie gets an A+
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X is easily one of the most talented bands making music. They are constantly evolving while being able to maintain their uniqueness. On the Odyssey, they have elected to go for a much heavier sound than what they normally do. At first, I was unsure about this new direction, I typically don't enjoy really heavy stuff that much. But this CD is great! The guitars stand out more than in previous albums, which I like. Michael Romeo's tremendous riffing has perhaps never been better. Russel Allen's vocals go from low growling to gorgeous melodies in the space of a single song; he really has great range. The title track to this album is wonderful. As others have commented, the intro sounds like it belongs in a movie. The patches used are wonderful and make it sound as if Symphony X was playing with an actual orchestra :) Breathtaking!<br />If you are a fan of Symphony X already, get this now! You won't be dissapointed! If you like neoclassical rock/metal, get this now too! A truly excellent album by one of the best bands in the business.
0792833201|5.0|Poltergeist is one heck of a fun movie ride. Steven Speilberg and Tobe Hooper undoubtedly created the best ghost movie, and made it extremely hard to beat. Although recent ones have almost succeeded (e.g. The Others, The Sixth Sense), Poltergeist still remains number one.<br /> Speilberg, co-writer, tells the story of a normal, suburban family who begins to notice their house is becoming a little haunted. When their youngest daughter disappears into the house, they call upon a group of psychologists to help them with finding their daughter and relieving their house of the evil inside. This story is amazing on film as we watch the Freelings see the ghosts do tricks with chairs to becoming more sinister with clown attacks (Personally, one of the creepiest scenes in the film).<br /> What made Poltergeist even better is the chemistry that was found in the entire cast. The family of the Freelings seemed so real. It's not hard to believe that they are an actual family. Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are actually lovely (Weird choice of word, but it fits) as the loving parents, and their show of emotional range was right on. Heather Rourke, who played Carole Anne, is an amazing actress for her age, and handles everything with quaint little charm. The remaining of the cast were all wonderful, fairly developed, and you cared about their outcome in the movie. I must mention Zelda Rubinstein. She played the little, creepy psychic and her part added some nice humour while adding creepiness to the film.<br /> Sadly, WB has given us a bare DVD. Only the trailer is present within the dvd. There were rumours that a special edition was coming, but they were scratched as WB denied them or either scratched their idea. But I'm happy with the movie on DVD as it is one of the best.<br /> The best, indeed. Poltergeist is my #1 pick for ghost / haunted house movie. If there is ever one that succeeds it, then it's going to be mighty darn good.
B000002BNB|3.0|Just as Terminator X was Public Enemy's secret weapon, The RZA is The Wu-Tang Clan's: While other members get all the attention, producer RZA, quietly working behind the scenes, has been the force behind Wu-Tang's raw, all over the map, Bruce Lee-meets-Gladys Knight sound.<br />RZA has done it again on Ghostface Killah's Ironman, arguably the best of the group's \\"solo\\" albums to date. Attacking from all angles, Ironman is classic Wu-Tang, piecing together Al Green and Jackson 5 samples, gospel choruses, kung fu soundbites and piano vamps into something unpredictable and vital-sounding.<br />With guest rappers like Method Man, Raekwon and U-God on virtually every track, it may as well be a Wu-Tang album. There's even a ballad with Mary J. Blige, on which Ghostface Killah raps, \\"Word up, Mommy&#151;I love you.\\"
6301773551|3.0|Star Wars - Episode IV, A New Hope is an entertaining, if rather dated, voyage into the mysterious depths of outer space.  Unfortunately films of the science fiction genre tend to age quickly due to rapid advances in technology (as evidenced here by some very static inter-ship battle sequences).  However, the essence of the film remains unchanged, and modern viewers are just as likely to feel uncomfortable in the presence of the black and foreboding Darth Vader as audiences of 25 years ago.<br />Vader belongs to the Empire - a consortium of power-hungry and remorseless warlords whose aim of galactic domination is threatened by the theft of some secret plans.  Enter young Luke Skywalker, who - with the aid of smuggler Han Solo, Princess Leia, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, a 7-foot Wookie, and two incredibly camp droids - must ensure these plans reach the rebel base and are used to destroy the Empire.<br />The setting gives the designers free rein to create some imaginative non-human beings, and these range from the sublime (such as the majestic yak-like Banthas used as desert transport) to the ridiculous.  A collection of people wearing masks reminiscent of department store Halloween costumes does not make for a very convincing inter-species frontier town.<br />Apart from this, and the almost unbelievably abysmal target accuracy of the bad guys, there is a lot to like about this movie.  The characters are clearly defined, and although ostensibly the story is spearheaded by Mark Hamill, it is Harrison Ford as sarcastically laconic space cowboy Han Solo who carries the film.  The passage of time may have slightly dimmed the power of the light sabers wielded in the battle between the Force and the Empire, but they are by no means extinguished.
B000067CPX|3.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers hasn't always appeared to be the band most likely to age gracefully. After all, these are guys who've battled horrific drug addiction, line-up shuffles, and a death in the family, and whose oft-imitated style of funk-punk spent the mid-'90s falling almost as far from commercial prominence as swing or ska did a few years later.<br />But then came 1999's Californication, which not only refined and updated the group's sound, but also deepened it, tempering RHCP's hedonism with a heartsickness that won old fans back into the fold. (A couple of killer singles, \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Around The World\\" and \\"Otherside\\", didn't hurt).<br />Now, its ship righted, the band returns with By The Way, which continues on Californication's more mature path, almost to a fault. The sticker on the packaging all but promises diminished returns: \\"Over 68 minutes of music\\" isn't always an enticement with a band so prone to padding, and a few duds pop up here and there. \\"Universally Speaking\\" isn't quite as toothless as its worst line&#151;\\"Simply put, I saw your love stream flow\\"&#151;but it's close, and \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" sounds as musically leaden as its target is obvious. But the best tracks more than overshadow the filler, as \\"Can't Stop,\\" \\"I Would Die For You,\\" and the lush future hit \\"Tear\\" match heartfelt confessionals with ingratiating, almost overbearing pop hooks. By The Way inevitably suffers for its familiarity: Had it followed 1995's so-so One Hot Minute instead of Californication, it would qualify as a revelation instead of a worthy retread. But the fact that the group is standing at all has to count as a triumph in and of itself. Its continued musical relevance, with all the high expectations that engenders, is just a borderline-miraculous bonus.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I saw this movie back in June and knew when I walked out of the theatre, it was a dvd must.  It's charming, sweet, funny, sad.  I've had my preorder in for a few months & just can't wait to own this!
B00005NEZ3|2.0|As a supergroup, side project, and novelty act all in one, Gorillaz literally looks good on paper. Not only does Gorillaz feature Dan &quot;The Automator&quot; Nakamura and Blur's Damon Albarn (a.k.a. 2-D), but its membership also boasts illustrator and Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett (a.k.a. Murdoc), who envisioned the group as an animated mock band akin to Josie And The Pussycats, but with hipper credentials. Gorillaz is every bit as hit-or-miss as expected, but to its credit, the hits on its self-titled debut sound more impressive and infectious than the misses sound like indulgent flops. It helps that indulgence seems to be part of the point. Gorillaz offers its members the unique opportunity to act as cartoonish as they want, by performing as alter egos free from great expectations. Ranging from hip-hop to art-rock to dub, often all at once, Gorillaz's songs sound suitably casual, and often surprisingly endearing. Standouts include &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; and &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; which uses melodica to fuse spaghetti westerns with King Tubby. A trio of rock songs, the arty &quot;5/4,&quot; &quot;M1 A1,&quot; and &quot;Punk,&quot; recall Albarn's later Blur work, while &quot;Man Research (Clapper)&quot; and &quot;Sound Check (Gravity)&quot; find smart ways to tackle techno and balladry, respectively. Of course, Nakamura knows how to provide both background and ingenious foreground, whether in Dr. Octagon, as half of Handsome Boy Modeling School, or, most recently, on Deltron 3030, a spectacular collaboration with Del Tha Funkee Homosapien which also featured a cameo from Albarn. Albarn, for his part, appears to be having fun, especially by comparison to his work on Blur's last dark, messy album. Like a would-be Mel Blanc, he lends the album several distinct voices, ranging from punk sneer to man-on-the-street English slang. But, predictably, Albarn is overshadowed when the indefatigable Del (a.k.a. Russel) makes an appearance on &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock The House.&quot; Given the nature of the collaboration, it wouldn't be surprising if Gorillaz never reconvened for a sequel, but that might be for the best. With the weight of a follow-up clouding the no-strings fun, the band's charm might not compensate for its lack of substance a second time.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am not a fan of Xtina at all.  It happened by chance, that I was in the record store buying a DVD player, when they had the Cd playing in the store.  The two songs that I heard were lovely so I decided to buy the album, just on a whim.  I was shocked with my purchase.  She has a lovely voice and the songs are wonderful.  I listen to this CD all day.

B000001E3V|3.0|I may be the only one to disagree with the raves this album received, but I think the Dominoes weren't particularly wonderful on these recorded performances.  Whitlock plays some pretty clunky piano - even misses a chord change or two. Radle plays steady but largely unimaginative bass.  Gordon acquits himself quite well until the over blown solo on Let It Rain.  As for Clapton - his voice is trashed, which kind of lets the emotion burn through in an effective way but technically it ain't great.  And, yeah, his guitar playing is ferocious, frenzied, and nervous.  He could have used a rhythm guitar player there because it sounds, to me, like he struggled to get the fills and lead in - something that Pete Townshend could do with much more agility.  That being said - I love Things Gotta Get Better in a Little While.  It's Clapton's true masterpiece.  It's better than anything else he's ever done...
B00000F3KL|5.0|First off this is a true story that actually occured, was researched intensively be the producers, and the director.  Not to mention they had people on set that were actually there,... Lastly I like to say that ColumbiaTristar did a fine job in making this film.  The cinematography was superb, the sound was like being there, excellent casting, as well as great acting, The CG was added nicely, and it all looked so real.  Not to mention the fact that is was a great story.
B000002A3T|2.0|I cringe any time I hear this album. It is painful to listen to.  It, along with A Momentary Lapse of Reason, are polar opposites of what Floyd used to be. Not just the sound, which for anyone should change over time, but in what it stands for, these albums have no message, no meaning.  It seems that Gilmour is trying WAY too hard to repeat old sounds that brought success. What comes out is supposed to be abstract I suppose, but is so annoyingly repititious that it is difficult to finish listening to the entire album.  It brings out a level of disgust that you wouldn't have known was in you.  This album, along with whatever new compilation is out today,is a shameful attempt to bank what they can off the Pink Floyd name. If you're new to Floyd I would suggest starting with DSOTM, Animals, WYWH... If you've already got all the old goodies and are considering buying this: DON'T! You'll regret it, we'll all just have to accept that the Floyd died in 1983. (sorry to be so negative but this album really is terrible) :(
B00003CX9Q|4.0|If you never buy a DVD again, you must get this one as your last. ET is the best movie to hit DVD ever and i don't think that i'll ever get another more enjoyable to watch.<BR>Not only do you get the original in all its glory, but also the re-mastered 2002 edition.<br />My favourite movie of all time, is surely going to get a work out. The only gripe is the packaging, there is no title on the spine which annoys me - otherwise it would be a 5 star event.
B000002OZY|5.0|I was a University Freshman when The Who released \\"Tommy\\" in 1969.  \\"Tommy\\" was unprecedented.  Elvis had produced a number of films with soundtrack albums.  The Beatles had produced the films / soundtrack albums \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help\\".  The Moody Blues had produced \\"Days Of Future Passed\\", a theme album.  But none of these works approached the sheer rock power of \\"Tommy\\".  Only the Rolling Stones could challenge the power of The Who, and the Rolling Stones had no comparable effort.<br />\\"Tommy\\" was *very* popular, but \\"Tommy\\" was expensive and supplies were limited -- an excellent album to purchase.  One classmate asked to borrow my copy so that he could record \\"Tommy\\" on the University's studio-grade reel-to-reel tape recorder.  I agreed, but I made him carry \\"Tommy\\" in a polyfoam cooler through the snow.<br />My friends and I interpreted the \\"Tommy\\" story literally -- a story.  We did not realize that \\"Tommy\\" partially was an adaption of Robert Heinlein's classic 1961 novel \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\", a novel that continues to affect Western counterculture.  We did not recognize that some societal aspects portrayed in \\"Tommy\\" were common in British rock culture, societal aspects now present in Twenty-First Century United States' culture.  We *did* recognize a powerful rock opus carrying a complex story compatible with the late-1960's United States counterculture.<br />\\"Tommy\\" has withstood the test of time -- the first, best and most popular rock opera.  Its instrumental and vocal artistry, its never-aging story and its *clarity* elevate it above subsequent rock milestone albums.
B000066C87|2.0|Gosford Park (Robert Altman, 2001)<br />I was truly a glutton for punishment this weekend&#151;not only a Joel Schumacher film, but one by Robert Altman, as well. Altman has been trying for thirty-two years to make another film as good as M*A*S*H. He hasn&#146;t succeeded yet, though Gosford Park is the closest he&#146;s come to it. Like M*A*S*H, Altman here assembles an exceptionally high-powered cast, containing too many both rising and established stars to single anyone out, and throws them into a situation; here, a hunting party. Mismarketed as a mystery film, this is actually something of a drawing-room drama.<br />Unfortunately, it seems Altman considered it a mystery film, as well, because the pace and character development necessary to films of the latter sort is utterly absent. The viewer is rushed through plotline after plotline, given almost nothing to go on in each episode and no time at all to get to know the characters. No one is onscreen long enough for us to develop an affinity for any of the plotlines (of which the much ballyhooed murder of the host, played by Michael Gambon [Longitude] is only one, and a minor one at that), and a few characters jump plotlines as readily as some characters jump from bed to bed.<br />There was much to work with here, and in a movie two or three times as long, it might have all been done justice. As it is, the performances by such brilliant actors as Emily Watson, Clive Owen, and Helen Mirren do nothing but hint at what might have been found had any of them had enough screen time to really start developing. (Mirren, as always, should be singled out; what little screen time she has is riveting.)<br />That Gosford Park was nominated for both Best Picture and Best Director in a year when such films as The Others, Donnie Darko, Monsters, Inc., Shrek, Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Man Who Wasn&#146;t There, (oh, you get the idea) were ignored for both awards is ludicrous. **
B00006G8LB|4.0|Most people who fantasize about being a costumed superhero usually focus on the upside of super powers: extraordinary strength, zooming through the air, and the adoration of fans.  Even back in 1962 with the appearance of the comic Spiderman, artists Stan Lee and Steve Ditko dared to show the flip side of a super powered hero.  When Spiderman was not in uniform, he was your ordinary geeky high school science whiz, who, unlike Clark Kent, did not have to pretend to be a walking victim.  As director Sam Raimi saw him, Spiderman is a walking mess of neuroses.  Simply donning a costume does not change the inner man.  Tobey Maguire, who plays Peter Parker, the Spiderman, does not allow his super powers to alter his basic sense of character.  As a counterpoint to Parker, another superpowered human, the Green Goblin (Willim Dafoe), serves as a twisted doppleganger.  Both Spiderman and the Green Goblin achieve their powers in such a way that tests them more internally than physically.  With Parker, he is bitten by a radioactive spider that alters his DNA to give him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider.  With the Goblin, he plays the Mad Scientist who uses himself as a guinea pig to test a drug that will give him powers roughly equal to those of Parker's.  But in Parker's case, he has the advantage of his wise Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who warns him that with great power comes great responsibility.  Parker refuses to heed this sage advice at first, but later comes to realize its validity.  There is no equivalent for the Goblin, who seeks only increasing power to fuel his own mania.  <br />Much of the charm of SPIDERMAN is visual.  There are numerous scenes of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin launching themselves through space and from building to building.  The scenes that accompany this visual treat bring to mind the similar scenes that Superman and Lois Lane played out in the earlier SUPERMAN movies, where Christopher Reeve saved Margot Kidder from falling from a skyscraper.  Parker's romantic interest is Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is both sweet and believable as a young lady who drifts from one man to another until she discovers that her true love (Parker) has always been right there for her.  The audience is never permitted to see the movie solely in terms of escapist derring do.  Although much of SPIDERMAN is exactly that, its more subtle charm is in its insistence that behind the glamor of a mask and power must beat a heart that permits the hero to remember that raw power used without consideration for others is seen ultimately as making its possessor as weak and as pathetic as any science geek before he gets bitten by a spider that offers him a choice about life and ethics.  Those like Peter Parker make the right choice and can still live a relatively normal life.  Those like the Green Goblin do not and the inevitable loss of both stature and power makes him stagger about the stage, like a wounded King Lear, bemoaning life's terrible ironies.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001)<br />All hail the coming of Richard Kelly. If the rest of his films are as good as Donnie Darko, America has found its first truly great director since John Huston.<br />The title character (Jake Gyllenhaal, who easily deserved last year&#146;s Best Actor award for this role) plays a paranoid schizophrenic high school students whose best friend is a six-foot-tall mutant-looking rabbit named Frank (James Duval [Go/The Doom Generation]). No, no one but Donnie is capable of seeing Frank. Frank makes Donnie do very bad things.<br />When not under Frank&#146;s powers of suggestion, Donnie is your typical high school student. Along the way, he acquires a girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone, of Life as a House fame), goes to class, feuds with his teachers, has deep and meaningful discussions about the sex lives of the Smurfs, gets bullied by the school bad boys, tries to make life easier for an exchange student, and hangs out with his similarly-outcast friends. When midnight comes, however, Frank pops up, and Donnie becomes&#133; someone else. The first time we see Frank, he tells Donnie the world will end in twenty-four days and some change. And things go downhill from there.<br />Add to this mess Donnie&#146;s English (Drew Barrymore) and Science (Noah Wyle) teachers, whom he likes; the insane Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant [Speed]), whom he hates (she seems to be some kind of psychology teacher with a twisted agenda); his psychiatrist (the redoubtable Katherine Ross); a motivational speaker who seems to have fooled everyone but Donnie (Patrick Swayze); and, of course, his family, who think he&#146;s absolutely insane. It&#146;s a thick, tasty stew of teen angst, mental illness, and the sheer beauty of growing up different than everyone else. Like life, it&#146;s both funny and sad by turns, and sometimes cruel; Donnie wins a few battles, loses a few. The only real difference between Donnie and most high school outcasts is that, well, he&#146;s got this friend, see&#133;<br />All of this makes Donnie Darko a good film. What makes it a great film is all the thought that went into the script and the direction; the underlying meanings, the visual clues, the attention to detail. Kelly makes M. Night Shayamalan directing The Sixth Sense look like an ogre with a mallet; this is the most symbolically-laden film since Begotten, at least, and possibly going all the way back to the original Cape Fear.<br />Donnie Darko earned itself a place on the all-time 100-best list immediately. **** ½got this friend, see&#133;<br />All of this makes Donnie Darko a good film.

B00005K9LM|3.0|There are a lot of similarities between this c.d. and Sreamin'- poor production and lousy drumming. But forget about that for a second! Just buy this c.d. for the guitar solos, man! The solos are intense and definitely over the top! (I've always hated the term \\"over the top\\"). K.K and Glenn do these back and forth solos, and although I'm the only one who seems to like the song \\"Eat me Alive\\", it sounds as if they're having a guitar solo showdown! If you don't buy this c.d., the monster on the cover will come after you!!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|If your an eminem fan, then his songs on the disc will satisfy your need for more eminem songs. the others are great, great variety, great beats, no-one [poo] on the album apart from macy gray, who should just buggur off.<br />DJ ENC was a bit harsh giving it 1 star. one stupid point he made was \\"he can rap, but his style isn't smooth\\" um, he can freestyle and write lyrics better than most people and he has his own style. i think he's just so overated that people have a go at him. basically, if you like the people who are featured, defintely buy the disc. great songs, double limited edition disc, along with pointless online password that enables you to access more stuff (which i have yet to check it out)<br />check it out
B00005K9LK|4.0|Screaming for Vengeance is probably the band's best '80s c.d.  All the guitar solos, especially &quot;Electric Eye&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;, just burn!  I have a concert video for this tour, and it's simply amazing!  If you're into Priest, there is no excuse for not having this c.d.  But I will warn you about two things.  First, the production is horrible, and second, Dave Holland is on drums.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I won't lie, I was a huge fan of Christina's first album, and was eagerly awaiting her sophmore effort.  I'd hoped that someone would tell her to cool the overdramatic flourishes that seemed to pepper all of her live performances, but nevertheless I was anxious to hear her follow-up.  I have to say when I saw the video for &quot;Dirrty&quot; as well as her outfit (the hankerchief one) at the awards show, I was really dissapointed.  I figured she'd pulled a Mariah.  I was wrong.  This CD is good.  This is definitely one book that can't be judged by it's cover.  The songs are strong, the talent is stronger.  I won't go into a track listing except to say that I agree with the other reviews, and that &quot;Beautiful&quot; is worth the price of admission.
B00001OH82|4.0|I really wanted to give it 3 1/2 points, but since that's not possible I'll be generous and give it 4 stars, only because it's not nearly as bad as some would have you believe.<br />There's some good rock songs here.  There's some weak ones.  I think part of why this album never took off was that it sounded too much like run-of-the-mill rock n' roll, kinda samey.  I thought Bowie's idea to join a group was pretty cool at the time. <br />The songs that are great:<BR>\\"Crack City\\" - a powerful anti-drug song from someone who's been there and back.<BR>\\"Amazing\\" - a sweet song with a great melody.<BR>\\"Bus Stop\\" \\"Pretty Thing\\" and \\"Video Crime\\" are great rockers.<BR>\\"Baby Can Dance\\" has sexual swagger and may be the best song on the album although it could be considered sexist in places by some.<br />The songs that work:<BR>\\"Heaven's in Here\\" \\"Prisoner of Love\\" \\"I Can't Read\\" and Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\"<br />The rest are pretty weak.<br />So it is a mixed bag, but the good songs are good enough to heat and the album is certainly a worthy addition to the collection of any Bowie fan.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought this CD the same day that Justin Timberlake's \\"Justified\\" came out (obviously I bought that as well). If I had to choose which CD was the better of the two, I'd choose Christina in a second. And that takes a lot for me to say, because I'm a hardcore/diehard *NSYNC fan.<br />I love every song on this CD. It's very rare for me to buy a record and not have to skip through one or two songs. My favorite out of all the tracks is \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\". The instrumental alone is so beautiful. The second it comes on, it almost lures you in.<br />My second favorite would have to be \\"Walk Away\\". In this track, she's talking about being in an unhealthy relationship. The guy in the song is two-faced and she was blind about it for so long that she can't get away. I love songs that you can relate to in real life. It's like she literally ripped out a page from my diary and wrote a song with it.<br />Finally, my third choice is \\"Impossible\\". This is one of the only songs Christina didn't co-write. Instead, this was written, arranged, and composed by Alicia Keys. Lots of R&B flavor to it. Love it... I just love it.
B00006HBUA|4.0|I'm 12, and I still watch cartoons. Not usaully old cartoons, like Scooby-Doo is, but I'll watch it if I have nothing else to do. Of course, it won't make me laugh or anything, but its entertainment. When I heard they were making a Scooby-Doo movie, all I did was shrug and say \\"ah\\". I planned on seeing it. I tryed a couple of times to see it theaters, but I ended up seeing other things instead. Then, it came out on video, and I rented it. The first 5 minutes, where the \\"gang\\" are in the factory, I thought \\"God, I'm not going to watch all of this junk\\", and \\"Oh, yeah, that looks real\\". I thought that 'til right up when the marijuana reference kicked in. (The part where Shaggy says \\"Me & Scoob went to do what we do best\\", an then all the smoke comes out of the van, and turns out to just be smoke from a grill.) That got a laugh. After that, I was pretty open to the rest of the movie. And there are about 2 more references to drugs after that (\\"I got a bag of...hamburgers\\", \\"Mary Jane? That's my favorite name!\\"). And the movie isn't just a complete imitation of the 60's show (which you could tell by what you just read), and in some parts, it actully spoofs it. The only problem is the special effects. I'm sure this movie got a HUGE budget, and they could afford better effects for (at least) Scooby-Doo, the so-called star. For me, the star is Matthew Lillard, who steals the show with his performance of Shaggy. And the whole Scrappy thing's hilarious, too. WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B000063V8T|5.0|I appreciate that Paramount has finally released TNG seasons on DVD. Now if they could only get it right. First off, season five was another outstanding season. The Inner Light stands as one of the most touching and powerful episodes of any television show. Also, the tie in to Star Trek VI with Spock is one of the best written episodes of season five.<br />The picture quality is so-so. It looks sharper than VHS but is a little soft on many of the episodes. The extras are pretty skimpy with a interviews with various cast and production members about various episodes. It's not bad but it would have been far more inviting to have some actor/director/writer/producer commentaries. Still, the dual layer DVD's included in this set are the one of the fewStar Trek: TNG where I haven't had a some sort of flaw (the season three set had picture problems, dialog somehow out of synch, etc.). So Paramount has gotten the manufacturing difficulties out of the way.<br />The packaging is very nice all except the booklet. It would be nice to see some sort of overview on the season, comments, etc. Considering the amount of $ your paying I don't think this is too much to ask.<br />On the positive side--many of these episodes are among the best Trek produced. They also stand as some of the best science fiction, no, scratch that, drama produced for either television or the movies during the 90's. TNG was equaled (with some episodes and the story arcs that were developed they actually surpassed TNG) by the complex Deep Space Nine (which, by the way, is still not available on DVD thank you very much).<br />If you're a Trek fan, I'd recommend this set although I wish Paramount had included more extras. TNG surpassed The Original Series in terms of scope, writing, acting and optical effects.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Wow.  Kurt wouldn't have been happy with this slipshod slopped-together mess of his songs, that's for sure.  Krist and Dave should've just re-released Bleach, Nevermind, and In Utero as a two-CD set (all the songs on these albums were very short and could've fit).  But alas, they went the &quot;big money&quot; route and  cheated us.  Make Kurt happy, and just record &quot;YKYR&quot; from the radio next time you hear it, and bypass this sorry excuse for a compilation.  Thanks, Krist and Dave... for nothing.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Buy it, because you're going to want to watch it several times, looking for things you missed and inconsistencies. There are few.
2070512541|5.0|This is the kind of book that lets you know your not the only person out there not understood. It comes from the heart and tells the truth about some kids and it's a very good book. I'd recommend this book to any person of all ages. It's the kind of book that takes you along the hand and it's like your right there in the book. Roald Dahl is a very,good writer and Quentin Blake is right there with him when it comes to art.
B00006JKOL|5.0|Behold this Cup of Wonder from possibly the most talented rock band that has ever been assembled. Jethro Tull has provided the listener with a symphony of sound that transcends all that rock music has to offer. Ian Anderson has made this newly mastered CD a signature piece that will stand the test of time, earning its place in history as a popular classic.   The CD's title track, Minstrel in the Gallery, is a mixture of Elizabethan folk that feels like warm water caressing the soul under a beautiful waterfall, then masterfully changes into a tour de force of Heavy Metal. This is only the beginning of Minstrel's Passion Play of Sound. Minstrel in the Gallery combines Rock, Folk, Hard Rock and Classical with such a high degree of mastery and taste achieved by no other before or since.   I dare to defy anyone not to feel the power and stunning emotion that is parlayed into the song Requiem. To my ear anyway, it is one of the most gorgeous melodies ever recorded. The rest of the CD plays with an equal host of excellence. With an added 5 bonus tracks, this CD is bound to enlighten all that come within hearing range.   When I was 14 this record had a profound effect on my personal and artistic growth. Over 25 years later it is still and honored and welcome guest to my stereo system. May it entertain you the way it always has me!!     I give it a 100 star rating!     Thank you Ian,   -Docchalk
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld on DVD is an absolute must. If Mad About You can do it, surely the greatest show ever to grace my television can be preserved and enjoyed again and again and again. I watch the reruns every night and still laugh just as hard every time. <br />Please, Jerry, please please please... do it for Mulva!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't need to repeat what everyone else says, please believe their hype.  My personal favorites: Lucky and Paranoid Android.  By the way, Thom was amazing solo at Bridge School, for anyone who isn't lucky enough to have seen him!
B000002552|5.0|In the hundreds of times I've listened to this album, I've never tired of it. Dylan was, arguably, at his peak during this period and the Band were just getting started in their recording career. However, you'd think they'd been playing together for years and years. All vocal leads (sans Robertson on Bessie Smith, but he did get better in years to come) and the harmonies, are spectacular (i.e. Odds and Ends, Goin' to Acapulco, Apple Suckling Tree, Million Dollar Bash). Some personal standouts for me are Katie's Been Gone (do we ever miss Richard Manuel!), Long Distance Operator (do we ever miss Rick Danko!), Tiny Montgomery (thank God Dylan's still with us), Please Mrs. Henry, and Million Dollar Bash. Every song on this disc is really a gem. <BR>Now consider the, by nowadays standards, primitive recording technology that was used for these tracks, and how the instrumentation of these songs comes through,  I'd like to see anyone today try the same thing....woodshedding, as the term has been used by members of the Band, to describe what was done for what resulted in this album. Garth Hudson's organ/accordion, Richard Manuel's piano, Robbie's guitar, Rick Danko's bass playing, and Levon's drumming/mandolin all signify master musicians, with Dylan right there. This would be the equivalent of Monet and Renoir getting together, on their best days and collaborating; or Charles Dickens and George Orwell wrting a book together.  By the way, if I had to take 10 albums on a desserted island, this would be one of them, and that would fulfill my  Dylan and the Band  selections.<BR>If you like this album you owe it to yourself to check out &quot;Bob Dylan live at Royal Albert Hall '66&quot;. Even though Levon Helm was not present on this disc, you still witness what the Band and Dylan were capable of playing just Dylan songs live.
B000005RS9|5.0|I got the remastered monaural mix of the album when I heard it was being put out in a limited-edition box. The above photo of the green, textured cover is what I have, and I can only say that if you don't have it, shame on you, but it may be gone!<BR>This is the mono mix of the British version of the album, and I have to say that it's 100% more trippy than the stereo mix. We hear a lot more echo, reverb and phasing on all the songs at various points. Or in the case of &quot;Bike&quot;, the loud reverb on Syd's voice is gone, and you can hear a growling Hammond organ in the intro of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, which is missing in the stereo mix. The drums are a lot harder-sounding as well.<BR>Which is weird, as these guys had almost literally invented Quadraphonic sound in their shows way back in 1967. But that's the way it was in Britain, apparently, as stereo was an afterthought, and left to studio engineers, with some pretty two-dimensional results. This is one such case, even though the stereo panning on &quot;Insterstellar Overdrive&quot; is missing here, and was the only good effect in the stereo mix. So, if you like the album but would like to hear it in a totally different light, by all means, get this version before it's gone!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I couldn't believe my eyes. I have Ok computer plus a few B-sides I can't identify and I couldn't be happier. I won't name that my songs cause the track list is all messed up but it's beautiful. Radiohead have proved themselves better than the losers messing with their genius and high above them. They're pure genius and whether you like coldplay and startsailor and all that, I think they're the biggest posers next to the mainstream rock thing but still, if you like coldplay and all that you could easily but radiohead higher. Radiohead are my favourite band and this is probably their best album. Starting with airbag which get's you pumped to go the length of the rest of the cd with it's mean messed up style. Climbing up the walls will be stuck in your head for hours on end. Electioneering is a hard-rocker to keep you on your feet, and thier are bunches of other greatly crafted songs I can't name. Buy it while you still can
B000002LQR|5.0|I never have been and never will be a fan of rap music.  That holds true for both \\"gansta rap\\" as well as the more recent \\"rap metal\\".  However, when you put together an album that is as funky, catchy, and rocking as this classic album is, I am more than willing to make an exception.<br />When this album came out, I was listening to bands like Tesla, the Black Crowes, and Damn Yankees.  I didn't realize that grunge was about to take over the rock world, replacing my favorites heavy metal and pop metal within the mainstream.  Independant of all of those realities was this band and this album.  It took me a while to warm up to it (with all the rapping, after all), but once I did I realized it was a masterpiece.<br />Where to begin in raving about this album?  \\"The Power Of Equality\\" and \\"If You Have To Ask\\" get the album off to a funky and at the same time rocking start.  \\"Breaking The Girl\\" is a gorgeous, heartfelt song that is especially effective considering the funky songs it is surrounded by.  \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and \\"Give It Away\\" are fun, funky rockers.  \\"I Could Have Lied\\" is an accoustic ballad, but it includes obscenity and a very strong bass line (both of which are prevelent throughout the album).  \\"Under The Bridge\\" of course is the accoustic, huge hit with a powerful message that everyone knows.  Songs like \\"The Righteous And The Wicked\\", the title track, and \\"Naked In The Rain\\" are further rocking, funky delights.  \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" is a very obscene and yet unforgettable song that shows how far these guys would go at that time.<br />This is the Chilis at their raw and gritty best.  For sure, it is the album that truly brought them into the mainstream, but there is nothing mainstream about many of the songs on this album.  After all these years, I still strongly recommend this album as a unique and diverse funky rock record filled with a variety of sounds and emotions.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Listen up people; this is the best debut album of the year!  One at the top in the decade.  Its called &#147;Turn On The Bright Lights,&#148; by the fantastic band Interpol.  They are absolutely amazing.  Every song is mind blowing, the well-written lyrics and music; I can&#146;t say enough good things about them.  I got to catch a live show and the performance too was incredible.  They got a great stage presence, and the foursome is decked out in suits and ties.  All four are absolutely gorgeous, its difficult to choose just one to daydream about. <BR> <BR>Interpol is from New York and they are Paul Banks on vocals and guitar, Daniel Kessler on guitar and background vocals, Carlos D. on bass guitar, keyboards and background vocals and then we got the last sex symbol is Samuel Fogarino on drums.  The story goes is that Daniel and Carlos first got together in New York and then Daniel met up with Paul in Paris.  Maybe hanging out in Paris is why they got that full European feel.  Or maybe that Paul was born in England.  Who knows, but they are the best thing since Morrissey and the Europeans are all ecstatic about the new album too!<br />Off the, &#147;Turn On The Bright Lights,&#148; album is the first track, &#147;Untitled,&#148; that is short and the sweetest thing you&#146;ll ever hear.  The complete and accomplished lyrics goes as followed, &#147;I will surprise you sometime, I&#146;ll come around, when you&#146;re down.&#148;  This song is truly breathtaking and no doubt you will be humming and singing the lyrics for days on end.  Truly a two-minute endeavor that can&#146;t but hold top preference of all the songs.   This superb song only leads to more really exquisite, fresh, endless, ethereal ear candy.  <br />Second track, &#147;Obstacle One,&#148; is fantastic and another favorite.    The guitar starts the song off and immediate lyrics follow of a girl putting weights on a heart.  &#147;NYC,&#148; is the third track with Paul singing, &#147;Subway is a porno, pavements they are a mess.  Know you&#146;ve supported me for a long time, some how I&#146;m not impressed,&#148; and with Daniel and Carlos singing the background lyrics, &#147;got to be some more change in my life.&#148;  Even though the song is about New York City, the tune is just so good you can&#146;t help to love it besides the point and plus it feels a song all people can relate too.  &#147;PDA,&#148; is the fourth track .... Check it out and buy the album since it&#146;s a certainty you will fall in love with the stellar band, Interpol and this new album, &#147;Turn On the Bright Lights.&#148;
B000002J2B|5.0|I sold this CD about 8 years ago, around the time the remastered release came out, with the intent of re-buying it.  It took 8 years before I bought it again.  So I am hearing it with fresh ears, after a long time.  Actually I was in a band back in 1994 that covered the tune \\"...In That Quiet Earth.\\"  Still, after so long, I forgot how the song sounded as well as the rest of the album.  I bought all of the other early Genesis albums again (by again I mean the remasters) when they came out, but waited until just recently to buy this one back again.<br />Now I wonder why I waited so long.  Without a doubt, this is a progressive rock album.  The first tune, Eleventh of Earl, sounds like it could of been on Trick of the Tail.  It's a beautiful peace, full of energy and clever arrangements.<BR>This whole album is progressive rock by my ears...Yes, I can see a little bit of the later Genesis on Your Own Special Way and Afterglow, but it is not a bad thing.  In That Quiet Earth leads into Afterglow perfectly, making Afterglow sound even more appealing when it starts playing. A majestic ending to a beautiful, unusual, and quirky album.<BR>This album is a must-have for any progrock fan.  Yes, there are quite a few progrock albums in the mid-70s, some better than this, but still, there isn't an endless supply.  They don't make 'em like they used to.  The production approach, the equipment, the songwriting, it's all different now.  I'm not saying this is the best Genesis album, not by a long shot in my opinion.  I prefer The Lamb...Selling England...and Foxtrot...BUT, If you are a progrock fan, buy this one.  You don't have to buy any Genesis albums after this one if you don't want, you can stop here.  Just don't stop at Trick of the Tail.  This one deserves to be in your collection too.  Even though The Lamb...Selling...and Foxtrot are masterpieces, they aren't this album.  This album has its own progressive rock merits.
B00003CY0V|1.0|plot holes. obviously rewritten ending to please the post september crowds. laundry list of faults and factual inconsistencies. the worst computer non-sense to hit the screen since the last William Gibson adaptation.<br />it starts strong with a teenage-caliber struggle for philosophy via \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" and one of the best produced special effects sequences ever. but quickly breaks into a plodding, trotting, plodding traipse through young punk male fantasies about being able to achieve great feats of hacking while being serviced by hookers. ...P>.<br />anti-social amoral acts suddenly redeemed by the greater good of stealing to a higher moral-ground for murder?<br />hollow, evil heroes for the mindless and skin for the...nice formula. it's pulled in lots of 5 star ratings here so it seems to be exactly what audiences deserve.
0783217048|5.0|Yes, the writing wasn't the best.  Yes, the three queens in the movie were straight.  HOWEVER, this movie is a must for any drag queen.  I can barely get through the movie without wanting to be Brigett.  This is a must own for us all!<br />Donny/Brigett
B000002KMV|5.0|1. Controversy<BR>2. Sexuality<BR>3. Do Me Baby<BR>4. Private Joy<BR> 5. Ronnie, Talk to Russia<BR>6. Let's Work<BR>7. Annie Christian<BR>8. Jack U Off <br />Patrice Rushen inspired Do Me, Baby---written by her and performed by him as a wooing song to her is one of the most enduring and popular songs from thsi album, it's been remade severla times but the madness, the delicious power which Prince renders it as the original sets it apart from all the others.  Annie Christian, a beautifully political song that warps both a woman and politics in teh age of Ray-gun is still amazing and relevant today.  I was just thinking to myself that he is merely in his early 40's and has another perhaps 50 years of music to create.  Will he be my centuries Beethoven?  I think so.  There are maybe a dozen people who are seriously creating a wealth of music, a panoramic scope of depth and diversity.<br />Controversy and Sexuality question both what sexuality is and why its so important that we define our own personal decisions that don't harm others FOR others in regards to our choice of love, experimentation/genitalia.<br />All the way this album is first class, an early one yes, showing that when there was the both the decision to be creatively controversial and the emerging mega-talent of a keen intellect and sonic aptitude that would influence millions and continues to do so today!  Academy Awards, Grammys, NAACP Awards, American Music, MTV, and I'm sure Emmy and Tony to come, I can only hope for a long life for Prince Rogers nelson so that we will one day see that all of this work was merely primal infancy for the adult maturation is to come.
B000001EG6|5.0|1970's \\" Elton John \\" album was the British singer/pianist's second album, but it was his first to be released in America.<br />So, this was the United States' first taste of Elton. While several somgs on the album ( the classic \\" Your Song \\", \\" Take Me<br />To The Pilot \\", \\" Border Song \\" )are some of his most popular tracks, many are underlooked masterpieces. \\" I Need You To Turn To \\" is a lovely ballad. Elton's voice is full of sincerity and<br />comfort, and the song's string arrangement by Paul BuckMaster is<br />beautiful. This song was featured in a live version 16 years later on 1986's \\" Live In Australia \\" album. \\" No Shoestrings On<br />Louise \\" is a countrified, mid - tempo song that evokes a sort<br />of country - like feel. It is a song I think Elton should start<br />performing in concert again. \\" Firts Episode At Hienton \\" is a<br />haunting ballad about lost love that has a haunting string arrangement by BuckMaster. If this song is haunting, the next track is chilling. \\" Sixty Years On \\" is also a popular track,<br />and the string arrangement sounds like if it comes from a horror<br />film. The song's lyric show the hatred of old age. \\" The Greatest<br />Discovery \\" is a song about the birth of a baby brother, and it's<br />a very beautiful song with a great string arrangement. \\" The Cage \\" is an all-out rocker. The next track is \\" The King Must Die \\" is a powerful song about corrupt royalty. This a great song. The album has been updated with three bonus tracks not included on the original 1970 lp. \\" Bad Side Of The Moon \\" is a<br />great track. The string arrangement is excellent, and Elton's<br />singing is superb. The next track, \\" Grey Seal \\", is not the<br />popular version from the \\" Goodbye Yellow Brick Road \\", but rather the original slow version recorded three years earlier.<br />The next track, \\" Lady Madonna \\", is an all - out rocker. The<br />song opens with audience applause, but it is not a live recording. This track closes the cd. I think you should buy this<br />album today.today.
B000000XCH|5.0|Cosmo's Factory is without any doubt one of the best albums ever made.  CCR's version of \\"I Heard it through the Grapevine\\" is fantastic.  The album offers different types of CCR music: fast paced, slow, songs with a message,etc.  This is an album that I never get tired of listening to.  I just wish the three remaining members of CCR could put their differences behind them and regroup.  They were absolutely one of the great bands of all time and Cosmo's Factory proves it.
B00005JKRA|5.0|Full to the brim with classic and memorable lines and phrases, This film is truly amazing. Every single character in the film portrays his role exceedingly well. The best performances for me include :- Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), Gunnery Seargent Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) .. and I think the best actor in the film - Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin).<BR>Baldwin is outstanding in this film.. his character is intriguing and interesting.. he also has a courageness about him that everybody watching the film looks up to. It's a tragedy he wasn't recognised for his performance at the Oscars.<br />All round, this is a great film. If you see a better War film let me know... I wanna see it!
B00005RHGK|5.0|This is scary! Does mess up in a few spots, but when I go to see a horror movie, I'm not looking for excellent story telling or great acting, I just wanna get scared, and this movie scared me, and that is saying alot. Just ask my friends!
0688170528|4.0|I picked up this book for no particular reason, and I'm really glad that I did - I think I found a new author to read!<br />This was a moving story. And, while the action in the story revolved around the death of Emily, the story was really about the relationships between the characters!<br />All of the relationships - between family, friends, lovers, etc. were complicated, and very realistic.<br />This book was interesting because it was told in a very detailed way, without overdosing the reader with details. We got to know the characters, their strengths and weaknesses, and we got to see how they related to each other (and didn't relate).<br />It was sad to watch this \\"family\\" fall apart after the death of Emily, and it was even more tragic to read how terribly the families coped with it.<br />But, Picoult portrayed the relationships, and the emotions in a very realistic manner.<br />If you're picking this up to read a great mystery, don't bother - there isn't much suspense. But, this is a fantastic novel because it explores relationships, and families, and friendships, and how they change, survive and don't survive a real tragedy!
B00005JK8K|3.0|Although Navajo soldiers served a vital purpose, speaking in a code based on their language, during WWII, prejudice still existed against them, as illustrated in \\"Windtalkers\\".  In the movie Nicolas Cage is assigned the duty of keeping a windtalker safe from capture, an act which was to be avoided by murder, if necessary.  Cage is afraid to let himself become too friendly with his charge, in case he does have to kill him.  He is also haunted by memories of a previous encounter during the war, when all of the men under his command died as a result of his unwillingness to retreat.  This movie serves an importnat purpose in informing the public as to the vital role of the Navajo \\"windtalkers\\" during WWII, but it would have been a better film if there had been more interaction between the characters and fewer violent battle scenes.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I am a fairly new No Doubt fan--picked up on them with Return of Saturn.  I enjoyed that CD but this is even better.  Gwen is in fine form on all of the tracks and the reggae influence is obvious throughout the CD.  You can tell Gwen and the rest of the band are having a great time.  Great traveling music for a beautiful day, the stereo turned up, and the windows down.  Rock Steady is a lot of fun!
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the brillant beginning of what now seems to be a trilogy of books set in the magical and frigtening world beyond the Wall. This book is perfect for reading late at night...a little creepy...but mixed together with action, romance, tons of adventure, and a little white cat with attitude. Sabriel is a darker fantasy...but definately worth reading...and to make it even better, the second book Lirael is just as good..I haven't read the third book yet...but I am definately looking forward to the outcome of this trilogy  :)
B00005ARDC|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD. It just flows...so great to listen to when you are working on anything.  I was reading an article about Joe Perry and he happened to mention this band.  that's why I gave the cd a try and and I can't stop listening to it!
B000002MZ6|5.0|What else can I say... Mike is a trip!  Put on some head phones, light up and let Mike do the rest.   You can really get lost in this one.  The only trouble is... finding your way back.  If you like music to trip by this is excellent!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|This album continues the excellent American Records tradition. Cash can still get to your bones with that voice and relentless, complex passion. <br />When they talk about American legends, here's the guy.

B000000H5K|1.0|If it weren't for Slipknot, there would be no room for bands like Slayer, Sepultura and Pantera. I think it is ridiculous that Sepultura are always trying to cop Slipknot's sound. Max cannot scream like Corey does. I hate people!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|In the early nineties, every major group put out a BOX SET. Now the trend is to produce a double CD greatest hits package. It's all the rave - Rolling Stones, Elton John, Bee Gees, David Bowie and now Fleetwood Mac. But this is a good thing.<br />Fleetwood Mac's box set was nearly overly inclusive and really only sold to the most devout fans. A few years later, a single 'Greatest Hits\\" CD was released. Now with the double CD phenomenon, we have a more affordable and better selection of Fleetwood Mac's best.  The Enhanced Sound is truly detectable and most of the hit songs are the singles versions, making for some refreshing song openings.<br />There is no material before 1975, however, it's a good selection and one that every true fan and every \\"maybe\\" fan will enjoy. The liner notes are good and there is a nice songlist with dates and chart notes.  There is a fancy CD-ROM attachment with \\"sales\\" promotional stuff about the upcoming album, but it's really just another good excuse to keep people from burning a CD copy - yes, with a CD-ROM attachment, most people cannot make copies.<br />Trivia: It's tough to beleive that a group this popular only had one Number One Hit - \\"Dreams\\". They should have had more. This is a great set.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This band is so lame. They are trying way too hard to emulate Coldplay's sound. I don't get the lead singer, all he does is whine and moan. And this isn't even music, it's just sound effects. Coldplay and Starsailor paved the way for this band, but that doesn't mean it is any good.
B00005U2JL|5.0|-Many of these reviews have been writing prior to the release of this DVD, so their basis is off of guessing and expectations. Since the release of this DVD I've watched it beginning to end 3 times and looked it at all possible angles. From every perspective - entertainment, quality, material covered that was actually at the concert, replay value, etc. <br>-As far as entertaining, if you're a Manson fan and have never been to one of his concerts, this is an perfect look and near concert experience from the Guns, God, and Government tour. During which Manson experimented with new stage acts including the &quot;holy garments&quot; worn of clergy, different lighting and pyrotechnics which added great effects and new excitement to some of the older songs, and a platform that lifted him to the top of the stage. <br>-The sound quality of this is superior to any other DVD I've heard or seen. The image is crystal clear and the sound is beyond great. If you have a home theater surround system, this is going to utilize it perfectly.-<br>-Lastly, the DVD is shot in succession. The first hour and 20 minutes or so are songs played one right after another just as it would be at the concert itself. Rather than playing clips of a song, cutting to backstage scenes and clips then going on to another song or something of that nature, the concert is played in its entirety. Then there is a nice little 30 minute short film called &quot;The Death Parade&quot; that has all of Marilyn Manson's little endeavers on it, from backstage shots, to christians protesting the concerts on the streets, to Manson himself whiping chicks and throwing bottles at people. Its all great footage.<br>-Final words: There is no good argument that anyone can come up with that would be correct when trying to put this DVD down. Manson and his crew have done an outstanding job on the quality of this DVD. Audio and video are sharp, and crystal clear. Lots of great songs including Disposable Teens, Anti-Christ Superstar, Beautiful People, Lunchbox, Great Big White World. Anyone who puts this down is either not a real big fan of Marilyn Manson or is just smoking crack.<br />Entertainment: 5<br>Audio: 5<br>Video: 5<br>Options: 4<br>Replay Value: 4
B00005QIPH|4.0|Alright, let's get something straight.  They don't really sound like Television except for the guitar tones.  And they sound nothing like Iggy, or Blonie, or all the other bands that people who have never heard Iggy or Blonie think they sound like.  If you get past what the guitars sound like, you'll realize that Is This It is really much more like New Order or the Smiths, taking tense, but otherwise seemingly harmless, guitar rock and injecting all the remorse, hope, frustration, sadness, and general disenchantment that a band of five rich kids from uptown New York could possibly muster.  And singer Julian Cassablancas often sounds like he's hurting himself trying to do just that (bridge of &quot;alone together&quot;).<BR>  This album is not the parade of style and Lower Eastside hipness that your poseur friends think it is.  The layed-back grooves and retro guitar coolness is just a trap, making you drop your guard, and then blindsiding you with emotion.  Think 40 ounces to freedom.  Lyrics like &quot;You drink too much / makes me drink all the same&quot; and &quot;Alone we stand, together we fall apart&quot; are much more interesting than people give them credit for.<BR>  The reason the album recieved four stars is that it suffers from monotony.  The vocal distortion effect is lovely, and the clean, jangly guitars are refreshing, but they make many of the songs, that otherwise are very distinct, sound exactly the same.  It's sort of to be expected though, since it is a debut album, and the Strokes have almost no studio experience.  I suspect the next album will show a lot of people that their perception of the strokes is dead wrong.<BR>  And, finally, yes, because of this combination of cool aesthetic and emotional depth, most people that liked the White Stripes last album will probably like Is This It, too.  Connections to the Vines, Hives, and Moldy Peaches are sketchier though.<BR>  I don't usually recommend albums to everyone, but this is about as close to universal appeal as an album can get.  I think it would most be liked by fans of indie rock like Pavement and Weezer (I know they aren't actually indie, but you know what I mean).  Also, fans of modern blues might notice that this sounds an aweful lot like a blues album.  Trust me on that one.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Ok, I don't usually review things, but I was reading some people's reviews that said the movie was bad. It was HILARIOUS. I've talked to quite a few people about it, and they all loved it. Sure, Goldmember was kinda gross and not great, but the movie was funny. It had a lot of the same jokes but it was still really funny even though I have the first two and have seen them each a million times. This movie is the best!!! If you like the other Austin Powers movies, then I think you should like this one too.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Although it was a ratings disaster this is the most resilient and human view of the role a small group of remarkable human beings played in the last two years of the war.<br />Few series will ever last the test of time, few have the relavance to teach us and touch our hearts at the same time. Band of Brothers is the only piece that brings together reality, history and incredible directing from an ensemble of people.
0790749815|1.0|The movie is of course great but this production is horrid! The pixelation is worse than any other DVD I have, to the point that it's extremely distracting. A very poor product - will stick to Criterion from now on though this means I will miss out on some great movies.
0385501005|4.0|Not many books make me laugh out loud (particularly when I'm reading in bed at midnight), but this one did.  Lots of fun British references that made me nostalgic for the year I lived in London.  Definitly read!
B00005R2M3|5.0|After seeing Shakira's video for &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, I decided to purchase the album.  It's great.  The songs are catchy, memorable, and have lyrics you could have stuck in your head all day.  The blend of English and Spanish songs is great, and the music is refreshing.
B000005YZM|5.0|this is an album that all you so-called \\"indie rockers\\" must absolutely check out.  stop blabbing about belle & sebastian, the ladybug transistor, etc!  this is the original, baroque pop classic.  it's all there: mellowtron, harpsichord, complex arrangements, beautiful harmonies, shameless foppishness, shaggy hair, psychedelic album artwork!<BR>it's really true:  it has \\"all been done before\\" as so many youngsters cry.  this album is over thirty years old and still sounds contemporary.
B00005QZWI|2.0|Some parts are fine, but there is no strong, recognizable theme to the music.  The hobbit's song sounds like an attempt at a theme, but it certainly isn't something memorable.  The whole soundtrack sounds like a collage of some of the more famous movie music.  The music fits well with the movie, but independently it isn't nearly as good.
B00005Q45W|5.0|If you have never heard Leonard Cohen, don't expect hot musical tracks or a great singing voice. His style of background music which had always been minimal has been reduced to little more than a beat which our song meister seems to miss more often than he hits.The deep dark raspy voice has become deeper, darker and raspier to the point where it is sometimes hard to recognize a tune eminating from the artist's lips.<BR> From reading this review,some people may get the impression that I don't like Leonard Cohen's music. They would be wrong! In this collection of songs Mr.C. does what he does best. That is to use the poetry of words to create mental imagery which will transport you into the magical realms of the mind. Seldom does such a collection of music come along by a master poet at the height of his craft. If you prefer the power of the lyric voice to the power of a guitar amplifier, this is the album for you.
B000002J09|5.0|I know there are 426 reviews for this, but I have some points to make. This album reminds me of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the U.S.A\\" for a few reasons. First it is their best. And like the afforementioned Born in the U.S.A, Some Die-Hard fans as well as casual listeners criticize this album, saying that it's \\"Overplayed on the Radio\\", \\"You can still hear this stuff 24/7\\". <BR>You know there's a good reason for that. Also if it didn't put up massive sales numbers, these same people would hail this. IV, Zoso or whatever you may want to call it is the Crown Jewel in Led Zeppelin's catalog, their Magnum Opus. Sure, they've made other great albums like II and Physical graffiti, but none have struck a chord with music fans the way IV has. To date it's sold 22 Million copies.

B000002UKS|5.0|the album that put the foo fighters on the map ranges from soft melodic tunes to hardcore rocking, and perhaps their most famous song of all in everlong which will never tire.  there were 4 hits to come off this album and for good reason.  If you like good ole rock and roll, WITHOUT turn tables, bagpipes or any other crazy instrument MTV has warped music with, then the foos are for you.
0060506989|5.0|I don't think I can fully explain, what this book has done for me in the sense of how it has awaikened me to what war is and how our men died, when called to fight. What a message, one that all americans need to know. The way they fought and suffered. I felt there pain after reading the book and watching the movie. A must read, it fills in the details the movie could not contain.
B000020617|5.0|i own all 4 foo albums, and this one is my favorite, its less gritty than their newest album.  Its melodic but still retains its rock and roll roots. None of this turntable or rap rock hybrid stuff.... 3 guitars and drums are all the foo's need to rock out.  Its music that makes me want to own a convertable and crise america with the top down and the foos blastin while I rock out and sing along.
0790731894|4.0|If AIR FORCE ONE deceived you as much as it deceived me, EXECUTIVE DECISION is the movie for you. Faster, less politically correct, it's a little pearl to add to your \\"action\\" DVD collection.<br />And don't be afraid of the mention of the name of Steven SEAGAL in the credits ; the real star of the movie is Kurt RUSSELL. He becomes the new father of the anti-terrorist group after the departure of SEAGAL. Father is not an inadequate word : observe that the group desperately needs a Daddy to lead them. In fact, one of the boys curiously spend the whole movie lying in bed and weeping, just like a little baby.<br />A DVD to buy if you're an action movie fan.
B00005NNT1|5.0|I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 yr old as a pre-release order from disney. My daughter loves the movie more than anything else.
B00006JKOL|5.0|Minstrel In The Gallery is a great hard rocking slice of progressive music.  Back in 1979, when I was first exposed to this release, I wasn't too keen on it.  But past experience with all things Tull had taught me that my patience and persistence would be rewarded.  And so they were--more than with any other Tull recording.  <br />For the progressive ROCK connosieur, Minstrel In The Gallery has everything.  Great vocals with witty over-the-top lyrics, stinging guitars, inventive drumwork, solid bass playing, and some of the best string arrangements ever to grace a rock 'n' roll recording.  Yep, Minstrel is my favorite from Tull.  I'd take it over Thick As A Brick or Aqualung anyday.<br />As for the sound of this remaster, it is wonderful.  Both of the  previous versions (one on vinyl and one on CD) of Minstrel I've owned were lacking in some way.  My old vinyl was almost completely devoid of treble frequencies, and the bass was rather flat.  My old import CD version I purchased back in 1987 was way too bright with the same flat bass as the vinyl.  The new remaster addresses all of these problems and more.  I almost feel like I'm hearing Minstrel In The Gallery for the first time.  Also, in direct contrast to recent general mastering practice, very little--if any--compression was applied to the music.  The full scope of the dynamics are there to behold--not squashed for the sake of a louder CD.  You just need to turn it up folks.  What rock 'n' roller has a problem with that?
B000068PQ0|5.0|I work at a music store. I saw this album knowing nothing of the Lips besides only hearing of them through the odd article in a magazine. One day when I got home from work I deceided to download some Flaming Lips. I downloaded 'Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt 1' and 'Fight Test'. Thoses two songs were enough to make me buy the album. So I bought the album, gave it a listen, and thought, yeah, it's ok. But over a period of time, while always playing it, it grew on me. I am writing this review on November 10, 2002. I have been listening to the Lips since August, non-stop. They are the only band I have any interest in right now. Not since Radiohead has a band affected me so much. Wayne Coyne seems to speak to you so personally through his lyrics unlike any other musician. I have never been so passionate about music until now. And the funny thing is, is that I almost disregarded this album after I bought it. Wow. I almost did the same thing when I bought OK Computer back in 1997, what does that tell you. All I can say is if you are taking the time to read this review I wrote, listen to the album, listen to their other albums, especially The Soft Bulletin. The Lips are the, in my opinion of course, the most amazing band on the planet right now. Just give them a chance.
B00006JKOM|3.0|Compared to Jethro Tull's previous recording (Minstrel In The Gallery), Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young To Die was a bit of a disappointment.  Sure, the inventive song construction was still in play as was the solid performance skills of the band.  But something was missing here.  Personally, I think it's the energy that was so evident on Minstrel only rears its head occasionally on Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll.  <br />Still, there are some good tunes present--particulary Quiz Kid, Crazed Institution, Salamander, and Pied Piper.  Basically, Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll: Too Old To Die is a great half recording.  It is the weakest of Tulls 1970's output.<br />Sonically, the remaster is a pleasure and puts to shame all previous versions.  If you consider yourself an ardent Tull fan, you want this.

0684803356|5.0|FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a great book if you are interested in the history of the Spanish Civil War. It is also useful if you are seeking insights into Hemingway. So much of the novel is taken directly from the author's experiences as a foreign correspondent in Spain for the North American Newspaper Alliance.<br />There are many facets of the book which contribute to its outstanding reputation. Hemingway's treatment of Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is exceptional. Jordan is a very complicated man who is radically transformed by the events described in the book. He is also the first Hemingway hero to contemplate suicide.<br />El Sordo is a leader of another guerilla band which is operating in the same territory as the band in which Jordan serves as an aide. The description of El Sordo's last stand on a hill against the Nationalists is an example of Hemingway's best writing.
B00005JKCH|4.0|&#147;Spider-Man&#148; is pure entertainment It buzzes along, quickly taking us from one thrilling moment to the next. The movie seems to as much fun to people like myself who&#146;ve never read the Marvel Comics series as it is to ardent comic book fans. On reflection, the film is filled with plot holes and serious lapses in logic. [For example, why does the hero take for granted his sudden new powers? How can a mere mortal slam through a brick wall virtually unscathed?] This criticism is hardly relevant, however, because any great escapist entertainment movie exists in its own world. Anyone who confuses its world with the real one needs a major reality check.<br />Peter Parker [Tobey Macguire] is a quiet, nerdy high school senior. Intensely shy, he can not bring himself to tell Mary Jane [Kirsten Dunst], the girl next door, that he has been in love with her since he was six years old. Taunted and ridiculed by bigger, more athletic boys, Peter is miserable. All this changes when he is bitten by a genetically altered spider at a local science museum. Suddenly he is all muscle. He can scale buildings and weave webs that allow him virtually to fly all over New York City. After an appalling family tragedy, Peter decides to use his powers to fight crime. Real danger comes along in the form of a local tycoon who is himself altered in a science experiment gone wrong. Peter, now AKA Spider-Man, must uses all his powers to fight this evil tyrant.<br />Tobey Macguire was the perfect choice to play Spider-Man. His quiet persona and his decent-but-not-great looks make his transformation exceptionally appealing. There is something about his performance that is quite touching, thus making his character a superhero that people can actually relate to.  Kirsten Dunst, one of our greatest young actresses, is perfect as Mary Jane. Willem Dafoe makes a marvelous villain.<br />My advice? Set aside reality. Enjoy the show.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Please don't be decieved by the cover, OR the single, \\"Dirty\\" which is really good. This album is very good. I am NOT a pop fan Believe me. Every \\"POP\\" singer I listen to, I consider R&B, whcich they are, and started out being (Mariah, Pink, ). I consider Christina R&B and her album prooves it. Here's my review<br />1. Stripped Intro: 5/5 stars. This song is cool and has a hip-hop beat thing. <br />2. Can't Hold Us Down: 4.5/5 stars. I like the message and it's so true. Lil' Kim adds the Hip-Hop, but she could rap a little more.<br />3. Walk Away: 6/5 stars. I LOVE this song. It's like a slow R&B jam. I LOVE it. It has a lot of meaning and Chris doesn't yell in this song, or any other song on the album....<br />4. Fighter: 5/5 stars. I like this song. I like how it skips from the \\"Walk Away\\". Good meaning<br />5. Primer Amor: 5/5. I ALWAYS new Chris had Latina in her. I like how she speaks spainsh in the song. Being part Portuguese, it sounds a little funny to me. <br />6. Infatuation:5/5 stars. I LOVE this song. I like her vocals too. Good Latin beat. <br />7. Loves Embrace: 5/5 stars. This song sound like Mariah's \\"Can't Let Go\\" or \\"Make It Last\\". <br />8. Loving Me For Me: 5/5 stars. This sounds like a Mariah Carey song. That's why I like it. <br />9. Impossible: 6/5 stars. I didn't see \\"Dirrty\\" on the R&B charts, but I definitly see this one on it. This song has a good tone and I like Alicia's piano. <br />10. Underappriciated: 4/5 stars. I don't care for what the song's about, but I like it anyways<br />11. Beautiful: 5/5 stars. I love this song too. It was the second song I heard from this album. Linda Perry has talent and I'm glad she did this song for Chris and not for Pink, even though It would have sounded good by her.<br />12. Make Over: 4/5 stars. I love this song cuz of how it's sung and the beat. Kinda wierd though.<br />13. Cruz: 4/5 stars. This song doesn't float my boat....<br />14. Soar: 4/5 stars: Not poppy, but sounds like something off of her first album.<br />15. Get Mine Get Yours: 3/5 stars. I don't really like this song....<br />16. Dirrty: 5/5 stars. I LOVE this song and I play it all the time. It's the only song she produced on the album. <br />17. Stripped Pt.2: 5/5 stars. This song would be good as the last song on the album (outro)<br />18. The Voice Within: 4/5 stars. It's an ok song.<br />19. I'm Ok: 5/5 stars. The best WRITTEN song. It's sad. I like it though....<br />20. Keep On Singin' My Song: 6/5 stars. I LOVE long songs and this one did it for me. Similar to \\"Happy Face\\" By Destiny Child's (Survivor) Well, the lyrics are. It's a well sung song and I like that strong note she hits on the end . I laughed when I heard the hidden thank you at the end or whatever that was. <br />Well, I love this album and I recommend it to anyone. You won't be dissappointed. For all the haters, keep on doing what you're doing cuz she don't care. I got your back Christina. She's the ONLY artist out right now who ranks with Mariah & Whitney, who are DEFINITLY gonna make strong come backs.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I'm a born cynic, and a great fan of Cash's work, but this album is the tops.  Stark, lyrical and bold.  It's a wonderful testament to faith, life, death and redemption.  My favorite track, and all of them are wonderfully done, is \\"I Hung My Head\\" as I can relate to it on a number of levels.  The cover of \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" gave me chills and then some.  Definitely a fitting work for a man whose career has reached wonderul peaks so many times.
6305313687|5.0|The saying, The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.. can be proven in this film..in its later stages. This film dictates the race derived violence that plague our society impeccably. Not that all race related violence is of the sheer magnitude that is portrayed in American History X, but is show what mere humans are capable of, when it comes down to protection and enforcing what they believe in and practice in daily life. The black and white layout of the film, is a simple, but blatant wrap up of what this film conveys..society, as a whole percieves that there is no grey area, in terms of race. Either you're black, or white. Its angers me, but thats how I believe the director felt how society perceives the idea of race. The film is very graphic in many scenes.. in ways that we normally cannot imagine. It shows racism and biggotry in its rawest form, but shows how one can turn his back on what he once believed in, and try to regain (or gain in this case) balance of morality.. the ending gets you the most. How it is concluded, will stay in the back of your mind for many years to come..and you will benefit from it.
B00004RFFW|5.0|This one is far out my favorite one, it action-packed, funny, and endearing, the story is solid as Mel and Danny are hunting down drug-smulling money-hungry diplomats! This movie is awesome, Joe Pesci is great, but he's not just the reason this movie perfect, I don't care what everyone says, this is the best one in the series, my favorites screens: Mel shots the fishtank, Mel and Pesci complaining about the Drive-thru \\"CLASSIC\\"! and Danny \\"YOU just got revoke\\"! this the best one one ever! buy it for god sake!! this one rules!!!
B00003CXI0|4.0|I've never read any of the books, co I'm not going to quibble about how well it holds up to any of them.<br />Harry Potter is the son of two married witches killed by the evil witch, Voldemort.  Somehow surviving the assault as a baby, marked by a jagged scar, Harry is raised by his hateful cousins (they keep him in a special room under the steps; Harry's portly cousin Dudley makes sure to come down the steps like an elephant) until that day when his parents' alma mater, Hogwarts Academy of Witchcraft, decides to accept him into their freshman class.  Knowing nothing of his parents or witchcraft, or of the way that preturnaturally magical people live alongside the rest of us non-magical types (or \\"muggles\\"), Harry is happily surprised to learn the truth.  Though set in modern-day UK, Hogwarts and the Witches Quarter resemble a cross between England in its Dickensian and Edwardian eras, complete with a winding street that looks like the one used in the \\"Muppets Christmas Carol\\" (Hogwarts itself seems like a send-up of the old English schools like those made famous in \\"Tom Brown's School Days\\").  Introduced to this new world by a gentle if dim Giant named Hagrid (Robby Coltrane, made to resemble a friendly grizzly in size and texture), Harry takes to his new existence and quickly maps out his challenges both mundane and epic - making friends with other student wizards, amassing points for his \\"house\\" (Hogwarts students are divided into dorms), contending with a snotty, bullying student named Draco (another nod to Tom Brown), and looking into the suspicious workings of the academy's potions professor (Alan Rickman) who appears undoubtedly in league with Voldemort.<br />This was a fun film, but somewhat long and loose - too content to be an event movie than a closely plotted one.  It was fun watching all of those kid actors navigate a world full of more recognizable adult stars (Maggie Smith resurrecting the heavy Scottish accent she used in \\"Jean Brodie\\"; Richard Harris as the school's dean; Alan Rickman who probably doesn't appear enough for plotting reasons; and Michael Caine as...wait, Michael Caine wasn't in this movie!  What happened to Michael Caine?)  While the special effects are great and all the players do a great job, the movie on the whole holds very few surprises.  The moral of the story is that love and friendship are the strongest forms of magic (there's hope for us muggles yet!), but the relationships are undertreated in the script (climaxed in a sort of deadly game of wizrard's chess played by Harry and his friends; in another instance, Ronald makes fun of fellow Griffendor-Wicth Hermione.  Though she's hurt, she spends much of the time being about the most frigid 12 year older you can imagine, never explaining how Ron's comment caused so much damage, or why she's so cold).  Still, despite its foibles, a fun movie and an event movie that outdoes the latest Star Wars flicks.  My 5 year older watched this and had a ball.
B000000QFY|4.0|This is a 3-1/2 star album, but I'm happy to round up to 4 because it's good to see these albums available on CD. When I looked two years ago, I couldn't find anything by Focus for sale. Focus is a Dutch progressive-rock band that mostly does instrumentals, centered on Jan Akkerman's guitar and Thijs Van Leer's flute. &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; is as good a novelty single as prog-rock ever produced, with its combination of power-chord guitar, yodeled verse, a vocal bridge that sounds like Popeye on uppers, and Tull-like flute solo. &quot;Janis&quot; is a lovely flute-based piece. &quot;Eruption&quot; is a long piece with several repeated riffs; in true annoying prog-rock fashion, each riff is given its own name. <br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00006FR47|5.0|CHICAGO V marked the beginning of a new incarnation of the Chicago sound.  After 1971's double CHICAGO III (which depleted their reserves of songs) and the quadruple set CHICAGO AT CARNEGIE HALL, the band decided it was time for a change.  Recorded in a mere few days in September 1971, CHICAGO V was released the following July featuring just one disc and ten relatively-shortened tracks.  Of course &quot;Saturday In The Park&quot; and &quot;Dialogue (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot; are well-known to Chicago aficionados, but what about the rest?  Chicago basically merged their freewheeling avant-garde and melodic tendencies together to create classics like &quot;A Hit By Varese&quot;, &quot;All Is Well&quot;, &quot;Now That You're Gone&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Robert Lamm hit his peak on this album, authoring a staggering 8 of the 10 tracks.  The album's enormous acceptance was evidenced by its incredible NINE weeks at # 1, making it the biggest album of 1972.  Now, CHICAGO V is fleshed out with an early take of Terry Kath's fine &quot;Mississippi Delta Blues&quot;, a backing track for &quot;A Song For Richard And His Friends&quot; (which appeared on the live CHICAGO AT CARNEGIE HALL) and the single version of &quot;Dialogue&quot;.  And take it from me, it all sounds GREAT.  A well-done reissue.
0451196716|5.0|This work by Stephen King is entitled \\"The Long Walk,\\": and is 'written by his alter-ego' Richard Bachman. Mr. King's work's a phenominel, and this is no exception.<BR>I'll admit, at the beginning King tried to make a big mystery what happens to the walkers who 'get their ticket.' Also, you could obviously tell what the ending would be like. What I thought would happen did, but at the same time, it didn't. I know, I know. You guys are think, 'How the hay did this chump 'know' but 'didn't know' the ending?' Well, my answer to that is relatively cheesy. You have to read this novel to find out. I should stop blabbing on about my opinion now, and get down to some business about what this book is really about.<br />Ray Garrarty is young boy who makes the tough decision to participate in the most grueling competition known to man. The ultimate prize awaits the winner, but for the ninety-nine losers, an award also awaits them. Their eternal rewards.<br />Back to the opinion... it sounds boring, and basically that is all the plots about. If someone tried to convince me to read a book with just that, I would think that they were crazy! But the thing is, King takes this plot that seems to go nowhere, and he extends it to make it the ultimate thrill, that cannot even be captured on a roller coaster! <br />In conclusion, all I have to say is, \\"Doggone it! King has done it again!\\"
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie is a great adaption of the comics.  They kept the storyline true, changing it only to make it fit the time restrictions.  The acting was good.  The only thing I would change is the amount of webslinging action.<br />The bonus features on the DVD's are good, but I don't think many non-fans will watch most of them.<br />I am very much looking forward to watching the sequal now that the mushy love interest and &quot;origins of&quot; plot are finished.<br />Mahalo.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love this film and highly recommend it!<br />HOWEVER, Disney seems to be sloppy about their QA process... We just got our copy and tried to play it in French, then we found something really bizarre. The first couple of minutes, the film kept on switching between draft version of black-and-white (in French) and color (in English); after that, it was all in pencil draft black-and-white in French. We checked our copy but found no scratches. This is obviously a technical problem from the careless Disney.
B00006G8LB|5.0|I am a comic book fan, and I am also a hardcore fan of Spider-Man, though I don't collect a lot of his merchandise, and I saw this movie and walked out of the theatre feeling like I just had to get this when it came out.  Sure enough, I got it on VHS tape about a week after it came out, and it was just as good as the last time.<br />The cast is excellent, and features Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson, Rosemary Harris as May Parker (Aunt May), and Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and the amazing Spider-Man.  Spidey's costume was done excellently, and the Green Goblin's outfit was really a leap out of the comic books, because originally the Goblin was just a green guy (Norman Osborn in costume) with a purple tanktop and kilt, gloves, and a wizard-like hat.  This is much better than the comic.  I actually own the graphic novel where Green Goblin is killed.<br />The special effects are okay, they are easy to spot, but can be ignored because this film is so action-packed.  And we also see that the supply of webbing for Spider-Man has changed.  Instead of buying cartridges of it to put in his gloves, he has organic webbing, which means he can just shoot them out of his bare wrists.  I laughed at the scene where Peter swing from one bulding to the other like Tarzan when he was exploring his powers and he crashed right into a billboard.  Another comedic scene is when Peter calls Bone-Saw McGraw gay: \\"that's a cute little outfit, did your husband give it to you?\\" during the cage match in which Peter was determined to win $3,000 staying in the ring for three minutes with Bone-Saw.  \\"Spider-Man\\" has its share of comedy as well as action and suspense.<br />The music, composed by Danny Elfman, is typical music, the opening music was creative.  I would also like to give Columbia/TriStar credit for the main titles at the beginning, that was really creative.  Sometimes it was great to have no music whenSpidey was swinging around with his webs, like towards the end when the Goblin had him basically beat, gosh, I hope I didn't give anything away.<br />And finally, the script was excellent, and a few parts were basically typical for a superhero, such things like \\"Bless you, Spider-Man, God bless you\\" or \\"we'll meet again, Spider-Man\\" are featured here.  But, there is also stuff that you would not see in comics, such as the part where Uncle Ben is changing a lightbulb and Aunt May says \\"Good, very good, just don't fall on your [can]\\".  And some of the script was actually pretty clever.<br />In conclusion, I definitely recommend \\"Spider-Man\\" for anyone who likes comics, and don't worry about knowing anything about Spider-Man before seeing this, because it explains everything.  So, DVD, VHS, rent, or theatrical, \\"Spider-Man\\" is not the best film ever, but it definitely deserves a spot on my shelf.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This soundtrack is probably my most favorite soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm always in the mood for it, because of the variety of different styles that are used. Whether I'm happy, sad, angry, energized, there's always something there I can listen to. Before I bought the CD, I watched the movie so many times half the time just to listen to the music. I've seen the movie 30 + times for certain, and I've listened to the CD too many times to count :-) I can't wait until the soundtrack for the Two Towers comes out, it sounds really good on the previews for the movie. If anyone knows when it's out, let me know at: (...) thanks!
B00006G8LB|5.0|I am a comic book fan, and I am also a hardcore fan of Spider-Man, though I don't collect a lot of his merchandise, and I saw this movie and walked out of the theatre feeling like I just had to get this when it came out.  Sure enough, I got it on VHS tape about a week after it came out, and it was just as good as the last time.<br />The cast is excellent, and features Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson, Rosemary Harris as May Parker (Aunt May), and Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and the amazing Spider-Man.  Spidey's costume was done excellently, and the Green Goblin's outfit was really a leap out of the comic books, because originally the Goblin was just a green guy (Norman Osborn in costume) with a purple tanktop and kilt, gloves, and a wizard-like hat.  This is much better than the comic.  I actually own the graphic novel where Green Goblin is killed.<br />The special effects are okay, they are easy to spot, but can be ignored because this film is so action-packed.  And we also see that the supply of webbing for Spider-Man has changed.  Instead of buying cartridges of it to put in his gloves, he has organic webbing, which means he can just shoot them out of his bare wrists. ... \\"Spider-Man\\" has its share of comedy as well as action and suspense.<br />The music, composed by Danny Elfman, is typical music, the opening music was creative.  I would also like to give Columbia/TriStar credit for the main titles at the beginning, that was really creative.  Sometimes it was great to have no music when Spidey was swinging around with his webs, like towards the end when the Goblin had him basically beat, gosh, I hope I didn't give anything away.<br />And finally, the script was excellent, and a few parts were basically typical for a superhero, such things like \\"Bless you, Spider-Man, God bless you\\" or \\"We'll meet again, Spider-Man\\" are featured here.  But, there is also stuff that you would notsee in comics, such as the part where Uncle Ben is changing a lightbulb and Aunt May says \\"Good, very good, just don't fall on your [can]\\".  And some of the script was actually pretty clever.<br />In conclusion, I definately recommend \\"Spider-Man\\" for anyone who likes comics, and don't worry about knowing anything about Spider-Man before seeing this, because it explains everything.  So, DVD, VHS, rent, or theatrical, \\"Spider-Man\\" is not the best film ever, but it definitely deserves a spot on my shelf, and should on yours, too.
0345350499|1.0|It pains me to say it, since I love Marion Zimmer Bradley's other works, but this book is the worst piece of drivel ever written.  The plot was paper thin and mainly consisted of people wandering around angsting and rehashing the same arguments over and over.  50 pages could have been cut from this book and no one would notice a thing.  This book was utter tripe.<br />If you like Arthurian ledgends, do a search for Diana L. Paxon instead.  Her Hallowed Isle series does the myths a lot more justice, and is a quicker more exciting read.
0375507507|5.0|As a person who has made numerous short trips on business over the years to Lusaka, Dar es Salaam, and Lagos, I have often wondered how people can live in Africa.<BR>In a tightly woven memoir, Ms Fuller vividly describes her growing up in Africa on four remote farms, 13 years in Zimbabwe, 2 years in Malawi , and  10 years in Zambia.  She communicates a love for Africa that pierces the economic, political, and health hazards that her family endured.   \\"In Rodesia, we are born and then the umbilical cord of each child is sewn straight from the mother onto the ground, where it takes root and grows\\" (p149). After describing her near death from dehydration from swallowing a bit of unboiled river water, she makes \\"a vow never to leave Africa\\" (p179).<BR>She describes how white kids from age five had to \\"learn how to loan an FN rifle magazine, strip and clean all the guns in the house, and ultimately, shoot to kill.\\" (p74)  A war that is ultimately lost.  ... <br />So far 2900 of the 3500 white farms in Zimbabwe have been taken under the guise of land distribution.<BR>The story is laced with wonderful dialogues,  the result no doubt of Ms Fuller's love of  reading in her media free environment and her years boarding at Arundel High School, a replica in Zimbabwe of the British Public School:  \\"The focus is on a rigorous academic program and we will be expected to pass difficult examinations sent out from Cambridge in England\\" (p224). <BR>She describes with deep affection a number of black Africans who worked for her parents.  In Zimbabwe, there is Cephas, an astute tracker, and the son of a witch doctor.  In Zambia, there is Adamson, the cook, with a joint constantly hanging from his fat lips, easing the pain of a daughter stabbed to death with a spear and another born with severe disabilities, not even able to walk.<BR>Then there is the young Australian woman hitching in eastern Zimbabwe with no one around for miles.  She wants a ride to where the Fuller's mineproofed LandRover is going even though she is told by Dad that they are just going \\"'To the dogs, . . to the bloody dogs.\\"<BR>She describes the defiance necessary for survival, -- her Dad telling a Zambian border guard \\"Fergoodsake, either let us go, or shoot us,\\" her Dad fully aware that shooting deaths are treated lightly, as accidents:  \\"We say, `Acci-didn't.  Acci-didn't stop. Ha ha\\" (p264).<BR>She describes her Mum's coping with the deaths of three children and resorting to alcohol in desperation.  She desribes her Mum's love of life, her efforts to rescue a spotted eagle owl, a symbol of bad luck  to the Zambian men who broke his wing in an aborted attempt to kill him, and her bonding with Caesar, her big bay Thoroughbred.<BR>She describes the terrors of the environment: \\"The hairs [of the buffalo bean] can stimulate a reaction so severe, so burning and persistent, that it has been known to send grown men mad, tearing into the bush in search of mud to alleviate the torture\\" (p110);  Putzi flies \\"lay eggs on damp patches of earth or unironed clothes, burrow under the skin, the eggs becoming maggots, bursting into living boils, emerging as full-blown, winged flies\\" (47).<BR>She is brutally honest.  Describing her beautiful sister's London wedding to a Zimbabwen: \\"The little lump under the wedding dress, behind the bouquet of flowers, is my nephew\\" (p289).<BR>She marries an American, a safari guide at age 23.  When asked how she feels before the wedding she replies \\"a bit queasy\\", not because she is nervous but because she has \\"had a dose of hard-to shake-off malaria for the last two weeks\\" (293).<BR>No doubt Ms Fuller's book will be turned into a movie, a movie that could rival Jamie Uys' film \\"The God's Must be Crazy\\".
B000002B7U|1.0|I think Randy Rhoads would not have liked this album if he was still alive....<br />Ozzy here goes totally mainstream, hair metal, pop metal, urgh!!
B00000IAU3|2.0|Dido's name is familiar to us since that fabulous collaboration with Eminem, &quot;Stan&quot;. It's pretty obvious she got all attention of the world after the success of &quot;Stan&quot; since she doesn't only sing her part in it but also adds to its flavour. Dido's debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; went multi-platin and suddenly she became a superstar. So what's the reason why we like her so much?<br />&quot;No Angel&quot; doesn't exactly stand for easy listening. In each song Dido seems to complain about something , she sounds depressed, yet certain of better future. That's what we like about Dido: she's the typical handsome girl next door giving vent to her feelings. She wins in accessibility what she loses in admirability, I defy everyone not to sympathize with her.<br />Dido provides us with a certain intimeness but does that say anything about the music? Apparently not. The opener &quot;Here With Me&quot;  starts with an intriguing tune that ties you to the song but it's a shame what it turns to. As far as I'm concerned the chorus is supposed to be the climax of a song , here it's nothing but a huge let-down.The song kind of loses its appeal after the chorus. Sadly  it's the same with almost all other songs on &quot;No Angel&quot;. Remember those brilliant, sweet, dramatic lyrics which made Dido famous? &quot;My tea's gone cold I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all/ The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all&quot;. These lyrics are from the song &quot;Thank You&quot; which was sampled in Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot;. The way Dido sings them makes a stone heart melt but the chorus should win the award for &quot;the most boring chorus ever&quot;. Further examples are &quot;Don't Think Of Me&quot;, &quot;Slide&quot; and &quot;Isobel&quot;.<br />Well, seems like Dido has the talent of turning  brilliant songs to soothing filler but there are 2 nice exceptions which prove she's capable of more. &quot;Honestly OK&quot; is experimental and trippy with some beautiful harmonica a la Ennio Morricone. And of course, the bonus track &quot;Take My Hand&quot;. It combines different styles, Dido's singing really comes along very well, I love these 6 minutes in the land of dreams!<br />Anyway, I heard some of Dido's work with Faithless and it's better than the better part of &quot;No Angel&quot;. It's just my opinion but I think she should stick with them.<br />I conclude that Dido has quite a lot of things to work on but otherwise, she's an interesting artist.
B00006AW2S|4.0|I have many of the remastered discs and I thought this one had pretty decent sound compared to some of the others.  I especially like the bass on this disc and love the Otis Redding covers.  The history of the different versions of this disc are interesting but the music speaks for itself.
B000068TPN|3.0|At the end of the movie, Barry Pepper says that the soldiers were not fighting for America, but for each other. Fair enough, but this seems to miss a significant point.<br />If they hadn't been there in the first place - they wouldn't have NEEDED to fight for each other - so what what he's really saying is that deep down, these men fought and died for nothing at all. They were there because they were told to be there - thats all.there was no higher purpose - no great cause like in World War 2 or even the Civil War. These men volunteered for the US army to defend America, then found themselves hideously mis-used in a war that was none of America's damn business.
B00000JH09|2.0|The 4 live tracks here are very poor. The guitar-playing is barely audible and the vocals are huffed and puffed. \\"War\\" was pretty good, but \\"Sugar\\" was truly awful. The other two were accessable. System Of A Down weren't a really good live band in 1999. Their studio music was very technical and hard to play live. However, on the Pleadge Of Allegence Tour around the time they dropped their sophomore album \\"Toxcity\\", their technical level dropped some, making thier live performances sound really good.<br />There are some differences in the liner-notes, with different pictures. Just the lyrics sheet has not been moved.<BR> <BR>You might want to buy this for the \\"Sugar\\" video, but just be aware that there are many better live bands than SOAD. <br />That's it, peace...
B00005JL0I|3.0|The movie is hit-and-miss (probably more &quot;miss&quot; than &quot;hit&quot;) but it does entertain through most of its considerable length.  The extra features are good, specifically, a 20 minute interview by one of the directors, Val Guest.  It does include the '54 TV broacast as well, but BEWARE: the version on this DVD is missing the final few minutes of the original broadcast.  If you're interested, I highly recommend the Collector's Edition VHS which includes the full-length TV show plus a highly informative intro by Lee Pfeiffer, as well as a collection of trailers for the movie not included on the DVD.  No true Bond fan should be without either version.
B000007T1M|5.0|System Of A Down's major label debut consists of 13 heavy, bizarre, layered and aggressive songs for you to behold. They are very talented musician and people as well. <br />Serj Tankian is a wild and crazy vocalist with disapproving views of society around him. He can has a melodic voice (See \\"Spiders\\"), a rather irritating high-pitched scream, and a few others. Sometimes you even forget that he is even on the vocals when you hear another voice. The vocals here are less emotional here than on \\"Toxcity\\" and decidedly not as good.<br />Daron Malakian is an amazing guitarist. Although his guitar-work here is much more load and distorted, it's not quite as heavy as on \\"Toxcity\\". He goes slower here. Nonetheless, he does some damn amazing things with his guitar (check out that sound in the beginning of \\"Suite Pee\\" or the other one in the beginning of \\"War\\"). Very technical. Plus, he does some back-up vocals (though not nearly as many as on \\"Toxcity\\") that have a whiny tone.<br />Shavo Odadjian is an average bassist. Not one of my favorites, however he is heard slightly better and more often than on \\"Toxcity\\". <br />John Dolmayan is a great drummer but he doesn't standout all the time. He doesn't use double bass drums too much either (not that it's a bad thing).<br />The album overall is great. It's heavy, complex, and at times thought provoking. \\"Mind\\" is great 6-minute-plus song beginning slow with sort of a jazzy-porno-movie-feel. Then it turns into a brainwashing assault of repetition and explosive riffs. There are many time-changes that jolt you back-and-forth. At one point, Daron's guitar gets up to Slayer-esque speed with would be superb for driving music. Then after the explosion is over, the noise dies down to a piece of music that sounds similar to that of the sound inside your head once you've survived a nuclear holocaust looking out at the rubble and orange clouds. It's quite a haunting song and a certain standout. It's their longest song to date. <br />Another good one would have to be \\"Soil\\". A more serious track dealing with a forced suicide of a friend (I'm just guessing, but judging by the \\"Evil lives in the skin\\" part, I'd say it means that a voice inside the person's head told him to blow out his brains). The guitars (though heavy) are pretty melodic sounding. A solo wouldn't work to well in this case, yet Daron manages to pull one off. I know it's kinda obvious, but you don't hear that many guitar-solos these days. The song ends in a fashion where they knock you out. Listen to understand that power and intensity.<br />\\"Sugar\\" is a knockout song if you haven't heard it so much on MTV. I didn't, so it's completely awesome. The lyrics don't seem to rhyme and they are pretty weird and kinda offensive. It's pretty much the reason why this album got noticed at all I guess.<br />Songs like \\"Ddevil\\" \\"Darts\\" and \\"CUBErt\\" are short explosions of aggression and little gems.<br />There are a few problems. The guitars are so loud and distorted that it can really pierce your ears at times. The production isn't top-notch; in fact it's a little sloppy. Finally, P.L.U.C.K. (Politically Lying Unholy Cowardly Killers) ends a little abruptly leaving you disappointed (at least that's what I think).<br />Great album, not quite as good as \\"Toxcity\\", but somehow more ambitious. If you liker this, try Slipknot, Slayer, and Meshuggha (pretty much what this band is: CRAZY!). <br />Standouts: \\"Know\\" \\"Sugar\\" \\"Suggestions\\" \\"Spiders\\" \\"Ddevil\\" \\"Soil\\"\\"War\\" \\"Mind\\" \\"Peephole\\".
B00005JHAB|1.0|i thought that this movie really [was weak].  the plot is about as dumb as cats and dogs, mr. deeds, and star wars II.  it's confusing because j-lo is going out with one guy and she doesnt like the other but next scene she's eating out with him or something(i dont know!... i hate this movie, and i wouldnt pay a penny for this movie.
B00006GFAB|1.0|Yet another platter chock full of the usual ancient party anthems.  Since these tired old warhorses insist on throwing these same old songs in the public's face, it's high time they get a brutally honest appraisal stripped of nostalgic haze.<br />Kiss was a band that couldn't funk like Aerosmith, couldn't muster the pop smarts of Cheap Trick and couldn't crunch with the authority of AC/DC.  The band was a one-trick pony -- whose trick was thudding, unimaginative at that -- and this collection proves it.<br />Without the grease paint, fire and blood to hide their musical deficiencies, the only songs here that stand on their own are \\"Rock'n'Roll All Night,\\" \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" (key to the sound of the '80s hair bands) and a few more.  The fact that the band can't come up with anything new only demonstrates their limitations.
B000066NW0|5.0|When Avril's first hit, \\"Complicated\\" came out, I enjoyed it very much.  But, when it got overplayed, I got sick of it.  When \\"Skater Boi\\" came out, I liked it too, but again, it was overplayed.  I really liked these two songs, and I thought that maybe her other songs would be bad, because usually, on cd's, there are about two hits, and the rest of the songs just [aren't as good].  But when my friend gave me Avril's cd because it was good, I gave it a try.  I was actually very surprised.  The lyrics relate to every possible situation a teenager goes through, well, with boys that is.  I could relate to this cd, and I realized I wasn't the only one who felt this way.  It's also a good cd to listen to while driving.  My favorites are tracks 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.  But numbers 11, \\"Nobody's Fool\\", and number 8, \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" are my absolute favorites.  \\"NOBODY'S FOOL\\" is the best, in my opinion. The lyrics are so creative, and they just sound good with the music.  The music is REAL music.  Get this cd, you won't regret it.  I was optimistic too, but I gave it a try, and saw that it was really good.  Hope you try it too!  :)
B00005JKWJ|5.0|It only happens once every, say, fifty, no, every hundred, movies when the sequel is better than the orignal. Blade II is one of these sequels to the highest degree. <br />Wesley Snipes returns in his all-star role as the Vampire-human hybrid killer of Vampires, Blade, every Vampire's worst nightmare. Over two years after his last big battle with his old enemy, Deacon Frost, Blade is still looking for his old time mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). His search has led him out of America and into Prauge in the heart of the Czech Republic. He somehow gets hooked up with a pot-smoking loudmouth named Scud (Norman Reedus), the reason is a mystery to all. He rescues Whistler and cures him of the Vampire Virus, the pathogen responsible for turning ordinary human beings into undead parasitic monsters. Upon regaining his old friend, Blade's crusade to wipe the vampires out takes a rather unexpected turn. He is called forth by the very leader of the nation he has sworn to take out and worst enemy, Vampire Overlord Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), his darkly beautiful and warrior daughter, Nyssa (Leonor Varela), and her fellow side-warrior, Asad (Danny John Jules). Blade learns from them that Vampires have an even greater enemy than he is. This new threat are Reapers, a race of mutant super-vampires, who are even stronger, faster, and more viscious than ordinary Vampires. The Reapers feed on both humans and Vampires, and are multiplying rapidly, for they need fresh blood every few hours and will attack any human or Vampire they can to feed. Within a month's time, their numbers will rise into the thousands. Once they finish off the Vampires, the humans will be next. Now Blade is out to wipe the Reapers out and finally face the progenitor Reaper responsible for the very outbreak of the Reaper plague, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss). Along side Asad and Nyssa, Blade leads a team of Vampire warriors called the Blood Pack, Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), Chupa (Matt Schulze), Lighthammer(Daz Crawford), Verlaine (Marit Velle Kile), Snowman (Donnie Yen(, and Priest (Tony Curran), a team that was originally trained to hunt Blade himself. But that will not be easy, for the Reapers are immune to anything that will kill ordinary vampires, except for ultraviolet light. <br />This movie has great special effects. It is faithful to the legacy of creatures of the night in every way and places Snipes as a master actor! It shows that even the deadliest of predators have superiors, sooner or later. Seeing the Reapers, who are more like carnivorous, mindless zombies than humans or ordinary Vampires, at their handiwork of draining their victims of blood will leave even the bravest of vampire movie watchers on the edge of their seats! With lots of martial arts fighting scenes and brilliant swordsmanship, it leaves the hand-to-hand combat scenes of Blade I in the dust! Even Vampires have enemies that don't just hunt them, but eat them, now! The Reapers are a totally out-of-this-world new step into Vampire terror. They're basically what the movie is all about. I frankly think that the Reaper is one of the best movie monsters ever made. They're so original and scary. They are unlike humans or vampires, they don't offer their victims life, or resist any emotion that some Vampires may have, or offer any gifts of new ways of living, or act normal in any way at all.  They, as the director puts it, \\"want to suck ya dry.\\" Some of the most intense sequences in the movie is seeing the Reapers open their mouths into foot-wide yapping maws, where their jaws split into twin mandibals equipped with fangs injecting lethal paralyzing venom, and out comes a barbed, snake-like tougne equipped with a gaping tendril-filled orifice that they use to siphon the life blood from their victims. And just wait till you see them in sunlight. See them burn black, the fierce blue light shine out of the the cracks in thier charred flesh in all directions, and finally explode in a shower of ash. As before, there are a lot of cool weapons and gadgets in the movie. And somewhere along the line, there's betrayl and revenge. But if you want to see where that comes in, see the moive and find out for yourself.<br />Finally, there's the actors themselves. Snipes is great at playing his role as Blade. Maybe it's the role he's best at. The one female character in the cast, Nyssa, is just what was needed for Blade II. She's pretty, she's a fierce fighter and she has feelings that show that she has some humanity even though she's a pure-blood. The relationship between Blade and Nyssa that develops through the movie, is one of the new ingredients to this sequal that makes it better than its progresser. Luke Goss has what I think is the second most important role in the movie. If you see him without his Reaper makeup on, you might think it ironic that he plays the scary, malicous super Vampire because he looks totally different, handsome in fact. But he plays his role as Nomak wonderfully. <br />But, one the best things on the movie is the final showdown. In Blade I, even though Frost was infused with La Magra, Blade had no real trouble putting putting him down. In the final battle of this one, Blade is totally out-matched by his opponent. If you've seen Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, you may be reminded of the battle scenes in that movie where muscular men are thrown around like toys. This final battle is truly well-down. <br />And Snipes really does follow the qoute he makes in the movie. \\"Keep your friends close, and keep your enemies even closer.\\"
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an extraordinary CD.  Norah Jones' voice is heavenly.  Putting her CD in your player will set a sweet romantic mood for you and your mate.  I can't listen to her voice without smiling, and feeling a little sad.<br />I recommend this for anyone who likes to LISTEN to music, not just play it in the background.
B0000542D2|3.0|A Hard Day's Night is one of those films that are highly praised, but not quite the masterpiece it's heralded as.<br />Perhaps it's overrated because of its groundbreaking nature in 1964. This film is the origin of music videos, and the reason we have MTV, VH1 and other music channels now.<br />But when you look at it now, some thirty years later, many of the film's flaws are all too noticeable. Most note worthy, the acting by the Beatles isn't up to snuff. It improves in their later films, but several of their lines here are down-right cringe worthy. Also, much of the camera work is unintentionally shaky. One could argue they were doing it for the film's somewhat documentary approach, but it seems more likely they were rushed for time with the Beatle's busy schedule, as many scenes were steady, while others were shaky.<br />But despite these flaws, the film is still very enjoyable. It's clear the Fab Four were having a blast making this film, ad libbing many of the lines. At times, their comments are surprisingly racy for the time, and it adds to their youthful vigor here. Despite no clear plot, the film still works, almost documentary-like, aided in part by the shaky camera work.<br />I prefer the Beatles follow up film Help!, a much better produced story with louder laughs. That film shows the Beatles becoming more comfortable in their movie shoes. Yet, somehow in its more polished state, it loses some of the youthful innocence the Beatles had at the very beginning of their career, which A Hard Day's Night righteously explores. Four stars for Beatles Fans, three for the average film viewer.
6304359217|5.0|Space Jam is another rare live action-animated movie. And if you like Space Jam, I also reccomend the Pagemaster. The movie stars Michael Jordan as himself. And I guess that this is a part of this movie is based on a true story. But most of this didn't. In real life Michael did retire and play baseball, but I don't believe that he got pulled down a golf course and aliens making thier way into basketball players like Charles Barkley and stealing thier talent, or a failing park like Moron Mountain. And I don't know if in real life Michael Jordan's father allowed him to play basketball after midnight in the summer of 1973. Which that is how Space Jam opens, then jumps to opening credits with the title song, and then we see Michael Jordan (as himself) at a press conference where he annoces that he is retring from the NBA (Notinal Basket Asscontaion) and going to baseball where we and learn that he went 0-4. And then aliens show up from outer space to kidnap Bugs Bunny and other looney toon characters. But the looney toons ask for a chance to defend themselves and changle them to a basketball game. The alins steal the talent from basketball players and grow to about 6 feet.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|Someone got my son this movie as a Christmas gift last year (he was 3 at the time).  I'm so glad I watched it first.  Within the first 5 minutes I had decided that he would not see this movie now - and he would not see it 2 years from now either.  The movie may have gotten great reviews, but I thought it was vulgar.  It's certainly not what I want my child to see and then imitate.  Not for kids younger than 10, in my opinion.
B00005YXZH|5.0|1st listening was average but the more I hear it the better it gets
B00006SFLV|5.0|This amazing show is finally being released on DVD in its entirety much to the relief (and thanks to) its loyal fans, thousands of whom signed a petition at mscl.com years ago to convince BMG that we do indeed want every single episode on DVD (rather than only the first three previously released).<br />MSCL captures a moment in time that we all remember.  Even if you weren't a flannel wearing teenager in 1994, the themes still resonate.  After all, everyone remembers their first heart-breaking crush, betrayal at a friend's hands, and the highs and lows of high school.<br />I have only watched two of the discs so far, but the quality is excellent.  Granted I was so overwhelmed by seeing the show again that perhaps I'm a bit biased, but the episodes I have watched so far look great...
B00001MXXG|5.0|In &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot;, Matthew Broderick plays Ferris Bueller, a high school teenager who enjoys slacking off and cutting school is his favorite hobby. One brilliant day in his hometown of Chicago, Ferris decides to cut school again (even though he has already missed school nine times), and tries to show his sick best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) how to have a good time and just how to be laid-back with life. Ferris can easily fool his parents (Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward) into believing that he is really sick so he can stay home from school. But when his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey) and school dean, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) find out that Ferris has cut school, they both try to make his life as miserable as possible in their own ways. And it's up to Ferris to enjoy his day off and get home before his parents come home from work.<br />The cast is brilliant...this is probably Matthew Brodderick's best role to-date. Director John Hughes did an amazing job, as usual. The script is well-written and extremely funny. &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; is a classic high school film that everyone should own. However, the DVD lacks terribly; the only bonus feature is a commentary made by John Hughes. And the DVD is available in wide screen format.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Ferris Beuller's Day Off&quot;.<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
630416923X|5.0|I found a new Pioneer laserdisc version of the Beatles Anthology on the Internet and the quality of the video and sound is quite remarkable. Until the DVD comes out, this laserdisc is worth the investment as used laserdisc players are available for around $200-300. Another nice feature of laserdisc is that there is no copy protection, and one can make a nice copy to play on your VCR.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|this guy is just the best he delivers the main song great and put together a great cast of guests buy the delux because you get the obie trice song rap names which was so good they shot a video for.
B000002UZ1|5.0|One advice, buy it!! It has so many great beatles songs, I don't know where to begin. All the tracks are good. But \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\" and \\"A day in the life\\" are maybe my favorite songs. \\"Old brown shoe\\" is a really sweet song too. Everyone should own a copy of this cd!!! This is the fab four at their best:)
B00006G8HX|4.0|The &quot;Star Trek III-The Search for Spock Special Collector's Edition&quot; DVD continues Paramount's two-disc DVD release for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature film series. The clean-up and 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack are clearly evident. But the other Special Features, like the &quot;Star Trek II-The Wrath of Khan: The Director's Edition&quot; DVD, are great, but still not as compelling as the Director's Edition DVD release of &quot;Star Trek-The Motion Picture.&quot; But boy, Robin Curtis still looks good!<br />Movie Grade: A (4.5 stars)<br />DVD Grade: B+ (4 stars)
B00005A46T|2.0|To start off, I think another  review here summed it up very well, it is almost identical to my experience with this band.  Their self-titled album amazed me with what I thought was the end of the line in heaviness, the ultimate possible extremity in music.  Soon after that I stumbled upon the underground, where great bands still lived, there was still talent and inspired music being written.  I dont want to get into the names of bands seeing that too much hype for any kind of music for these so-called \\"metal-heads\\" will have them buying anything, but trust me that there is a world of great, METAL music that the public ignores. <BR>On to the content of the CD: yes, this is nu-metal with the down-tuned guitars and a somewhat groove to it, but in no way does it suck. There are good songs on here, nothing great, and if you compare them to the other bands in the mainstream their really not all that bad. The best way to describe this would be to call it junk-food metal. It sounds good the first time you hear it, its definetly enjoyable, but listening to it multiple times doesnt reveal anything new. Heavy sound, but not 'heavier than hell' as people like to say.There is practically a library of GREAT metal bands out there, but this isnt one of them.
B00000JMQC|5.0|I remember watching this overseas when my parents would go to the embassy, while I was in the 2nd/3rd grade. I love the movie so much back then that I'd watch it whenever we'd go over there. It was scary, of course, with all the heads in cases and whatnot, but come on... I'm 23 now, and I own a copy myself to watch whenever I want  a good squirm (but, then, maybe it's just because I remember being so freaked out by Mombi when I was a kid... maybe not...). I definitely recomend it for someone who wants to watch a great \\"kids\\" movie with or without children in their presence. It's good for everyone.
B00005JK8K|3.0|The trailer for this movie made it look better than it actually was.  I was rather disappointed that the movie didn't turn out to be as good as it looked in previews.  I found that there were too many special effects and battle scenes but not enough character development and dialogue.
B00006RG9K|5.0|I really liked this DVD.  With many different camera angles, fans will truly enjoy.  If you want to watch Phil and Chester drum, this DVD provides the angles.  If you are a keyboard fan,  many angles focus entirely on Tony.  Guitarist also have a chance to view the work on the srtings.  For those who enjoy not only the music but the lightshow- many angles are above the stage and in the balcony so you are not forced to look at the close-ups.  Sound is great but the only disappointment is the commentary track.  One wishes that the band was more articulate.
B00006C79E|3.0|It's been over a decade since their masterful debut, and the UK trio Saint Etienne are still churning out decent albums of quirky, pretty pop.  &quot;Finisterre&quot; won't make anyone trade in their copy of &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot; or &quot;Good Humour,&quot; but it's an overall appealing CD with a few good tunes.  The trio's greatest asset is definitely Sarah Cracknell, whose vocals exude a distinguished cool over these tracks.  In between spoken interludes, we are treated to disco bliss in &quot;Shower Scene,&quot; 80's-like synth touches on &quot;Amateur,&quot; and the carefree pop of &quot;Soft Like Me,&quot; which has--gasp!--rapping.  There's more filler than I'd care to listen to, and the removal of the spoken interludes would have made this CD a more enjoyable listen.  Still, any album that has the lyric &quot;I believe in Donovan over Dylan&quot; can't be that bad, and, therefore, &quot;Finisterre&quot; earns a B- in my school of music.
B00005JKJA|1.0|This film is just plain disappointing. I believe Lynch try to <BR>create some kind of Art Nouveau cinema but he just does not<BR>have the genius to back it. The film has no conclusion <BR>whatsoever and left me with the feeling of having lost 2h30 hrs<BR>For Lynch fans only.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was using B &amp; N's feature in their store where you can listen to any CD (many CDs anyway), and thought I'd try the popular genre for a change. I was going from CD to CD to CD and confirming what I already knew, that pop music held very little for me when I tried Nora's CD. Okay, Who is Nora Jones, I was thinking. I liked the first track, so decided to go further, and behold, I was liking everything I was hearing. I find her voice, attractive, her very subtle pianistic style attractive, even the old country tunes that have been worn out long ago, were made attractive once again. How she and her ensemble did it, I don't know. There's nothing there of a kind that I haven't heard before many times. I can't explain it further. I gave a copy to my 15-year-old daughter and the quality of sounds emanating from her room has improved greatly, as she plays it over and over.
B00005UWBP|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a day...if not more...Heart-pacing...edge of your seat thirll ride
0767817664|5.0|i can even forgive the (nearly unforgivable) cheesy dance club seduction scene (bad!) Roddy Mcdowell is reason enough to see the film...his Peter Vincent, Fearless Vampire Killer is a wonderful character (not to mention a good name!) and you can really see McDowell revelling in the campy over-the-top antics and nature of his character. there are some good laughs, chills and a lot of action in the film.....good stuff!
B000002UB3|5.0|&quot;Abbey Road&quot; was the last album recorded by the Beatles, although both &quot;Let It Be&quot; and a collection of singles never released on albums both came out afterwards.  While not as monumental as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (what could be?), this album is at least the equal of that one.  Maybe it was more appropriate than ironic that George Harrison was now fully coming into his own as a songwriter, as amply proven by &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; just as the group was disintegrating.<br />Even at the end the Beatles are still having fun at other people's expense: one interpretation of the famous cover is that, working right to left (this is England after all) John is Jesus, Ringo the minister, Paul the dearly departed (remember he is &quot;dead&quot;) and George the grave digger.  You will never be able to convince me that the final punch of line of this running gag will be the final irony that Paul will be the last surviving Beatle.<br />&quot;Side 2&quot; of the album quickly becomes a hodge-podge of apparently everything Lennon and McCartney had been working on, spliced together so that the whole is greater that the sum of the parts.  Essentially you end up with a pair of suites: &quot;Sun King&quot;/&quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;/&quot;Polythene Pam&quot;/&quot;She Came In Through the Bathroom Window&quot; and &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;/&quot;Carry That Weight&quot;/&quot;The End.&quot;  For that matter, &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; is a suite unto itself by that standard.  There might have been a tendency to think of these as almost throw away songs, but Joe Cocker proved that was not the case when he recorded &quot;She Came In Through the Bathroom Window,&quot; the most recent live version of which is one of the top Beatles covers of all time.<br />The harmonies are still as rich as ever (e.g., &quot;Because&quot; and &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;) and there is still the impulse to remind people that this is still a rock &amp; roll band (e.g., &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; and &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;).  The fun, such as &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; and Ringo's &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; are still present, as is the social critique (&quot;Come Together&quot;).  So as the Beatles went out there was not only evidence of what they had become but a reminder of how they started out when they hopped across the Atlantic and shook America out of its lethargy after JFK's assassination by singing a couple of songs on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot;  The best way to think of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is that despite what we see and hear on &quot;Let It Be,&quot; this is the album that proves the Beatles went out on top.<br />I see that Paul McCartney finally got to sing &quot;Her Majesty&quot; for Queen Elizabeth II, so that has to be another thing to check off on his things to do list.is still a rock &amp; roll band (e.g., &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; and &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;).

B000002SE0|5.0|The best recording of Turandot. Better than her 1959 recording with Bjoerling. Her effortless high notes over chorus and orchestra at the end of the second act are beyond compare. Corelli, when he was in voice was superb. He is in voice.
0316666343|5.0|I was hooked the moment I read the first page.  I was sad when I read the last, because that meant that the story was over.  That is a true sign of a good book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A great blend of country, jazz, soul and probably a few other genres.  Be sure to read the liner notes to see that Norah wrote a few of these tunes and plays the piano on almost all of them.  The recording of Hank Williams' \\"Cold, Cold, Heart\\" brings this hit into the 21st century without compromising it one bit.  \\"Come Away With Me\\" is so wistful one wants to hold Norah's hand and tell her everything's gonna be ok. All of the songs invite one to sit back, listen closly to the lyrics and relax.
B000006YMM|4.0|Although some of the songs on this album fail to justify the singing talent of Agnetha Faltskog,her voice is something that never lets her down. This being her second solo english album gives us some enjoyment with songs like &quot;I Won't Let You Go&quot;,&quot;Just One Heart&quot;&quot;Eyes Of A Woman&quot; and &quot;One Way Love&quot;. Again I must say along with my review on her greatest hits album,this is strictly for Abba or Agnetha fans only to enjoy..but I hope someone can prove me wrong,I've yet to meet someone who is not a real Abba fan to like Agnetha's solo works. Anyhow a nice album to listen to when you are in the mood to relax and unwind.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd was a trippy band. They were rooted in hard rock. Like Alice Cooper, when they played straight music it was mostly heavy rock. This album contemplates the emotional wall we build around ourselfs when bad things happen. It is one of the most haunting records ever. It will move you. It may make you laugh, cry, whatever. You will feel some emotion. Roger Waters is so much better at writing then Syd B. ever was. He poured his heart into this album. It shows. You must own this record. This is pure art......
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has got talent.  This being his first cd, it is amazing. I love his lyrics and smooth musical tunes. Everything about this cd makes it worth buying. Mayer is original and he even writes and plays his own music, which in todays world is pretty rare.  I rarely like all the songs on a cd, however, this cd is an exception.  Every song is good. I love to sing along.  I would recommend that everyone purchase this cd, it is worth adding to your collection.  I expect we'll be seeing great things from John Mayer in the future. If nothing else, just sit back, relax and enjoy this amazing cd...
B00006L3LD|5.0|Incubus, in my opinion, has to be one of the best bands of this era.  I have every single one of their CD's and this one has to be one of the best.  Their music is so different and original that it needs to be put into a class by itself.  If you like any kind of music I recomend this CD.  It kicks some major...  Brandon Boyd (lead singer) has a unique rythmic voice along with guitar, bass, drums, and DJ this band can play anything from their dream-like 'aqueous transmission', to their \\"angry\\" 'Blood on the ground'...buy this CD even before you buy food.  It's so worth it.
6300182355|5.0|This movie is somewhat cheesy but it is a classic in his gender and definately very well put togheter, also the soundtrack is top-notch. Overall: EXCELLENT.
0446607274|5.0|My first experience with Connelly's Harry Bosch, and damn I'm impressed.  Ellroy is the man, but Connelly may be one of the best in his own right.  Looking forward to many more stories with Harry Bosch, one of the more intriguing characters I've read in a long time.  The story rips along at a buzz-saw pace, intelligently written, with humourous quips and a mystery that keeps you guessing until the last chapter.  This is what great detective fiction is all about, and ANGELS FLIGHT delivers.
B00005BCOK|5.0|Great movie. It make you wonder about technology being too perfect and selfconscious. Overall: EXCELLENT.
B00006CXXU|5.0|My dad bought me Christina's first album when it first came out and I liked for about a year then I 'grew up'. The album was just too pop for me. When I heard Dirrty for the first time, I instantly hated it. Yeah it wasn't pop but it wasn't my kind of music either.<BR>But one day at a store I saw her album and for some reason I bought it the next day! [I got my dad to buy it from here since I was low on cash] But after listening to the songs i nearly had a heart attack. Christina had truly changed musically AND vocally. I could barely recognise her voice in some songs! All of the songs had so much emotion. I guess she grew up with me too since she wasnt singing about genies anymore.<BR>So, if you disliked her last album then you gotta buy this.<BR>if you liked her last album then dont buy this.<BR>None of the songs are pop. They are more like R&amp;B and there are some exellent ballads, hot latino-ish song, a rock-ish song, hiphop-ish songs, Alicia Keys-ish songs [she even wrote one]<BR>...And you can truly relate to the songs. I never new Christina had so many emotions and I respect her for writting them and sharing them with the world.<BR>My favorite songs on the album are the ones she did with Linda Perry. But some Linda songs sound a little like pink [vocally and musically] But thats good for Chris, she learned that you dont have to sing perfectly.<BR>I also believe that Christina will have older fans now. No, not teenagers. Poeple in their 30's and 40's will listen to this album cuz i think it'll be harder for the younger kids to relate to this album.<BR>Well, stop reading this and click &quot;add to shopping cart&quot;!
B00003CXDU|4.0|I thought this movie was not going to be good, but instead I enjoyed it very much. It was funny, had a decent plot and the special effects were much much better than I expected. Overall: VERY GOOD.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I remember the episodes where they had these songs and I especially remember crying while buffy sang walk thru the fire. And I remember laughing at the song about the bunnies. <BR>This soundtrack is excellent. Seriously, Buffy fan or not you should get this album because it's filled with fun and emotions. Everyone can relate to these songs. [even the bunny song]<BR>If you buy the album and you don't like it, you can always find a Buffy fan that will be more than happy to have it.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I just saw the 20th anniversary of E.T. and it is still magical. I think the<BR>20th anniversary changed nothing that made E.T. a classic. They changed<BR>E.T.'s face for the better. More movement in his face and instead of the<BR>FBI having guns they have walkie talkies. The Night Sky looks wonderful and<BR>the spaceship looks better. I think this 20th anniversary is exactly the<BR>same movie as 20 years ago but spielberg just used technoligy today to make<BR>it more visually stunning. Thanks Mr Spielberg.
0783222955|3.0|This movie was ahead of its time. I really enjoyed the introductory sequence featuring Scout coloring and humming. Gregory Peck was amazing as Atticus Finch, bringing much, but not too much drama to his role. However, I do feel that this movie was overall too dramatic, very unlike the book. It lacked the book's subtle humor, and replaced it with exaggerated dramatic scenes. Perhaps I'm biased, but after the book, my expectations weren't quite met. But, I would recommend this movie for its symbolism, good acting, and pleasant feeling that you're left with at the end. (I give this movie 3 1/2 stars.)
B0000683DH|5.0|Certainly the best of the original cast Trek movies, Wrath of Khan the Director's Cut is augmented by fun features. Notably, Mike Okuda's &quot;text commentary&quot; reveals unique production tidbits that even ardent Non-Trekers will find interesting. A delight for any student of film as well. Throw in a fine audio commentary track from the director, a disk of featurettes, and the discovery that the longer version of Kahn is actually better, and you have a decent product for any film fan, and a must have collection for Trek fans (of any level).
B00006LLNU|5.0|The entire album is one long, beautifully flowing epic.  Sigur Ros is one of the few truly unique bands to come around in recent years.  Their music is very mellow and soothing.  Wonderful background for anything.  I would recommend this album to anyone looking for something different and intelligent.
0316666343|4.0|...this one will make you think!<br />I caught wind of the basic plot of this novel through some media source and remember thinking, \\"No way I'll read that.\\"  ... Initially like I get drawn in by the CSI type shows, but then more by the writing.  I loved this book and I am quite hard to please when it comes to contemporary fiction.  To try and summarize the beauty, mystery, spirituality, grief, and humor depicted in the novel would not do it justice.  So I'll just tell you, read the book.  I bet you'll be recommending it to your friends.
B000002MY3|4.0|while i do blame canada for a lot of things, (hardly) I don't blame them for Alanis Morissette. until she starts prancing around without any clothes in a video. but this is before that time. this album is defintiely a landmark album. I recommend it mainly b/c it set the precendent for a lot of female singers. alanis has a powerful haunting voice that really makes the album that much better.<br />I recommend &quot;You Outta Know&quot;. I always thought that was her best song.<br />peace
B00005QG9J|5.0|Before I say anything, let me start by informing you that Incubus is my favorite band of all time, so this review may be a little biased.  having said that, on to the review.<br />Oh man, this CD is excellent.  By far the most musical of Incubus' albums, and in my opinion the best of them all.  When I first bought it and listened to it, there were a few songs I wasn't too fond of, but most of them grew on me.  There is now only one song I still don't like too much, and that's track 10, &quot;Have You Ever.&quot;  I was amazed at how great this album was, and my advice to you is if you don't like a song at first, listen to it a few more times (not in a row, but every now and then), and you'll grow to love it.  That was the case for me with track 3, &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot;  This album is absolutely wonderful, and is still in the original style that Incubus established for themselves in their album &quot;Make Yourself.&quot;  Buy this CD, it's well worth the money.
B000063V8T|5.0|It's hard to beat the third season of ST:TNG for its combination of the first two years' original-Trek-esque weirdness and more subtle modern sensibilities, but if any season of the show even comes close to edging out year 3 as my favorite, this is it.  Season 5 was the year of brainy gems like Darmok and The First Duty, heart-on-the-sleeve classics like The Inner Light and The Perfect Mate, and good kooky fun with The Game, Conundrum, and A Matter of Time.  There are a few dead-on-arrival entries too (including the series' all-time worst, Imaginary Friend), but it's hard to find a year of the series that doesn't have at least a couple of those.  There are more bonuses than usual, the best of which is a touching tribute to Gene Roddenberry (who died during the production of the fifth season).  It's also nice to see the visual FX guys get their own featurette - as nice as CGI is, it's good to remember that sometimes modelwork can get it done better, and perhaps even cheaper (the eight-story power generator that was only as tall as a fluorescent light tube).  My only gripe is that I wish they'd space these out a little more for seasons 6 and 7 - some of us can scarcely afford to pop a hundred on one of these puppies every month.  Then again, in the Star Trek spinoff library (and not counting Enterprise), Paramount has the equivalent of 21 years of television to roll out in DVD form, so I suppose they're making sure it doesn't take 21 years to make it to market.  It's a no-win scenario.  But, that said, this set is a winner.
0790749815|4.0|Nominated for several Academy Awards, this 1959 film by Alfred Hitchcock lives in my memory because of several memorable scenes.  There's a scene where Cary Grant is being chased by an crop duster airplane.  And then there's another scene where killers are chasing Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint on Mount Rushmore.  I remember Cary Grant being suave.  And I remember Eva Marie Saint as being beautiful.<br />Forty-three years have passed since then.  It's time to take another look at this classic.<br />Well, Cary Grant is still suave.  Eva Marie Saint is still beautiful.  The two memorable scenes are still tense with action.  And the Hitchcock style of suspense is there too.<br />But it's no wonder I don't remember the plot, which revolves around Cary Grant being mistaken for an international spy, Eva Marie Saint being a double agent and James Mason and Martin Landau being the bad guys.  That's because, like some of today's technological wonders, the plot is an afterthought, pulled together for the purpose of showing off the &quot;good scenes&quot;.<br />My opinion on this was borne out by the special features on the DVD, which described the making of the film.  The action scenes were thought up first, and then the story was fitted around them.<br />O.K.  The film is a classic and will remain so no matter what I say.  And memories of those several scenes will live long into the future.<br />But I yearn for a story I can sink my teeth into.  I want to care about the characters.  I want to believe that the action they are going through is possible.  I feel this about films of today.  And I feel this about North By Northwest.<br />High-tech aficionados will enjoy this flick as a great achievement for Hitchcock given the era he worked in.  I can appreciate it for its historical significance, but certainly not for anything else.  I therefore can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.
6305508550|4.0|Office Space is a great movie. It's one of the many DVD's I own. It's from the creators of Beavus and Butthead so you know it's going to be great. It comes on Comedy Central just about every weekend so if you want to buy it that's fine but if you want to record it and get it for free, that's even better.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I bought this movie on the recommendation of a Target employee who fiercely recommended it but couldn't readily explain it. Despite being extremely confusing, it absolutely rivets you to your seat with suspense and slowly reveals the truth. Insignificant events turn out to have meaning. You dont know if Donnie is crazy or not. What is real, what is not? Do things really happen by chance? Are things really how they appear? <br />Just like the previous reviewer, I watched this movie three times in the same night. There are clues carefully placed throughout the movie alluding to what's coming. I guess the reason I never considered buying it was the title and the box. The box looks like a Friday 13th/Freddie movies and doesnt accurately reflect the depth of this movie. And the marketing, I never heard of the darn thing.  One of the deleted scenes on the DVD I felt should have been included in the movie. Since Donnie's hallucinations are increasing in severity and frequency, his shrink doubles his dosage. The scene left out is where the shrink tells Donnie he's been taking placebo's all along! That would have freaked me out, and I'm sorry the director chose to delete that scene. Missing this movie is like missing the Sixth Sense.
B00005JKJA|5.0|The two halves come together only briefly in the middle of the film.  She is torn, split right down the middle: the wannabe starlet too naive for Hollywood; and the spurned lover whose anger and resentment may (or might have led) lead to murder.  But why are they played by the same actress, and why do they diverge at the point in the film that they do?  The answer is not so simple, but I think it lies in the fact that \\"dreams are not only made, but shattered in Hollywood.\\"  I know I'm getting in deep here, but can we substitute the naive one's drive/passion to \\"make it\\" as an actress with the spurned one's drive/passion for revenge?  Is Hollywood the sexy lover who uses you only when it needs you and for its own purposes and then dumps you when it's through with you?  Something like that is happening in the film, but you know what?  Lynch's movie is more enjoyable to watch than any attempt on my part to explain it.  No matter how elusive it may seem at times, Mullholland Drive is a great viewing experince. And the lesbian scene is excellent, too.
B000007T1M|5.0|The first SOAD album is pure insanity. Poetry with power Chords. It has everything. So does TOXICITY. Toxicity is just as hard rock in it's own way. You Have to give them that the first CD was written as mostly songs the would enjoy playing live. Think they said so in an interview. But Toxicity is completley original, just as the first. For those who dislike toxicity, would you rather have them copy the first one completley? Then you would hate them more. And why Hate them at all. You dis toxicity just cuz you CLAIM the riffs and lyrics are softer and slower, or cuz it gets played on the radio.If they hadn't had sucess on the radio, they wouldn't have sold many albums, and would have no money to create another masterpiece.
0375507507|5.0|Subtitled, \\"An African Childhood,\\" this delightful autobiography by Alexandra Fuller transported me right into her world.  Born in 1969, her early childhood was spent in sweltering hot Rhodesia, where her parents slept with guns next to their bed, and her father was often away, fighting with other white men against the guerillas who eventually won the war.  Her parents were poor, life was brutal and harsh, and the climate was always sticky and uncomfortable. And yet, this is a tale laced with humor as she casts her child's eye view at the many disruptions and disappointments of her family's life as they moved from Rhodesia to Malawi and then to Zambia.<br />Ms. Fuller's world was full of hot sweaty days, hard work, mosquitoes and ticks and snakes.  There's only occasional electricity, drinking water is foul, and any kind of plumbing is a luxury.  But there's always beer and alcohol, and lots of cigarettes, all of which is taken for granted as a way of life by her and her sister, the two surviving siblings out of five.  I couldn't help thinking about my own children and their easy life here in New York, as I looked at the photographs throughout the book as the two young girls grew up and the parents grew wrinkled and gray.  I love the writer's descriptions and the way she uses words.  The children sing songs about fighting through \\"thickandthin\\" and the family camps with other \\"expats-like-us\\".  Young Alexandra, nicknamed \\"Bobo\\" learns to clean, load and shoot a gun.  Her father chain smokes cigarettes as he drives their Land Rover over inhospitable roads.  Her mother loves animals and keeps packs of dogs around in a losing battle to control their fleas.  The children attend boarding schools that change in racial composition as the politics change.  And yet there's never a single word of self pity in spite of failing crops and ramshackle living conditions.<br />I loved this book and read it fast, enjoying Ms. Fuller's voice.  The Africa she describes became real to me as I let myself plunge into her world for a little while.  There was an excellent map which helped me locate the places she describes as well as the family snapshots.  Most of all though, there was a sense throughout of what it really felt like to be that little girl who grew up to share her memories with her readers.  I thank her for doing that and give this book one of my highest recommendations.  Read it.  It's a real treat!me as I let myself plunge into her world for a little while.

B00005ASIL|3.0|Any greatest hits album with the remastering of hit songs is going to be fairly decent.  I would have to rate this as an OK mix of 20 Tull songs. Favorites like New Day Yesterday and Aqualung still shine incandescently.  There were however many notable excellent tunes missing.  There was really nothing from the great Tull album Benefit and where was Cross Eyed Mary from the Aqualung album?  There actually were a few clunkers included.  The selection of tunes was dubious at best.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic coming-of-age novel.  Harper Lee takes her readers on a three-year journey from the perspective of a young girl growing up in the South.  The story takes place during the Great Depression of the 1930&#146;s in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama.  The novel centers around Scout, the narrator, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus.  The book focuses mainly on the racial relationships of this time, but explores other areas as well.  <br />Scout and Jem (9 and 13 respectively by book&#146;s end) become wise and Scout matures significantly over these three years.  Atticus has a lot to do with this. He teaches his children to treat everyone equally by trying to &#147;consider things from another&#146;s point-of-view.&#148;  The maturity of both children as well as their bravery shines through during the trial scene in which Atticus is appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Scout and Jem suffer emotional heartache throughout the trial.  However, they stand up for what they believe &#150; all people should be treated fairly no matter what color they are, and that &#147;there&#146;s only one kind of folks.&#148;  <br />One of the other areas Lee covers in her novel is the pressure put on young women in the South to act as perfect ladies. This is especially hard for Scout who prefers to be a tomboy.  <br />Finally, the book takes a look at how cruel society can be and how easily we can dehumanize another person.  Boo Radley, an important character in this novel is viewed as an outcast in Maycomb.  The children of the town are both frightened and intrigued by this man. In their minds, they assume him to be a monster. However, Scout learns otherwise when she finally sees him for who he is. <BR>  <BR>To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic.  Although racial relationships are somewhat better today, Lee does an excellent job of describing the hardships of staying true to beliefs while trying to grow up at the same time.
0060974176|4.0|This is the first book that I planned to read as a part of learning about lean, the other two books are &quot;Lean thinking&quot; and &quot;Becoming Lean&quot; , so far I could say that the \\"Machine that Changed the World\\" is a good benchmarking between craft, mass and lean producers. It mainly gives you an insight of the differences between lean and mass producers from the production, sales, marketing, customer relation and other dimensions. If you don't know about lean I really recommend you to start by reading his book because it will make you start to think in a lean way, if you know about lean and convinced about what it can do to you organization start with lean thinking and then go to &quot;Becoming Lean&quot;.<BR>This book is aimed at strategic level and as a key tool to convince old timers about the lean-mentality against the push-mentality.
0887307280|3.0|I haven't try any of these techniques because I'm totally broke, so I can't tell you that it's REALLY good.  But I do give it three stars because it provided some interesting insight I have never thought about like the difference between commodity and product or how colors and shapes influence sales.  But there was a suggestion about touching your costumers to increase sales.  Do I smell sexual-harassment lawsuits?<br />This book bascially has three messages.  1) You must be balanced: 33% Entrepeneur, 33% Manager, 33% Technician (Most people are primarily Technicians and there lies the fault) 2) You must have an impeccable business model worthy of being franchised.  This model focuses on the business as being the product, not what you are selling.  The author provides a plan to create such a model.  3) Always lift the curtain!  (The curtain being your comfort zone)<br />I gave it only three stars because it was longer than it should be.  There is this ridiculous example given throughout the book with some lady starting a pie business.  And then a mini-autobiography of the author (glorifying himself to some extent) halfway in the book.  To top it off, a really cheesy letter written to the pie lady took up one entire chapter! (Telling her to lift her curtain!)  The letter is scary to say the least.  Absurdly long-winded...such a letter written by a person who is sad and pathetic...a letter if sent over email would have the recepient pressing her delete button several times over.  The author is confused with the genre of book he wants to write.  This belongs in the entrepeneurship/self-help/fiction/spiritual genre if there's such a thing.
B00005176F|5.0|Here Blur have compiled an excellent Best of from lots of mediocre albums. They have handpicked the best tracks from their 6 albums and it is a surprisingly good CD worth owning.<br />Here we have the classic grunge-pop of 'Song 2', the ultimate indie-rock of 'Beetlebum', the fantastic gospel ballads 'The Universal' and 'Tender', the down-trodden, beautiful, lo-fi 'No Distance Left To Run', and the soaring 'She's So High' and 'This Is A Low', the latter being their best song ever.<br />Even slightly silly tracks like the funky 'Girls And Boys' complete with great bass and the overly cockney Britpop of 'Country House' and 'Parklife' sound pretty good when taken away from their respective albums and put in a more mature compilation. The cockney act isn't bearable across a whole album, but fun when only representing two or three tracks.<br />I don't like Blur, I don't like Damon Albarn. I love this compilation. Must be a canny choice of tracks. Now, if only they can make a regular album of entirely quality...
B00005RHGK|1.0|I should have known better!  Rarely can you hire a movie that has skipped the cinema and gone straight to DVD which is actually good.  Sometimes it happens, but certainly not in the case of JEEPERS CREEPERS.  The beginning is promising but the constant bickering between the brother and sister just got annoying.  Justin Long's (the brother) aggression was very over the top too. Let's face it, the acting all over this film was appalling.  The main problem with the film is the villain.  The film loses total credibility when you see what he is - a bat-like figure with wings who hungers for human flesh, that tries to dress like a man. I mean, come on! I scanned through some scenes later on, so the film would finish more quickly.  The best thing about the movie is that the brother gets knocked off in the end - he deserved it, for bickering with his sister so much!
B00006LLLN|5.0|There is not much to say about this Cd, it's perfect.If you like alison krauss you'll love this record. AK shows why she's a record grammy winner with every track and makes you feel like you're sitting right there.<BR>The best AKUS album to data. Buy it!
B00004R99K|1.0|I watched this as a child but didn't recall the part where the little cute baby oysters come out of the sea with the walrus and the carpenter.  They are really cute, and you think they will learn a lesson but be all right when they don't listen to their mother, but the big walrus guy eats them.  When my little boy figured this out, his face just dropped.  Before that he liked it because of the really cute baby oysters.  This is NOT for little little ones.  He's 4.  The mad hatter has this tongue problem that his tongue is always hanging out of his mouth.  Combine that with the obnoxious worm that keeps breathing smoke in Alice's face saying who are you very annoyingly and I was thoroughly irritated.  Keep in mind, this is only my OPINION, but I wanted to take it back to the store and get my money back.  Be sure you rent and watch anything from childhood before buying.  Your memory of it is a child's.  Mine had quite a few years  in between.  I hope this was helpful.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Fans have been waiting for a live album from Alison Krauss & Union Station for quite a while, and finally it's here. This is a dynamic set, covering their career very well, not leaving out any specific era of their career. This album proves why this group has longevity in bluegrass music, they are consistent and always making good music. Alison has a beautiful voice that trandescends with the beautiful instrumentation provided by herself and Union Station. The album was recorded live from the Louisville Palace in Louisville, KY. One of my favorites is the inclusion of the Dolly Parton cover \\"But You Know I Love You\\", which they give their own flair and magic to. Watch out for \\"The Lucky One\\", another endearing powerful performance. They also dig into classics of theirs including their rendition of Keith Whitley's \\"When You Say Nothing At All\\", \\"Baby Now That I've Found You\\", \\"Oh, Atlanta\\", \\"Every Time You Say Goodbye\\" and more. A large percentage of the material naturally comes from their NEW FAVORITE album, highlights from that set here include \\"Let Me Touch You For A While\\", \\"The Lucky One\\", \\"New Favorite\\", \\"The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn\\", \\"Take Me For Longing\\" and more. I also like they included material from Alison's 1999 album FORGET ABOUT IT, including the title track, \\"Ghost In This House\\", \\"Stay\\", and \\"Maybe\\". What you get here is 25 live tracks, from a dynamic group who I am sure we have not seen the last of! Highly enjoyable, highly reccomended.
B00005JKCH|2.0|I missed it when it was at the cinemas, and many people said it was worth seeing. So, we hired the DVD the other night expecting to be dazzled.  The film is so 'formula Hollywood' it's not funny! And to top it off, full of digital effects.  It's not the worst film to come out this year, but far from the best.  The only reason it has done so well is because it's a childrens film.  Kirsten Dunst is miscast in this film, by the way.
B00005NC66|3.0|The film is beautifully restored. But the commentary by an American 'film expert' is unbelievably annoying - the man clearly has a turnip for a brain, and spouts endless slack-jawed drivel about how the film is just a harmless piece of jolly French fun with nothing profound in it. Give me a break.
B00006LHYC|4.0|The first English release by this huge European star is a pleasant listen!  It is mellow and filled with gorgeous smooth vocals reminiscent of Lara Fabian.......great lyrics.....just an overall great pop album...not much left to say=)  Enjoy!
B00000I5Y6|4.0|I bought this CD last Easter and I still listen to it all the time. It is a great album and has all of their hits as well as alot of prime album material. You'll know them for &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot;, &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Point Of Know Return&quot; but pretty much everything else is album material... Not that that's bad or anthing. Give It a spin. I'm sure you'll like it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When I first heard Dirrty, I thought Christina had done what Justin did and took a completely R&B Hip Hop approach to this album, when I sampled it on her website, I was so thrilled to realize that she hasn't made that mistake.  This album is amazing, and vocally better than any of her other work.  The only downfall for me is there aren't more dancy/punk tracks on the album, there are a lot of ballads, they are great ballads too, but the R&B infectious opener Can't Hold Us Down is a good start to this album.  The main highlights of this album for me include Can't Hold Us Down-featuring Lil Kim, the four tracks Linda Perry produced:  Beautiful-(the second single off the album), Make Over-(a punk influenced rock track), Cruz-(an uplifting ballad), I'm OK-(a track that talks about her father, deeply personal), Fighter-(featuring Dave Navarro on guitar), and of course Dirrty.  This is a good album and will keep Christina near the top...
0767802470|4.0|No doubt! \\"Das Boot\\" is definitive the best Anti-war film ever made.<BR>The only disappointment is the length. (That's why I only can give it 4 stars)<BR>I watched the DVD and I must say, I could feel the cuts. The DVD concentrates too much on the action-parts and the english dubbing really doesn't bring it.<BR>I don't say the DVD is bad! There's only a lot of story missing.<BR>For those who don't know; there are 3 different versions:<BR>1. The original film made for TV (in 6 Parts) with a total time of over 6 hours.<BR>2. The 120 minute cinema-version<BR>3. The Director's Cut with around 180 minutes.<BR>If you have the chance to get your hands on the 6 hours version, get it instead! Watch it in german (with subtitle if you really have to). It has a lot more \\"Depth\\" than the \\"Director's Cut\\".

B000002UDB|5.0|The Fab Four never intended for this to be an album, but luckily they did. We would have never had &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; or anything!... A True Classic. You must own this release! If you want nothing but the Beatles' hits then you should get either &quot;1962-1966&quot; or &quot;1967-1970&quot; both of which are superb.
B00006690G|5.0|Ok after listening to his first two albumns I didnot really enjoy his music minus a few songs however when I first listened to \\"The Eminem Show\\" I must say I was presently suprised that he changed his style a little bit from the catchy radio friendly songs to the more harder, emotional style that the Eminem Show has.  My fav's on the albumn are \\"Superman\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Say What You Say\\" & \\"Till I Collapse\\".  Two songs on the albumn that I really didn't enjoy at first but see my self coming back to time after time now are \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" in which the third verse of that song is one of Em's best verses ever and the song taken from the Aerosmith classic Dream On, \\"Sing For The Moment\\".  This albumn is tight all the way through however and you don't need to skip any tracks when you play this.  Definetly a classic albumn and I believe the Albumn of the year.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Great American music sung by a once in a millenium voice.  You couldn't ask for much more.  Sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday.  Especially enjoy hearing with more clarity, the Jordanaires (reminds me of Elvis telling the Jordanaires after a recording session: &quot;Fellas, I really believe, if there hadn't been a you, there wouldn't be a me&quot;).<BR>Elvis you might be gone, but you have definitely not left the building called America (or the world, for that matter).  Pop in this CD, sit back, and enjoy.<BR>You definitely won't be dissapointed.
B000002UJQ|5.0|well you know it must be good if so many people are writing reviews just to put its rating back up 1/2 star to 5

0688172377|4.0|I don't think it matters that this book is not &quot;world-class&quot; literature.  Waris Dirie has a wonderful story, full of hardship, striving, and pain. But due to her continual striving, she has made a success of her life, in spite of the odds. <BR>Her experiences meant something to me. One of the most vivid was the description of her circumcision in the bush. This is an inspiring book, showing what can be accomplished with fortitude and a positive attitude.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is for all the people that don't quite understand what the hype is about Radiohead and why I think they are great. The music is about lots of things and of course it will mean different things to different people and with that said this is what I get from them. Isolation, sick/affraid of technology (more apparent on latter albums) and all with unbelievable singing with great instruments playing along.<br />So if you want to listen to something that doesn't take a brain to enjoy than by all means watch MTV and listen to the radio. Radiohead has something that most people will never get; they have talent. All that is needed is an open mind and repeated listenings. Peace and enjoy.
0385503954|5.0|I came to Ian McEwan's novel because of reviews I had read.  I had read several of his earlier works and these reviewers stressed how much Atonement was a departure from the earlier materials. That grabbed my attention.  This is a simply wonderful novel that owned me from the opening sequence to its quite incredible conclusion.  These are people whose lives I became wrapped up in, page after page, section after section.  I read it in 30 minute spurts every morning for several weeks and felt as if I were entering the world of early World War ll England and France in a way that I did not believe was possible.  The middle section with the engrossing section on the collapse of France at the beginning of the War is simply stunning.  I then went on to read Amsterdam, the winner of the Booker Prize and the novel written before Atonement.  In a way I am glad that I approached them in that order.  Atonement is, to my mind, the superior book. Amsterdam is literate and very flashy. It moves at a much faster pace than does Atonement.  But to give the Booker prize to it is not much different than giving John Steinbeck the Pulitzer for Winter of Our Discontent.  Read Atonement first and view Amsterdam as a very filling after-dinner mint.
0792106989|5.0|This movie has all the ingredients of a great Western; John Ford Directing, John Wayne and Jimmie Stewart acting, and an excellent story line.  The first time I saw this movie I was impressed but it wasn't until I saw it again years later that I truly began to appreciate the greatness of this movie.  The initial attention is drawn to the irony of misguided credit for the film's title; the man who shot Liberty Valance.  However, repeated viewing gives the audience an appreciation of just how artisticly this story is developed.  A mistake of history credits the wrong man with the killing of a ruthless outlaw who terrorizes the otherwise peaceful community of Shinbone.  The lives of two men go in opposite directions as a result of this mistake.  The movie benefits from excellent casting as well as direction.  The first excellent development was the casting of Wayne as Tom Donophan who portays the hero who drifts into obscurity.  Wayne's powerful on-screen character shows a character whose fall is that much greater from the loftiness the Duke brings to the role.  Conversely, Stewart's character, Ransom Stoddard, is a sort of Casper Milquetoast with a law degree whose ascendance is that much more unlikely.  Lee Marvin is an excellent villain and Ford completes the casting with his usual complement of talented role players.  The subtle imagery that permeate this picture makes subsequent viewing nearly as enjoyable as the initial one.  Ford leaves us with an appreciation that greatness is not what it seems.  After I came to appreciate the fullness of the director's message, I have not been to a funeral of an elderly person without thinking over the characters in this film.  How will we be perceived when we're gone?  What incidents in our lives altered how we are perceived?  All of us possess some elements of Ransom Stoddard AND Tom Donophon in our lives but it is left to those who tell our story to determine how much of each the public perceives.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I am Nirvana fan but I dont own any of there CD's so when I heard that Nirvana was Releasing a Greatest Hits. I decided what he hell and bought it. Need to say I wasnt disappointed. This album is Nirvana at there best. I like this album and to anyone new to Nirvana. This album shows the begining of the rock area of the 90's. This is album. is definitely one of the best Rock albums in a long time. But dont pass this album up. If you are new to Nirvana buy this is your long time fan then buy this. the only disappointing thing is that there are not gonna be anymore new songs.But I think this a great Tribute album (even though its not) and just a great album.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bow down to this Goddess. All should worship her for she deserves it. Buy all of her Music and thank her for the opportunity to hear her voice.
B00006C79E|5.0|I chimed in with my thoughts on \\"Sound of Water\\" so I obligated to review \\"Finisterre.\\" It's a definite return to the form of \\"Tiger Bay\\" and \\"So Tough.\\" (I may be alone in thinking a return to form wasn't completely necessary, because I enjoyed the chill-out direction they were headed with \\"Sound of Water.\\" Another album or two like that and they would have crossed paths with one of my other favorite bands, Alpha.) <br />\\"Finisterre\\" pulls together everything good about the past few albums, with a healthy dose of electro thrown in. The electro is no surprise considering the band's penchant for remixes. Every electro DJ in my town had been spinning the Two Lone Swordsmen mix of \\"Heart Failed\\" since the first club nights crept up. But like Dot Allison's latest album, the out-right electro exercises here pale in comparison to more traditional material. \\"Amateur\\" and \\"B92\\" are almost throw-away tracks, but they are reminders that this is the St. Etienne of 2002 and not of 1992 (especially with \\"B92\\"'s refrain of \\"The boys are back in town/and Nothing can stop us now\\"). In \\"New Thing,\\" though, the electro sound combines with classic St. E style to make a great club number. Some of the other tracks have more of a traditional deep house thump like \\"Hug My Soul.\\" Those include the single \\"Action\\" (if you put them on a parallel line with New Order this is their \\"Regret\\"; the same sentiment and mood are echoed here), the superbly blissful \\"Shower Scene,\\" and \\"How We Live Now,\\" which builds for three euphoric minutes before Sarah ever hits the mic. <br />The disc has just as many great moments that don't shout out to club culture. The instrumental \\"Language Lab\\" has a \\"Hill Street Connection\\"/\\"Misadventures of Margaret\\" feel to it. \\"Stop and Think It Over\\" echoes \\"Misadventures\\" as well as the slower numbers on \\"So Tough,\\" with Sarah delivering one of her best vocals yet. \\"Summerisle\\" is the closest they come to the moody textures of \\"Sound of Water.\\" (Does anyone know who the other vocalist on this cut is?) \\"The More You Know\\" does indeed sound a bit like Broadcast, but that's not a bad thing at all. Two other tracks feature guest vocalists speaking the verses with Sarah singing the choruses. \\"Soft Like Me\\" is painfully catchy but on this album it's one of the weaker tracks. You can't help but think that Sarah could have done something better with the verses. The title track, however, uses the same formula to much better effect. Sadly it stops before even hitting four minutes, despite having the feel of an epic along the lines of \\"Cool Kids of Death.\\" <br />Hopefully a new b-sides collection like \\"Interlude\\" or \\"Mess of Help\\" will be along before they close the book on \\"Finisterre.\\" \\"Andersen Unbound\\" and \\"7 Summers\\" off the \\"Action\\" single mix the experimentalism of \\"Sound of Water\\" with the more '60s-influenced songwriting of \\"Good Humor.\\" \\"Andersen\\" in the least would have made a great addition the the album. <br />They haven't disappointed me yet, and at this rate I doubt they ever will.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I fell in love with her hit \\"Don't Know Why\\" and had to hear more. Nora is definitely a throwback to the old jazz/blues style and is a breath of fresh of fresh air in the age of marketed music.  Simple, smooth, and stylish - anyone who appreciates the cool jazzy sound will absolutely enjoy Nora.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|At the end of the classic tale, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", amidst the whirlwind twister damage and broken beams, the Tinman, The Lion and The Scarecrow stand over Dorothy's bed gazing down at their Princess. Is she alive? Is she happy? Will she take that silly dog and run away again? <br />Yet Dorothy looks up through glazed eyes and a bruised head but only one thing matters..\\"There's no place like home\\". <br />\\"There's no place like home\\". <br />Shrek is Homecoming, a revisitation and feel-good head-to-toe warmth generated from all the twisted yet poignant fairy tales you believed in as a child. Like \\"Oz\\", it is a formula fairy tale. There is your Beast, your Beauty, your Wicked King and Bumbling Sidekick. The Girl has a dream. Girl realizes a dream. But perhaps the dream isn't quite all it's swamped up to be. Or is it? <br />Our Hero is a mighty green ogre with a Bad Attitude, some incredibly gross habits (and what child doesn't love gross?) and an intensive need for a good gum scraping and tooth whitener. Mike Myers of Austin Powers fame seems to succeed with rotten teeth better than most actors with a million-dollar smile. As big and Bad to the Bone that Shrek is, he is also an \\"onion\\": many layers of a Good Man are buried and swaddled deep within the Beast. <br />Our Faithful Sidekick is an As*, but you gotta love him. <BR>Eddie Murphy is the Donkey, a babbling but good-hearted Mule who attaches himself to Shrek's side and doesn't understand the meaning of Personal Space. Stealing the show with some incredibly funny lines, he also becomes the unlikely Object of Affection for a certain fire-breathing mammal, an interesting and delightful twist of events that the parents will certainly enjoy and understand more than the children. <br />We have a King, of course, named Farqaat, played by John Lithgow. The movie's premise begins with Farqaat evicting all of the Fairy Tale characters from Dulac who are less than perfect. Perfection in his eyes, of course, is quite a twisted matter, as Farqaat stands about 4'2 but compensates for his height symbolically by erecting the hugest castle in Dulac. <br />The displaced fairy tale creatures are dumped into Shrek's swamp, and being the quiet and introverted Ogre that he is, he simply cannot condone the company. Watching the Three Blind Mice battling on his slab of a table, he claws at his face and demands to know who is responsible for his Gated Community being occupied by trashy renters. <br />Visiting Fargaat, Shrek and Donkey are commanded by Farqaat to rescue the Princess and bring her to the King. His motive? True Love? Hardly. Farqaat is a diminutive little man with a diminutive little heart who merely needs a Vehicle to ensure his Kingship. <br />High Maintenance Ho Ho Ho's <br />Cameron Diaz is the Princess, encased in her lonely tower far from the center of the Disney parody town of Dulac. <BR>This Princess has been sitting around that little empty chamber quite long enough, thank you. She's got her bags packed, her flight tickets checked and she's ready to go. She's empowered. She's determined. She's run this scenario through her head a thousand times and damn it if this guy thinks he's going to ruin it. <BR>As many Princesses do, she needs to feel the kiss of One True Love, but she also employs some rather Matrix-like talents to prove that she can kick butt. She does it all without messing up her hairdo as well. She is motivated by a secret goal that drives and empowers her. <BR>Inevitably, what she needs and what she gets become two entirely different things. In terms of For Better or For Worse, she gets both...yet no fairy tale story could have had a better ending. <br />Dreamworks Katzenberg, former Disney Executive, ousted like a Big Green Ogre gets his sweet Revenge with every slap at the Disney icons he can muster. We cheer, we roar-we want More! Dreamworks has created a significantly wonderful parody tale with tremendous graphics and a script that will keep you laughing fromminute one to end. Some of the lines go right over the children's heads but straight to your brains, and every adult appreciates when these tasty morsels are tossed at us. Shrek is a non-stop flight from Oz's Yellow Brick Road right to the center of your heart.
1572522089|3.0|tedious and rather academic.  The battle scenes are the stand out in this beautiful but flawed film.  It's said that Kurosawa worked on this film for 10 years.  Maybe he tried too hard!  Perhaps that is why it is over blown and tired at the same time.  Lacking the rich characterizations and humanism of Kurosawa's earlier works it entertains but in the end leaves you cold.  It could have used a big dose of Toshiro Mifune!
0446530573|5.0|On a whim I scooped this one up today off the 'new' books stacks at work. I love watching the Sopranos, which if you haven't heard, is a very strange look at modern America through the eyes of a mobster family. And like most families, one of the topics here is Food. <br />Specifically, southern Italian, heavy on the cheese, pasta and tomato sauce variety. That's ok, this is food that sooths, and brings back happy memories. Or, in the case of the Sopranos, some not too happy memories. <br />Told as a journey down memory lane by the character of Artie Bucco himself, the owner and principal chef at the Nuovo Vesuvio, we get various interviews from various characters from the series. From AJ's three pop tarts and a Coke breakfast, to Meadow's self-absorbed fears of getting fat, Carmela's tips on having a party, to Adriana's guide to a sexy night out, it's giggle from start to finish. The men wiegh in as well, with Junior's memories of life with Tony's dad, a screamingly funny bit from sister Janice to Tony's rules for grilling. (Lighter fluid is for sissies) And of course, Furio's take on American cuisine. Even Dr. Melfi joins the fun with a paper on the eating habits and styles of Italian-Americans. <br />So, besides the in-jokes for followers of the series, there's also plenty of family style recipes. Some are pretty basic, from 'Sunday Gravy' -- a very rich meat and tomato sauce, to a cholestrol heavy Baked Ziti with meatballs, various zuppe or soups, and plenty of hearty meals. Photographs in lush, mouthwatering detail accompany most of the recipes -- the one of the standing rib roast made me drool, and I'm going to try very hard not to enthuse about the cannoli shot. Most of the recipes are fairly basic, relying on fresh ingredients and simple techniques, and a minimum of fancy equipment that you need beside cannoli shapers and a pasta machine. <br />Trust me, homemade pasta is still the best. What I really like is the author, Alan Ruddick, took the time with thisone to stay true to each character as they are in the series, slang and attitude and all ? it's a giggle from start to finish, and some of the photographs are screamingly funny ? especially the one of Tony and the barbeque. <br />(and for fans, the endpapers of this oversize book is a hoot -- nothing less than Livia trying to burn down her kitchen...)
0790729628|5.0|With \\"Blade Runner,\\" Ridley Scott has given film lovers a stunning  film that appeals as much today as it did when first released. From beginning to end, his attention to detail in lighting, set design, blocking...*everything*...is breathtaking. Even twenty years later, \\"Blade Runner\\" does not appear dated or low-tech; Syd Mead & Jordan Cronenweth out-did everyone else of the period.<br />The story takes place in 2019, in the city of Los Angeles. Humans have invented robots (called \\"replicants\\") to serve as slaves, especially in off-world colonies. The latest version of the replicants, though, is so close to human (\\"More Human Than Human\\" is manufacturer's motto) that they begin to develop their own emotional responses. This leads to trouble, as they have fully-formed, adult bodies, but the emotional experience of children (which the actors who play the replicants do a fantastic job of portraying through facial expressions and body posture.)  Because their anger can often lead to violence, replicants have been banned on Earth. Should any turn up, special units of the police called \\"Blade Runners\\" are dispatched to \\"retire\\" the replicants (killing them was not called \\"murder\\" or even \\"termination,\\" since they are viewed as sub-human.)<br />Deckard (Harrison Ford) is the main character, and we experience the story mostly from his perspective. He is a retired Blade Runner quietly going about his life, when he's suddenly yanked back into the business by his old boss (M. Emmet Walsh,) who tells him he desperately requires Deckard's help. Six replicants hijacked a ship off-world and have found their way to Los Angeles, where Tyrell Corporation, their manufacturer, is located. They are seeking their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell, for answers and little will deter them.<br />As the story unfolds, we learn more about the replicants Deckard must track down and retire, and it is to be hoped that we develop some empathy for them. To add another layer to the story, Rachel, Deckard'slove interest, comes with a full package of complex issues that force Deckard into a bit of a dilemma as he pursues his quarry. <br />This is not a fluffy, happy movie; it is filled with dark, dripping scenes of haunting beauty (highlighted by the Vangelis soundtrack,) and a moral that is not beaten into viewers with a large, heavy-handed hammer. One of the scenes near the end has Rutger Hauer speaking a monologue that remains one of my favorites, because it speaks to a deep, central part of me that selfishly grieves because when I die, all of my memories will die with me - no one else will see things the way I have. I connect with Roy on a very intimate level at that moment, and I feel most other viewers will, too.<br />The cast is out*standing*: Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, Joanna Cassidy, William Sanderson, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, Joe Turkel, James Hong...holy smokes! Each actor perfectly portrays his or her character with absolute believability, right down to small tics and expressions, and their chemistry is fabulous.<br />This version of the film leaves out Deckard's narrative, adds a few moments of footage to more clearly establish an implication regarding Deckard's humanity, and removes other footage to clean things up a bit. The loss of the narrative removes a lot of the 40's gumshoe, film noir aspects of the movie, but it doesn't make the movie difficult to understand at all; the film very clearly stands on its own without it.<br />However, the narrative in the original verison adds a lot of charm to the film, and gives us a clearer understanding of Deckard; I really enjoy that version as well. The film is much more elegant without it, though, allowing viewers to pay more attention to the gorgeous scenery and background sounds, instead of listening to what Deckard is saying, and missing some of the details.<br />I can't say that I prefer one version to the other, as they both  have so much to recommend them. I couldn't even argue which version a person \\"should\\" see first; each will color the viewer's experience of whichever film is seen second.<br />\\"Blade Runner\\" in either form continues to blow me away, even though I have seen it dozens of times. It is always in my list of of top five favorite films, and I very much recommend both versions to anyone who enjoys science fiction, detective movies, or generally excellent film. Sit back, relax, and allow the sheer beauty to sweep you away into a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
B000002J09|1.0|...Anyway I've always found this album to be an album of extremes. It can be extremely boring sometimes and it can also be extremely annoying. You can't honestly like Robert Plants voice! Nobody can master the ... whine like he can. Listen to him sing \\"It's just a spring clean for the May Queen\\" or \\"you're head is humming\\" Hoo boy.....not good.<br />...
B000067DNC|5.0|This is perhaps one of the most original series in science fiction history, and in its second season setups the events that drive this show for the next 2 seasons. I have a theory that most shows have their best or one of their best seasons their second season. Usually because they have already given a full season to introduce the characters to the public, and can expand them without undermining the basic characters. Such events take place when Sam becomes the Host of Jolinar, Daniel gets addicted to the sarcofagues, we see Col. O'Neill's dark side of rage and anger when Aphopis attempts to get help from the Tauri, and Teal'c dealing with issues of a long-distance father. We meet the To'kra, Asgard, the Ancients, and NID's efforts to steal alien technology for the first time.
0345448898|3.0|Pullman's fantasy trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" is an entertaining, original work which is worth reading.  However, it appears that all the marketing stops have pulled out in order to make this work a manufactured classic.  Comparisons to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" etc. have been trotted out, and a fancy trade three-volume set is available for the Christmas market.  <br />Enough already!  These books are well-written and fun; worth the price of admission.  Classics, however, they are not.  Time may prove me wrong, but I don't think publishers can manufacture greatness (pace boy bands).  To readers: buy them and enjoy them.  To the publishers: settle down!<br />Casey Coleman, Ed.D.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I grew up during WW II and also with the war movies of the era. These films were so unrealistic as to be comical, and even disrespectful of the soldiers who fought this war. Band of Brothers is a moving, eyes open, unsentimental portrayal of what it was like to live through the trauma of battle. These men had to get up each day and do the inconceivable. Superbly acted, filmed, and directed this series can only make someone who has never experienced combat thankful for their good fortune, and also eternally grateful to those who gave up their youth, and lives, to keep America free. Never forget them. These men are real, and they are heros.
0316666343|4.0|One fateful day in December, Susie Salmon is walking home from school when she is trapped by her supposedly mild mannered neighbor, Mr. Harvey. Mr Harvey wanted to do more than show her something in the cornfield, however. He was going to rape and murder her, and that he did. Susie saw her entrance into heaven, and watched her family grieve.<br />Her sister Lindsey sannot accept Susie's death,and Buckley, her four year old brother cannot understand why Susie never comes home. Susie's mother and dad are thrown into serious emotional upheavels, and their marriage begins to seriously crumble. Susie's mom moves away for awhile. <br />Susie's Dad JUST KNOWS MR. Harvey did this to his daughter, but he is having a very hard time convincing the police of this. It isn't until much later that the police are really on to this man who seems as though he's innocent.<br />Susie is watching from heaven, and seeing her family fall to pieces over her murder. She is trying to reach out to her loved ones on earth, and be a guide from above.<br />I enjoyed the book. It was something very different to read. But I'm sure it is a too realistic view of what heaven is really like.
B000002AQQ|4.0|this movie was awsome.   probably my favorite of all time.   the soundtrack is almost as good.   i was a little disapointed in the soundtrack though becasue it is missing a few very good songs that were in the movie.   all long the watch tower by jimmy hendrix and freebird from lynard skynard.   freebird is my favorite song so im mostly disapointed with this compilation becasue it isnt on it.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|If this was a regular album, it'd probably get three stars, but its a soundtrack which are generally quite bad so it got bumped up a notch.  Em contributes 3 tracks, all three are mediocre after about the 5th time listening to it, and Rakim's cut is pretty weak.  Gangstarr and Jayz shine on their tracks while Nas's song is quite bad.  And, contrary to the Amazon[.com] editor's review, the song was not directed towards JayZ, but probably towards Cormega.  The R&B songs pretty much ... as much as Xzibits song.  Where the album shines is the 50 Cent/D12 tracks. In total, there are about 6 or so quality songs on the album which is better than most albums coming out these days.
B000021YQV|5.0|SOAD are definitley in the category of best metal bands. Not only do they ROCK they also have intelligent lyrics to accompany it. To imagine SOAD take Rage Against the Machine and make them harder and faster like thrash metal almost. This is a highly reccomended CD!..

B00001QEE2|5.0|If you are looking for a retelling of the myth of Hercules, then you will hate this movie. Disney completely ruined it. But what disney did do was create gorgeous animation, a pretty decent soundtrack and an adorable story with a strong female character. The artwork throughout the story keeps in line with the greek style of artwork from the shape of the trees to the style of dress and hair on their pottery. So watch this movie for it's entertainment value, and not for a faithful retelling of a complicated greek myth. Take it with a grain of salt and you will be okay.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This is a great album that does justice to the best Buffy episode to date.<br />The songs were written by Joss Whedon and so reflect the characters perfectly.  Though not all the cast have the best voices, they all work well with the songs chosen for them.  &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; allows Amber Benson to sing sweetly about love, &quot;Standing&quot; shows off ASH's golden pipes, and the &quot;Under Your Spell/Standing&quot; reprise is a duet that perfectly blends Amber and ASH's voices.  And &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot; is a marvelous blend of the entire ensemble.<br />The last track is the demo version of &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; with Kai; Joss's wife; singing the part of Buffy and Joss playing piano and singing Spike's part.  Not awesome, but pretty darned good for a demo.<br />There is also two suites; from &quot;Restless&quot; and &quot;Hush&quot;; by Christophe Beck which just rock and music from &quot;The Gift&quot; which is fabulous.<br />This is a must have for any Buffy fan!
0385484518|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel.  I have a very short attention span, hence the fact that this is the first book that I have completed ince high school.  This book is very important for me, as I learned a lot about life from a dying man.  How else can you get into contact with that sort of teaching?  You'll rarely find that level of honesty.  The most memorable thing Morrie told Mitch: \\"WHen you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\"
B00006LLLN|5.0|This live CD by Alison Krauss, Day Tyminiski, Jerry Douglas, Ron Block, Barry Bales and Larry Atamanuik is the best by far of any acoustic music cd on the shelves or in Amazon's warehouses today. These are 25 super songs performed in a great arena with Bernie Velutti's competent hands on the sound system.  You can hear the crowd, banter among the band members, a Dixie yell now and then; feels like you are there.  Here the fiddle, guitars, dobro, banjo acoustic bass, and drums (selected numbers) give constant back playing to Alison's exquisite voice, Dan's rolicking singing, and Ron's spiritual tones. There is no hesitation in this band. Each piece is done with authority. Moods range from the supremely melancholy new tune BUT YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU to the lively BRIGHT SUNNY SOUTH.  Alison's classics, Baby, Every Time, Cluck Old Hen, Broadway, Ghost, When You Say Nothing, and There Is A Reason are presented with perfection.  Jerry Douglas gives listeners a ride on the CHOCTAW HAYRIDE that will brighten the dreariest winter day. You give this cd, you'll be remembered.  Personal note: Over the years there are a few songs I can remember where I was when I first heard them.  One is Bobby Gentry's ODE TO BILLY JOE. Another is Alison Krauss singing STEEL RAILS (Not on cd).

B000002AGN|4.0|What a clever chap Mr Dave was.  Visiting Turkey, he heard some of the locals improvising in odd tempos.  The odd tempos came back to him when he was in the studio and all it took was a wink at Paul Desmond, the equal driest sax tone in medical history.  It is interesting that the CD is dedicated to the memory of Mustapha Kemal Attaturk, the father of modern Turkey.  Attaturk banned the wearing of the fez, so leave yours at the door when listening to this wonderful CD.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Ahhh...Harry Potter. This film successfully manages to bring the magic of J.K. Rowling's characters to life.<br />\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the first installment of Rowling's planned seven-book series about a young orphan, Harry Potter, who wakes up on his eleventh birthday only to be told that he is a wizard and has the chance to leave his muggle (non-magic) aunt and uncle to attend the greatest school of all time: Hogwarts.<br />While at school, Harry meets many unforgettable characters who are beautifully portrayed in this film. There is Harry's best friend, red-head Ron Weasley, the fifth child of a poor family who loves, among other things, wizard chess. There is the over-confident Hermoine Granger, who enjoys reading, studying, and being right. There is Harry's nemesis, the evil (and brilliatly casted) Draco Malfoy, starved for power and from a family that is, well, loaded with money. There is the gentle Rufus Hagrid, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts, who wants nothing more than a pet dragon. And there is the beloved headmaster, Prof. Albus Dumbledore (played by the late Richard Harris), a man who is both wise and gentle.<br />Both the books and the movie have come under heavy scrutiny for being about witchcraft. They are. They are also about the struggles of good battling evil and Harry's triumphs and let-downs as he struggles to discover himself and his expectations as a young boy thrown into a world he completely doesn't understand. This isn't evil, it's a magical adventure, much like Peter Pan.<br />Another comment from many fans of the Potter series is that they don't want to see the movies for fear of destroying their views as to what the books are 'really like'. The first time I saw this film, my good friend, who absolutely loves Harry, kept exclaiming, 'This is just how I pictured it!' Many fans have walked away with similar responses, and I have yet to find another movie that follows the book so closely.<BR> <BR>The adventures of young Harry at Hogwarts (and even getting there) are magical masterpieces. From his first chance standing on the platform 9 3/4 to his first views of the enchanted ceiling, you will feel Harry's wonder at his predicament -- and, like him, feel the magic behind it all.

B00005OM4N|1.0|If you like sugary pop, this is the CD for you. If you want to hear the growth Britney think she went through, look eles where. Nothing about her has really changed. She's still the \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\" girl. I was hoping for some growth but I guess that's all she got to offer. Just download the CD if you want it. It's a waste of money otherwise. I kinda like \\"I'm Not Yet A Girl....\\" and \\"Overprotected.\\" So, there's the star she deserves.
B000002KP3|4.0|in early days of listening to ride a white swan and hot love I became hooked on trex.then came get it on.could it get any better? for me only on par with electric warrior and then a very slow decline. yes slider was very good and tanx good, but not as good as this.he made many more lp's but never with the atmosphere of this. dandy in the underworld was his best for me after tanx.the reason why i dont give it five stars is because they should have seperated the studio work in progress to a second disc with more cuts,also the cd cover could have been a lot better like the 30 anniversary edition of david bowies ziggy.the sound quality of the transfer is only slightly better than the previouse cd version of electric warrior.i have a so called audiophile system using tube amplification and high end cd player and the differences are very subtle. the symbols seem to be more real. the other most obvious comment is that the work in progress cuts, show why Mark sounded so bad in live concerts. the songs are so well produced he would have needed a 10-15 other musicians to even come close to the real recorded sound. a bit like U2 in concert,though they dont have a problem because they use a backing tape to fill in the gaps,like kareoke.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is official my favorite CD. It's so powerful. This girl got madd vocals!!! Sorry for the cheesiness but that's the only way to describe it. I've never had a CD (and  I have ALOT) where I like every single song....then 'Stripped' came along. I expected a sugary-pop Britneyish sound, but I gotta support Christina so what the hey. Boy was I in for a surprise! This CD really does display her range. She can go from singing ballads like 'Walk Away' and 'Impossible' to the notorious 'Dirrty.' We all know she is risque and out there but when you got as much vocal range as she does...
B000006YMP|2.0|Okay. Agnetha's first album was number one in UK or whatever, but I think that this is just another Abba album ...I love the catchy song: I Can't Shake Loose (No 65 UK), Wrap Your Arms Around Me (No 45 UK), Man, and Take Good Care of Yor Children. After this album, Agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in UK. A very disapointing album, and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly (from the first recording to the release was 5 months!).
B00005MM01|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album. Preliminary warning: if you're not tuned into Donovan's world, philosophy, and mindset, this album will probably seem uninteresting, unexciting, and childish. But if you're in the mood and you *are* tuned into Donovan's cozy world of nature, friends, gypsies, hoboes, babies, love, and in general an appreciation for the small things in life, it's absolutely outstanding. The way I got tuned into this music was from a songbook of Donovan songs: after reading the lyrics and actually playing the songs myself, I developed a profound appreciation of every single song on this album. In my days of hitchhiking and riding busses into natural coastal areas, these songs would run around my head and in time I learned to play every single song here on guitar. Every single song here has some subtle but very appealing hook if you listen carefully: a cool jazzy bass intro, a beautiful acoustic guitar riff, lyrics from Shakespeare, poetic imagery of the underworld, contrary motion in the lines of a piano riff, a call to environmentalism, analogy of children with flowers, the charm of old friends far away, human qualities in starfish, rock 'n' roll chords played quietly on organ in contrary motion to a melody, an interesting flute embellishment, the contrast between the world of children and adults, several poems with beautiful beach imagery, poems of married love and the eccentric husband, the pain of faithfulness, glimpses into life on the lam, psychedelic contemplation of colors, images inside a forest, ad infinitum. Absolutely charming.  Many of these songs have strong imagery of places in Europe. For example, while staying at an inn in Germany, the innkeeper told my sister that Donovan's lyrics about the &quot;flower pot on a window sill&quot; (in &quot;Skip-A-Long Sam&quot;) were written about their inn. Similar imagery arises from lyrics about sheep, English &amp; Flemish geographical names, magpies, etc. The only song I know thatgot radio play was &quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven.&quot; The rest reside in their own special world.
B000006YMN|5.0|But it is a shame that it has been her most recent album since this although this is a decent atempt. Agnetha has recorded a new album which will be out next year in Europe, and maybe America. I love 'I Stand Alone' and 'The Last Time'. Agnetha will reign for ever!
B00006CXXU|5.0|An excellent job by the &quot;genie&quot;. Although the album structure is very reminiscent of Mariah Carey circa &quot;Rainbow&quot; it definitely has a personality all its' own. Best bets are the rocking &quot;fighter&quot;, the aptly titled &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;cruz&quot;, &quot;soar&quot; and &quot;voice within&quot;. i did find this collection kind of sybilish in that she goes from pretty &quot;dirrty&quot; to gospel-tinged without taking a breath. I like to try to get an artists' message - hers is mixed but delivered with punch, sass and on the ballads (for the most part) - sincerity.
0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning puts a delicious new spin on childrens books with a story that doesn't end 'happily ever after'.

0395645662|5.0|...P>The protagonist of the story by Lois Lowry is the eleven-years-old Jonas. He lives, at first glance, in a wonderful community protected from pain, illness, unemployment or unhappiness. Jonas is approaching his twelfth birthday, the day on which he will receive the assignment for his future life. He is chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory. His teacher, The Giver, stores all the memories generations before had given up to live in Sameness. During Jonas' training in becoming the new Receiver he learns a lot about emotions, animals or different weather conditions, things that the other community members had never known before....P>That book is absolutely a great one. While reading the book through the eyes of Jonas more and more questions were raised - some where answered, some not. You get a closer look on your own life, your life as an individual, your life in society.<br />How would life be without happiness? Or without pain? What is life living in sameness? What is a protective society? Where do we have to draw the line between creating protection and taking away the things that make us human? And what is it exactly that make us human? Lowry doesn't offer us any answer, more effective, she makes us think of our own how these questions will be answered.<br />I have really enjoyed reading the \\"The Giver\\" and I guess it was the right decision by the teacher \\"making\\" us reading it. It was worth the time it took to read and understand ...
B00006J3T4|5.0|Even though there has been a recent history of wonderful CDs from Knopfler, this is a really great one.  The disc is consistantly good, but the centerpiece is the title cut.  Ragpicker's Dream is the best new Christmas song to come along in a long time.  I think it is right behind Sultans of Swing for my favorite Knopfler song and is shatteringly beautiful.  Not to be missed.
0345448898|5.0|This is a book that works on so many levels. Though some here have said that it is a book for eleven years and older, I'd say to boost that up to thirteen or so. My reason? His Dark Materials questions the world, the existence of god, the character of good and evil, the meaning of love, the essence of childhood and growing up...deep issues that can only be appreciated by those older than elementary age. I first read this book when I was eleven myself and, though I enjoyed it, I did not fully comprehend it. I am fourteen now and, through re-reading, I have garnered the full beauty of it. All prospective readers should clear a few hours from their schedule for each book, find a comfortable chair, and read with an open mind. After reading, I recommend contemplating the questions posed instead of giving in and diving into the next book. This series deserves it. They are not fantasy books, they are philosophical works! Well, that is to say they are entertaining philosophical works.

0684833395|5.0|CATCH-22 is masterful in so many ways.  It begins as comic farce, proceeds to the increasingly surreal, and then transforms into a nightmarish tragedy before ending triumphantly.  No novel that I know so successfully blends all these disparate moods.  I believe it was Hugh Walpole who wrote, \\"Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragedy to those who feel.\\"  No book illustrates that better than this novel.  This truly is one of the funniest books I have ever read.  It is also one of the most tragic.<br /><br />CATCH-22 also introduces one of the most insane collection of great characters in fiction:  Yossarian, the Chaplain, Orr, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Milo Minderbender, Maj. Major Major Major, Nately, Doc Daneeka, Danby, General Dreedle, Nately's girl (not the description in the book, but Amazon's software will bleep it), Cathcart, Nurse Duckett, The Texan, Major ----- de Coverley, The Soldier in White, and a host of other characters.  It is one of the most gloriously populated novels of the past half century.<br /><br />This is a novel I can almost not discuss except through superlatives:  greatest war novel I have read, funniest novel I have ever read, greatest English language novel of the past 60 years.  But the best thing is that it is, on top of being a superb book, an exceedingly fun book to read.  Even at its nightmarish, this is a fun, delightful book.  And few novels contain as many unforgetable moments as this one.
B00006G8K0|4.0|After the success of Hammer's The Curse of Frankenstein in 1957, they decided to take the next logical step and remake Dracula. Released in 1958, Dracula (U.S. title The Horror of Dracula), reunited the very same cast and crew and The Curse of Frankenstein and created the formula that would carry Hammer's success throughout the 60's and 70's. Christopher Lee's portrayal of Dracula was so definitive that people pictured him in their minds when they thought of Dracula, a typecast that he was never quite able to escape. His Dracula--tall, dark, lips glossed with bright red blood--virtually revolutionized the horror film industry.<br />To update the film, Hammer used not only eye-popping Technicolor, but added the sexual element, not clearly pictured in previous versions. This was the first vampire film where the female victims actually seemed to be enjoying the process. Peter Cushing, as Van Helsing, compared vampirism to drug addiction, and Hammer furthered the theme into realms of disease and madness in later films.<br />The script, by Hammer's favorite screenwriter Jimmy Sangster, streamlined the key elements of the Bram Stoker novel, taking only a few liberties along the way. Probably the main change was Jonathon Harker, who knew the score from the start and arrived at Dracula's castle posing as a librarian, but intending to play the role of vampire slayer. This doesn't quite work out for him, and quickly swinging back into novel territory, he meets up with Dracula's three concubines.<br />Horror of Dracula is widely considered to be Hammer's best Vampire film. I'm not quite sure that I agree with this (give me Captain Kronos or Twins of Evil over this one any day...) considering that they built a whole genre starting with this film and took it in some wild and previously unheard of directions. It is Hammer's most faithful adaptation from an original work, and it's notable as the beginning of something big.<br />The DVD release has a few extras-not many and nothing I'd never seen before elsewhere. There is a notable mistake on the packaging. The woman on the back is Stephanie Beachum, in her role as Jessica Van Helsing in Hammer's Dracula: AD 1972, when they decided to bring the Count into the then \\"modern age.\\" Ooops! Maybe whoever designed the case didn't actually watch the film.<br />The release seems somewhat minimal and casual, but it's definitely worth picking up. While I'm slightly disappointed with the lack of extras, (and by the cheesy packaging blurbs and picture mistakes), I am very grateful to be able to have it on DVD!I'd never seen before elsewhere.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|All of Cash's &quot;American Recordings&quot; have been uniformally excellent, and installment #4 is no exception. Even a slightly weird cover of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; with Fiona Apple works in the context of the album as a whole. And, as usual, he takes others' songs (Depeche Mode, Sting, Trent Reznor) and makes them his own. American III is still my favorite, but a few more spins of this disc and I may have to change my mind. Any one serious about understanding American music should buy these four albums.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Ok, first, this is only five stars because this is a greatest hits.  Basically, the singles like any greatest hits album.  I'm going to tell you all exactly what this is: THIS CD IS 14 OF NIRVANA'S SONGS.  that's about it.  All those interesting tracks like &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Dive&quot; and &quot;Negative Creep&quot; are not here to my dismay.  But hey, I wasn't asked to compile it.<br />Nirvana dabblers, buy In Utero before you buy this.  In Utero is definately their best album.  Nevermind is about second best, but artistically, In Utero has more to it.<br />So, analysis holds that this is a great CD.  You get 13 old fav's of Nirvana set to modern production standards, perfect to make a mix tape.  You get &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; which is the last new song till the 25th anniversary of Nevermind.  We'll be fourty then, bummer.<br />The only thing that could make this disc better would be &quot;Dive.&quot;
0553565915|2.0|This book, despite the fact that it does have some uplifting moments, is very heavily slanted through the filter of the author's christian beliefs and as such is rendered quite suspect. Due to this, I was fairly skeptical through the book, up until I came across references to warring angels doing battle with Satan, at which point I just tossed the book aside.<br />There are other, and better, and more open and loving, books on NDEs out there; they're far more worth your time than this one.
B00005ATQE|5.0|This is definitely Kubrick's darkest film. The performances given by Vincent D'Onofrio, Matthew Modine, and R. Lee Ermy stand out and give this beautiful film it's surreal, depressing mood. But of all of them, Vincent D'Onofrio stands out the most with his heartbreaking performance as Private Leonard Pyle. As I write this review, the thing that sticks in my mind is that one scene in which Pyle shoots Drill Sergeant Hartman and then himself. <BR>   <BR>   And, of course, Kubrick's use of light, space, and camera movement make this another one of his darker films. This film would best be described as a mix of Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver, in terms of atmosphere and lighting, as well as some elements of plot. I think anyone interested in film or in war, or the Vietnam War specifically should check this out.
B0000009RX|5.0|Zappa had a varied career and recorded all styles of music.  But in the late 1960's, he was just getting started, and so of course this sounds like something recorded in that era.  But wait.  Listen to those lyrics.  Zappa was a satirist and even picked on the grand pooh-bahs, the Beatles, parodying the Sgt. Pepper's album cover and ridiculing hippies.  But Zappa also ridiculed the establishment, the cops, the schools, etc., etc., etc.  What gives?  Zappa was one of a kind, that's what gives.  And this album is classic satire.  But the songs are good, too.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow. Christina sure has changed. For the better! Chrstina speaks raw and with the truth and the result is tramendous! Here is my track by track review of STRIPPED. I rate tracks from 1-10/10.<br />1) Stripped Intro - A great start to the album. A little minute-and-a-half interlude where she apologizes for not living up to her previous \\"cookie-cutter image.\\" 9/10<br />2) Can't Hold Us Down - Excellent collaboration with Lil' Kim. When I first heard this song, I thought it was about women empowerment. And it is. But there's a deeper meaning. Someone pointed out that it sounds like she's confronting Eminem. I think they're right. 10/10<br />3) Walk Away - MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! Christina's vocals rock with musical influences like Aretha Franklin and Billie Holiday. Deep lyrics, slow blusey beat. That's enough for me. 16/10<br />4) Fighter - Okay. It's a rock song. It's has great lyrics but it doesn't really suit her all that well. Don't get me wrong. It's a good song. 8.5/10<br />5) Primer Amor Interlude - Light acoustic guitar and Christina talking in spanish. 7/10<br />6) Infatuation - Rumored to be the next single. I think it's pretty radio-friendly. Catchy chorus with an up-tempo yet gentle beat.<br />7) Loves Embrace Interlude - I don't even consider this an interlude. It's just like a prelude to the next track. It would be better if she blended the two together to make one song. 6.5/10<br />8) Loving Me 4 Me - My #2 Fave. A Very slow song about her perfect guy who loves her for her. (Hence the title) 11/10<br />9) Impossible - A collaboration with Alicia Keys. While this song doesn't do anything for me, it's good. Slower song. 8.5/10<br />10) Underappreciated - I really like this song. Probably my #4 favorite. Slower tempo but not ballad slow. Bass-filled and a great chorus. 10/10<br />11) Beautiful - A very inspirational song about loving yourself. People say this is the best song on the album, I disagree. It's good but no the best. 9/10<br />12) Make Over - Okay. I like this song. But... I don't know. It gets just a tad bit annoying. I also think this song is an excuse for using the word [...] (She repeats it in the chorus.)<br />13) Cruz - One of the two songs I strongly dislike. Frankly, a filler. 2.7/10<br />14) Soar - Excellent uplifting track about trusting yourself and going with your gut instinct. 9.5/10<br />15) Get Mine, Get Yours - *clears throat* Hmmm....This song is about...you know...bedroom activities. While more classy and mature than \\"Dirrty\\", it's lyrics are more strongly sexually loaded. (Freak my body/We'll get nasty, naughty/Sweating and rubbin/work me like a 9 to 5) 8.8/10<br />16) Dirrty - Who doesn't like this song. You've all heard it. My #3 fave. 10.5/10<br />17) Stripped Pt. 2 - Just a continuation of Stripped Intro. 9.5/10<br />18) The second song I strongly dislike. An awful slow song that I just can't get into. 4.2/10<br />19) I'm OK - A fabulous and somewhat disturbing documentation of Christina's rocky childhood. 9.4/10<br />20) Keep on Singing My Song - A great conclusion to an excellent disc. 10/10
B0000524CY|5.0|The extra footage adds to an already great movie. I saw on the big screen in 1973 and still enjoy it very much today. Not much for extras but the sound and picture quality is sweet.
0375414053|2.0|As fiction, this novel doesn't work.  The characters are absurd and one-dimensional.  Almost every page contains supposed pearls of wisdom about work and women, mothers and children, men and women.  Some of these hit the mark (the Muffia who look down on working moms is dead on as are the pangs of guilt the heroine feels because she knows she is failing her children but these are way too frequent and honest!) but most don't, and also don't belong in a novel but rather perhaps an essay about these topics.  <br />The heroine is a silly person, and in the space we see, a bad mother and wife, as well as a poor role model for working women.  By accepting her view, it becomes impossible for women to do it all or to do anything well.  She criticizes her husband for not doing as much as she does and then gets upset when he cooks elegant food.  Yikes!  <br />There is no real character development and most of the changes occur in the last chapter while we get agonizing detail about matters such as clothes changes in the rest of the book.  Guess Pearson didn't know how to end it because she got her point across -- working moms must fail -- and that was what she was concerned with.  A more helpful and interesting take on the subject would include what one can do within some of the constraints that Pearson accurately depicts: how to create personal fulfillment without sacrificing children and marriage, how to set limits at work to aid time with one's family or even work part-time for a while (heroine dismisses this out of hand), and also keep some sort of personal values rather than lionizing the accoutrements of financial success.  Good topic, bad execution and outdated ideas doom this one from page one.
B00005221L|5.0|Predator is an awesome action movie in it's purest form. Consider this: 1) A bunch of big, bad [...], military guys with even bigger guns will go into the jungle on a mission. 2) The leader of this group will be Arnold Schwarzenegger 3) In this said jungle will be an alien opponent of mythic scale just waiting for some new sport. 4) It will have an unknown director who will use optical effects never before created. Now consider the genious who green lit this project, producer Joel Silver. Silver may just be the greatest thing to happen to the action movie since James Bond leapt from Ian Fleming's page onto the screen in Sean Connery's body. The very idea of this film is preposterous, yet Silver saw something, as he must have with such films as Lethal Weapon, Die Hard (also directed by McTiernan), and The Matrix. He must have seen the potential for greatness. <br />Why is Predator so brilliant? I don't know, it just is. From the word \\"go\\" this movie is nonstop. McTiernan, just put the pieces together right. Surrounding Schwarzenegger with guys like Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, and Sonny Landham, was inspired. Also inspired: giving Ventura the gattling-gun and the line, \\"I ain't got time to bleed, or Landham's line, \\"There's something out there waiting, and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die.\\" Alan Silvestri's heart pounding score, the amazing special effects from the predator's camouflage and it's POV, and Arnold, how great is Arnold? Pretty great (he certainly has some of his best one-liners).<br />Man, this movie just rocks. It transcends it's genre, everything about it is tip-top. It is definitely one of Arnold's best roles. So what do I think? Is Predator one of the best action/sci-fi movies ever made? I think yes.
B00006F7S4|5.0|When a relationship breaks your heart, spirit and soul it can take a lifetime to heal.  Sometimes you suffer silently.  Years can go by before all mental damage in your head heals.  Other times you become the opposite of what you were in the relationship.  Mainly to change your outlook or hope that word gets back that your happier without that person.  The most powerful is when you can sit down, sort through your emotions and let it all out.  That's what Beck picked.  Having this CD makes you look at yourself really hard.  <br />How you ask?   <br />Every word on this CD has happened to you if you were in a relationship that has gone south.  Have you ever put your heart and soul in the hands of another? In time have you watched it disintegrate before your eyes?  Every ounce of emotion Beck pours into these songs (and the best songs on this CD are the ones where he shows no emotion at all).  YOU HAVE LIVED THE PAIN ON THIS CD! <br />Not many songwriters can catch this much pain on one CD.  How is going to play this live without having a nervous breakdown?  I had a hard time getting though this CD the first time due to its brutal honesty.<br />This has to be one of the best CD's, if not the top CD of the year.
B00006NSGX|3.0|One More Car is a snapshot of Clapton reinventing himself yet again. There's enough of the blues material that dominated his early career and mainstream rock stuff from his top 40 days to please both old and new fans.<br />Like Paul McCartney's Back In The USA (another excellent live album--in fact the best live album Macca's ever made bar none), Clapton's live albums usually act as a summation to date of his career. He reinvents the stronger material from Pilgrim (and album that had potential but was ruined by trite lyrics and overproduction) and even reaches into his back pocket to whip out the classic Derek and the Dominos track Bell Bottom Blues (always a fav of mine). He even picks a couple of nice tracks from Reptile and breathes new life into them.<br />There are a few drawbacks for long time fans. Eric has chosen to include a number of songs already well represented by his previous live albums. Yes, the're classics but his extensive back catalog would allow him to revive a number of great songs (Tell the Truth, Mainline Florida to name two)that haven't had as much exposure over the years. EC should take a look at McCartney's new tour. He manages to pull out a number of old crowd pleasers (Coming Up, Band on the Run, Jet, Live and Let Die)and manages to include a number of material he's never recorded for a live album before. Many of the classic Beatles numbers (and solo hits) are reinvented by the crack backing band Paul assembled. Additionally, he's played with the arrangements on some just enough to make them seem brand spanking new again.<br />This isn't Slowhand's best live album but he's in fine form throughout. He doesn't have anything to prove and that's to his advantage. As EC ages there's an almost introspective quality that was missing on many of his earlier live albums. That gives this album a freshness that makes it a keeper for long time EC fans.
B000002AGN|5.0|Everyone's hear Take Five, whether they love or hate jazz-it was certainly the first jazz piece I ever heard-but when The Quartet recorded Time Out they weren't expecting to have such a huge success, so why has it done so well?  The answer,  I think, is that this is an album where everything just works, from Paul Desmond's dreamy alto to Joe Morello's sensitively coloured drums.  It has mass appeal, but also, in it's odd-meter experiments, plenty of material to keep academics happy.  The pieces range from peaceful-Strange Meadow Lark-to swinging-Pick Up Sticks-and the one thing they share in common is their brilliance.  This is a definite 'desert island disc', and a perfect introduction to the genre that is jazz.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The outstanding cuts here are &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &amp; &quot;In My Life&quot;. Cash re-records &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (after listening to Elvis Presley's 1976 version), &amp; his own self penned &quot;Give My Love To Rose&quot; from his Sun Records days. He's re-recorded an upbeat version of his own self penned &quot;Tear Stained Letter&quot; from his 1972 album &quot;A Thing Called Love&quot; with added verses. This is the best of the four volumes in the American Recordings series.
B000002G7G|5.0|The concept of the whole album (save Murder Mystery)is one's search for love and redemption in a very unforgiving world.  \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" finds the protagonist searching for love with an unavailable man or woman (song never really says which makes sense in light of Lou's constant androgeny). \\"Candy says\\", as you stated, is Candy Darling's desire to be loved in a world which has forced him/her to hate her own skin.  Jesus is searching for love and redemption through religion.  Ive thought long and hard about \\"Beg. to see the light\\" and I believe its an acceptance of the writer's fate to simply acknowledge the futility of his pursuit (be it simple acceptance, love, redemption etc.) and let everything be just alright. Overall, this album and VU and Nico are beyond art and they have certainly outlasted the normally alloted 15 minutes.
B00006C79E|5.0|Finisterre is real &quot;grower,&quot; i.e. a record that not only takes time to undestand and appreciate, but also tends to cling to your psyche and haunt your mind for ages. Of course, this defines the most appealing and consummate type of listening pleasure. Of course, this must be St Etienne. At first, there is a shocking rawness and questionable unresolve. Give it time. Suddenly, after your twenty-seventh examination of this record (give or take a few), you will be utterly and mercifully hooked.  Finisterre is: Complex yet simple. Reserved yet free-spirited. Pop yet avant-garde. Once again, this band reinvents themselves, paves new roads and illustrates beauty on the canvas of sound. Yes, it is that heavy. And yes, it also is that gentle.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made in 2001. Wonderful music, awsome costumes, and perfect actors. I say that when I just have a...VHS recording for HBO ( i am kinda[thrifty]). But then I rented the DVD, and what a difference.<br />The DVD has a much better level of clarity, and sound performence. Plus if you want to activate it, a special feature will give you some behind the scenes info about the movie<br />On the first DVD, it shows the actualy movie itself, plus a couple of added features. Also it has some interviews which are pretty cool.<br />The second DVD, has all sorts of nick nacks for any Moulin Rouge lover. Also hidden deep withen the DVD is a scene where Nicole starts laughing her head off when Ewan is singing 'Your Song'. It took me over an hour to find it, but don't let that mis-lead you. It is very easy to navigate around in the DVD and see the extra features it offers. I also highly enjoyed the un-cut dance seqences. <br />All in all, this DVD is well worth the money, and these are the words from the mouth of a very [thrifty]person. You will love this DVD
6303407188|4.0|...or at least according to the appropriately campy opening sequence with Jeffery Jones portraying Criswell.  The  universally acclaimed schlock film director receives an admirable film treatment courtesy of director Tim Burton.  What would have been easy to lampoon instead becomes one of the silver screen's most memorable biographies.  Burton's sly but conventional interpretation of Hollywood's most unconventional moviemaker provides us with necessary elucidation of this enigmatic legend.  <br />Usually working with the sparest of elements and a dreadful lack of logic did not deter Wood Jr. from attempts to realize his greatest ambitions.  Early in the film he laments to his girlfriend that he hasn't been able to get his career in movies started.  \\"Orson Welles was only 26 when he wrote, produced and directed 'Citizen Kane'.  I'm already 30 years old!\\"  Wood Jr. begins his movie making career after convincing a low budget film producer to allow him to direct the company's newest production 'I Changed My Sex'.  This movie eventually morphs into the infamous and disastrously awful 'Glen Or Glenda?'.  From this point Wood Jr.'s career spirals out of control, taking on a shape and form that he becomes convinced is the height of artistic expression.<br />We also discover the circle of friends that Wood Jr. continously surrounds himself with were as hopelessly eccentric as he was.  Though Depp is the star of the film - and he makes an indelible impression as Ed Wood - Landau steals the film entirely portraying horror film legend Bela Lugosi.  Alternately belicose, vainglorious, outlandish, profound, mystifying, pathetic, Lugosi finally succumbs to a 20 year drug addiction, deeply affecting Wood Jr.  Shortly afterward the intrepid filmmaker has an encounter with his gullible landlord whom he convinces to finance the movie 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'.  This sequence of the film is perhaps the most memorable because of the diametrically opposite forces involved.  The film's financial backers are members of a Baptist church who object to virtually everything about the production - first politely then vehemently when Wood Jr. emerges from his dressing room after a tantrum wearing the angora sweater and dark colored skirt made famous in 'Glen Or Glenda?'  He flees the production site winding up in a bar where he spots none other than Orson Welles.  Director Burton paints Welles as a victim of  coincidence who innocently tells Wood Jr. that \\"visions are important.  Never give up your visions, Ed.\\"   Does this mean we have Welles to thank for 'Plan 9' and the other Wood Jr. schlock films that followed?<br />'Ed Wood' also has one of the best supporting casts you will ever see in a Hollywood film.  The bizarre and campy characters are played to great effect, their dialogue being as eminently quotable as Wood Jr. was notorious.  Since it's release in 1994 I cannot think of a movie that has made me laugh as hard and long as this one does.  If you haven't seen 'Ed Wood' stop denying yourself this cinematic treat and correct this oversight immediately!
B00005QFF1|4.0|Occasionally, an American film will come along that pays tribute to the teaching profession. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (1994) was a terrific one that comes immediately to mind. THE ROAD HOME is a simple and poignant love story, as well as one about the honor accorded a teacher after long years of service. It comes from China, which perhaps has traditionally assigned teachers more social respect than here in the U.S.<br />As the film opens, Luo Yusheng (Sun Honglei) is traveling back to his birthplace, a mountain village in northern China. (The scenery is perhaps reminiscent of the Rocky Mountain foothills on the eastern slope.) His father has died, and he's returning home to comfort his aged mother. On arrival, he learns that his father, who was the village schoolteacher for the previous forty years, expired in a nearby city. His mother, Zhao Di (Zhao Yuelin) insists that his body in its coffin be brought back in the traditional manner, i.e. hand carried by the local men, such that \\"he will remember the road home\\". She also has her son bring out of storage an ancient and decrepit loom, on which she weaves a covering for the coffin. As far as the plot is concerned, this activity serves as the takeoff point to the lengthy 1958 flashback, which tells the story of how the 18-year old Zhao Di (now played by Zhang Ziyi) fell in love with the handsome young teacher, Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao), who arrives in the village to help build the one-room school and begin classes. In that earlier time, Di, as the prettiest maiden in town, had been selected to weave the red banner to be attached as a good omen to the main roof crossbeam of the completed classroom.<br />The young Di is the reason to watch THE ROAD HOME. Zhang Ziyi is utterly captivating as the uncomplicated village girl, who sets out to win the bachelor teacher's heart by cooking her best recipes. There's absolutely no hint of sex, violence or profanity, much less any special FX. It's the type of film that most Tinseltown producers probably wouldn't even consider making. It's sweet and gentle, and reminds the viewer of the bond that grows between husband and wife during decades of marriage, as well as the lasting influence a good teacher can have on students. Cynics and the maladjusted should stay away or risk Rolling Eyeballs Syndrome.<br />I found myself liking this film a lot despite its sweetness and predictable plot. Perhaps I should re-listen to my audio self-help tapes on Becoming the Curmudgeon.ucers probably wouldn't even consider making.

B0000042MY|5.0|[...]I think this is a fantastic soundtrack;  a great match to the film.  Like the \\"Glory\\" score, this one plays a strong underlying influence on its film, becoming rather emotional at times, and being able to stand alone as purely good music.<br />From the opening credits the music helps set a sweeping, dramatic mood.  Every time I hear it I'm instantly captivated.  There's a good mix of fast-paced music (\\"Elk Hunt\\", \\"Massacre\\") and slower-paced stuff (\\"Kiss\\" and \\"Cora\\").  There are some slow bits in the middle of the movie, but it picks up dramatically at the end, which can be felt in the music.  I agree with another reviewer that \\"Promentory\\" is the best track, but many of the tracks come pretty close.<br />All in all, I'd say that anyone who cherishes a solid, moving soundtrack should give this one a try.  Especially if you're into Colonial and/or Irish music.  (And watch the movie... you'll probably enjoy that as well!)
B00006JSS8|5.0|I remember this song when the electricity went out,4 of us piled into a '72 Camaro at 8:00pm,heard this song on the radio on the way to the restraunt. Restraunt had palm tree's, neon lighted bar,parrots,the cook(chef) played guitar with two other cooks for about 60 of us in the restraunt.The restraunt was real 'Casablanca',ate catfish with lemon. I remember I got pitched (B.S.) a line from a female, they told her I was under aged. Anyway I heard this song only twice in 1980,didn't know who sang it,and started too hum it ever since. Saw ad on t.v. to buy Stevie Wonder-The Definitive Collection,'Masterblaster' was sample song,had to buy,thanks Stevie...........
B00004Y6NX|4.0|This is a really good cd from dire staits, but not the best one. The best songs on it are Tunnel of Love, Skateaway(got a lot of airplay back 20 some years ago), and track 6. Les boys is probaly the weakest track on the cd, but every track is good. I didn't have any trouble making a copy of this cd, but I haven't tried to put in the player and play it on the computer yet.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Repeating what other people have said, the tracklisting to this so-called 'greatest hits' CD is frustrating.  It's so incomplete and badly done that you almost want to cry.  <br />There are fourteen tracks on this disc.  It totals about fifty minutes.  There probably could have been seven more songs on it.  And some of the songs picked were iffy at best.  &quot;Been a Son?&quot;  That has to be one of my least favorite Nirvana songs ever.  (It is, however, the Blew EP version and not the Incesticide version.) And the remix of Pennyroyal Tea is good.  Other than that, I don't have a probelm with the songs that are already on here.  It could have been MUCH more. For example, &quot;Sliver&quot; is technically the only Incesticide track on here.  Where is &quot;Aneurysm?&quot;  How could that possibly be left out?  The Bleach album is also poorly represented - along with the over-exposed &quot;About a Girl&quot;, why not put &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot; and &quot;Negative Creep?&quot;  I have no real complaints with In Utero or Nevermind (although some of my favorite tracks were omitted).  Such as &quot;Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle.&quot;  (Which has really no place on a greatest hits album, I guess.)  And &quot;Drain You!&quot;  <br />However, as a greatest hits albums, I suppose it serves its purpose - it should attract new fans and lead them to buy other albums.  Then they'll realize that Nirvana had greater songs than &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;<br />The songs on here are great, but the tracklisting brings it down.  That's the bottom line.
B000063UR2|5.0|Okay, I just watched both versions (the expanded Director's Cut with the Jerry Goldsmith score and the original theatrical release with the Tangerine Dream score)and even flipped back and forth and watched specific scenes like the ending more than once.  My verdict is that the U.S. theatrical version with the Tangerine Dream score is still vastly superior.  That music was just so haunting and so otherwordly while the Goldsmith score, while pretty, was much more traditional.  I did enjoy more dialogue to explain what was going on (the U.S. theatrical<br />version was notoriously short on that), but in some places it really bogged down the story and explained things that were better left to the viewer's imagination.  It made the draggy scenes (which usually involved the fairies or the trolls) even draggier.  And the ending is worlds better in the Tangerine Dream version.  Anyway, I've always loved this movie so I'm giving it five stars.  I know the plot, acting, and dialogue are hardly stellar, but I'm willing to overlook that because the visual sumptuousness is unsurpassed as is the primal appeal of its images.  Definitely a fairy tale for the ages!  I'm so thrilled to have both versions on DVD.  Unlike so many DVD's, it truly lives up to its billing as the ULTIMATE edition!

There are no hit singles here &#150; at least nothing like the fare we&#146;ve been accustomed to from the fab four.  If hits are what you&#146;re after, check out anything from their earlier catalogue - hit after delightful hit &#150; there&#146;s enough to rock you for many lifetimes and generations to come&#133;  No, the output here is all about integration - it&#146;s the whole package. And THAT girls and boys, is why Sgt Pepper is so effective - and why the whole piece must be heard in its entirety.  A thrilling miasma of sound.  Evocative, surreal, discordant  - just listen to those minor key undertones.  Dark , cold, nightmarish - like a Hitchcock chiller, the feel is deftly handled.  Superbly crafted and packaged - a symphonic masterpiece.
B000002540|5.0|I first heard this album in December 75, I was 18. It inspired me, Roesers guitar work; pure bliss, Blooms vocals; strong but inviting.  I felt I had really missed not seeing Cult at their height. I saw them twice later; Spectres and a later tour, although great not the brilliance of \\"On Your Feet\\".  We hear of guitar greats -Clapton, Page, Hendrix - Place Roeser in there. His skills are more than apparent on this album.  For a live album there aren't many better, If you like rock, you'll love \\"On your feet\\". Get it now.  27 Years later I still listen and enjoy...
B00006NSZ5|4.0|Great album! Em definately is still shining,as well as bringing some great talent in for Shady Records. even with the poor choice of including the R&B tracks, and the even poorer choice of putting on the incredibly disapointing U wanna be me, Nas should just stick to mixing with J.LO...and Jay-Z? not bad, but why? Jay-Z is over with, done. but regardless Em and his crew out shine the worst spots...and the only thing more I could ask for is the battle raps from the movie on it.<br />One last note to DJ ENC...you believe that rap should be 'smooth, full of charactor and easy on the ear'ok, everyone has their own opinion, but if you're gonna start hatin on Em, tellin us that he has no talent because he's grating on the ear...(which don't make no sense no way) I want to start hearin you dis Mystikal, Busta, and O.D.B in the same sense. Until you do that, I'm gonna just stick with MY opinion that you're hatin on him because he's a white rapper, who has had the skill, the creativity, the talent, the intelligence, and the balls to stay above the rest, when you thought he was gonna be another Vanilla Ice.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Well I was a bit skeptical about this flick, but a couple of my freinds went to see it in the movies and said it was wroth checking out, so I did, and found myself surprised. I think the opening sequence was really good and compelling. The ending was really bold, and I liked that, alot of directors would never take that route. It's one of the best i've seen in recent years, and it kept me at the edge of my seat. I liked the fact that it didn't have a bunch of dumb, horney teenagers in it, ready to die, instead it took a brother and sister route, which I think played out very well, I think the acting was better than I imagined especially by Justin Long(Derry), his facial expressions were unbelievably convincing. Of course they have to go do something stupid as to go look down the pipe, but I like that Derry added \\"what if it was you back there?\\",I thought that was smart.If people were smart in horror flicks, there wouldn't be any. The Creeper was convincing, I found him really creepy, it was one part I think they could have left out and that was when he started whistling, but other than that, I felt that this thing really had a scary vibe to him. You found yourself saying during the movie, go somewhere, where there is people around, but later you come to find out that, it doesn't matter if people and cops are around or not. The Creeper will still come after, and I also liked that. This film is worth checking out, I bought it, and if you like horror films it's not a bad film to add to your dvd collection.
B00006IUL7|1.0|This movie was almost as big a waste of good film as &quot;Ihstar&quot; was. I expected the combined talents of Robin Williams and Al Pachino to be a master peice, but what a let down. Well at least now Warren Beaty and Duston Hoffman have someone they can snicker at to.
B000002UD1|3.0|Coming after the, shall we say, dissappoinment that was called \\"Sometime in New York City,\\" if Lennon had farted on his next album it would have been a welcome relief. He made \\"Mind Games\\" and herein lies the problem. The album is a true return to melody and lyrics worthy of Lennon, with several outstanding songs as good or better than anything on \\"Imagine.\\" The problem is the album is plagued with mediocre production and a few substandard songs that once you've finished the album, leave you with a feeling of....dissapointment.<br />\\"Mind Games\\"--the song, shows just how brillant John can be lyrically. The backing is perfect for his wordplay. \\"Tight As\\" is a song where the production lets Lennon down. The backing thunders along but you really can't distinguish anything. There's a solo in here somewhere but its barely audible in this mix. This kind of aborts any power this track could have had. \\"Aisumasen\\" is one of those love it or hate it kind of songs. It's long and slow and most people might not have the patience to really listen to it but I think its phenomenal. The clear sound, good singing, great feeling and maybe the best guitar solo on an individual Beatles record, make this a killer track. It's followed by \\"One Day at a Time.\\" This is a nothing song. This is the kind of song they play in hospitals to keep patients sedated. It's that bad and totally out of character for Lennon. Maybe he stole it from McCartney. \\"Bring on the Freda\\" is supposed to be a rocker but it doesn't go anywhere. Also, the steel pedal guitar is prominent in the mix--did someone forget to tell Lennon the steel pedal guitar is not a rock 'n roll instrument? It's too prevelant on this album to its detriment. \\"Intution\\" has some really good words although they are wasted with music that is way to poppy. \\"Out of the Blue\\" is a just a good song, period. \\"Only People\\" is one of those let's-all-sing-this-together type of song and like \\"Lucie\\" it doesn't have the force it should. \\"I Know, I Know\\" while having some interesting work by bassist Gordon Edwards is another underrated Lennon classic. Its just a superb song. \\"You Are Here\\" is a nice acoustic, insignificant filler track with very little going for it. \\"Meat City,\\" the closing song, would probably be my choice for highlight of the album. John just cuts loose. The songs is a balls-out rocker the way \\"Lucie\\" and \\"Only People\\" tried(and failed) to be. I would give it 4 stars but I have to deduct one star for poor judgement and mediocre production. If you want to buy this album, buy \\"Imagine,\\" first.\\" while having some interesting work by bassist Gordon Edwards is another underrated Lennon classic.

B00006AG5N|5.0|ELV1S 30 #1 Hits is destined to become a top album by the end of this year or next year. This is so much better than The Beatles 1.

If you haven't bought this album yet, you don't know what you're missing! This is definitive and deserves top feeding. All of the songs are crisp and crystal-clear sharp.

B00005JKCH|4.0|This film did a better job bringing Spidey to the big screen than Superman did for the Man of Steel.  The reason is that &quot;Superman&quot; took itself pretty seriously.  This film doesn't.  It is, quite simply, the comic book come to life.<br />As far as I know I read every Spider-Man comic book from its inception until 1968, when I discovered girls.  So I speak here with authority.  This film **is** the comic book.  If you liked the comic book, you'll like the film.  If not, you probably won't.<br />I watched the DVD expecting to hate it.  Within 10 minutes I was hooked.  OK, fine, so the special effects don't look 100% authentic (they're great, just not believable).  OK, so the Green Goblin is a little hard to believe.  So what?  Like they were authentic and realistic in the comic book?  Give me a break.  This is a great movie for what it is.  And unlike so many dreary films these days, this one has an actual storyline, a love interest, a dash of humor, and overall is great fun.<br />The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending.  Come on, Mary Jane is gorgeous, and Peter seems like a normal guy, excepting that he's Spider-man.  So what's the deal?  OK, I won't spoil it for you.<br />Great fun.  My whole family just got done watching the DVD, and it was a fun evening.  My 4 year old son, 10 year old daughter, and their 48 year old dad all loved it.  My dear wife never knew that I know all there is to know about Spidey, heh heh.<br />Buy it.  You'll like it.

0345347951|3.0|Childhood's End is considered by many to be a classic.  While it has some original ideas, the story itself has some flaws.  Some chapters are simply a dry accounting of the changes to human society without showing the impact on the actual characters.  Some characters I just found unengaging and really didn't care what happened to them.<br />I'm sure I'll never forget the ideas in this book, but I have very little interest in reading it again.

6305949980|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas. I've grown up with the movie. Back in '93 when I was very young I first saw it. I was too young to complete a complex thought about the film but now I am. I've seen the movie dozens of times between then a now and have been trying to get the DVD for a while now and finally got it recently. Watching the deleted scenes and photos were fun because I got to know what it was like to make the movie and what they did. The movie has been critcally praised and all I've heard were good things from the people who've seen it.<br />The film starts by seeing that all of the holiday's have there own town. Creatures and people representing people heard around that holiday.(Monsters on Halloween,Elfs on Christmas etc)They celebrate that holiday when the time comes and in the woods there are trees with the doors to those places. The story starts in Halloweentown where they are celebrating Halloween. Jack Skellington who is the one loved by most and is the most scariest of all the creatures there. When Halloween ends we learn that Jack has been depressed because it's always the same every year. He ends up walking into the place where all the holidays intersect. He walks into Christmastown and loves everything there. No monsters,no ghouls,no horror. Just happiness and people being jolly. Back at home he ponders about what the meaning of Christmas is only to come up with one solution......to make there own Christmas. Jack and the crew in Halloweentown all make toys they think are beautiful and fun but are really horrible and scary. Jack is warned from his friend Sally who loves his dearly to not go on with it but Jack disagrees. He needs something new to end his Halloween cycle. Jacks big misake is when he sends Halloweentown's finest trick or treaters Lock Shock and Barrel to go and get Santa Clause. The problem is caused when they give him to Oogie Boogie(Bogeyman)and Boogie is a very very evil Halloweentown citizen. Can Christmas be saved?<br />With excellant music and songs by composer Danny Elfman(Spiderman,Planet of the Apes,Novocaines Theme)Great songs include \\"This is Halloween\\",\\"Jack's Lament\\",\\"Sally's Songs\\",\\"Jack's Obession\\",and \\"Poor Jack\\".<br />Some scenes may be a little scary to some young kids but The Nightmare Before Christmas has fun for everybody...adults and kids alike. A movie that will always be loved and will always be great.<br />ENJOY!

B00000K31Q|4.0|I think of all the teen dramedy movies of late, this is the best.  Probably because it has the highest ratio of people that can really act in it, and possibly because Freddy Prinze has nothing to do with this.  The actors actually develop tensions between each other.  The music generally fits the events of the movie, rather than giving the feeling that they threw in any old hit song.  It still feels like a teen movie, but I think it tries a lot less hard to be cool to the teens.  Maybe it is just not so noticeable.  There is no extra maturity, or complexity, but I think that is due to the stars abilities.  The extra DVD features are lacking, but I definitely recommend this movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|\\"Moulin Rouge\\" shows us that Nicole Kidman is arguably the greatest actress of our time.  In this film, she convincingly displays the whole spectrum of human emotion.  From indifference to eternal love, Ms. Kidman, in this film, gives us a most satisfying performance. <br />How she could have been associated with one as mediocre as that Cruise fellow?   We should be glad that has come to an end.  For the future is bright.  This movie shows us how bright that future is.  <br />Nicole Kidman might just be the greatest actress to have ever lived.  Moulin Rouge tells us that this might be so.  Hopefully, Ms. Kidman's future work will prove to us that her performance in Moulin Rouge was not a fluke.<br />Jim Schmidt<BR>[...]
B00005JKLZ|3.0|This film had the tables stacked against it from the start.  It would be hard to outdo the original movie.  I don't think this film outdoes that film, but on its own, this film is fun to watch and kept my interest.  The CGI effects are amazing.  It wal like watching a dream at times.  The camerawork is very good.  The shots are well laid out and very attractive.  Maybe that is the best part of the whole movie.  The extra features on the disc are lacking.  Still, the movie is worth seeing on an afternoon you have nothing else to do.  Maybe a date movie.
0553213105|4.0|Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This movies is a lot of fun.  I think it is creative, and it is definitely clever.  The only bad thing about this movie is that a good number of the jokes are poking fun at other movies, so they may not be understood by everyone.  But it is well done, and the computer animation is excellent.  I didn't notice any glitches or rough looking spots.  Everything moves almost naturally.  Some people and things walk a little strangely, but that is hardly enough to pick at.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B000069CWE|5.0|i must admit i was a little disappointed. this is just the same as hybrid theory, only remixed. (obviously by the name) really it's a good cd though. it keeps us lp fans happy for now seeing as the new album is coming out in a month and a half. some songs are better than others but my favorites are by myself, my december, high voltage, and papercut. hey i say they tried and it's not a bad cd so i love it because i love linkin park. i would suggest bying it because it really is a good cd. go on ... go get it now.
B000001AJG|5.0|Let me just say that i dont own any Stevie Wonder albums, only this one. The fact that he made it doesnt really matter at all anyway. The &quot;secret life of plants&quot;-Xperience is what you should call it listening to-singing along or playing along with this astounding album. As far as im concerned a milestone in musical history although not many may agree. In any case i always get drawn back to it, a yearning for different sounds, soothing or years gone by. Ah well im not THAT old, just bought my first piano and im going to try to follow this album around like i used too playing my guitar.
B000063DHL|4.0|It was like a scene from The Breakfast Club. Four 10th graders exiled by the band director to a tiny practice room every day during second period. Ostensibly we were in there to practice our instruments, but most days nary a note was blown or plucked. Instead, we formed a circle with our folding chairs and traded idle chatter and vicious barbs. For those of you requiring a cast of characters, the room contained Kurt (a preppy French-horn-playing jerk typically clad in an oxford shirt, pleated slacks and penny loafers), Kim (a redneck trumpeter chick with a don't-mess-with-me attitude who grew up just down the street from me in York Terrace), Tim (an unpretentious friendly violinist who worked long hours after school at a local seafood restaurant), and me (a mediocre saxophonist with a jones for classic rock and a small circle of close friends who thought band was for stoners and delinquents). <br />Our second period experience usually began with Kurt insulting one, two, or even all three of us. Some of the things Kurt most enjoyed poking fun at included my questionable writing skills, Tim's fondness for flannel shirts, and Kim's overall scholastic prowess. Considering the rate at which Kurt doled out insults, it was a wonder that he didn't emerge from our cell bruised and battered one day. Luckily for him, the only person in that room who possessed any violent tendencies was Kim and only she knows why she didn't act on them. It's not like Tim or I would have intervened - plump little Kurt wouldn't have stood a chance against an angry (and generously proportioned) Terrace girl like Kim.<br />Tim was into heavy metal, a musical genre Kurt considered pathetic. The way Kurt saw it, 'why would anyone play corny Iron Maiden when they could play music by cool acts like the Thompson Twins or Corey Hart?' He certainly never shied away from heavy-handedly offering his views on the subject to Tim. Whenever Tim started raving about Maiden or their mascot, Eddie, Kurt would rollhis eyes and hurl another insult at him. There wasn't much I could say to come to Tim's defense since I was completely unfamiliar with Iron Maiden myself at the time. Over the course of the year, Tim made plenty of offers to play some Maiden for me, but preferring to avoid giving Kurt another excuse to insult me, I never took him up on it. By the time the school year ended, we all reviled Kurt and had no desire to continue interacting with him in the future. Oddly enough, none of the rest of us hung out anymore either - perhaps because we all associated each other with Kurt.<br />With the appearance of Appetite for Destruction the next year, I became a huge metal fan myself and over the ensuing years amassed a formidable collection of metal albums. However, for many years, there was always something missing from my collection. Perhaps it was all the ribbing I'd heard Kurt give Tim, but something always inhibited me from checking out Iron Maiden. Finally in 1999, after hearing a series of Maiden classics on WSOU, Seton Hall's Pirate Radio, I could hold out no longer. I picked up Powerslave and Somewhere in Time in short order and got to work. And what pleasant work it was. It was like discovering a treasure trove I never knew existed. Maiden infused their music with so much energy - Bruce Dickinson's impassioned multi-octave vocals, the incomparable Smith-Murray guitar duels, Nicko McBrain's rock solid drumming, and Steve Harris' chugga chugga bass lines. I dare say heavy metal has never been so melodic before or since. I found both Powerslave and Somewhere in Time to be very good albums, but lyrically Somewhere in Time was far more appealing to me than the war and violence themed Powerslave. Plus, Somewhere in Time had more epic cuts like the veritable history lesson, \\"Alexander the Great\\", the inspirational anthem, \\"Wasted Years\\", the slow-building \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\", and the twin guitar classics, \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"De Ja Vu\\". If you love heavy metal, I am almost certain you will find cuts on Somewhere in Time that will blow you away. Of course, Maiden does have a reputation for including a few less than stellar cuts on many of their albums and Somewhere in Time is no exception. However, if you are reasonably competent at operating a fast-forward button, you will not be disappointed with the overall power and majesty of Somewhere in Time. I can almost assure you that you will like it better than a Corey Hart album from the same era.

B00006V9A0|3.0|Yeah, it's okay, but for a band such as Nirvana that truly redefined a category or two, it's really missing a few things. Other reviewers have lit on the songs absent. The thing is, most of the songs (to my ears anyway) sound extremely faded today, and the new song, whatever it's called, is extremely weak in almost all areas except the chorus. The highlights: Nevermind of course, the Bowie cover, Lithium. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of Nirvana, but this will not be the CD I remember them with.
B000066I6N|5.0|Lets hope not. It deserves more respect than that. Frankly this is the most original album I've heard in years. True 90% of the lyrics have been resurrected from Percy's deep blues catalog. It's the new band that makes it.<br />After catching the gang on Austin City Limits I immediately went digging around for the mp3's to see if the studio recordings were as good. Well, I quickly found them to be outstanding. <br />With Robert's vocals, you can get away with just about any ol hack band. The group he put together for this album is amazing. They really understand how to put together some great melodies. You can tell that Robert really enjoys playing with them. They all seem to be on the same musical wavelength. <br />As many other reviewers have stated, this is not Led Zeppelin II, nor should it be compared as such. This is also not \\"Tall Cool One\\". Anyone who has made the mistake of stereotyping Plant as just a hard rock front man will be quickly disappointed. If you really know Led Zeppelin, and are a fan for their more obscure pieces (like those from LZIII), then this will be a refreshing treat. <br />At the same time, no one should claim this is a \\"boring\\" album. The band's rendition of Hey Joe sends chills up my spine. Jimi did a great job with it and made a hit. This version is not intended to be a hit. It's another take on Dylan's lyrics; a very dark take that is extremely well presented. I would have bought the album for that piece alone. Boring? HAH!<br />Before buying this album, remember one thing. It's a blues album. Not Black Dog or Whole Lotta Love blues either. It's classic folk blues with a fun psychedelic twist. <br />Led Zeppelin was one of the greatest bands of all time for one fundamental reason: they embraced all genres with a uniqueness that was all theirs. Percy embraces that with all the passion he does towards all of his work. Do yourself and Robert Plant a favor... <br />Take the album for what it is, and enjoy it!
B000002KK2|5.0|One of the most startling things about Jones is her immediacy.  Everything about her work has tremendous spontenaity, as if she suddenly broke into song on a streetcorner and a few passing musicians and back-up singers decided to join in--an effect that is particularly well captured on her self-titled debut.  In some respects she seems to be the heir of such free-form artists as Laura Nyro and Patti Smith; she is certainly the forerunner to the more recently debuted Natalie Merchant, Alanis Moressette, and Jewel.  But in the final analysis, Rickie Lee Jones is Rickie Lee Jones: there is no other quite like her.<br />Jones speciality is her remarkable ability to fuse whatever styles happens to catch her fancy and blend them into a seamless whole.  &quot;Chuck E.'s in Love,&quot; the hit single from this collection, is jazzy and funky and fun--and what most casual listeners think of when Jones comes to mind.  But it is merely the introduction to her remarkable skill at combining diverse musical ideas.  One of the most startling examples of this is &quot;Last Chance Texaco,&quot; in which she combines elements of new age and jazz with a western flavor in a plantive, powerful ballad that likens failed love to broken-down cars going nowhere on an endless highway (&quot;She was a block-busted blonde&quot;)--lyrics and vocal as brilliant as the music itself.<br />If Jones is frequently plantive in tone, she is also remarkably hip and funny.  &quot;Easy Money&quot; mixes blues and jazz with a honky-tonk edge to tell a sly story of grifters on the make, and &quot;Danny's All-Star Joint&quot; mixes everything from swing to a sort of childhood nostalgia proto-rap (&quot;Hey-hey boys, how bout a fight/cause here comes Rickie with her girdle on tight&quot;) in a truly fun filled portait of street life in a corner store hangout.  It's all amazing stuff, shifting smoothly from powerful passions and tragedy to introspective musings to up-beat good times and pure musical joy.<br />While it is almost impossible to pick one single cut from the recording as a favorite, my favorite here is &quot;Company,&quot; a ballad that artfully mixes traces of pop music and jazz in a memorable reflection on life-changes that cause friends to drift apart--and the longing that follows the separation.  If you like good music that stretches the boundaries of style, you'll find it here.  Strongly recommended.hile it is almost impossible to pick one single cut from the recording as a favorite, my favorite here is &quot;Company,&quot; a ballad that artfully mixes traces of pop music and jazz in a memorable reflection on life-changes that cause friends to drift apart--and the longing that follows the separation.

B00005JLEU|5.0|OK, I'm not one of the people that had the honor of seeing Spirited Away in it's original Japaneze language before the English dub release. But I definitely bought the DVD after seeing the English dub version. This is most definitely one of the finest animated films I've ever seen, and it's quite groundbreaking, along the lines of Snow White and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Being the most popular film of all time in Japan, Disney had a chance to get the film to a wide audience here in the states with the English dub theatrical release, and the film only opened in 26 theaters, and expanded to just 151. It's been treated as if it's a piece of junk, but it's truly a very fine film. They had a chance to have an easy home run, and they blew it. However, if you're lucky enough to catch this film in the theaters, it's really a wonder to behold, and definitely worth the buy on DVD. I myself already bought the Japan version and will very likely buy the US version when it comes out as well...it's that good.

Yes David has aged, as we all have, but his music is timeless. The focal point of Pink Floyd's conncert performances has always been David instrumentals.  This DVD is a rock masterpiece.

B000067CPX|4.0|I have been a longtime fan of this California quartet, throughout the ups and downs, death and destruction they have endured.

0440178002|5.0|John Blackthorne, English pilot of a Dutch ship, is shipwrecked on Japan with a few members of his crew in the year 1600. As he learns about Japanese society and forms relationships, he slowly becomes involved in high level political intrigue under the watch of powerful Japanese daimyo Toranaga.<br />Within the historical context that Clavell lays out, the book works very well. However, since I know nothing about historical Japan, I had to accept Clavell's assumption that Japanese society of the time was sophisticated but extremely violent.<br />The characters are very believable. Blackthorne starts out appalled by various Japanese customs and slowly begins to accept them. While never wholly embracing all that's going on around him, he understands it and can work with it to his advantage. Toranaga is a brilliant political and military tactician who understands his own limitations and has a high regard for his vassals. Mariko (a key character and Blackthorne's love interest) is torn between duty and desire. Father Alvito (the main Jesuit priest) seems at first to be the archetypal evil Christian missionary, but by the end he's portrayed as a much more sympathetic character.<br />The plot is interesting and moves quickly. In spite of a large cast and a sprawling story (covering 1100+ pages), Clavell does a good job of keeping it all together. Since it took me a long time to finish the book, I sometimes lost track of the minor characters, but in the end it didn't really matter. All of the writing in \\"Shogun\\" was worth reading. Clavell didn't write long, needlessly descriptive passages and he still managed to capture my imagination completely.<br />My main objection to the book is the ending.  It was too abrupt -- almost as if Clavell was completely caught up in the story and suddenly decided (or was told) to wrap it up in the next 50 pages. A few people have commented on how they didn't want the book to end. I wanted to the book to end, but wasn't entirely happy with the ending given to me.<br />That being said, I do recommend \\"Shogun\\". It's definitely one of the best historical fiction books I've read.he ending given to me.<br />That being said, I do recommend \\"Shogun\\".

6300214753|5.0|The above title says it all. After viewing \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", you may ask yourself \\"Hmm...just exactly how was a cool, righteous dude such as Ferris Bueller able to pull his antics off, and without getting caught in the process?\\" Such is a question which may come to mind, regardless of whether you're a teenager, or if you've left your teenage years long behind you.Ferris (Matthew Broderick) is one lucky kid who has it all: a pair of loving and understanding parents (played by Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett), a beautiful and intelligent girlfriend named Sloane Peterson (played by Mia Sara), and, to top it all off, a bright and successful future ahead of him. But...something's missing...Although he's already missed nine days this school year, Ferris decides to undertake the most important \\"Senior Skip Day\\". In order to pull this feat off, Ferris enlists the help of his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who's home sick in bed. Together, they both cook up a scheme to get Ferris's girlfriend out of a boring history class, with both Ferris's school principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) under heavy suspicion - both of whom are determined to catch Ferris with his pants down. While all this is happening, many comical moments occur in the unfolding, including a hilarious classroom scene with Ben Stein (in an early role) as a drone economics teacher (whom I personally would have loved to have had as an instructor during my high school years!), plus various other classic scenes and dialogue worthy of many a viewing.The secondary \\"star\\" of \\"FBDO\\", is a 1961 Ferrari GT, which gets quite a workout during much of the movie (although this big red machine's fate is a bit too much to mention). It's interesting to note that four Ferraris were used in the making of this outstanding motion picture.But, you may also ask yourself: \\"How was it that Ferris & Co. were able to visit all those landmark places in Chicago all in one day?\\" And what landmarks these venues are! First, our mischievous gang of merry gentlemen and one debonair lady take in the sights of our nation's third largest city high atop the tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower, then it's on to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for an instant's insight into the trader's market, and on to a midday lunch break at a fancy French restaurant, where Ferris barely avoids meeting up with dear old Dad. After their midday respite, Ferris, Cameron and Sloane take in a Cubs game at historic Wrigley Field (before lights were installed for night games, a spectacle which truly made this ballpark a one-of-a-kind attraction, alongside its ivy-covered outfield walls). Finally, our gang pays a visit to the Art Institute of Chicago, where unique and stylistic works of physical, impressionistic structures await our unique band of \\"tourists\\".What occurs during and what follows this \\"field trip\\" is very pacey and classic comedy dialog, just like the outing around the city (including a must-see free-for-all \\"concert\\" and sing-along in one). Just watch Ferris's pursuing principal and his jealous sister TRY and catch him in the act. You'll ABSOLUTELY die laughing!\\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" is another John Hughes written and directed masterpiece worthy of high praise. The master of teen flicks is clearly at the top of his game here. You DO NOT want to miss the closing credits as well. Just make sure \\"FBDO\\" is on your must-see, must-own list of important movie titles to add to your important video collection...and I mean RIGHT NOW!ese venues are!

0316666343|5.0|Beautifully written tale of tragedy and sadness.  Then, love and spiritual hope. Another book that has these same themes that I recommend is called I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You.  I also think this is a well written book.  I love these books and rank these two as my absolute favorites. What I especially love about Lovely Bones is that I can picture it as a movie--a darned good one.  I can't wait.
6304457391|5.0|\\"Seven Days in May\\" was a so-so book that John Frankenheimer turned into an absolutely brilliant movie.  It's an excellent cold-war drama, made at a time when tension between this country and the Soviet Union was at boiling point.  At the center of the story is President Jordan Lyman, a well-meaning, somewhat naive chief executive who has pushed through a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviets, which most of the country, and all of the military, fear the Soviets have no intention of honoring.  The stage is set for a political confrontation between the president's supporters, who feel they must back him whatever their private apprehensions, and his opponents, who fear he is selling the country out.  Enter at this point a career soldier with political ambitions, General James Scott, who plans to put his enormous popularity to work in devising a scheme that he thinks will save his country, which is nothing less than a military plot to overthrow the government.  However, loose lips can sink a ship, and a few chance words reach the ears of Colonel Jiggs Casey, a Marine torn between his loyalty to his general, General Scott, and his commander in chief, president Lyman.  What makes a good soldier, and what makes a true patriot?  That is the dilemma Casey has to come to grips with as he realizes that the clock is ticking, the plot is underway, and there are less than seven days left before something very big goes down.<br /><br />The movie has minimal action and a lot of dialogue, but the tension is maintained nicely throughout, and the acting is uniformly excellent.  Among the excellent cast, the standouts are Frederic March as the president, Burt Lancaster as General Scott, Kirk Douglas in one of his finest roles as Colonel Casey, and Ava Gardner, still drop-dead gorgeous, as Scott's cast-off mistress, drowning herself in booze, self-pity and resentment.  The final verbal confrontation between Casey and Scott near the movie's end is one of the best I've ever witnessed on film.  The movie grabs hold of you from the opening frames and keeps you riveted right to the end, all the while making you wonder, could it really happen here?  Let's hope we never find out...<br /><br />Judy Lindm.

She's the COMPLETE package of looks AND talent. Her voice gives me chills everytime I hear it. Each song is a masterpiece. I cry every time I listen to \\"I'm OK\\". She really bared her soul on this album. I do believe she has a VERY LONG LASTING career ahead of her. ...
B00005JKCH|2.0|Let me start by saying that I really enjoy the film itself and give that five stars.  I think it really captured the spirit of the comic book.  However, I have never been more disappointed in DVD extras.  I was really looking forward to more depth and detail into the making of the movie and the actors' thoughts on the process.  I even thought they would have given a small hint as to how they will approach the future films.  I felt like all it was was a repeat of all the specials that were shown on television.  The few original additions felt like they were just thrown in to have more items in the list.  I don't think the extras did anything to enhance the film.  Maybe the most disappointing thing for me is the omission of the trailer that shows Spiderman building the web between the World Trade Center towers that catches the helicopter.  That was an amazing trailer and really got me excited for the movie.  I realize 9/11 is still a sensitive area for many people, but I think omitting that scene takes away some of the excitment and mythology in the movie of New York.  The creator's of the movie and DVD missed their chance to really show off the things that made this movie great.

B000069HZP|1.0|This film was living up to its hype for most of it, until the ending, at which point it all fell apart in what must be one of the most senseless, absolutely moronic and ridiculous endings I've ever seen.  To go into detail would be to spoil it, so I'll just say that thanks to the ending, what could have been a good film is completely undone, and the viewer (the intelligent one, anyway) is left insulted.<br />David Fincher knows how to put together a good-looking film, with all the requisite entertainment elements, but what he just doesn't get are the concepts of plot coherence, reasonable limits of suspension of disbelief, and anything approaching feasibility.  This movie ends up being just a meaningless two-hour joyride, with a last few minutes that negates those two hours with a level of stupidity that few films in history have ever matched.  <br />I was wondering how such an apparently hyped movie, with such a stellar cast, could have had such a low profile.  Now I know.

1881273156|5.0|Chapman's book was recommended to me by both newlyweds and a couple who has been together for over 20 years. My husband and I took it along with us on our honeymoon and have already started recommending it to others.<br />The book's great asset is that it encourages you to examine the ways that you show affection and the ways that you expect to receive it. The latter has been the cause of many a misunderstanding in our relationship; we noticed an immediate improvement once we started taking note of these hidden assumptions. The exercises give you a concrete way to continue to show love to your spouse/partner, that has its own rewards built in. Because we've found this  to be so valuable, I give this book five stars.<br />The weaknesses? Chapman's metaphors are clunky (while the concept of a 'love tank' is useful, even the couples I know who love this book cringe whenever they find it necessary to say, &quot;Honey, how full is your love tank today?&quot;).  His assertion that there are no more than five love langauges is also adamant but not well-supported.<br />Despite these minor weaknesses, the message and method are so helpful that I would (and do) recommend this to anyone who wants to have a better relationship with his or her partner.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I have to admit that I am an extreme novice to Nirvana's music... quite sadly. Sure, I've heard several of their songs here and there, but never really made an effort to track down their CDs and give them the chance they deserved. <br />This spring, I heard &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; for the first time and really couldn't stop thinking about the song. So, I was buying quite a few CDs a couple of weeks ago and thought that this would be a good way to determine whether or not this band would appease me.<br />Well, if you're anything like me -you heard a few songs and liked them but never really made much effort- this CD will define that fact completely. <br />For me, the album is infectious. Too wise, thoughtful and rock-driven for one sitting. The music leaves you thinking very seriously. It covers topics most popular modern musicians wouldn't dream of. From Kobain's rocky childhood (exposed partially in &quot;Sliver&quot;) to the disillusionment everyone faces every now and then in life so well portrayed in &quot;The Man Who Sold the World,&quot; all the way up to the human inferiority complexes explored (exposed?) in &quot;All Apologies.&quot; Nirvana made political and philosophical statements in an industry where Michael Jackson ruled as king- a daring feat.<br />Their success certainly doesn't elude me. It's evidenced in the brilliant rock and joyous sadness of each song.<br />It's a fantastic collection for someone who loves rock-n-roll or grunge. It's not too heavy instrumentally, balancing guitar riffs and drums perfectly with Kobain's unfaltering stream of poetry. Mentally it's an experience that few bands now have the capability to produce.<br />One of the year's must have albums.
1577311523|5.0|The reason Eckhart Tolle's teachings continue to attract and hold the rapt attention of so many around the world is because his calm and sure words reach into and capture souls. <br />He makes no demands on the reader nor does he claim that he himself - or any other single entity that ever walked the earth is the only one with the final answer. He reminds us over and over that EVERYONE has a direct connection to God, regardless of what our description of God may be - and that there is a way for each of us to become conscious of that magnificent power.  <br />His teachings don't include the promotion or endorsement of any organized form of religion nor do they warn that if we don't follow them, we'll go to hell. He doesn't condemn or discount any established religion or sysem of belief for what they teach as truth - despite the fact that many of them have criticized, discredited and even warned against him.<br />Truth is still and silent and needs no sword or shield.    <br />By simply telling of his own transformation from ego nature to absolute Truth, he encourages and inspires us to become that too. And for those of us who listen and HEAR, it's the beginning whole new life. How great an adventure is that?!
0553103547|5.0|This is by far, the most realistic me·di·e·val fantasy that you'll ever find. It's better than Lord of the Rings! The reader is immersed in a culture of knights and peasants, of warriors, zombies and Hounds...the trials of many to struggle for power, to stab in the front as well as the back - a political fiasco that forces one to question the answers; and reminds us that life is ever fleeting.  This series killed me, and brought me back all the wiser.  As with most things the first book sets it all up...you CANNOT read these out of order!
0792839749|2.0|maybe for their 45th anniversary edition MGM will remember themselves and put it in WIDE SCREEN FORMAT!!! there is SO much that is lost in the pan&scan version. when a film was done back in the 60s, wide screen was a perc still and MGM was still the best at utilizing the format. the wider the better and the more of the screen you used to pull in your audience the better,too. well, with today's technology, it's not uncommon to find that a film is done in both perspectives to apease everyone, but super panorama was engulfing. i miss that feeling. the film is pretty much only 1/2 there, and 1/2 a musical is just annoying. will not buy it till it's out and done proper. i have & LOVE the mary popins dvd - that was done right...<br />4/20/4 - thank you, thank you, thank you!

It isn't suspenseful, it's definately NOT SCARY, with weak acting, an incoherent plot, and an idiotic killer, this film ends up being dumber than the movies it claimed to be rising above. I can't believe people got scared in this, it wasn't meant to be a \\"horror\\" film in the first place, it was actually intended to be a dark comedy, so you're suppose to laugh at this, not get scared in it!

B000002HH2|5.0|\\"I'm going hunting for mysteries,\\" Bjork sings on her second album. \\"I'm going to prove the impossible really exists.\\" She does both exceedingly well on Post, which expands and improves upon the promise of her first album, 1993's Debut - while at the same time demolishing all expectations one might have about what she's going to do next. With this album, she teaches you to expect the unexpected. <BR> <BR>Post is a glorious, kitchen-sink mix of music; eclectic but not eccentric, edgy but not outr, sweet but not saccharine, experimental but never elusive, full of great danceable beats, interspersed with softer moments that are, in their own way, just as relentless. <BR> <BR>Speaking of relentless: The album starts with the driving, insistent \\"Army of Me,\\" a song that borrows its beat from Led Zeppelin, its brass stings from `80's Yes, but whose attitude is pure Bjork. Its lyrics read as a repudiation of the self-serving alt-rock whining from the previous three or four years: \\"I won't sympathize/anymore/and if you complain once more/you'll meet an army of me.\\" Bjork effectively serves notice that navel-gazing and self-pity are things of the past: \\"self-sufficience, please!\\" she sings, not asking for it but demanding it. The best part of the song is its delightful irony; she's using the industrial sounds embraced by such \\"angry young bands\\" as Nine Inch Nails to effectively defuse their anger. <BR> <BR>The rest of the album uses \\"Army of Me\\" as a jumping-off point; having captured your attention, Bjork never once lets it go. She guides the listener through several musical and lyrical modes: the slow crescendo and dark romance of \\"Hyper-Ballad\\" segues into the sweeping, majestic, mysterious \\"The Modern Things.\\" \\"It's Oh So Quiet,\\" a swing-jazz freakout that's anything but quiet, is followed by the grinding industrial groove of \\"Enjoy,\\" which descends into the calming quietude of \\"You've Been Flirting Again.\\" The symphonic, pulsating \\"Isobel\\" is followed by the soft, sweet \\"Possibly Maybe\\" - whose mood is then spun up into manic joy by the pounding Latin rhythms of \\"I Miss You,\\" a terrific love song about an affair that \\"hasn't happened yet.\\"  <BR> <BR>The last two songs are the most experimental Bjork had done up to that point: \\"Cover Me,\\" the song quoted at the beginning of this review, and the minimalist, impressionistic \\"Headphones,\\" co-written by Bjork and Tricky. \\"Headphones\\" in particular is a beautiful piece of music, electronic bloops and bleeps that somehow manage to sound organic, warm and welcoming. It is a song that is meant for headphones, I think (even if the title didn't imply it, I'd think so), so you can fully experience the envelopment of sounds, and Bjork's beautiful, multi-tracked singing. And while I'm on that subject...<BR> <BR>Bjork's voice is the center of this album, and she's even more creative and versatile with it here (if that's possible) than she was on her first release. She makes intelligent choices: on the angry \\"Army of Me,\\" she does not howl or growl the lyric, but sings it in a calm, matter-of-fact voice that sounds all the more insistent and furious, as if she's struggling not to lose her temper. On \\"Hyper-Ballad,\\" a song about frightening oneself to feel \\"happier/to be safe up here with you,\\" she sings lightly, almost airily, about such subjects as throwing herself off a mountain cliff, and wondering whether her eyes will be closed or open when she lands. I cannot think of another singer alive today who could pull off a feat like that, or who could even conceive of doing so.<BR> <BR>\\"It's Oh So Quiet,\\" \\"Enjoy,\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" showcase Bjork's tremendous range, as well as her ability to belt out a lyric like nobody else on the planet. \\"Quiet\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" are especially formidable in this regard; in the former song, the calm of the verses is shattered with each successive, explosive chorus, as the brass section kicks in, and Bjork not only out-swings it, she very nearly out-sings it as well. It's quite possibly the best vocal on the entire album. It's run a close second by her performance on \\"I Miss You,\\" where excitement, anticipation, impatience, lust, and about half a dozen other emotions crowd themselves into every note. They become more and more strident with each line she sings, battling for dominance until it is all she can do to get the notes out; her vocal ends on a long, yowling high note, then a clipped, joyous scream, both of which send chills down the spine.<BR> <BR>Perhaps the most surprising vocal moments on Post occur when Bjork begins singing in her native Icelandic, both on \\"The Modern Things\\" and \\"Headphones.\\" It shocks you into hearing the song as Bjork herself must have imagined it. Too, it has the effect (if one doesn't speak Icelandic, as I imagine most of Bjork's fans don't) of turning her voice into another instrument, soloing as a guitar or trumpet might, adding \\"colors of sound\\" that might be missing had she chosen to sing in English. In her native idiom, the songs become that much better, that much purer, and I wish she would sing in Icelandic more often!<BR> <BR>Post is one of the best albums of the last ten years, a variegated, magical album, wherein Bjork goes hunting for her mysteries and finds them in the most mundane of places: mountains, hearts, and headphones. And she does, in the end, prove the existence of the impossible - because I didn't think it was at all possible for her to improve upon her first album. Yet here's the proof, as amazing and magnificent and mercurial as the singer herself. I've listened to this album countless times now; every time I hear something new...and a higher compliment I cannot pay. Remain in light - Phrodoe.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great series on the life of soldiers in WWII. The acting is great and the scenery is spectacular. One of the benefits of the DVD is the making of and 80 min interview with the actual veterans. It really puts in perspective what they went through from training to the end of the WAR
B00005J6T0|3.0|True Blue gave the world a first indication that Madonna could put 'substance' to her music that lived up to her image. Up to True Blue era all she could seem to come up with was cute bubblegum love songs or cheese-dance orientated songs with lyrics about how much she likes to dance. Seriously, 'Madonna' and 'Like A Virgin' were pretty weak albums save a couple of catchy singles. It seemed the best things about her was her thrift store clothe sense and the whole 'hey Im cheap and easy' image.<br />'True Blue' is not only a on off attempt at lyrical substance but is musically more diverse, interesting, and sophisticated than before. 'Live To Tell' is an AMAZING haunting ballad with AMAZING lyrics, only 'Oh Father' and 'You'll See' from later years do the same thing better. 'Papa Don't Preach' gains credit from approaching a controversial social topic head on with a catchy chorus. 'Open Your Heart' is pure pop but utterly catchy and wonderful, a classic, and 'La Isla Bonita' proceeds the whole latin fusion craze by about 10 years but does it better than Ricky Martin or J-Lo could ever hope for.<br />As with any Madonna album the singles are the best extracts from it. Having said that, I still think 'Where's The Party' would have made a better single than the 60s girl group deriative 'True Blue.' As for the remainder of songs, 'Love Makes The World Go Round' is sentimental but sweet, 'White Heat' is so-so, and 'Jimmy Jimmy' is um, stupid.<br />While not an artistically profound record by any standards, Madonna was at least proving she had music potential to back her image and 'acting skills' (ha ha)which she proved a fact with 89's 'Like A Prayer' which was, in fact, a great album.
B00006DEFA|5.0|...this is the one.<br />Milos Forman's &quot;Amadeus&quot; broke new ground in so many ways. It's one of the most amazing, entertaining, enthralling biopics ever made. It broke tradition by showing its hero not as a Tortured Artiste, but a regular guy with a lowbrow sense of humor who just happened to be one of the world's most gifted composers. And unlike many other biographies of musicians, the MUSIC takes center stage. Listen as it blasts out of your speakers!<br />&quot;Amadeus&quot; was released on DVD in the format's early days (1997, I think) and the main problem with that release was that the length of the film required it to be &quot;flipped&quot; to the other side halfway through. The new Director's Cut fixes that problem...and goes a long way to make amends.<br />First of all, there's tons of extra footage, incorporated into the natural sequence of the film (it's not added in as a &quot;bonus feature&quot;). Most of the extra footage is welcome, with only a couple of scenes unnecessary, in my opinion. Second of all, the sound! This is music to be played loud, and the quality is perfect.<br />Let's not forget the extras...director Milos Forman and screenwriter Peter Shaffer offer insightful commentary. There's a wonderful documentary on the making of the film which contains great soundbites from the cast and crew, interesting trivia tidbits and great behind-the-scenes footage.<br />The film itself is a joy. If you enjoyed the original DVD release, you'll be in heaven here.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When I first listened to this cd, I recall skimming through each song and enjoying the different guitar solos he plays.  Then one by one, I went through the songs and fell in love with each one.  John provides a &quot;Dave Matthews&quot; type voice with light guitar melodies and heart-felt lyrics.  This type of music reminds me of sitting in a coffeehouse, just relaxing and pondering while carefully relating my own experiences to the words. I think John will explode and become more and more popular with each single he puts out.  I now call him my favorite singer, and I recommend this cd to everyone.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Without a doubt, Wilco's &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is the best pop/rock album I've heard all year. Forget about the hype. Forget about the umpteen reviews calling it the best album of all time...this really is a very well-made, totally engrossing piece of work.<br />I don't even really know much else that Wilco has done. I've been vaguely familiar with their music for some time now. But by all accounts, this is a different Wilco from previous releases. Sure, there are similiarities. But they really went back to the drawing board for this one.<br />The main difference is the production. There's lots of strange effects, some static and dissonance, lots of experimental touches...but it always complements the music, never distracting the listener. The songs are not really all that unusual...it's the way they're arranged that sounds so incredible. &quot;I Am Trying to Break your Heart&quot; starts things off with lazy distortion and a haze of static. &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; is helped along with beautifully arranged strings. &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; would be just another nondescript alt-country single if it weren't for the seemingly out-of-place drum machine that barrels through the song. &quot;I'm the Man Who Loves You&quot; is a glorious, sloppy, horn-driven love song with lead guitar straight out of 70s-era Neil Young.<br />It's beautiful, messy, eloquent, harsh, and like nothing you've ever heard.
B00007AJGH|5.0|When WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT first came out, it was considered a technical milestone. Everyone put something on TV about it, the producers wanted to show you how the tricks were done.

B00006F7S4|4.0|This album has gotten quite a mixed reaction from my circle of friends. A lot of hard-core Beck fans were disappointed, which is odd because it resembles his earlier \\"Mutations\\" album in a lot of ways. If you like your Beck lazy and mellow, this is the one for you.<br />Beck's last album was \\"Midnite Vultures,\\" a crazy, infectious, booty-shaking stew of Prince-influenced funk. By comparison, \\"Sea Change\\" is probably the furthest he could get from that last work. This is slow, moody, acoustic...\\"sleepy\\" seems to be the most appropriate word I can think of. The results, in my opinion, are amazing.<br />Beck's funky side is definitely a lot of fun and I love him for it. But when his songs are stripped of the party sheen, his skills as a songwriter come out. And it's not just acoustic guitar and vocals. There are other instruments here. The steel guitar is great. His use of strings is really something, particularly the astonishing arrangement of \\"Paper Tiger.\\" My other favorite songs are \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine,\\" \\"The Golden Age\\" and \\"Lost Cause.\\"<br />\\"Midnite Vultures\\" is Beck's Saturday night party album. \\"Sea Change\\" is the cold, rainy Sunday morning one. And there's nothing wrong with that.
B00000K19E|2.0|Everyone thinks that this is the best movie ever made, but I think it is terribly over-rated, even for a sci-fi.  This is a movie for people, most likely high school kids, who just want to see something &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;awesome,&quot; caring only for action.  Parts of it are entertaining if I happen to be watching it (which is rare), but when I'm not watching it I feel like I'm missing nothing and have little desire to watch it.  It had some good special affects and martial arts scenes, but it lacked in story and character development.  There is virtually no originality to the storyline at all.  This movie almost directly ripped off Dark City, borrowed from Terminator, and any other movie relating to a nuclear war torn future and people being controlled.  All of the sudden a savior, some kid (Keanu Reeves), is going to save everyone.  Gimme a break..........  <BR>I wouldn't even recommend this movie for action.  There are movies with much more exciting, furious, and fast-paced action than this.  As I said before, this movie is only for people who want to see something &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;awesome.&quot;  I think this movie is only meant to be eye-popping action (for me it doesn't even succeed at that), but if you can see beyond that, there's not much else there; it is a very bland movie.  My advice, if you want to see a good sci-fi movie, watch Dark City, and if you want to see a good action movie, watch Face/Off.
B00006EXCC|5.0|All the Rolling Stones' Abkco albums (essentially their 60s-era catalog) have recently been reissued in what has to be one of the most welcome reissue projects of the digital age. The previous Abkco discs were pretty shoddy. Among the classic albums reissued are \\"Between the Buttons,\\" \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,\\" \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and \\"Aftermath,\\" which many people consider to be one of the Stones finest moments.<br />In my opinion, \\"Aftermath\\" and \\"Beggars Banquet\\" were the band's best sixties albums. Two versions of \\"Aftermath\\" were released -- one for the US and one for the UK -- with distinct differences. The UK version has three additional tracks, while the US only has one. Unfortunately, the track missing from the UK version is the seminal \\"Paint It, Black.\\" But since that track is available on countless compilations, I highly encourage you picking up the UK version. The three additional tracks are worth it.<br />This was a landmark album for the Stones. Their musical growith was evident in many ways. First of all, there are no cover songs. Although I enjoy the Stones covering classic blues and R&B songs, the songwriting prowess of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards is one of rock and roll's most enduring institutions. Another aspect of this album's importance is their willingness to go beyond rock and roll and even their blues roots by embracing unusual instrumentation and arrangements. The baroque \\"Lady Jane\\" is adorned with harpsichord. \\"Under my Thumb\\" contains marimba. Thanks to the relentlessly experimental Brian Jones, the band incorporated these sounds into \\"Aftermath\\" and helped change rock and roll.<br />There are so many songs here that are instantly recognizable classics, and others that deserve to be. Despite the sophmoric sexism in the lyrics, \\"Under My Thumb\\" is musically brilliant and undeniably catchy. The amazing \\"Out of Time\\" (one of the three UK-only tracks) also uses marimba and is a great companion to \\"Under My Thumb.\\" One of the Stones' most beautiful, underrated songs, \\"I Am Waiting,\\" is also here (fans of the film \\"Rushmore\\" will recognize that song, and since it's been inexplicably left off the soundtrack, this is a place where you can find it).<br />The Stones definitely took a big step forward with \\"Aftermath\\" without losing sight of their roots (although the one song on the album I can do without is the bluesy improvisational \\"Going Home,\\" which never seems to end).<br />Completists will likely want both versions of this album, but if you have to choose between the two, I highly recommend this one. Then you can get \\"Paint It, Black\\" from the \\"Hot Rocks\\" compilation.autiful, underrated songs, \\"I Am Waiting,\\" is also here (fans of the film \\"Rushmore\\" will recognize that song, and since it's been inexplicably left off the soundtrack, this is a place where you can find it). <br />The Stones definitely took a big step forward with \\"Aftermath\\" without losing sight of their roots (although the one song on the album I can do without is the bluesy improvisational \\"Going Home,\\" which never seems to end). <br />Completists will likely want both versions of this album, but if you have to choose between the two, I highly recommend this one.

B00006CXXU|3.0|Okay, let me say I'm not a Christina Aguilera fan. However, with all the reviews I was reading and the hype, I decided to buy 'Stripped.' Now, this is not going to be biased becuase I truly listened to the music and was not influenced by the fact that I'm not a fan.:) <BR>Basically, if your looking for anything from her last album, dont buy this one! They are totally different. 'Stripped' is much more mature, and definently more R&B-Pop. Another note: If you like fast, upbeat songs, again, this is not the CD for you. More than half of then half of them are ballads, or songs that sound like Alicia Keys.(By the way, the song with Alicia on it, 'Impossible' isnt that great.)<BR>The BEST TRACKS:<br />Beautiful- The best one out of the album! It's going to be her next single. It's not one of those, \\"i love you\\" songs, and actually has a meaning and is very catchy. <br />Fighter - Catchy, good song with a rock feeling to it. <br />Dirrty - Don't think about the video when your listening to it, and it's pretty good.<br />Keep Singin' My Song - Last track on the album, and a good ending. <br />I'm Okay - Sort of a little spooky, but really deep and makes you think of Chrisitna in a different way.

When i was in 6th grade and would do anything to blend in with the other kids that i thought were cool.

I mean, if you are so blind that you enjoy Limp Bizkit, you would be happy listening to anything. So, either keep your eyes closed while you submerge your head into your toilet to listen to your korn, your limp bizkit, your disturbed, ORRRRR, open your eyes, towel off your head, and start listening to real music.
6305657939|4.0|In a film quite reminiscing of the his James Bond adventures, Pierce Brosnan is back as both co-producer and starring role as Thomas Crown, a leader magnate in mergers and acquisitions of the modern day New York. Just because he &#147;likes it&#148; he happens to collect priceless works of art&#133; illegally. Enter super-sexy, beautifully chic and extra smart<br />Rene Russo, as the woman who will &#147;get him&#148;, in more ways than one.<br />&#147;The Thomas Crown affair&#148; is a re-make of the film of the same name that Steve McQueen starred in during the sixties. Not having seen that version, I have to admit this one in particular has all the style, glamour and cache of the high life everybody wants to follow but, sadly, not everybody gets. Pierce Brosnan is not a versatile actor, but roles like this, where he can display his slender persona and gallant ways, suit him as a tailored grey flannel ensemble done by the most excellent fashion expert. Speaking of fashion, his counterpart, Rene Russo, surprises and enchants in her Celine wardrobe and Bvlgari jewels. Russo certainly shows off as beautiful as ever and with all the quick wit and classy manners of a female James Bond.<br />No expense in this movie was spared, the rides in Crown&#146;s Jaguar, dinner at Ciprianni&#146;s (with no previous reservation), weekend away in the privacy of one&#146;s own villa in Martinique, windsurfing and more. We all know that the first purpose of the entertainment industry is, precisely, to entertain. What better to do that, than to slip &#147;The Thomas Crown affair&#148; into your VHS or DVD player and relax with a good glass of wine.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|We love it, we've watched it in the theater too, and the DVD lets us settle arguments - like, did the evil prince actually get to kiss the princess? Great fun; excellent quality; addictive music at the end - we're not quite baby boomers, and the tunes are just right - my wife threw out her back trying to dance to them!
6301543408|3.0|This was not the best Star Trek movie, and not even all that spectaular, but it was fun to watch and that's the bottom line, how enjoyable it is.  Despite the bad critisim, William Shatner worked the best he could with what he had. Furthermore, he is not even a career director like Nimoy and the others and you have to give Shatner credit for pulling this off.  This movie is a lesson.  It is a lesson that all is not what it seems.  Kirk against God?  I think not.  Kirk against a charleton, yes and the wisdom to recognise a dubious charlaton is an important message.  The Star Trek V film was a bit too jokey for my taste, but the light-heartedness of all the movies is what makes Star Treks 1-6 the best of all sci-fi(that's my opinion ).  III and IV are much more balanced with humor and seriousness.  Most of the setting is aboard the &quot;New&quot; and glitched Enterprise and takes place with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  You get a grand tour of the New Enterprise from bridge to basement and all the secret passages and jeffries tubes.  A virtual tour is enough to buy the movie.  But besides that, it does have a few moments like the outdoors scenes, campfire stories, and the battle before getting hyjaked.  Not to mention a cool pair of anti-grav boots for Spock.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Without mixing words, \\"Trouble in Shangri La\\" is lush - the lyric sheets, the photos, the production.  Everything is as rich and beautiful as Nicks' own lyrical style.  A lone Nicks heading toward an ephemeral sea graces the cover and sets the tone for an amazing collection of songs.<br />True, Nicks may be in her best for since &quot;Bella Donna,&quot; but this is by no means to suggest that this is &quot;Bella Donna II.&quot;  &quot;Trouble&quot; features a collection of poetic discourse that spans decades - you feel Stevie's journey in these songs.  Her distinctive voice, now much throatier than it was in the &quot;BD&quot; days, is a testament to her experience.  In short:  you believe her.<br />&quot;Trouble&quot; takes itself very seriously, and it should.  I liken this album to the great concept albums of the seventies.  Each song is really a piece of a much larger picture of a Shangri La splintering and crumbling, climaxing in a heartbroken Stevie Nicks, brought to her knees in a tearful goodbye on &quot;Love Is.&quot;  <br />Stevie Nicks has always written songs that are visual, but the imagery here is somehow stronger than it has been in the past.  The title track is an epic - Hollywood Babylon in nature.  There is a newfound bluntness in the undisguised &quot;That Made Me Stronger,&quot; where you can almost see Tom Petty defiantly sitting across the table from you.  &quot;I Miss You Now&quot; is frightening in its loneliness; it nears desperation in its apologetic desire to go back.  &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; encapsulates thirty years, but is not angry, despite its straightforward rocking, but rather explanatory.  <br />The aforementioned &quot;Love Is&quot; is perhaps the most visual of all Stevie Nicks songs.  It really does describe a scene - one in which a woman is left to deal with her own future.  Though the song proclaims the singer's happiness, it sounds as if she must convince herself of the same, but stops short of truly believing in it.  <br/>As the lyrics fade, and Nicks is left crying, the listener knows only too well that the paridisio of Shangri La is fleeting, and the world can crumble around you leaving only you and your strength to deal with what is left.  The lesson is strong, and you cannot help wishing that you could meet Nicks on the other side of that doorway to the sea that graces the cover just to ask:  &quot;Is it all true?&quot;
B00005U11Z|5.0|Excellent dvd.  All the songs are great.  I didn't realize Steve Perry wasn't on this, but Steve Augeri is even better!!! We watch this over and over. Can't say enough good things about this dvd.
B000001FI7|3.0|The Portishead sound is one of barebones electronica and fragile female vocals. Nothing here is particularly original, but the album has it's virtues. It's fairly solid, with few real weak points, and the melodies are memorable. Probably as a result of this, the record has enjoyed tremendous critical aclaim. The problem is that the lyrics, which are dark but somewhat forced, give a certain contrived vibe everything. Many men won't like it either, given that it was hard (for this male, anyway) to relate to the broken, feminine persona. I confess that there were moments on this album where I just wanted to shake Beth Gibbons until she stopped whining. What's more, there are bits of surprising simplicity where there doesn't seem to be much of anything going on. For fans used to busy electronica, this may seem to be a virtue. For those of us familiar with what AC/DC is able to do with a barebones rock song, it's third rate. This album is not that great, and not for everyone.

B00005UW9T|4.0|I mostly like the songs in this movie, but the movie as a whole is quite good. I still watch a lot of cartoon movies, disney etc. (being a 19 year old male, and still watching them disney cartoons- I'm just like a big kid). I do believe one or two of the songs where made by Aaliyah, and that is the main reason why I had to have this movie. Just collecting all of Aaliyah's movies and music, she is amazing. But like I was saying, this movie is really good if your still into the rated G movies or disney.
0375414053|5.0|As almost everyone knows by now, this book is a diary of Kate Reddy, who holds down a power job in London while trying to have a life.  The writing is magnificent: lots of little gems, some of which might get censored in an online review. Don't miss her description of hanging out in the kitchen with her inlaws at Christmas.<br />This book can be read on several levels. I must admit I was exhausted at first, just reading about Kate's efforts to juggle her life. Being single and childless, I can only admire the fortitude of working mothers who really do try to \\"do everything.\\" And I was disappointed in the ending, where Kate does seem to walk away from a part of herself.<br />I couldn't help wishing this couple would go to marriage counseling! Kate and her husband seem to have different values and her abrasiveness can be annoying, even to the reader who is rooting for her. Marriages like this one -- very strong wife, kind supportive husband -- ususally do not last without outside help.<br />I also wanted to encourage Kate to hire a coach to help her set priorities and develop somem assertiveness. Her friend and colleague at work, Candy, even teases her about being too quick to say yes and to accept tough jobs with no compensation.  When Kate says, \\"Nobody got bonuses,\\" Candy says, \\"And you believe that?\\" Either Candy is a saboteur rather than a true friend, or Kate has contributed to her own powerlessness.<br />While some women (and men) will be appalled at the crudity of Kate's boss, I think the author is just being realistic. The securities industry was always known for its machismo, as described in Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker.  A senior woman like Kate will have less access to legalistic harassment remedies than a clerk-typist -- and Kate makes this point herself. She has to choose:  a job or a lawsuit. The fact that her boss is an Australian adds to the realism: the author understands the male-female dynamic of \\"down under.\\"<br />Even if you get frustrated, it will be hard to stop turning the pages. There is suspense created by the author (\\"How will Kate get out of this mess?\\") but, more important, the underlying theme: How much of Kate's stress is created by her dual roles -- and how much by her own assertiveness and coping skills?will be hard to stop turning the pages.

B00006LLNU|5.0|As many reviewers have expressed here, at first I was just a bit disappointed with ( ).  It didn&#146;t seem like they had moved forward.  More of the same, I thought.<br />However, after listening to this album many, many times it has started to reveal itself as a MONUMENTAL work.  <br />Why?  <br />While Agaetis Byrjun was a spectacular album, it seemed like a collection of good songs.  On ( ), SR has created an album that is more coherent and works better as a whole, including a perfectly placed 30 second pause.  <br />I now think of it as one piece that picks up more and more tension until it literally explodes on the last track.  The catharsis that happens on the end is only augmented by how slowly the album starts.  Once you know the structure of the album, it is hard not to feel a higher sense of tension as you are slowly moving towards higher and higher climaxes.  <br />It&#146;s like .... tantric sex.<br />I was able to see them live recently, and the songs pickup even more drama revealing themselves as &#147;epics&#148; with very precise structures.  I was blown away!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Shrek tries desperately to be funny, in a Disney's Aladdin sort of way.  And, sometimes, it is.  Amazingly, as Disney's movies descend further and further into mediocrity, and as digitally animated films like Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. deliver mildly amusing kiddy jokes, Shrek seems almost witty by comparison.  The trouble is, however, that there are more witty insights and genuinely intellectual humor in a single episode of the Simpsons than in all of Shrek.  It's fairly easy to see why.  Shrek has the look and feel of an edgy film made by a committee of bankers.  Again, there are clever moments here, but nothing great.  It's simply too bad that this represents perhaps the best animated film in years.  That's the state of the art, unfortunately.<br />Mike Myer's voice characterization is bland and unremarkable ...  One can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to have Chris Farley voice the lovable green lump.  Chris died, of course, before he could complete his work.  Eddie Murphy is similarly forgettable.<br />Finally, the \\"inside\\" Disney jokes are okay, but just that.  Put some bright teenagers to work and they could come up with stuff that is much funnier.  I've seen it happen, in fact.<br />I'm not disappointed I watched this.  It's pretty good.  And it gives some hope after seeing awful movies like Ice Age.
6303346367|5.0|This breathtaking story of a man who sees an agent murdered and is chased by the police was one of Hitchcok's best movies, and I must say that it was such a good movie with no language and  very little violence that it could be almost perfect for kids 10 or older.  <br />And as the story goes on, it gets more interesting and eventually seems funny.  When Donat and Caroll are cuffed together, they seem to keep their wits up, and are really good at keeping secrets and staying safe.  In the end, they really appreciate it.  <br />So, I hope you have the chance to watch this wonderful movie, because it is one of Hitchcock's best.

B00005JK8K|1.0|I bought the VHS Copy of this movie. We were very disappointed with the theme as every war detail was too graphic, gory scenes. There was just too little information about the Indians that were the windtalkers. They needed to give more information about them and not all the war scenes.  The acting was superb however as far as the characters involved.
0156013983|5.0|I want to read this book over and over. The story is simple and thought provoking. The story is about friendship, imagination and curiosity. Its also about being a child in a world of &quot;les grandes personnes&quot;.<br />The language is fairly straight forward, though very descriptive. Its a thoroughly heart warming story.
B000069I1H|4.0|Y'gotta watch this movie. Very cool and funny. Hardly any bad language. Murphy &amp; De Niro rock!
0316518565|2.0|The author appears to be one of the most character-challenged individuals of all-time, a major piece of work.  By accumulating incredible unauthorized trading losses of around one billion dollars, he single-handedly brought down one of the oldest banking institutions in England, and left countless people without jobs and investments worth millions.  What is absolutely amazing is the fact that while he never denies the fraud he committed, throughout the book he seems intent on blaming his superiors for their inability to discover his losses.  While it is true that his superiors were so enamored of the fictitious gains his unit was reporting that they didn't want to ask hard questions, it is Mr. Leeson who is responsible for the wreckage.  He never expresses any remorse whatsoever for the damage he inflicted.  He was greatly perturbed because he couldn't serve his prison sentence in England, instead being returned to Singapore.<br />Without the proper education or pedigree, Leeson somehow managed to be promoted from a settlement clerk to running the Barings Singapore futures operation.  Apparently his idea of having fun is to get plastered and moon some flight attendants in a bar, for which he was arrested by the Singapore authorities.  Certainly he knew how strict laws are in Singapore, and he could have served a year in jail.  It seems back in England, he hung out at pubs with friends who would unzip their pants and place their private members in the hands of unsuspecting females.<br />The book is of some interest to traders, because Leeson commits every cardinal sin in trading.  He had no business ever setting foot near a trading floor.  His biggest error was his complete inability to cut his losses, the most fundamental requirement for successful trading.  He averages down or \\"doubles up\\" his positions when they are moving against him, another critical mistake.  He constantly \\"hopes\\" the market will move back in his direction, and attempts to move the entire market by taking huge positions.  While it is possible to move a market temporarily if one is trading large enough positions, the market will always continue on its established trend.  The author continually engages in this futile strategy, at one point losing 60 million dollars in one day trying to change the direction of the market.<br />Finally, the book is not a terribly interesting read, in that a significant portion of it is repetitious detailing of how he conceals his mounting losses to his superiors through the use of \\"creative accounting\\".  Perhaps that is why the book is now out of print.  The one thing that he does care about is his wife, who at the time of publication of the book was still standing by him.  If she has any good sense, she would drop him like a bad habit.
0783230710|5.0|Edge-of-your-seat-for-the-whole-two-hours type movie. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Just watch it. Now.
B00004Y6TQ|3.0|Actually I was a little bit dissapointed when I purchased this CD in the USA (instead of waiting for 2 months and getting it at home in Russia for half price). The movie &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; itself produced great impression on me, as most of Fon Trier's films did in their time, especially by music and songs by Bjork. The CD &quot;Selmasongs&quot; is not a soundtrack to the movie - do not let the cover fool you. The music is the same, but the lyrics is different and performed in a different way. I know that Bjork had a lot of fights with the director over the songs, and finally she had her own way with this album. Unfortunatelly....
0062502182|5.0|Intensely gripping and inspiring, this fable like Jay Singh's The Butterfly or Spencer Johnson's Who Moved My Cheese, will make you want to take a step back and reflect on your life. It will make you ask yourself the essential question: Am I who I want to be? Or am I living my life for others? Coelho's protagonist will keep you reading till the end. The book has, without a doubt, expanded my understanding of life vastly. Buy this book! It will change your life.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this CD yesterday after hearing \\"Don't Know why\\" & \\"Come Away With me\\" for a couple of weeks on the local jazz station here in St. Louis.  Norah Jones, is just amazing and she has a very unique sound which separates her from all of the rest.  I am a big fan and cannot wait to see her in concert.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This cd offers a diversity of rap.  As always eminem lives up to his name and raps better than before.  There are only 2 songs that I dont listen to because they are not rap songs, but they have pretty good lyrics and mean a lot.  Everyone should buy this cd who is an eminem fan or just a rap fan.
B000056NX4|5.0|The new version on JCSS is absolutely fantastic. Glenn Carter is an absolute shoe-in for the role, along with the other actors. <BR>I always find myself crying or in awe at the end of this video. All of the performances and effects are extremely well done and the sound quality is at its best.<br />If you love Andrew Lloyd Webber [as much as I do], then this MUST be in your collection. If you've never heard of him before: buy it anyway! Don't let the title throw you. You don't have to be a religious person to enjoy this. The music will move you no matter what genre you enjoy.<br />...
0316666343|2.0|Everyone was gushing about this book so I read it to see what the fuss was about. i have to say the idea of a murdered girl narrating from her own desired idea of heaven is an interesting one, however there are major frustrations when we read about those left on earth. Susie's sister Lindsey seems to mature far faster than is normal (losing her virginity at 14?). Also Mr. Harvey \\"gets away with it\\". Though he ends up dying in a freak accident, nobody in Susie's family knows. We're left with no closure at all.
B000066F6H|5.0|First off: The fact a kid witht he name &quot;Fred Durst's Numba One Fan&quot; ripped this cd is hilarious.<br />First off, this isn't the super punk album that Barely Legal was. This is a little bit more garage. Lets put it this way; just about every Hives song can be compared to Get Free (Vines) or Territorial Pissings. (Nirvana). Thats the kind of music on this record. Its great. You don't buy, you're missing out.
B00006LI4S|5.0|...into a whole new kind of performance style.<br />It was like the best of dreams, and I can say with full honesty that of all of the concerts I have seen Pink Floyd members give, this one heads my lists of the kind I would like to be in the audience for.<br />I could see how happy everyone was, at that concert...there was a clear electricity in the air. To me, that can make or break a concert--whether the artists are *feeling* their work. It was very clear to me how much everyone was enjoying what they were doing. That's very important to me. I think there is something special about a smaller venue. I liked how the DVD showed comments to the audience, to emphasize that connection.<br />Mr. Gilmour was enjoying himself greatly.  I think his audience comments show that, in addition to the playing itself (which is definitely a product of passion). And his voice was excellent. This really showed on &quot;Je Crois Entendre Encore&quot;.  There are two other individuals who deserve to be mentioned in this respect. One is Bob Geldof. I couldn't help but smile at his enthusiasm...note that funny dance at one point! All smiles...it's infectious!  Plus, his singing wasn't too bad, either.<br />And, of course, there is Mr. Wright. Someone told me, right after attending the concert in person, that he had *never* seemed so happy as he did then. It was obvious to me he felt wonderful performing &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, and I'm sure the audience's very warm reception helped out. He was so animated it was an absolute joy to watch. I think the band responded to him; that song was so full of passion from all who performed it--and I'm sure this has something to do with the lead singer (same kind of effect that makes the difference between the two Comfortably Numb's). I noted on the lyrics that come with the DVD, that the lyric change Mr. Wright made is official. &quot;You feel alive, your heart untied, and loved forevermore.&quot; I think, personally, that it suits the soaring nature of this version...perhaps &quot;beatified&quot; was appropriate for the languid voice of Sinead O'Connor, but not for the passionate singing of Rick Wright--that was so *alive* that I can't think of any better word choice for that moment.<br />As if I had not already loved that album, based on this I would LOVE to see the whole of Rick Wright's Broken China performed in a similar sized venue--obviously it will need a little more on the technical side (and perhaps a bit more visually, given that the story does lend itself nicely to that), but I would think there'd be a way to keep it a small and intimate performance. Would be very nice. :-)<br />I very much liked the new arrangements. In my opinion, the highlights were: Coming Back to Life, High Hopes, Comfortably Numb with Mr. Geldof, the second part of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Smile, and Je Croix Entendre Encore. And, of course, the absolutely impeccable Breakthrough.  I cannot explain it--to me, High Hopes became even more than the studio album or PULSE! That does not mean any version of that song is bad at all--in fact there is no bad version of it. I really do love the sound of the choir there and in Coming Back to Life (which takes a very cool gospel feel to it, and having sung in a similar choir myself, I really enjoyed it).That second part of SOYCD...that's just phenomenal, almost savage in the way it roars to life.<br />&quot;Smile&quot;...I am very happy for the inclusion of lyrics. That's such a neat, simple song, and I hope its folksy simplicity is preserved going into the studio, because that's what I love so much about it. That's the kind of song that can get stuck in your head for days--and you do not wish to chase it out! ;-) <br />Only a few &quot;quibbles&quot; to mention, and one of these is minor. One, on WYWH, I could hardly hear Mr. Gilmour's voice during the part where he sings with the guitar; that could perhaps have been mixed a bit louder.  The second...I'm afraid I will be skipping the first Comfortably Numb with Robert Wyatt; I didn't care for the singing, and I don't think the musicians responded to him nearly as well as they did to Mr. Geldof, so this version lacked the energy the second one did. <br /> <br /> <br />I wished the audience, during the first SOYCD, would've been quieter--that honestly struck me as rude, yelling out as often as they did. At one point, when the audience got loud, I saw Mr. Gilmour smile at their antics...but I'm sure it was also very frustrating. :-( So please note that, all you future concert goers...this doesn't mean to not show enthusiasm, but I think there are appropriate times for it. An example of good audience behavior would be &quot;Breakthrough&quot;. Wild applause at the beginning, of course, which I am sure was much appreciated. Except for one yell as the music got started, they're pretty quiet during the song, which I think is the respectful thing to do.<br />Here are a few non performance-related things that were interesting. I can't explain it exactly, but the colors on the stage are absolutely striking, and definitely inspired the menu art. Someone did a fantastic job with the lighting at RFH. I also thought the sound clips as you navigate the menus are just unearthly...very neat mixes and distortions. <br />This is definitely a good DVD, all around, even with my &quot;quibbles&quot;--I was definitely not disappointed...FAR from it! Hats off to Mr. Gilmour and Company for this excellent production!
0345448898|5.0|I've read and loved all the Harry Potter books, and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, and I have to say, Pullman surpasses them all. With effortless grace and an amazing imagination, Pullman essentially re-tells the story of the fall of man through the characters of two utterly real, conflicted and all too human children, Lyra and Will.  They are pitted against dark forces, but are given some astonishing helpmates and tools with which to fight a battle for nothing less than the souls of all humanity. Assisted by Daemons and Angels, Lyra and Will seek the answer to a puzzling mystery - what is \\"Dust\\", and why is it spilling out of the universe?  Pursued by some very determined and evil adults, Lyra and Will meet armored bears, flying explorers, and witches in their travels through parallel worlds to find the answer and elude their persecutors. Dark, richly imagined, occasionally terrifying, Pullman is a breathtaking storyteller.  Young adults will love the fantastic creatures and situations Lyra and Will must surmount, and adults will get a kick out of references to Milton's Paradise Lost, and Dante's Divine Comedy.  Young or old, this is a brilliant series of books best read in one juicy gulp.
0440237688|1.0|This book is not for everyone.  My child had nightmares after reading chapter 19 which I would easily rate R for graphic detailed violence.  For parents who take their responsibility of monitoring the material their children are exposed to, be sure ahead of time that your child will not be emotionally upset by the \\"how - to\\" description of the actions.  In my opinion, there are no redeeming qualities to this book.  My child could not evaluate anything to do with the book because she was obsessed with the murder of an innocent new-born baby.  While other people may say that it's not real, the subject of euthanasia is real.  I would never recommend this book, however, I would caution parents, and teachers alike to evaluate the person for whom the book is being selected and determine if he/she will be negatively affected by it ahead of time.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD is loungy and trippy at the same time while maintaining a peaceful and relaxing characteristic. I don't doubt that Dido's voice sounds smooth and rich like Sarah McLachlan's voice, but I do enjoy her lyrics better. I find Dido's CD easier to listen to than some of McLachlan's that my mother owns. Reason being-I found McLachlan's lyrics depressing and somber. <BR>After reading many of other reviews, many will disagree-being on the opposite spectrum, but this is how I truly feel listening to it.<BR>Ms McLachlan has been around longer and Dido is fairly new, but I believe she deserves credit for this enjoyable CD.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|It was originally released in May 1982, but Duran Duran's second album, \\"Rio,\\" didn't catch fire on these American shores until a year later, thanks to the breakthrough single and video \\"Hungry Like the Wolf.\\"  It was perfect timing for the British group: the year was 1983, during which MTV culture was taking shape and revolutionized the way we listen to music.  That, coupled with the group's stylishly produced videos and new romantic-inspired pop, helped make Duran Duran such an important staple in 1980s music.  Here, virtually none of the 80s cheese you find from trendier groups appears on this CD.  There's the dynamic title track (replete with a sax solo from Andy Hamilton), the seductive \\"The Chauffer,\\" the uptempo rocker \\"Hold Back the Rain,\\" and the funkified \\"My Own Way\\" (which differs from the original mix on the 1981 single).  \\"Rio\\" is one of the first LPs I ever purchased (I still have the original vinyl), and it gives me great teenage memories.  On its own merits, the record really deserves 4 stars, but it gets an extra one for its sentimental value.  (By the way, this remastered version is the original pressing of \\"Rio\\" that was released overseas, and not the remixed version that was once available in America.)
630196697X|5.0|A rough and brutal melodrama set against the backdrop of New York's seedy underworld which delves into the secret workings of federal agents and Communist spies.  Widmark plays the petty crook, the proverbial three-time loser, whose actions are motivated solely by greed.  When he lifts a wallet from the purse of Jean Peters, he gets himself into deeper trouble than he could ever imagine...A truly provocative film, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET was originally a simple story about drug pushers.  Originally cast in the Peters role was Betty Grable(!).  Shelley Winters was also considered (a much better choice).  This film is quite complex with some intricate depth: miles beyond a mere anti-Communism film - this was filmed during the infamous McCarthy era - it unfortunately is viewed as such by many.  Thelma Ritter steals the show as the seedy but much-loved Moe.  The viewer is captivated by her natural acting technique: when she dies by Kiley's wicked hand while listening to the phonograph, the viewer is spellbound.  Ritter won an Oscar nomination for her outstanding work.
B0000542D2|5.0|With their unbelievable wit and talent, the Beatles have made \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" their best movie ever. When I first watched it, I didn't notice some of the \\"hidden\\" things in the movie. The special features pointed them out, without it, I would never have noticed. I watch the movie whenever I can, about twice a week. I could never get bored of it. It's truly the best movie ever.
6302878527|5.0|Although some may find this delightful 1967 British film more than a little dated, it holds a special place in many hearts including mine.  In the opening, Finney and Hepburn are driving in their Mercedes-Benz from England to the French Riviera.  He's an architect, and they're driving to the home of Maurice Dalbret, the Frenchman who gave successful Finney his start.  During the road trip, its obvious the marriage is headed for trouble.  Flash Back time.  Twelve years ago, Finney is a back-packing student looking at buildings and Audrey is among a bevy of female music students going to a festival.  The happy times, the trials and tribulations and the whole gist of the film will appeal to many but not to others. (oh, well).  I like it.  Some felt that Hepburn was too old (7 years, to be exact) for Finney, but this is hardly a problem (wasn't Lucy older than Desi?).  The usually fastidious Hepburn was dressed by Mary Quant, Paco Rabannne &amp; Ken Scott: she even wears blue jeans!  The stunning location scenes where filmed on location: St. Tropez, Paris, Nice and Beauallon. *If the viewer is or knows a true Sag, they know what I meant by the heading: I was born 5 December: at 42, it remains my passion to travel!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Deep and emotional, made for people that really cares about music , if you are a fan of good music , beautifuly crafted<BR>and played with passion then you must check out as well the new CD from Peter Gabriel Up, and Tempano , The agony and the ecstasy , inteligent music, yes, different from Sigur Ros but worth having .
0060245867|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was 2 years old. He is now 12, and insists upon keeping it to share with HIS OWN child, someday -- that's how much he enjoyed this book, which we read over, and over, and OVER, when he was young. Although he's obviously way beyond that reading level now, he still pulls it off the shelf occasionally for a chuckle, and the adorable stuffed mouse, with the silly grin and the cookie in his hand, which accompanied the book, still has a place of honor on my son's dresser.  I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone who wants to have some genuine, giggly fun, reading with his/her young child.
0394873742|5.0|This is the greatest book! I have taught 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade and have always had this book in my classroom. It is great for vocabulary building and just a fun way to get kids interested in books. My students of all ages gave it lots of wear, and it is still in good shape for my son to enjoy. He is now 18 months and ever since he was about 9 months has loved to sit on it and pat the pictures and now he is starting to name different things. It's really unique because of it's giant size (about 1.5'X2') and thick cardboard pages. I think it is well worth the price for the amout of enjoyment and wear you will get out of it! What a great gift too.
0380788624|5.0|'Cryptonomicon' is a novel about cryptography. Sounds kinda boring right? This book is as far from boring as you can possibly get. It jumps back and forth between the present and the past - dealing with World War II and codes such as the enigma code/machine, and with modern cryptography and data protection issues. It takes these technical aspects and throws in adventure taking place on pratically every continent, likeable and interesting characters, and an excellent ending.<br />These ingredients make this book hard to put down once you start reading it. Stephenson has perfected the technology-based adventure novel genre that Crichton started. If you like Crichton, and haven't read Stephenson yet, start reading this book today - you're missing out. Even though this book is a lot longer than your everyday novel, you still want more of it to read.
0151008116|5.0|How anyone could not be utterly enchanted by this book is beyond me!  I can't remember reading a better book. And I read a lot of current, mainstream fiction (no puns intended). I remember thinking how disappointed I'd be when I finished the book, because the every sentence was such a joy to read.<br />It's clear that this book stands on it's own singluar merits.<br />I won't take up too much time by analyzing writing style, plot, characters, etc. (long reviews are boring, don't you think?). Only that, as with Pi's blended days on the vast Pacific, author Yann Martel's prose hooks you from one alluring sentence and chapter to the next. I didn't think Yann Martel could fulfill this part, but he did. The book's ending accomplished what it promised the reader: it could make you believe in God [regardless of whether one does or doesn't].
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is told through the eyes of an 8 year-old Southern girl from Maycomb, Alabama; Scout Finch.  The story begins one summer in the 1930s with Scout and her brother, Jem, leading a normal childhood full of play, mischief and wonderment over their mysterious and scary next door neighbor Boo Radley.  The children have never seen Boo Radley but have heard stories and rumors of his life of solitude locked up in his large, dark and scary house on the corner.  This is also the summer that Dill comes into the children's lives.  To amuse themselves, Scout, Jem and Dill put on plays to mimic what they think Boo's life is like and try to entice Boo to come outside so they can see him.  These chapters are full of child's play, innocence and fun.<br />Meanwhile, during the children's innocent play, the racism and violence in this small southern town is brewing because a black man, Tom Robinson, has been accused of raping a white woman.  This tragedy seeps into the chilren's innocence when thier father, Atticus, is appointed to represent Tom Robinson.<br />Harper Lee's description of the Tom Robison's trial are riveting, nail-biting and very exciting.<br />There are many sub-plots along the way and the author does a wonderful job of tying them to all together for the novel's rising climax and ending.<br />To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent look into the racial injustice that played a major part in America's history.  Harper Lee's narrative through the eyes of an innocent 8 year old little girl is a masterpiece.  The novel is full of valuable lessons to be learned and passed on to our own children.
B00006690H|5.0|Ok. This was my first Eminem album, and it's edited. But, they do NOT sensor the d-word, which, can or can not be good.<br />Curtains Up: A nice begining, it's Em walking up the the mic and saying \\"Ahem...\\"<br />White America: Then the CD goes straight here and you hear AMERICA!! It's an ok beginning, but not a favorite.<br />Business: Ok, this IS a fav. It's basically Em and Dre and the fight against bad rappers.<br />Cleaning Out My Closet: Another fav, its kinda depressing. It's about Em and his mother.<br />Square Dance: Disturbing. It's hick-like with Em saying I'm back, nothing to stop that. At the end there is camo appearances by artists like Busta Rhymes.<br />The Kiss: Basically how Marshall got arrested. It leads nicely to...<br />Solder: This is about how everyone is against Em, but he moves on still.<br />Say Goodbye To Hollywood: Another intense track, it's about how Slim might need to take a rest from rap.<br />Drips: This is not on the clean version, otherwise the whole song would be [bleep]kinda thing.<br />Without Me: My fav, its great fun to listen to. He rambles from Moby to Dick Cheney.<br />Paul Rosenburg: It's just voicemail about how Em should not carry his gun around.<br />Sing For The Moment: This is an Aerosmith song, I'm not sure on what it's about.<br />Superman: It's Eminem saying I'm staying single, so don't try.<br />Hailie's Song: My other favorite, it's a song where he actually SINGS!! It's a song to his daughter, and it hits you in the heart with something other than a bullet.<br />Steve Berman: The head of Interscore records getting shot by You-Know-Who after he doesn't like his album. My least fav, its too depressing.<br />When the Music Stops: Em+D12=W.T.M.S. I don't like it, its not happy and perky like some others.<br />Say What You Say: My least favorite song, it's just Shady and Dre rapping about a lot. <br />'Till I Collapse: Nate Dogg is in this one, and it's got a great beat. Em is talking about he'll rap 'till he collapses, which makes no sence with Say Goodbye To Hollywood.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy: One of my fav's, a song that cracks you up<BR>featuring his kid.<br />Curtains Close: Pretty funny if you listen, a disgruntled janitor tries to sing Without Me. Oh, no! We're done!
B00005JKG9|3.0|I have been waiting for Glengarry Glen Ross since I first purchased my DVD player several years ago.  This film is easily in my all time top 10.  When I heard it was going to be a 2 disc special edition, I figured it would be worth the wait.  I managed to get my hands on a copy early and to be honest it is a let down.  The widescreen transfer is beautiful but this has to be one of the most empty 2-disc SE's around.  The most disappointing missing feature is the commentary that Jack Lemmon did for the SE laserdisc.  What better way to preserve his legacy than to include his comments about arguably his finest film performance?  Instead, you get a Jack Lemmon \\"tribute\\" feature with interviews from his son, Peter Gallagher, and other folks who are mildly ammusing.  Another feature is \\"New Cast Interviews\\" which is simply Alan Arkin and Alec Baldwin (separately) doing commentary over scenes from the movie.  No Pacino, no Ed Harris, no Spacey.  They have included a nice Charlie Rose show clip with Lemmon and a very short Spacey clip from \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\".  Then you get a non-Glengarry related feature on salesman.  Why?  You do get a new commentary from the director which is nice, but this was an actor's movie first and foremost.  Why Artisan took several years to finally release this on DVD is quite frankly hard to understand with what has been delivered.  Mitch and Murray would be very upset with Aristan's effort here.  Long live the Machine!
B000062TU1|5.0|While many people complain that the movie version of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" followed the book too closely, I think that its faithfulness to the text gives credit to Rowling's genius.  I read the book, so while the plot didn't surprise me the special effects and superb acting did.  The book came to life.  The casting was excellent - the chemistry between Hermione, Harry, and Ron was magical, and every character was believable.  The actor who plays Harry Potter was both a child and an \\"old soul,\\" which brings depth to his character.  I was impressed with many of scenes, such as those with the Sorting Hat, the quidditch game, and the big chess game.<br />A delight to watch!
0385495323|4.0|I read this book after reading 'Cryptonomicon' by Neal Stephenson, which is a fictional novel that also deals with secret codes and cryptography (and is an excellent read by the way). I wanted to know more about the subject of cryptography, so I tried this book out. It a very good introduction to the subject. It simplied the concepts enough so that they were easy to understand. Another good feature of this book, is that it wasn't all technical - there are historical aspects of secret codes and how those codes were broken.<br />Simon Singh has done an excellent job of taking a complex subject, and making it an enjoyable read. If you're a curious mind who enjoys understanding how things work, read this book.
B000063DIR|1.0|Ozzy must have had one too many beers when he thought up this one. So what if you owe Kerslake and Daisley royalties, that doesn't mean that it's required to re-release one of your best albums(much less ruin it along with Randy's phenominal guitar work)! Just make some more copies of the 1995 remaster, and leave it alone. It's hard to find the previous Ozzy remasters from seven years ago anyway, now I'll have an even harder time trying to find a copy with this on the shelves. This is an utterly disgusting way to try to make more cash, especially when you already have enough money to wipe yourself with. And in my opinion Ozzy really doesn't deserve all that money. He never was much of a singer, and I can bet he didn't write half of his material. The majority of the talent was in the rest of the band no matter what lineup, and this was the best lineup Ozzy had, and now, thanks to Ozzy and Sharon, this masterpiece will never be the same. Thanks a lot!
B000001Y2U|5.0|... .<br />As far as the album...It is very NIN style. If you like Trent, you will like this album. It has an industrial sound. More hardcore than Mechanical Animals. I love it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love it, love it, love it! I'll admit to always having been a *slight* fan of Christina Aguilera, but was still surprised when I bought it the other night. I have not regretted it for one second, it's by far the best CD I've purchased in quite a while. I keep playing it over and over again, Infatuation is my favourite, play it loud and play it often.
0060392886|5.0|This is the one book that I could not put down. Some of the stories can be a bit outrageous but it made for fun reading. I had the same dream Motley did. They had made it to the big times and their book gave me a taste of what it would be like.
B000002JB8|5.0|If you want to relax on a hot summer day this work will put you in a cooler, mellower world. As the CD jacket may indicate, it sort of reminded me of escapist music from friendlier times; sort of a modern day 30's aquatic musical soundtrack. It is not quite so refreshing on a cold sloppy winter day, but still mood setting. If you want to really chill this will get you there.
0596000480|5.0|I found it a very useful tool and an interesting reading. I've been using it to learn the basic principles of the language, the advanced programming techniques and then as unerring language reference.
B00003CX5A|4.0|This film is full of beutiful detail, from a twisted gothic horror village and demonic faces in the fire. It's creepy, horrible and funny, Depp portrays a clever, if wet, hero, with Ricci's lovely, if mildy irritating heroin. A star lost however, as some of the 'bodies' getting hefted about can look a little unrealistic. Don't watch before walking in dark isolated woods.
B00006LLLN|5.0|What an incredible collection by one of the best ensembles around (bluegrass or otherwise).  Alison Krauss proves once again that she is one of the finest vocalists in the world.  Just listen to her rip it up on \\"Oh Atlanta\\".  And the vocal harmonies on the tracks \\"Ghost in this House\\", and the beautiful \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" will send a shiver down your spine and put a tear in your eye.  Just incredible.<br />Standout tracks include Dan Tyminski's outstanding take on the traditional \\"The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn\\" with an amazing guitar intro, and the haunting \\"Maybe\\" with one of Alison's finest performances.  And thank god for Jerry Douglas, who really is the best dobro player in the world.  The band is on fire on the two Douglas-penned instrumentals \\"Choctaw Hayride\\" and \\"We Hide & Seek\\".  They deserve a much wider listening audience and this CD proves it.  Just go get it today!
B00000G3PA|1.0|This is absolutely the worst movie ever.  The plot is not only ridiculous and far-fetched, but it tries to be serious in some parts.  If a movie is going to be ridiculous it should at least be funny.  Anyone associated with this movie should want to hide from the world forever, and be disgraced that they sunk to new lows in movie making.
B000002OHF|2.0|Like many people, I was introduced to WA by the incredible \\"Argus\\" album, so I was eager to see how they would follow it up. Unfortunately, \\"Wishbone 4\\" only disappoints in comparison. In addition to the band's incredible musicianship, the strongest point of \\"Argus\\" was the songwriting; unfortunately, the material here just isn't up to par, in fact, most of the album is pretty pedestrian generic 70's guitar boogie. While \\"Ballad of the Beacon\\" and \\"Everybody Needs a Friend\\" are first-rate, most of the songs here are throw-aways: \\"Doctor\\" and \\"No Easy Road\\" sound like Humble Pie rejects, \\"Sorrel\\" tries to evoke an \\"Argus\\"-style vibe in its imagery but fails due to an uninspired melody and indifferent performance, and \\"So Many Things to Say\\" (the worst offender) sounds like it was recorded on a cheap cassette deck in someone's garage. If you really love \\"Argus\\", this might still be worth a purchase for \\"Ballad...\\" and \\"Everybody...\\", but otherwise it's pretty slim pickings.
0345448898|5.0|This is the closest thing to a \\"Rowling meets Tolkien\\" epic I have found. Pullman takes us on a thrilling ride, seen through the eyes and world(s) of young Lyra. Her quest to find out the truth about her parents and to help her father quickly turns into a life-and-death encounter with countless \\"baddies\\" and many new friends. Her far-reaching adventures are sure to please readers fascinated by intertwined worlds, witches, magical gadgets, pseudo-science, and retro-tech visions of zeppeliners in combat with talking bears. Pullman's concept of daemons - basically souls incarnate as animal companions - is brilliantly executed and plays a central role in the story.<br />But thankfully, Pullman wants to do more than just entertain with some fancy antics in a fantasy world. The underlying plot is about budding adolescense and the ensuing loss of innonence (and beginning of responsibility), the fundamental conflicts between good and evil, faith and facts, sin and free will, and as he moves towards the conclusion of the trilogy, Pullmans's rooting in classic english literature as well as his courageous ambition to make a controversial point becomes clear. The series quite successfully raises questions about authority, power and destiny, and the fact that the story sheds light on the hypocrisy and dubious morals of the church and questions the value of dogmatic religion may well rattle some parents and unprepared readers alike.<br />Beware, people get maimed and die, children are orphaned and scared, the good turn out bad and it's all quite a bit more realistic (for want of a better word) and nuanced than in the world of Harry Potter. On the other hand, there is less of Tolkien's (in some people's opinion) long-winded poetry, and the resulting balance is sure to please many.
0930289331|5.0|This comic book ranked #3 in Wizard Magazine's top 40 comic books of all time, and if you read it you'll understand why. A rookie Batman making mistakes and learning from them, and a &quot;young&quot; James Gordon stealing the show in his own way, this is a must own.
B00003CXXM|1.0|...  I was anxious for this to end very early into the movie.  It was not that entertaining at all.  If you want a good movie for 2002, check out Signs.  It'll keep you on the edge of your seat.  This movie will just make you want to leave your seat!
B00005JKCH|5.0|this was the first good movie of the year. Star Wars beat it barely simply because Yoda got to fight, but this film is definately worth the money. It has great acting, the effects (although impressive) needed a little work, and it could have been longer, but other than that this film is gold. A solid 4.5! I can't wait until Spider-Man II! Buy this and Star Wars Episode II and have a wonderful movie night this weekend.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Okay, it's true.  I do believe that Lucas has lost a bit of his edge, but you can see that even in Return of the Jedi.  Really I would normally have given this movie three stars, but in this case this movie is tied into a wonderful series, so though it wouldn't hold up alone being part of the series brings it up.  <br />Yes, Jar Jar is annoying.  No this movie doesn't have the darker edge that made the original Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back so good.  The major fault with this story, though, is that the characters aren't as enduring.  There is no character as edgy as Han Solo.  Anakin is cute, but you never doubt that he will pull off what needs to be done like you may have sometimes doubted the whiney Luke.  Amadala does a good job, but doesn't have the snap back fiery wit of Leia, or her love-hate relationship like Leia did with Han.  R2D2 is great and shows his heroic side, but we only got a short taste of the interplay between the heroic R2D2 and his cowardly counterpart C3PO.<br />So, obviously the movie has its faults, but it does succeed where it is important.  In the end it is a thoroughly entertaining space opera.  Isn't that what Lucas's goal was originally when making Star Wars?  Perhaps this movie alone is no classic, but it is part of a series that is.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore is jut brilliant. If you like good reading, good literature and love plot twists, then read this book. This book is ranked as the best comic of all time, and can do nothing less than agree.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I was a bit unsure about buying this DVD package since Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg produced the series (and since Saving Private Ryan was such a poor movie).  However, I was really surprised.  Band of Brothers is done really well.  The story is well presented, the characters are great and you really see them develop and you become attached to them as the series goes along.  This is by far one of the best world war 2 movies/series I've ever seen (second only to The Thin Red Line).  Definitely worth the money, considering you get 6 DVD's, 10 episodes on 5 of them and bonus features on the 6th.
B000068TPN|4.0|I was too old for this war but have younger friends that served. They recommended the book to me. I found it an very moving detailed account of the type of thing that my friends told me about. I would recommend the book to anyone.<br />Then I had the opportunity to see this DVD. While it was not completely true to the book, it is just as moving and more gut wrenching. My wife who does not like this type of movie was consumed and sickened by what happened to our soilders. <br />The movie allows you get a very good idea of what the battle was like and allows you bring the horror of war move clearly into your heart. If you can read the book first.
B00004YYDI|3.0|I was a big fan of this film from the first time I saw the much-maligned US version (\\"The Professional\\") a few years back.  So I was thrilled to see this Uncut version of it on DVD.  I finally got to see it this week and have mixed feelings about it.  The added footage (at least the footage I can disseminate as being added) is:<br />GREAT because--<BR>It adds background history to Leon that gives depth to his character.  Something I was very much curious about.<br />NOT SO GREAT because--<BR>1) I'm not sure Leon's character needed that much depth, given the scope/tone of the film's storytelling, 2) It presents *outright* the sexual tension between Leon and Mathilda that is nicely left *implied* in the so-called massacred US version, and finally, 3) The added minutes somehow screw up the pacing of the film.  I can't put a finger on why, how, or even where it happens-- but it just does.<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not some prude who can't take the relationship presented between the two main characters.  In fact, the tension is there even in the \\"cut\\" US version.  But stating it outright just forces a \\"Lolita\\" aspect to it that, for me, restricts to a single interpretation of the relationship, and the rest of the dialogue between the two characters.<br />I still like the movie a lot.  I can't say more than what's already been said about Gary Oldman's performance.  I haven't seen Episode II, but I'd still be willing to guess that this *IS* Natalie Portman's best role to date.  And without giving away too much, Director Luc Besson's handling of what happens to Leon at the end is absolutely the best I've seen ANY director handle that type of ending-- moreso because it's done so well in an \\"action flick.\\"<br />Buy the Uncut International Version out of curiosity, and if you're a fan of the film.  But the US version (\\"The Professional\\") can stand on its own as a great film.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This DVD is one of my favorites for a very good reason. Buying it is like buying two DVD's for the price of one. The film and the two-hour, yes two-hour documentary on the second disc are both stunning. <br />The film concerns the life of a powerful publishing magnate, Charles Foster Kane. Rash, egotisical, and vain. He ruled his empire like a king. The people that are in his life are treated like objects that can get him further. The documentary is the story of what happened when William Randolph Hearst found out about the film and thought it was about him.<br />In terms of the film, it's done beautifully. Wonderfully edited and rarely shot at a right angel, it's done with wonderfull precision. All the actors are well cast for their roles and Orson Welles himself assumes not mearly the title role, he literally becomes him. <br />The documentary that accompanies the film shows not only the film and it's controversy but the lives of BOTH Orson Welles and Willam Randolph Hearst. Showing a meeting or a confrontation between them was nearly inevitable. <br />Brilliant work!
B00006FDCD|1.0|Ok ill admit that at first the clown pennywise was creepy but after about 5 mins he wasn't scary anymore. the acting was bad the special effects laughable. This movie is just a bad movie for me not watchable
0553213105|5.0|There is not much for me to say about this book, other than to add my voice to the choir singing the praises of Jane Austen and &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;  I recently read it for the first time (although I have been a long-time fan of the BBC series), and I was absolutely blown away.  Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.<br />Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit.  Here razor-sharp pen peels back the outward polish and fine veneer of a host of stuffed shirts.  Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy live and breath, and I am addicted to their story even though I know the outcome.  Plot is not the reason to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; rather it is just to take pleasure in good writing and cheer.<br />After this book, I am diving headfirst into the world of Jane Austen.  Amazing that it took me this long to discover her.
B000000WCX|4.0|I dusted off my copy of Earthling recently to give it a good listen, and surprise, surprise - it was better than I recalled the first time.  In fact I thought it was Bowie's best album post Let's Dance. I could actually listen to the whole album the whole way thru without skipping a track.  <br />To be honest, I'd become quite disillusioned with David Bowie, one of my music heroes from the 70s and early 80s.<br />Up to this point (1996) - with shades of Tin Machine reflecting his once edgy past and occasional genius emanating from soundtracks and collaborations...it'd been much a spotty period of creation for the Thin White Duke...marked by indulgent musicality - none of which really hit home for me.<br />Earthling puts aside such indulgences. The effort feels and sounds inventive.  And it has a groove.  Much of it recalls the feel of Bowie's Eno period - with drum and bass thrown in.   <br />Little Wonder and Looking for Satellites...one song experience unfolds into the other, which is generally the way a Bowie album should be.  <br />Unfortunately, for diehard fans since this effort - it's been hard to discover new music from the man who gave us so much but remains - I feel - in somewhat of an overall creative drought.  Shed a tear for the past, but enjoy Earthling with Bowie's music cred intact.
B00005JKG5|5.0|I'm so glad Flashdance is finally out on DVD! I've been waiting such a long time for it to come out. This movie is a true 80's classic! It has great music, awsome dancing, and I dissagree with anyone who says that Jennifer Beals is a bad actress. She plays the role of Alex just great!<br />I'm dissapointed though that they cut off scenes on the DVD. I remember when I taped it off the TV, there were some scenes in it that the DVD doesn't have. I certainly think for it being a DVD they should have all the scenes to this movie. I'm also dissapointed because they didn't have any special features for it, like for example the theatrical trailer, and the music video for \\"Maniac\\". I think they could of done a much better job on the cover. They could of made it more creative instead of just a plain blue backround, and they should of had Flashdance spelled out in a much prettier font, like the font they had on the cover for the VHS. Also, it's only on widescreen format. Maybe some people want to see it in a standard format, like me. I think they should of had a choice between those two.<br />Other than that, I'm really glad the movie came out on DVD. It gives the movie a much better sound quality. If you love 80's dance movies, than this is just for you. The music on this movie just makes you want to get up and dance. Especially to the song \\"Maniac\\" and \\"What A Feeling\\". It's the best movie i've ever seen from my opinion! I really hope they'll bring out a better DVD version in the future, with all the scenes from the movie, with a better cover and special features. If anyone thinks I'm asking for too much, I'm really sorry, but I think this DVD deserves a bit more.
0385720920|4.0|This book is the first of Chuck Pahalniuk's novels I have read. The book was interesting enough that I purchased his new release &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;.  Choke was nothing like &quot;Fight Club&quot; the movie(Haven't read the book yet).  It took a little bit of patience to get started but I finished with ease and surprise in the end.  Choking to get by in life and trying to find out who you really are.
0676974538|5.0|\\"Nigella Bites\\" is the ultimate in cookbooks - the pictures alone are tempting enough to make you want to try the recipes. Although far from health conscious, the recipes use everyday ingredients that can be adapted to fit  all manner of tastes and lifestyles. I bought the book ... before it was released here and I actually enjoy converting the recipes from metric; it makes me feel a part of the very English mystique that seems to surround Nigella and her view of food. The recipes come across more like guidelines than direct orders so don't be daunted by the degree to which recipes call for \\"full fat\\" this or that. There are some things that just cannot be substituted in certain situations, but I tweek many of the recipes to fit my low-fat way of cooking and the results have been spectacular! Besides, a full fat, full calorie treat is an occassional necessity and these are the recipes that one should turn to in those cases. Nigella's free-spirit and love of food comes through the book's pages and will inspire all who read it to get in there and start cooking!
B00007BK2N|5.0|Micheal Winterbottom's  \\"24 Hour Party People\\" is a phenomenal piece of film.  From the beginning scene where Tony paraglides to the closing moments of the visitation, all of my senses were indulged with the sweetest drug there is; music!  My only complaint is an insufficient amount of newOrder coverage.  Joy Division, Vini Reilly [ Durutti Column ], A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, new Order etc..  The music is flawless and unmatched. <br />If only had Tony Wilson signed The Smiths.. GOD KNOWS..?!<br />ABSOLUTELY A STELLAR PIECE OF CINEMATIC JOY!!
B00005RHGL|5.0|Wow! What a movie! You may have seen this epic western before but unless you've watched the Vista Series DVD you haven't seen half of it! There are several new scenes added into the film that makes the movie as a whole more interesting and in-depth.<BR>It fills several holes and all and all makes this a better movie.<BR>This is of course, an adaption of the historic O.K. Corral old west  shootout that took place in Tomstone, Arizona.<BR>The plot is perfectly constructed and is next to flawless.<BR>The performances are magnificent! <BR>Kurt Russell Makes the perfect Wyatt Earp and is totally believable in the role of the famous western lawman.<BR>Sam Elliot of TNT fame is cast as his typical old-west sheriff and is very good at playing Wyatt Earp's brother.<BR>Bill Paxton in an interesting change of role is cast as another of Wyatt's brothers and is most interesting in the role and pulls it off extremely well. Now, the absolute best performance in this film is given by the incredible Val Kilmer and watching his slyly sarcastic Doc Holliday on the screen makes you incredibly upset that he didn't even get nominated for an academy award which is downright unjust! He is the epitome of cool as he utters such classic lines as, \\"I'm your huckleberry\\" or whispering to his girlfriend, \\"Look Darling, It's Johnny Ringo\\" at the sight of the infamous outlaw. His accent is so believable it's amazing to think that it's put on! One of the most famous scenes in 'Tombstone' is one in which Val Kilmer's Holliday, after watching gunslinger Johnny Ringo show off by spinning his pistols around, takes two shot glasses and mocks Ringo by duplicating his movements.<BR>When viewing one of his other performances, say, his Bruce Wayne character in 'Batman Forever', released the same year as Tombstone, it's amazing to think that this is the same Val Kilmer that played Doc Holliday in Tombstone.<BR>Incredibly, Val Kilmer has all but dissapeared from the screen.<BR>His last film being the little-seen 'The Salton Sea', released earlier this year. He surely deserves to be a more well known presence on the screen. All in all this is a powerful tale of friendship and justice that should be treasured among the best westerns, in fact, Tombstone is The Best Western ever to grace the screen!
B000002UAU|3.0|I'm afraid this has to be the most overrated album of them all . Ironically it is the cutting edge technology of the time that the Beatles were using that makes this album sound so dated today .<br />The majority of these tracks are lightweight , with a hint of the cartoonish about them , but I'm afraid too many gullible people have swallowed the hype that the entertainment business has dished out to the public , to perpetuate the golden goose that is the Beatles . Talk about the tail wagging the dog !
B00004T9VY|5.0|\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" is one of the most powerful album of the last century !!!!! Cat Stevens's MASTERPIECE !!!!<BR>The sound on this remastered version is perfect and emphasizes the quality of the songs. Songs like \\"Sad lisa\\", \\"Hard Headed woman\\", \\"Father and son\\" and \\"where do the children play?\\" are among the best songs I've ever heard (and I've heard a lot of songs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).   More than a must-have, an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0399229191|4.0|I would give it a 5, but it is a pitty that it is a little book. It is ok for a one to one basis, but it looses a bit when working with it in a classroom. If it was bigger, than it would be easier for the children to appreciate better the details. The pupils wanted to stand up to see better. They did love to wait their turn to do so and to touch the spider web. For the rest, it is wonderful: the sounds of the animals, the predictive pattern and more. Through it they also learned to appreciate the beauty of the creation done by a spider and have grown in respect for this animal. Thanks Eric Carle!
0446608955|1.0|Preachy and predictable.  This book is very religious and sends an over-simplified message of right and wrong.  It separates the world into the righteous, religious types and the `sinner' who see the light as soon as they give the \\"believers\\" a chance to reach to them.  This is the type of message you take your kids to church for.  They deserve better in literature.
B000000I02|5.0|Well this work is more complete and versatile as well, even if less structured, than  &quot;Rotter's Club&quot;, which remains a better standard reference in order to understand all the elements of this genre.<br />Dave Stewart by Egg performs a major keyboards' work than that one in &quot;Rotter's Club&quot; (apart from the track &quot;Mumps&quot; from the latter, which is perhaps better,expecially for its versatility).<BR>Honestly the music harmony in Rotter's Club seems less complex but  with a major structure of the tracks,thinking anyway of a better output here in this great debut,because the experimentation works very well and a bit better.Well, expecially when there is a contamination with symphonic music, everything seems working better.<br />Despite of the different opinion, I recommend both of them and their value is the same (5 stars)
B000002UHG|5.0|As if Pink Floyd keyboard virtuoso Richard Wright hadn't already made himself a &quot;mystery musician&quot; with his complex dazzling music and one-sided empty grin, his 1996 solo fare &quot;Broken China&quot; firmly established that enigmatic tone his music has always seemed to take.<br />Perhaps the most fulfilling thing about Wright's &quot;Broken China&quot; is that the keyboardist is found back in tune with himself, his purpose, and his music. Wright is often known to be unsatisfied with a lot of his work, and a bad case of writer's block in the late 1970s resulted in his exodus from Pink Floyd and two less than perfect solo projects. However, with &quot;Broken China,&quot; the confidence which Wright regained from his reunion with Floyd has obviously paid off as he goes solo once more.<br />This 16-song cycle is a semi-conceptual piece dealing with the state of depression, something Wright's music expresses without flaws; his glistening musical arrangements blend together in a surreal flow, with the classic electronic touch. Former Pink Floyd session-contributor Anthony Moore's assistance is worthwhile on such great tracks as 'Night Of a Thousand Furry Toys,' 'Woman Of Custom,' and especially 'Reaching For the Rail' and 'Breakthrough' (both of which see Sinead O'Connor in guest spots). But Wright's work alone in the musical value makes &quot;Broken China&quot; the great work it is, evident on 'Satellite' and 'Sweet July.'<br />&quot;Broken China&quot; may very well be Richard Wright's masterpiece so far, even if the &quot;new age&quot; label is a bit far fetched. The confidence of a great musician is back and gleaming, and the album's ultimate result is above satisfactory.
0399226907|3.0|The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a great book for any young children around preschool through 1st grade. The book is about a caterpillar that starts off from just and egg. Then, the caterpillar starts eatting a leaf. Then he starts to eat some fruits, and then more fruits. After he is done with that he gets to his sweets. For instance cake, pie, and ice cream. Even though he eats all of that he still eats another leaf. By this time the caterpillar is full and makes a cacoon, and then he turns in to a beautiful butterfly. The author Eric Carle always comes up with gimics for little kids in his books. For example, the book has holes in it so it appears the caterpillar is actually eatting. I recommend this book to the young. The older you get the cornyer it gets. Not a classic but overally good a book.
B00005YXZH|5.0|when i hear music that doesn't sound like the current \\"typical fare,\\" i rejoice. obviously there are others out there like me, because Yankee Hotel Foxtrot has been getting rave reviews from coast to coast. i'd seen it mentioned in several magazines and decided to pick it up before a long flight. while i was somewhat put off at first, after a few more listenings it grew on me like kudzu. one time through is really not enough. with lyrics like \\"I want to hold you in the Bible-black pre-dawn\\" and \\"Tall buildings shake, voices escape singing sad, sad songs,\\" it's obvious that someone has a sense of poetry. somehow intelligent and thought-provoking writing has been gradually cast aside in favor of shallow pop-y glitz. i for one am thankful that not all bands have followed suit, and that there is intelligent life out there despite what mtv says. i would recommend this to anyone, no matter how their tastes run.
6300183211|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever made.  It's very graphic and languaged quite - non-suitable for children, but the first time I saw it, I couldn't move from my seat, only when I was yelling at the tv.  *LOL*  All I can say is 5 stars, and Al is still keeping up the good work!
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X are absolutely amazing!  This album is an excellent combination of heavy and symphonic.  The production is excellent as well.  DO NOT COMPARE THIS WITH PREVIOUS SYMPHONY X ALBUMS.  Each Symphony X album is unique, the Odyssey is no different.  Awesome musicianship from every member.  Russell Allen's voice sounds as good as I have ever heard on this album.  Symphony X fans will embrace this work for it's creativity.  I give this album 100 stars.  The song &quot;The Odyssey&quot; is unreal!  Enjoy this album as it is, this album is Odyssey, not V or Divine Wings of Tragedy.
B00006LWSF|1.0|I keep seeing the word \\"great\\" here.  Let's clarify something.  Greatness necessitates talent -- talent meaning a real gift and the discipline to perfect it.  Caruso was great.  Sinatra was great.  Even Elvis, in his way, was great (disregarding the movies).  But a rapper (any rapper)?  In this instance, a tattoo-mangled kid whose \\"music\\" consists of sing-song rhymes about profanity (trust me, when you use that much profanity, your message becomes the profanity and nothing else)?  Please, people.  Tell me our civilization hasn't sunk this low this fast.  People who are flocking to this film and to Amazon to buy this CD are lemmings.  It's a long drop.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a beautiful, haunting (literally) book.  All the characters are fully realized and believable,including, surprisingly enough, the murderer.<br />The concept of a murder victim narrating her own story is a little off-putting at first, but soon seems totally natural.  Susie is removed and matter-of-fact about her murder, but loves and misses her family and friends, and finds it difficult to let go.<br />This book is sad and moving and hopeful and, yes, lovely.  I do recommend it.
068484267X|5.0|This book is a wonderful testament to the human spirit, good and bad.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I do believe we all love Disney movies...I do not know how anyone could not. They are normally love stories (which I love), but that is not all that there is to it. These movies are animated, but don't you think that they aren't any good. I think they are some of the best movies around! Oh and yes they are created for children, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy them. In fact, I enjoy them just as much now as I did when I was young, if not more. The older ones are better though. I do not really like the ones that have come out just recently (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, etc.).<BR>Beauty and The Beast is a classic story of a &quot;beast&quot; and a beautiful woman who comes to love the beast for who he is inside, not just what he looks like on the outside...kind of like judging a book from its cover. This is something we can all learn from. When she first meets him, he is quite mean. But with time, he grows and a wonderful creature emerges from deep within. This is probably my favorite Disney movie. My favorite scene is when she is wearing that gold dress...it's just so beautiful. Everyone loves love stories; everyone loves Disney movies--so when you combine the two you get some of the best movies ever created! I would highly reccommend this movie--adults too!
B00005RYKV|4.0|I'll get around to writing a better review eventually. I liked the movie, and just wanted to point out that Denny revenge scene wasn't too light because he wasn't finished. Because of the ending events happened differently then he thought they were going to.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I really wanted to write a review of this album right after I heard it for the first time, but for once, I actually showed restraint. I decided to listen to it over and over - to immerse myself in it (for that is truly the only way to describe what happens to a listener who is in the grips of Sigur Ros) - before setting pen to paper, so to speak. <br />The first time I listened to it, I would have rated it 5 stars and shouted out its gorgeous wunderability to any and all who would listen to me. And after listening to it for a couple of days, I like it even more. Ten times more. That's right, I rate this album 15 stars out of a possible 5. But perhaps I am building it up just a bit. <br />This is not, and will not be, everyone's cup of tea. That's why there are different flavors. <br />Believe me, if you buy this CD based on my gushing review, you can't be mad and say I didn't warn you. This is music of a kind you probably haven't heard much of before. It floats around you, fills in spaces that most music can't touch, and transports you to a different place in time, a time all at once beautiful, aching, emotional, and nostalgic. And all of this without the aid of words. For you see, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lead singer for Sigur Ros sings entirely in &quot;Hopelandish&quot;, a self-invented language that mixes pure Icelandic with several other languages (I swear there's some English in there somewhere though...). This band is beyond pretentious and I still don't hate them. <br />In fact, the impossibility of &quot;understanding&quot; the lyrics on ( ) in a conventional manner of thought is, in one sense, what elevates Sigur Ros above so many other artists sculpting the same kind of music. Since nothing is understood, it's up to you to decide what is being said or not said, or, if all else fails, to just give yourself completely up to the sheer emotion of his high, pure voice. Vocals here are used as an instrument, like any other in the band, and together the combination is sheer aural pleasure. <br />But of course, there are people who will absolutely hate this album. My wife can't stand it and wishes I wouldn't play it because it drives her crazy. I still love her though, because she's a good person - and usually has better musical taste... There is a distinctively love/hate relationship built into the fibre of the music itself, because there is no way you could 'kind of' like or 'sort of' not like Sigur Ros, especially with ( ). All eight of the songs are Untitled and flow together into a wonderfully cohesive whole - and you're either completely with it or completely not. Pick a side. Please try and pick the right one though. <br />And now is the point where I wonder how I can possibly review a CD that has no real title and no song titles. It could get quite old quite fast for me to start comparing Untitled #1 with Untitled #6, even I would start to get confused at some point. But in a sense, that's the precise reason why the album works so well, without the distraction of song titles or 'real' lyrics, the album is almost like eight different parts of a single (and very modern, experimental) symphony. Personally, I believe you should listen the album all the way through. There are no singles here. They are not randomly placed on the disc either. They are meant to be heard, to experience the rolling waves of their progression to a loud and powerful conclusion. But if you don't have seventy minutes, and want a mellow, shorter version of the experience, listen to tracks one through four. <br />Very few bands can actually change the way you look at music and the way it can affect you emotionally. Sigur Ros is one of those bands. Unfortunately, they proclaim themselves to be one of those bands, have in fact declared that they will (or at least aspire to) change the face of music forever. Which, they probably won't, if for nothing else than the old maxim that true genius is always years ahead of the crowd. This, my friends, might well be true genius.
B000003S5H|3.0|Although I normally don't get into this branch of electronic music, this duo is pretty good when their music isn't spoiled by singing/vocorder.  Electronic music can be good with vocals (some Massive Attack stuff, Portishead, the Knife..) but the vocals have to be done right.  And they're done totally wrong on \\"Moon Safari.\\"<br /><br />\\"Femme d'Argent\\" is good, ...  \\"Sexy Boy\\" is good as well.  It has some vocals, but they're so warped with effects that they add to the music.<br /><br />So after two good songs I was expecting a good album.  But then came \\"All I Need,\\" with its unbearable singing.  Of the next four songs, I would only rate \\"Talisman\\" as good.  \\"You Make It Easy\\" has the same bad voice that was on \\"All I Need,\\" while \\"Kelly Watch The Stars\\" and \\"Remember\\" are ruined by that corny techno computer voice that's everywhere in bad music, from that \\"Blue da boo di da boo da song\\" to Daft Punk.<br /><br />When all is said and done, the two true highlights are \\"Ce Matin La\\" and \\"Le Voyage de Penelope\\".
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters Inc. perhaps only falls in comparison with its older bros. and first cousins. Visual references to the Star Wars cantina scene, which were made in Antz and Bugs Life, are looking de rigeur about now (i.e. perhaps that scene needs to be laid to rest for a few sequels). While the animation is, of course, superb on all levels, one expects nothing less from the creators of Toy Story and Toy Story 2. Were this the first film, wild accolades of unmitigated originality would be bestowed. <br />Nevertheless this film contains ingredients in abundance that are great from film to film. ... one indelible element of films across genres, including animation is an indelible and unmatchable chemistry between its two co-stars. In this case we have the highly unlikely pairing of goal-oriented, impeccably named Mike (Billy Crystal, in the role of a self-centered but ultimately sweet manager/agent of sorts, not unlike the role he played in America's Sweethearts). <br />His character's job here is to keep doors (to children's bedrooms) coming for the monster (Goodman) he keeps company gears rolling smoothly for. One fairly minor, but distinguishable problems, is that his character's job isn't quite defined enough to keep me from ending my sentences on prepositions. .... <br />But what's there is still great stuff. One barely distinguishable aspect of one scene early on, where Mike and Cat (that's what I call the John Goodman character because that's what the child who becomes their charge calls him) are walking to work. It's obviously a fall day since the leaves are brown. But I could tell there was a mild breeze, as I could detect a slight rustling in both the leaves of the potted plants that adorned the apartments and the trees that lined the median islands of the suburbs of Monstroplis. I looked for stillness, variations in wind direction, shadow variance and found nothing. I knew my viewing pleasure was in the hands of professionals. <br />Of course I did miss some of thefiner details like character development and dialogue. But in the case of ..., this film, ..., these films reward multiple viewings not only on big screen but video/DVD because each scene is packed with visual and written references to great films and brilliant one-off gags that might otherwise be missed. One line of dialogue I caught along the autumn walk-to-work scene I did manage to catch referenced \\"lunching at Harryhausen\\" The Harryhausen reference is to Ray Harryhausen, the brilliant animator who perfected both stop motion animation and claymation. .... <br />Of course Monsters Inc., ..., and all the other aforementioned contain numerous visual and written references to (here's the short list) the Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, Star Wars (Episodes 4 and 5 in particular), Escape From Alcatraz, as well as the depth of field imminently displayed in the moving package scenes of John Frankenheimer when he shows groups of characters in constant motivational tension against one another or an intended goal. <br />I realize it's a stretch, but I felt the same character of tension in watching the moving packages in Toy Story 2, the moving suspended doors in Monsters Inc., and watching individual scenes of De Niro, Sean Hayes in Ronin shot in individual scenes together in angular depth of field opposition, a visual way of revealing that each character had their own conflicting motives for retrieving, well, whatever it was. <br />It's not that Ronin or even the career of John Frankenheimer was some direct influence, but it's more a matter of emphasizing that here are a small group of directors from obviously the same highly expert visual school, the one where each frame isn't complacently pretty or complacent ... wow, but sublime and subtle in the ways each scene can illuminate character, motivation etc. <br />You can experience every emotion in this film -- and believe me you will run the gamut, in the secure knowledge that every turn is guided by experts. ... ...
6305176299|1.0|This movie is filled with action but is totally unrealistic!  The movie should actually be considered a comedy because of the stuff that goes on.  I wouldn't reccomend it.
B000055Y0X|5.0|It all starts when a military officer afraid that water has been infected, by Communists, to attack our \\"bodily fluids,\\" calls for a nuclear strike, preventing any contact with the bombers unless the recall code is known, which only he knows. His aide Captain Mandrake try's to talk him out of the plan, and give him the recall code. In the War Room the president is furious, and is on the phone trying to help the Russians prepare for what is happening. Soon he learns the Russians have a Doomsday device that will kill all human and animal life, if activated by the bomb. Time is running out, and things don't look too good, as Dr. Strangelove counsels them.<br />This was directed by the acclaimed Stanley Kubrick, and stars Peter Sellers in three roles. This film was nominated for Best Picture, and Best Actor. The film is in black and white, which was the best choice, due to many darkly lit scenes. This film is considered a classic in the comedy genre, and it deserves it, because every scene contains laughs. Its ironic comedy, satire, making fun of all the paranoid war crazy politicians of the cold war. A lot of the humor is also subtle, so when you watch think about the little silly use of words. So many of the characters and scenes are memorable. The transfer is good, but sometimes grains do pop up, but mostly the black and white pictures looks crisp and clean. This disc also has 2 documentaries and interviews with the stars. As well, some humorous trailers are included. I recommend this highly, just don't take the serious subject matter too serious. 5 stars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one amazing DVD set. I saw parts of it on HBO during its initial showing and was highly impressed with the episodes I saw. The realism of the battle sequences appears to be on the order of Saving Private Ryan. The script dialogue and acting are very well done in an understated way. The visual impact does not need further embellishment. This is a great war production, but it does not spend its time glorifying or denouncing war. The characters all felt WWII was necessary, but absolutely horrendous on the participants of both sides.<br />The different episodes focus on different aspects and characters in chronological order. I really liked the ensemble cast. None, except David Schwimmer, is really well known, but almost all were able to develop their characters in a meaningful way during the the duration of the 10 episodes. Different episodes tended to feature different cast members. The soundtrack was well done, too. The excerpts from interviews of the actual people was very touching and helped to emphasize that the production did not stray from the truth too much. It certainly is a landmark production and will be difficult to beat in the future. With all the trash that is being constantly produced it is amazing that this was made. I guess that having Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg producing it made a big difference.
B000068TPN|3.0|Mel Gibson stars as Commanding Officer Hal Moore, in this war drama based on true events. The film details the lives of the platoon, and their battle in the Ia Drang Valley, against the North Vietnamese, the first major battle in the Vietnam War. We first see the troops training, and spending time with their families, until they are flown over to battle. The rest of the film shows the 3 day battle in graphic detail, while cutting the action, to show the soldiers families receiving the bad news that their husband/father has died. The films message is that these men in war, were united and fought for each other. Nothing separated them while they defended their homeland. The film shows the profound effect of the war on the soldiers families, not just the Americans, but also the enemies. This film is directed very well, we get beautiful aerial shots, and 360 degrees view on the battle field. Acting is also very well done. The war scenes, have graphic violence, but not as graphic compared to other war films. The only problem I had is that there wasn't much story narrative, just mostly fighting. This DVD has a commentary, deleted scenes, and a behind the scenes documentary. Anyone who is interested in military history will enjoy this, as it is very historically accurate. As well as any Mel Gibson fan will enjoy this heroic tale. 3 stars.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I purchased this DVD because I went through a Marvel comic book phase when I was growing up. So I thought it might be fun to see. Reviews on the movie were reasonably good, too. However, like many movies of this genre (action-adventure-superheroes), it tries to overcome its inherent flaws in script with overdone and interminably long special effects sequences that defy all physical laws.<br />I made the serious mistake of viewing the special features on the 2nd DVD disk first. They were very imaginative and interesting and it increased my expectations for the movie. Unfortunately, my expectations were clearly not met. My major complaint is that the script was just too thin and absolutely predictable. Are all producers/directors are still trying to recreate (copy?) the Titanic phenonmenon (see Pearl Harbor et al). Also, Kirsten Dunst looks ridiculous in a red wig. However, Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were well cast. Overall an average movie.
0783229526|2.0|A journalist and his friend go to Las Vegas to cover a race. They also go there on a ton of drugs. This film shows them in colorful Las Vegas freaking out at everything, while on the drugs. During the film we get to hear the protagonists comments on life in America.  It is very bizarre. Now bizarre can be good, but in this case its boring and not very interesting. The characters and story aren't good. You are just thrown in the drugged up world of these two guys, and it all appears very silly. I give this 2 stars, because I can see how some counter culture type people might like this. I hear the book is much better. Some parts are funny, but the rest of the film is nearly unwatchable. If you like psychedelic trips, this film is for you. As the 60s ended, so did the idea that drugs would bring freedom and enlightenment. All it brought were a lot of headaches.<br />ATTENTION: If you plan to buy this, I suggest you wait until January 28, 2003 when a Special Edition will be released with a ton of extra material, by Criterion Collection.
B00005JKED|1.0|This &quot;film&quot; was a painful experience from start to merciful finish.  This movie was Copland, Boyz in the Hood, and Colors rolled into one film of far lesser value. If you are looking for a well written and interesting &quot;action/drama&quot; skip this one and try &quot;American Yakuza&quot;.
6305922756|4.0|Spinal Tap, directed by Rob Reiner, follows a dimwit band on their tour in America. The band has a series of episodes, that do not portray them in a positive light. They are silly, and even admit they are child like. Their popularity has diminished and they need to come up with new ideas to rejuvenate the band. The film follows a young director making a documentary about them. <br />This DVD has good transfer and sound. The extras are good as well, with a commentary with the band, out takes and more. The film itself is an effective comedy/satire of rock n roll bands from the 60's folk to 80's hair metal. I found the jokes throughout the film set up well, and one joke comes up right after another, with no dull spots, although it is not bust out loud laughing kind of humor. Fans of metal with a sense of humor should enjoy this. 4 stars. Check it out.
B000002KKS|5.0|Look...To me, there is no Sabbath without Ozzy. I am as big of an Ozzy fan as anyone, and when someone says Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill come to mind, no other lineups. BUT, despite that, this is one of the most solid metal records ever. It's such a classic. I rate this as high as any other previous Sabbath record, despite it's differences. I recommend this record to any metal/hard rock fan.

B00006LWSF|4.0|The movie \\"8 Mile\\" was beyond my expectations, though my expectancy was stymied at such flops as \\"Glitter\\" & \\"Who's That Girl.\\" Eminem has been a showman and doesn't falter with this soundtrack or the movie. The skill and dedication he brings to his work is exceptional. Some may argue that he's not the same as he used to be, however, all rockers, rappers, actors, or whomever tend to follow the natural order of things such as growing up.<br />The album, which could be considered a follow-up of \\"The Eminem Show,\\" yet it isn't. The tracks are laid smoothly and fit the movie very well. Eminem has always been about telling something, whether it be his beginnings, personal life, or just letting his rage go. The movie and the soundtrack compliment each other. There doesn't seem to be a connection to Eminem trying to be Tom Cruise, or win an Oscar. Simply it's telling a story. The Beatles did it with \\"A Hard Days Night\\" and pulled it off quite well because it was honest. So it is here.<br />Eminem lays a lot of new tracks here for his fans and also brings back some old-school influences mixed with his current ones. \\"Lose Yourself\\" tends to lean towards the single charts, which it is, but it lacks the poppy sensation of the \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" \\"Business,\\" or \\"Without Me,\\" and certainly the first single effort - \\"My Name is...\\"<br />If you liked the movie, or are a fan of Eminem, this album is for you. The new frontiers lie in a bed of growing up in the business, being prolific, and paying homage to those who have shaped the success of this brilliant entertainer.<br />Robert Eldridge (...)
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have no idea what to write, but for anyone who's interested - this is a GREAT movie! I, personally, am a huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki. If you like Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, or Grave of the Fireflies, I'm sure you'd love this. The animation is beautiful, as always, and the music's great. I love the way Miyazaki has a way to make his works all inclusive - children can love it as much as teenagers and adults would. It's entertaining, with some touching moments as well as humor. I know this review is pretty vague and isn't telling you about the story, but it's worth 30 dollars or more ^.^
B00003CXXI|5.0|BOUGHT IT FOR MY NIECE FOR HER BIRTHDAY. PURCHASED THE DVD FOR MY OLDEST SON. IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE. THE ANIMATION WAS GREAT.
B00006IUL7|5.0|A remake, as Hollywood has proven to us time and time again, is a bad idea, especially if the original was just fine the way it was. This is why the task of turning the critically acclaimed Scandinavian original into an American film starring three Oscar-winning actors is not as easy as it seems. However, the film's in good hands; Chris Nolan, the amazingly talented director who gave us the headache-inducing (but in a good way) &quot;Memento,&quot; knows how to craft a good film without playing down to the audience. <br />What made the original so good was its cinematography. The camera was a character; like a fallible narrator, angles could not be trusted; you had to second guess every frame. The cold Scandinavian landscape was the perfect setting for a film which delved into a crime, but also into the mind of the one investigating it. I was afraid the subtle nuances of the film would be lost in the American version: the telling gaze, the sun through the curtains, the metaphor of the fog. But, thankfully, Nolan kept most of the elements in his version, particularly the cinematic trope of the penetrating gaze (as a voyeuristic tool).<br />For those who are more used to multiple action scenes, you might be disappointed. There's quite a bit of dialogue, the events aren't explicitly stated all the time, and the audience has to, in a way, participate in the film. However, the performances are top notch. Robin Williams, whom we all know as the silly funny man, has managed to master the art of subtlety. His tone, facial expressions, and eyes convey more than can be expressed with words. Al Pacino, a little older than Stellan Skarsgård, the actor who plays the protagonist in the original, pulls off a fine performance alongside Swank. <br />One disappointing element is the ending. Keeping in mind this is an American film, Nolan opted for the conventional everything-will-be-tied-up-explictly ending, which seems forced, especially when you consider the subtlety that informsthe rest of the film. But this is still a fine film that is miles ahead of many other thrillers that Hollywood is churning out. If you're curious, do check out the original &quot;Insomnia,&quot; as it is, overall, more skillfully done.
B00003CXXI|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE. MY KIDS ENJOYED IT. THE ANIMATION WAS GREAT.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for two years now, and the result is AMAZING...Christina really has amazed me with this album....all of the songs are sung with such GREAT emotion and to know she wrote every song on this album except two (Beautiful, and Impossible) is a growth within it's self...One of the most shocking and most emotional song on the album I would have to say is &quot;I'm OK&quot;..in this song she sings about her childhood and growing up in a house of dolmestic violence...I can't imaging how hard it was for her to sing &quot;Hurt me to see the pain, across my mother's face, everytime my farther's fist put her in her place&quot;...I can actually literally hear her crying on this song...and it's just soo amazing how she can let all those emotions out like that...Anyway IF YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT NOW AND DON'T HAVE THE ALBUM GO GET IT NOW!!
B00006LLLN|4.0|Listening to this CD is just like closing your eyes at one of Alison's concerts.  Her voice penetrates your soul.  The background vocals are typically outstanding as Union Station shows why they are considered on of the best bands in bluegrass.  The Union Station sound is hard to describe, it is eclectic.  They are country, bluegrass, traditional or newgrass depending on the song they are playing but they are always good. <br />This is an outstanding recording that shines on most fronts and shows first hand why Alison Krauss has the reputation she does and why she gets the radio play she does.  The song selection mixes between old and new and she never forgets to let her band take some spotlight and do some of their solo material.  This CD will show you why this band rivals Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder as the biggest &quot;crossover&quot; group from bluegrass to country music.  <br />If I have one reason in not giving this CD 5 starts it would be the fact that their seems to be some &quot;drive&quot; missing.  As a bluegrass fan I enjoy a driving banjo and a strong mandolin rhythmn that seems to be missing on this recording.  Their are flashes of it in songs like Cluck Old Hen but it comes and goes too much for my personal taste.  The slower songs don't have that type of bite to them but her voice saves the day as she sings like an angel. <br />Don't let the &quot;drive&quot; criticism scare you away though, this is a great recording and even though it is a bit country it retrains one foot in bluegrass.  Buy it and enjoy!
B000002UB3|5.0|The late George Harrison summed it up with this quote from The Beatles Anthology.  Ringo Starr had said they were back to putting forward their 200% on Abbey Road.  And it shows.<br />Producer George Martin's idea for this album was to please John Lennon with straightahead rock, which is featured predominately on \\"side 1\\" and to please Paul McCartney with medley splicing as on \\"side 2.\\"  As a result, they came up with a grand finale to their career, even though it preceded Let It Be in release.  Of course, many of you remember this as being the one album with perhaps the most \\"references\\" to Paul's death (which as of this writing has not yet occured!).<br />John starts off Abbey Road with the hard rockin' \\"Come Together,\\" which started off as a campaign jingle for Timothy Leary (fortunately, Leary never ran!).  The line \\"Here come old flat top\\" got John in trouble with Chuck Berry, who had used the line in \\"You Can't Catch Me.\\"  George follows with one of his best ballads ever \\"Something\\" (a song both Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett would cover) and the opening line was a tribute to James Taylor's \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\".  Paul's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" may not be the strongest track here (John hated it!) but he introduces perhaps the 1st use of a moog synthesizer on a Beatles' song, which works out quite interestingly.  \\"Oh! Darling\\" features Paul screaming his lungs out (he tried making his vocal sound live).  Ringo's \\"Octopus' Garden\\" is a nice catchy song (it proves like George, he could write) and I remember as a kid the Muppets on Sesame Street singing it!  John's rather heavy sinister jam \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" closes the \\"rock\\" side (I'm still thinking vinyl) and I'm sure most of you know who the \\"heavy woman\\" is.  The chorus (repeated several times) is played in a funky shuffle.  The coda builds up more and more, then finally. Like Paul's \\"Her Majesty\\" which closes on \\"side 2,\\" it ends abruptly leaving the listener to suspect that the taperan out in the middle of the take used.<br />George's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" opens the 2nd part of this album.  It was written in praise of the sun peaking out after a spell of miserable weather in the garden of his pal Eric Clapton.  Have you noticed how similar the verse's opening is to Buddy Holly's \\"Maybe Baby\\"?  \\"Because\\" features a backwards rendition of Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" and features John, Paul and George harmonizing quite beautifully.<br />Then we come to the big medley, which is 70% Paul's.  It starts with his mildly vitriolic \\"You Never Give Me Your Money,\\" his jab at Allen Klein, whose \\"services\\" were unwanted by him.  The melody picks up as Paul sings \\"Oh that magic feeling, nowhere to go,\\" then his \\"sweet dream\\" comes true.  The chorus counts to 7 and then fades into John's \\"Sun King\\" which features wordplay in different languages.  John's \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\" were written in India, both of them catchy character songs.  \\"Her Majesty\\", the album's \\"encore\\" was supposedly meant to be sandwiched between the 2 songs (I have heard one unauthorized release of this).  \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\" was supposedly written about one fan who snuck in a lavatory to get a glimpse of the Fabs.  The mood is softened by Paul's lullaby \\"Golden Slumbers\\" (whose name was taken from an old poem).  The militaristic \\"Carry That Weight\\" follows with a reprise from \\"You Never Give Me Your Money.\\"  Finally, Paul saves the best for the last with \\"The End,\\" which features a rare drum solo from Ringo and guitar solos from George, Paul and John.  It's rare that so much is given in only 2 minutes and 20 seconds.  Then the tempo slows down as Paul prophetically sings \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\\"  Amen.
B00005JL2O|5.0|There's much more to this movie than might be seen by your average reviewer.  Yes, it repeats itself.  Yes, it uses obvious gags.  But, such is the spirit and style of the Austin Powers series.  Myers may reuse jokes, or use obvious gags.... but the point here is that he does them WELL.  He isn't repeating material from the first two movies because he's lazy.  Anyone who knows him will tell you very quickly that he'd never let that happen... he is doing is because its funny.  The opening is an obvious preparation for such total absurdity (and even a mockery of its own popularity) and all references to earlier movies are done with such self-consciousness that he obviously wants us to think about the previous films.  He isn't trying to make it seem new.  <br />Its barely a shallow movie, either.  If anyone knows the background to the Austin Powers series, you've probably heard about Mike's amazing devotion to his father, Eric.  (note the name of the production company.... Eric's Boy)  And, what subject perpetuates Goldmember, in jest or in somber truth?  Family and fatherhood.  No, this isn't Shakespeare, but he is contemplating an issue in a special way that only a comedian can do.  It is as if he is laughing at the Mike Myers that made the first two films.  On that level of self-realization, the film is hardly shallow.  If comedies aren't your bag, or you have to cry all the way through something for it to say anything to you personally, that's fine, but lets remember that this is a comedy, folks.  Laugh a little.  It won't hurt.  I promise.<br />With that, I tip my hat to Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat, and Goldmember.  Mike is one of the most talented comedians of our era, and I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This, I think is one of the easier disney movies for kids to relate to because it doesn't get too complicated. It's about a little boy who loves the jungle and he has to leave it. Kids can easily relate that in a number of spectrums from leaving a friends house to the disappointment of bedtime. Bagheera and Baloo are absolutely adorable. They keep their animal mannerisms throughout the movie, which I find incredibly charming. For instance, Bagheera yowls if something falls on his tail.
0380820846|5.0|I've been waiting, ever so patiently for this novel, and I was not disapointed!<br />I loved the turn of emotions in Colin as he began to see Penelope in a romantic light after having befriended her for years.  Their emotional adventures together was wonderful!<br />It was very refreshing to finally met a heroine that was not the picture of absolute beauty.  Let's be honest, most of us woman are not what society depicts as \\"perfect\\" as many of the heroines in romance novels seem to be.  I loved watching her finally see her dreams come true and the man that she's cared for for so many years finally return her love, and to hell with looking perfect!  It was great.<br />Thanks Julia for another wonderful adventure!!
B00006CXXU|4.0|After reading all these reviews on amazon about how this album was just the event of the year,I was positive that there would be NO dissapointments. That is really not the case. While this album was all in all very,very good there are a few flaws which should be pointed out. While her voice has matured (mostly in the right direction) there are some places where she seems to all vocal musicality, and just concentrates on proving the strength of her voice.But don't worry, it only happens on a few tracks.Also I think that while this album leaves a very good effect after a listen through, I wish that Christina would put a little more spark into some of her songs(particualrly the ones at the end).Because some of the songs are beautiful, but leave something to be desired. The standout of the album?surprise,surprise, it's not Beautiful (which is actually nothing out of this world.It's nice, but that's it)It is the seductive ballad walk away which blew me off my feat. I never in a million years thought she'd be able to pull something like that off. The emotion she conveys into every word is unbelievable. If you ever want proof of just HOW talented this girl is, listen to walk away, and all your quetsions will be answered.It's brilliant. Now the reason I' giving so much explanation to one song is because this is simply the way Christina should sing all the time. Not too much, not too little, just enough. With this song, you will know that in twenty or so years, this girl will be well around. Cruz and Soar are two tracks which are rather bland and portray very little emotion from Christina. I'm Ok was very well done. It's not as good as I thought it would be, but it still is quite haunting and will leave you almost inside-out. The voice Within is a very beautiful ballad with good lyrics, and an excellent bridge. Again there is still a little more of Christina to be desired vocally,but nonetheless it is a very good song. Keep on Singing My Song was a nice way to end the album.It's all in there, good message,gospel choir,and a super long note Christina holds at the end of the song,leaving you in awe.Let's go back to the beginning of the album. The intros and interludes (unlike in other cd's) are actually done with effort and have a point. Can't Hold Us Down featuring lil' kim was pretty good but could've been spiced up.Fighter is a fierce and angry song,and Christina's first venture into rock.Turned out well.Infatuation is another excellent tracl.Gret Latin beat,awesome lyrics (\\"mama used to warn me to beware of those Latin lovers.She said I gave my heart too soon and that's how I became your mother. I said ay mama you seem to forget I'm not in love yet), and perfect arrangments and production. Loving me 4 me, a neo-soul r n' b jam is perfect.It's very light and airy,not to mention perfecly sung. Impossible is wonderful.(It's not a duet with Alicia Keys,she just plays piano).Pure 70's soul. Unforgettable is pretty good, packed.Kind of a mixture of contemporary r n' b, and again 70's soul.( a lot of 70's influences on this cd).Beautiful is positive and uplifting,with a good message.Not overdone or anything, But as I mentioned previously it really is nothing out of the ordinary.Linda Perry could've done better with that. Get Mine,Get Yours is a pretty good upbeat r n'b song with sexy beats. Dirrty is the infectious first single, a great song to dance to.Make over is 70's funk.You won't believe it's Christina at first.Awesome chorus. Another high point of the album is that even though most of the songs are quite long, none of them seem to drag out pointlessly.They all take up the room they need. I also respect Christina for taking time with this albumm, instead of rushing herself just to stay in the spotlight.Now while this album is such a breath of fresh of fresh air from all the [stuff] that we tend to hear all the time. Also I hope Christina keeps up with her new style.Finally we hear an album which glows with effort and isn't overpoweredwith dance (...). While ther is still growth to be done. I believe that with Christina's talent,there is nothing she can't achieve.Meanwhile \\"Stripped\\" will be getting a lot of rotation in my cd player.
B00005JLO2|1.0|This film has only token resemblence to the original book. Anyone looking for a Lawrence of Arabia/Zulu type historical epic will be, as I was, sadly disappointed. The story is full of nonsensical plot devices, like the nubian guru-type that plays the same irritating quasi-spiritual, guardian angel role as Morgan Freeman's Azeem character did in 'Robin-Prince of Thieves'. He follows the main protagonist, Harry Faversham (Ledger), around the desert, repeatedly saving his life and for no obvious reason at all. Also Faversham actually is an out-and-out coward in this version and you don't like him or any of the other characters at all. The dialogue is uninteresting and ridiculous in the extreme, especially anything the love interest (Hudson) says, and I got to the point about two thirds in to this movie where I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters and prayed for it all to be over soon. The other irritation is the allegedly spectacular battle seen, the British are surrounded, form a square formation, and then order the retreat. Where did they retreat to? They were surrounded and hugely outnumbered!! I can only assume the makers wanted to use a square for dramatic effect, but had to get a couple of the main charcters safely out of this situation, hence the convenient retreat. Enough said, avoid this unless you've seen everything else on Blockbuster's shelves.
B00006ADFL|5.0|The first time I saw Heavenly Creatures I didn't like it. Afterall this IS a true story about two teen aged girls who commit a terible crime. I've since seen it several times and each time I like it more. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey give incredible performances and Pauline and Juliet. Melanie Lynskey is especially good as lower middle class Pauline/Yvonne,Gina. The use of music and the fantasy sequences effectively show the over the top emotional states these girls were in. The relationship starts out innocently. In fact, Pauline is so miserable, it seems like Juliet is the best thing that has ever happened to her and then everything spirals out of control. <br />The final and best sequence has almost no dialoge--just the delicate music of the Humming Chorus from Madame Butterfly as Pauline's plodding, simple mother walks unwittingly to her death like a cow to the slaugher house. The scene starts out with beauty and ends with hideous cruelty and sums up the story of Pauline and Juliet perfectly.
0696204800|5.0|This is my all time favorite pattern book!! If I could only afford one pattern book, I hope that is not so, this would be it! Loaded with 250 pages of patterns for patchwork, appliqu and many are easily adaptable to foundation piecing. Blocks are shown in 4&quot; size but I have enlarged them on a copier with great success. Each of the blocks are shown in clear concise color photos. There are many wonderful themes scattered throughout the book, including: Teatime, Thirties, Flowers, Noah's Ark, and every holiday you can think of. The Preface offers 40 different projects you could make with these blocks, including wearable art.
B00006GA4C|3.0|I'm writing this review with one big caveat, that being that I'm more in agreement with the band's critics than with their now fiftysomething fans. Sure, Grand Funk was capable of making some genuine kick-... R 'n R, but, please, spare me the revisionist accolades about Mark, Don and Mel's talents. Mark Farner's guitar solos consisted of playing the same riffs over and over again. Comparing him favorably with Hendrix? I don't think so! And while I'd rather crank-up GFR for an early Seventies nostalgia fix than, say, listen to the Goose Creek Symphony (Yeah, I know, I know: \\"Who?\\"), facts is facts: these guys were stoners who got incredibly lucky riding the hype, no more and no less. Let's have a little honest perspective here, \\"timelessly great\\" GFR ain't, unless you did too many drugs back then.<br />Having spewed all of that out, I admit a sneaking fondness for \\"The Red Album,\\" as good a head-banger as there ever was. \\"Got This Thing On The Move\\" plows like a sonofagun, as does \\"In Need,\\" \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\" and particularly \\"Inside Looking Out.\\" Cut for cut, the whole thing probably adds up to the best album Grand Funk ever did during the Terry Knight years. Take that however you want and flame away!
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha tells the story of a young man on a quest for the meaning of life.  Primarily, he becomes a Samana, fasting and living with no possesions. He experiences and explores several different teachings and lifestyles, learning and taking with him something from each way of life, eventually growing tired of his ways and then moving on. In this manner, Siddhartha learns many different arts, trades and philosophies, eventually finding enlightenment.<br />  This was a very short book, and was definitly worth reading.  Although the story of a young man from a wealthy family going out into the real world to seek the meaning of life is not exactly original,it is still worth reading.  The philosophy which this book largely bases itself on is not to follow blindly or get caught up in insignificant matters, but to think for yourself, learn something about yourself from every one of your experiences and find the meaning of life in this manner. I would reccomend this book to anyone, it is a short, simple read and many things can be gotten out of it.
B000002L9S|4.0|This CD by Madonna ranks up high amongst my favourite releases of 1986. <BR>She started by releasing a ballad - the haunting LIVE TO TELL - which topped the charts rightaway during the springtime; then she raises controversy with PAPA DON'T PREACH, a tune speaking openly about the abortion issue from a teenager's standpoint. Again # 1 is hit.<BR>You think the woman's satisfied? Forget it: TRUE BLUE is a track that relies heavily on the '60's beats while OPEN YOUR HEART is the tenacious attempt at getting the guy of your dreams.<BR>And if ever there was an artist that ever started the latin-flavoured campaigning, that was Madonna thru LA ISLA BONITA.<BR>I do have the regret of not having seen WHITE HEAT launched as single...it really had the potentiality to break through the charts...Big Time!<BR>Bottom line: this album is truly a well-crafted, well-produced and well-performed one.<BR>You gotta get it.
B00006879E|5.0|I want to say they're the new &lt;fill in band name here&gt; but I can't. They're like nothing you've ever heard before. Completely original and addictive. Makes you want to get up and sing along and become a groupie all at once. Live they are amazing and full of energy. And really eager to talk to fans. BUY THIS ALBUM and support a band that is going places fast. Tell everyone you know and then go see them live...with everyone you know. Peace Out.
B00000I8NC|4.0|The music on this ep is pretty good, but the most amusing part is the vocal sample of the madman on track 2.  He recites word for word, the lyrics to &quot;Virus&quot;, by Iron Maiden!  Godspeed must have known this, because Blaise Bayley was the current singer of Maiden at the time.  Most people who would listen to this, probably would not ever listen to Iron Maiden, or vice versa.  The music is good to be sure, but the vocal sample is worth the price of admission.  For any curious godspeed fans, the song &quot;virus&quot; is available on the Iron Maiden comp. &quot;Best of the Beast&quot;
0553579908|4.0|George R. R. Martin has written a novel that is larger than life. With an enormous cast of well done characters and a keen eye for conflict, he has delivered a story that a reader of any genre will be enthralled by.<BR> <BR>Plenty of knights, nobles, lords and ladies in a rich tapestry with a rich history! He balances the elements of fantasy in a manner that never over-powers the characters or setting, but that always lets the fancies of the mind take flight. Political intrigue has seldom been so good, and his characters keep true to themselves and you follow them eagerly through the wilds, across seas, down hall-ways, and into the depths of their hearts, ever anxious just to see what happens next.
B000066796|4.0|This is fun little time-travel romance. Meg is great as always and the guy who plays the guy is good, but Hugh Grant would have been better. But it's worth the time. Oh my god, I can't believe I wrote that. Hugh Jackman is fantastic.Having since [this is like a year later I am editing this] seen him play Curley in Oklahoma, I am a die hard fan of Hugh Jackman. I guess this little story didn't do him justice. He is the greatest talent on the silver screen or on Broadway. Hugh Grant should be permitted to shine his shoes.
B00006CXXU|4.0|First off, this disc is as far away from Christina's 1999 debut as you can get. No more cookie cutter pop songs (those are only memories now). Vocally, Christina'a talent has never been in question. Her material, however, has been the subject of heavy debate. This album, though, should turn things around in a different direction. \\"Stripped\\" is full of very high quality songs that showcase how talented this young woman is. Christina is a very soulful singer that can perform practically anything and sound amazing! This cd displays alt-rock, British rock, pop-rock, Latin, punk, jazz, gospel, r&b, hip-hip, and classical! She is talented beyond words, and this album shows her diveristy as an artist. \\"Stripped\\" is successful in shedding Christina of her teen pop singer past, and her personality shines through in an array of different colors. \\"Beautiful\\" is true to it's title (and could very well be a Grammy contender), \\"Can't Hold Us Down' features a salty rap from Lil Kim and is an ultra cool, radio-ready cut, \\"Infatuation\\" is a light-hearted Latin number (which Christina performed at the Salt Lake Olympics), and \\"Impossible\\" is a smooth r&b number with Alicia Keys that is also Grammy worthy. \\"Fighter\\" is a very powerful rock anthem that shows of the true strength of Christina's voice. All in all, there is a lot of great music to be heard on this disc that, by the way, took 18 months to create. Christina is beautiful, talented, and determined to be the artist she wants to be.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is quite possibly the best book ever written.  The plot is as real today as it was when it was written.  The characters are strong and vivid.  Its like stepping back in time to a place you've never been. If you enjoy the book, A&amp;E and the BBC made a wonderful mini-series adaptation of the story starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Also for a more modern take on the same premise, read Bridget Jone's Diary by Helen Fielding.
6300182193|5.0|I have been enthralled with this movie since I was a kid. It's definitely one of the more romantic takes on the Dracula theme. The music is wonderful! I like the story line, even if it does deviate from the novel.<br />The story of a love bordering on obsession that flowers between Dracula and Lucy is riveting, and, I think, the best part about this movie, but the ending is anti-climatic; I WANTED Lucy and Drac to make good their escape! I can't understand why Jonathan Harker insisted on holding onto a woman (Lucy) who was so obviously in love with someone else (Drac).
B00005MP58|5.0|On a scale from 1 to 10, this mini-series deserves at least a 50.  Generally I boycott film adaptations of my favorite books,  but boy am I glad I made an exception for this one.  From the music to the costumes, to the locations, to the actors,  Jane Austen herself could not have done better.  The film is true to the text and the spirit of this classic story.  Kudos to A&E/BBC.  If you enjoy this film,  you will most likely enjoy the A&E/BBC adaptation of Jane Eyre as well.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film and it never gets old.
0316666343|4.0|After reading the book description for Lovely Bones, I was afraid it would be depressing, so I put off buying it.  But, after reading the customer reviews (some of them positively glowing), I decided to give it a try.  The story was sad, but it was also uplifting.  As I understand it, the author was raped when she was in college and wrote about that life staggering episode in her memoir, Lucky.  Perhaps that is the reason the description of Susie Salmon&#146;s rape and murder was so powerful.  After her murder, Susie wanders her version of heaven and keeps watch over those left behind on earth.  It is difficult to say more about the tale without giving away the plot.  There are parts of the book that drag on a little, but ultimately, it&#146;s the story and the strong characters that pull the reader along.  This is an original and thought provoking story.  I found myself wondering about loved ones I have lost.  Are they watching over me?  I sometimes think this is true and it is a comforting thought that Alice Sebold&#146;s story has reinforced.

630587493X|5.0|I read the short story and the novel back in the early 70s while in the Navy.  The story stuck with me and I have never forgotten it.  I am not an overly sensitve guy but I have now seen the movie twice and I have cried at the end both times.  The portrayal is that moving for me.
0385720920|4.0|This book was an eyeopening trip into Chuck Palahnick's mind.<BR>I thought FightClub was amazing, but this book is right up there also. A quick, frantic read. You won't be able to put it down.
0380789035|5.0|American Gods is a great story. Its story of America its Gods that showed up on the boats of the coming to america age and how its been reduced to money and substance. How some Gods are lost and forgotten and new gods appear around every corner. All woven into a journey of an ex-con who-with nothing else going on-must help the old God's led by Odin.<br /> The story was very easy to read. I love the Nordic God references which are fascinating in my eyes. The ending left me in awe.
B000069CWE|5.0|This album kicks [butt] and totally mixes up the previous tracks.  they have done more than just make new background music with this cd by presenting various new artists and new verses.  I can only wait till the next fully new album comes out.  I have no doubt in my mind that this group will be around for a long time with many hits to come.
B00006HBUB|1.0|This movie was horrible. I rented it instead of buying it (Thank God) because I still love the cartoon. I was hoping that it wasn't as bad as the critics said it was. The funny thing is...it was worse! The acting was horrible. The plot didn't even follow the cartoon formula. It was so dumb that I would have turned it off but I fell asleep. Save your money for something funny and entertaining like Monsters Inc. or something else. Do yourself a favor and rent this one.
B00005A0N5|5.0|While wandering over the metal section at a record store, an employee grabbed a copy of \\"Oceanborn\\" and said: \\"Have you heard this band?\\" I had not yet uttered a negative answer and he was already removing the cd wrapper. He immediately proceeded to play me bits of the songs. I WAS BLOWN AWAY!! I have been a metal fan since about '89, and from 93 onward I have gotten into a lot of different genres, from Jazz to Reggae and beyond. On the last 3-4 years I have bought only a couple of metal cds, because I was a bit dissappointed with the whole genre. Bands seemed to be playing the same old cliches, and new bands were no exception. But, when I heard Nightwish, I saw the sky open up. Here was a band crafting music equal parts technical brilliance, emotion and innovation. And Tarja!! I am absolutely in love with her voice!! I get chills down my spine every single time I play this cd. Amazing. Brilliant. Power to spare. Arresting emotion. Get it.
0385503954|4.0|A number of reviews have summarized the story of the 'crime' of 13 year-old Briony and the resulting dramatic changes that occur in the lives of the key characters: in addition to the young girl, her older sister Cecilia, her cousin as well as the son of the housekeeper, Robbie. The first part of the book covers one hot summer day in rural England in 1935 where the tragedy unfolds. The atmosphere is masterfully evoked and the evolving drama sensitively depicted.  To this reader the most successful facet of the chapter and the novel overall is the characterization of Briony. In many ways, this is Her story, seen from different angles and from different time perspectives. She is, as the late arrival to her parents, a typical mix of a spoilt and neglected child. She lives in her own fantasy world where the realities of her surroundings are mixed in with the wild imaginations of a romantic of her age.  McEwan captures the capricious teenager very well indeed.  He also paints an excellent portrait of the upper-middleclass family and its open and hidden frustrations and tensions.  Cecilia is also well drawn as the returning fresh (women's) college graduate. She tends to replace the mother for Briony and a set of cousins, but at the same time she is uncertain of her own identity.  This part of the book is the most engaging, it draws the characters well and builds up the tension up to the 'crime'.<br />The rest of the novel does not maintain the momentum created. The story picks up five years later with Robbie at the front in France after having spent the intervening years in prison for THE crime, which he did not commit. Briony, obviously in part as a result of her guilt for blaming Robbie rather than the real aggressor in a false testimony, has decided to train as a nurse in London.  We also learn that her actions resulted in her sister refusing to communicate with her and the rest of the family.<br />One wonders why the very detailed description of the retreat from the front to Dunkirk with a wounded Robbie as the main character was necessary. Based on extensive research of historical documents, McEwan offers an excellent account of the dramas of that retreat, however, its significance for this particular story is not evident.  The incidental facts one learns about the intervening years, the protagonists and their changed relationships do not justify the importance given to this chapter.  The exception is the description of Briony's life as a nurse which is more to the point.  An extensive duty period where she is suddenly confronted with the dramatic influx of seriously wounded soldiers leaves a deep impression. The learning curve that changes her from an innocent and irresponsible 18 year old to an adult during those hours is well drawn.  Her actions following this experience, although somewhat unconvincing, are intended to demonstrate her resolve to confront her 'atonement'.<br />The novel ends with an epilogue set some 55 years later. It depicts Briony as a successful writer of a certain age.  While preparing for a birthday party in her honour, she reflects not only on her life but also on the question of atonement.  I agree with those reviewers who commented on the weakness of the ending of the novel.  The concept of a story in a story and the author's privilege to change major aspects of the story line to give it more of 'happy ending', does not sound quite convincing. Atonement is not achieved by making the characters survive and live happily ever after.  Briony, even at 77, remains the capricious little person that she was at 13.  She still invents fantasies and refuses to take responsibility for her actions.front to Dunkirk with a wounded Robbie as the main character was necessary.

B00005JKCH|5.0|As Hollywood starts to shoot out one after another comic book themed movies, we as the viewer start seeing them all looking the same and not one of them sticking out.  First it was Batman and then it was X-Men and now Hollywood brings out it's hardest punch (I believe) with the web slinging action flick of Spiderman.  <br />   Tobey McGuire plays the part as Peter Parker the little high school nerd that is the joke of the crowd.  Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane the beautiful young women who Peter Parker was in love with since the third grade.  As the stories goes Peter Parker is living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He finds himself wanting to get the girl of his dreams and yet doesn't know how.  Parker is at a school field trip and taking pictures for the school paper.  He makes a move on Mary by taking a picture of her for the school paper as he is doing so a spider dangles his web down and lands on Peter's hand and bites him.  When Peter gets home he is very tired and goes straight to his room and falls asleep.  When he wakes up he finds that he has changed and that he doesn't need his glasses anymore and that he has gained \\"miraculously\\" muscle tone.  As he finds out that these powers are too good to be true we see Parker jumping buildings and climbing buildings.  As he see's Mary having a difficult time and he wanting to find a way to her heart he enters a wrestling contest and wins only  a little money and not the full amount.  As he is exiting the building though he see himself in the middle of a robbery and let's the guy pass because he see's the company as being possesive.  When Parker is out starting to go home he finds a crowd with cops and he makes his way through and finds his uncle shot on the ground.  He hears from the cops talking to eachother were the suspect is and runs to find him. This is where you see a great chase scene. As he finds his powers and tries to strengthen them there is another evil starting to brew on the other side of New Yorkand that is the character called the Green Goblin. The green goblin is a man who was fired from his jobed and gets really ticked and wants to get even.  The green goblin's son is friends with parker and is dating the Mary Jane.  Yet as the story starts to unfold Mary Jane starts to fall for Parker when he doesn't even know it.  As Parker becomes more known, the Green Goblin tries to unite forces with him and yet SPiderman refuses and the green goblin tries to kill him.  <BR>   The whole movie is very well done and not over romanced and all the roll playing of the characters was very well done.  I would highly recommend this movie to those who have and have yet not read the comic books.  This is a movie for everyone.

B00006CXXU|5.0|It is such a joke when an artist says that he or she will mature, but really doesn't produce anything that is equal to that adjective. Take for example Britney Spears: she's claimed that her sophomore and junior albums are \\"mature\\". Well Britney, having recycled beats, singing songs that only 15-year-olds could relate to, and the continuation of computer-enhanced vocals does NOT exemplify maturity.<br />If you talk about an artist who really meant to mature and made a huge effort on her follow-up album, then you have a perfect example: Christina Aguilera. This album is one of the best albums of 2002. It is one of those albums that would become a classic in the years to come. Christina has made a huge leap from pop/R&B tunes on her debut to an eclectic mix of blues/R&B/rock/Latin/alternative/soul on \\"Stripped\\". Whereas her debut album's lyrics were mostly about love, this album tackles on many issues that people can relate. From society's double standards imposed on women (Can't Hold Us Down), domestic violence (I'm Ok), self-esteem (Beautiful), striving for success (Soar), casual sex (Get Mine, Get Yours), betrayal (Fighter), Christina's sophomore English album brings in a lot of meaning. Her voice is still one of the best in the music industry. She sings with so much emotion on each of her songs. Christina has definitely survived the whole \\"teenybopper\\" category and moved on in with the big-timers of music.    <br />If you are expecting the same Christina with the catchy pop tunes as evidenced on Genie In A Bottle, What A Girl Wants, and Come On Over Baby, maybe you will have some time to adjust to this album. If you are a huge music fan with a variety of music likings, then you have to buy \\"Stripped\\". I promise you, you won't regret spending your money.
B00005JL0I|4.0|I'm thrilled that Casino Royale is finally available on DVD to complete my James Bond DVD collection. Not produced as a traditional Bond film, but as more of a spoof, this film doesn't make any sence at all, but I absolutely love it. It is a gorgeously Technicolor 60's romp with cameo's galore, and all the &quot;mod&quot; you could ask for. I wish the DVD had some extras, but I'm still very happy that it's available in widescreen and in glorious, gaudy color.
B00005QCVT|5.0|Requiem for a Dream may be the kind of movie appreciated for its effective camera techniques, but it's not the kind of movie one likes, at least not in the sense of liking a feel-good, thrill ride, or big-fun kind of a movie.  Requiem for a Dream is, at its core, about the horror of drug addiction and the degradation of the using life.  Only the purist masochist would choose this life if he knew what it held in store for him.  The characters in this tale unwittingly go down the gradual but steady road to hell and complete derelection, a decline that becomes more steep and takes on greater speed until it hits its inevitable bottom.  Take the most intense moments of Leaving Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Jacob's Ladder, and roll them all up into one to get an idea of the movie's climax.  Thank God this is the edited edition.  I can't imagine how much more sordid the director's cut is.<br />Requiem is a modern-day object lesson for those who would glamorize drug addiction and its captives.  The subject matter is quite grim, and on its own, the story is not particularly original.  What gives Requiem its appeal to critical acclaim is the incredibly effective camera techniques that director Darren Aronofsky gives this work.  Truly, it is an elegant piece of work in the way that many have called Einstein's Theory of Relativity \\"elegant\\"; once you see it written down, it's so obvious, so clear, so simple.  And so dead on the money.  In fact, Aronofsky's effective filming of the story to bring to life, for the viewer, what it feels like to be caught up in that drug-addicted hell, is so perfect and so right-on that it must have already been done, but I can't remember when or where.<br />For students of film making, this movie is a definite must see.  For those pondering the idea of relapse, this movie may very well take the wind out of your sails, and for that reason alone, it is worth the price of admission.
0385484518|3.0|Although over-rated, this was a good book with some good life lessons. You don't like Mitch, but you can't help identifying with him because we are all guilty of these wasteful ways of living life. The writing and the lessons were a bit too simplistic to my liking. I heard a lot of raves about this book and my friend actually recommended it. I was a little disappointed that the book didn't move me (on an emotional level) - maybe I just had too high expectations.
B00005U2JL|4.0|Not AATCHB (Nine Inch Nails: Live) intense, but it is a different band of a different style. This DVD I think delivers just what it is supposed to and that is Marilyn at his best. He is a shaman of sorts to open our comatose eyes to reality. He puts on a rockin show. Being in 5.1 surround the sound quality is awesome and the picture is very clear. The concert captures all the best parts of each song performed with clear and smooth transitions, for the most part. I love the effects of his show and the feelings he brings out. At one point, he comes out on a black covered platform, I presume, and looks larger then life. On the \\"Nobodies\\", he performs in painter's stilts to highten his vision that he wants to share with you, a little part of his world. The 30 minute documentary, \\"The Death Parade\\", was enjoyable but I guess I was expecting a whole lot more. Personally I got a better view of the person and his life on the road on his \\"God is in the TV\\" video. But the poet put this together himself and showed us what he wanted. This DVD is trully a great accomplishment for Marilyn, a artist who never stops to amaze.

0316666343|3.0|This book was written very descriptively.  At time though I thought the book was disjointed.  There were too many characters expressing their feelings and at times you had to switch gears too fast and move on to the next character.<br />The story of Susie Salmon was very interesting.  I felt that towards the end though the book was lacking-almost losing its momentum.<br />I'm glad I read it, but it isn't on my list of favorites!
B000002UAR|3.0|I'm beware that this one is not stereo but mono recording! <BR>the beatles reached their<BR>                 popularity in 1964 because of the commercial success they covered the american rock n roll bands in<BR>                 the periode. <BR>This album is a bit better than the first early stuffs hard days night, for sale, with the beatles etc..!<BR>the music is more progressive, the songs are composed in largely inspirations and new ideas like tomorrow never knows, for no one, and your birds can sing etc...
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I heard Johnny Cash interviewed on NPR's Morning Edition the day after the CD was released.  I rushed to the nearest store and purchased it.  It is, without a doubt, the most expressive, touching, sincere, and honest collection of music I've ever experienced.  I've long been a Cash fan, but this really tops them all.  Whether you have any other Johnny Cash CD's or not, you absolutely must add this one to your collection.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Let me first say that I have never been a fan of Christina's even though I have always appreciated her incredible singing voice. This album though, has made me an admirer. I had read when Christina's self-titled debut was released that none of her future albums would be as pop driven. I waited to see where she would go and I am impressed. Props to her for breaking out of the mold and finding her true voice. There are so many genres of music on this album that is truly boggles the mind. From the honest soul of my favorite song (produced by the talented Alicia Keys) &quot;Impossible&quot; to the emotional ballad of &quot;I'm OK&quot; {co-written by Linda Perry), there's something for everyone. If you appreciate good music then you will appreciate this album. Two enthusiastic thumbs up from me and I anxiously await seeing more of Christina Aguilera's evolution as a musical artist.
B000002U82|5.0|Eventhough pink floyd as being one if not my musical inspirations, the dark side of the moon would probably for me at least to be one of the hard rock albums to review, or at least in a reasonable sence. So, since i'm bored out of my mind, with nothing else to do i'm going to give this a shot. So, not only one if not pink floyds most known album to date, thus being dark side of the moon. Well, I shall say whish you were here, the wall, animanls, and the pre dark side meddle. So many ways to decribe this album, laid back, extremely inovative, and ripe with funky melledies. Songs like speak to me, time(another one of my all time favorite floyd songs) us and them are such prime example of this.  While also you get into the more experimental side of this album breath, and money and any colour you like. Anyway, is there really any need to write a 24 paragraph review? well, no not all the time, while I like to for the most part get down to the point. So inconclution, for any rock fan or music fan I would definetly aquire a copy of dark side of the moon, but in realality, I can't think of a floyd fan with out dark side of the moon. Perfect music for relaxation and a full on pleasureable sonic experience.
1580084621|5.0|This book was obviously a labour of love. David writes beautifully, and, if the first two recipes I have tried are anything to go by, the book gives supurb results. As David has spent the last decade running very successful Thai restaurants, he knows what he is talking about. <br />I am just learning to cook Thai food. I can see this book guiding me for several years as I enjoy this new hobby. <br />This is a high quality book and I highly recommned its purchase.
B00005RFAI|5.0|When I first heard this album I didn't like it. A year later I am still playing it....hmmmm.<br />This is not a Britney like album.  This album has very strong songs like &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot; and the fun funky &quot;Get This Party Started&quot;.<br />Pink is the next Madonna, hands down.  Showing a new sound, a new look in every video, and a different personality.<br />I was wrong giving this album a so-so review without hearing it through and through.  Now this album is one of my faves.<br />This should definitely be up for Album of the Year come 2003 at the Grammies.  For Pink to win her battle and do what she wanted to do as an artist is unbelievable.<br />This is no sophomore slump.

6304936303|5.0|\\"The Last Boyscout\\" certainly has shades of other films such as \\"Die Hard,\\" \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" and \\"Beverly Hills Cop,\\" but it borrows from the best and comes out a winner. On top of that, director Tony Scott is on hand to keep things slick and hard-edged. There is a reality to \\"The Last Boyscout\\" that most films of its kind can only yearn for, despite its over-the-top action moments. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans share a fantastic onscreen chemistry which solidifies the experience. Add in some one-liners you'll love to quote, and you have a classic on your hands. Tony Scott is the man.
B000006YYW|5.0|So you love 80s music? But think you've heard it all before? If you have not heard Robin Gibb, you have heard nothing! !<BR>If you read BG fans' reviews (and YES I am one of them) you could deduce that HOW OLD ARE YOU (HOAY) is the post flower power incarnation of an eccentric voiced hippy. Well... ignore comparitive reviews; They do not lead to any insight into Robin Gibb music. This album has NOTHING to do with BeeGees actually. It is an album that pinpoints the era of the beginning of pop's globalisation, and forcing MJ's Thriller off the top of the charts in Germany in 1983 it proved to be a relevant 80s European New Romantics Masterpiece.<br />As Europe was swept by eurobeat post-disco campness, Robin tapped into this vibrance mixing with the Dark Goth sounds of London's upcoming BATCAVE club of the mid-1980s; The place that ensured that the Eighties was destined for historical significance. Robin elegantly tapped into the darker side of this slick New Wave movement, ensuring that Robin would far outlive the 80s even if the BeeGees disco backlash would spell the end of the group.<BR>Luckily that didn't happen, yet Robin's angelic voice and Celtic folk overtones in their own right did prove to live long past that decade that haunts us in the 2000s.<BR>No-one should be surprised that Robin is releasing a new album this year, that almost certainly wont be his last (especially judging by Germany's responses to his solo appearances of the last 2 deacades).<BR>Robin was always the fashion conscious BG. Hell, he even sung with Marcella Detroit before she was known to be a Shakespeare Sister! ROB YOU ARE THE MAN!LOL. Furthermore, Robin pushed the boundaries of BG music, as is evident on the ESP & SIZE albums. Robin's extra sensory perception of pop music trends will no doubt enrich his upcoming album, which promises a fresh dose of variety, and unfamiliar territory. Barry has forgotten about new sounds since his Now Voyager project of 1984. Barry is cool yet Robin madethe supergroup into what they should have been, even if most of us are oblivious to that side of BeeGees.<BR> Check out HOAY before you make an opinion about Music from the 1980s! HOAY rules!!
B00003CXFG|5.0|Before Vin Diesel soured himself in bad Rob Cohen films (like the POINT BREAK rip-off THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS), he was the coolest of the cool playing Riddick, a convict sentenced to life imprisonment on some faraway planet. When his ship crashes into a seemingly lifeless world, he and the survivors are forced to unite when darkness falls and the planet's hidden residents come out to play. PITCH BLACK doesn't break new ground because of its underwhelming beasties, but instead because it is a science fiction \\"creature feature\\" that focuses heavily on character development. You actually care for these survivors, and that makes the movie work on a level that cripples so many others in its ilk. Add some splendid performances to the mix by the gorgeous Radha Mitchell, the unpredictable Cole Hauser, and THE THING's Keith David, and you have the best interplanetary thriller since ALIENS and PREDATOR.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie \\"blew my socks off\\"!!!  I adored the animation, and found the graphics to be the best I've ever seen.  I am 48 years old ... and I can't quite figure out who was more awed by this movie.... my 5 year old niece or me....no exageration at all here! I think I smiled almost throughout the movie... except for a few cruel things that Arquaad did or said.  What a jerk! ... ahhh but he got his!!!  What goes around, comes around.. which brings you right back to the theme of the story, and ends with the orbital path of truth and love once again.  Ahhhhhhhhh ... that feels good.  :) If I remember correctly ... isn't this the way that films SHOULD be made.  Real life is tough enough.  I say \\"SHREK FOR PRESIDENT\\"   :)  ENJOY ALL !!
B00003CXDD|5.0|Ever heard of a little thing called &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; or a man by the name of J.R.R. Tolkien? Well, an overrated filmmaker by the name of George Lucas certainly has, and it's readily apparent in &quot;Willow,&quot; which owes more than a little to the best fantasy yarn ever told. However, despite this breach in a writer's etiquette, &quot;Willow&quot; remains one of the very best sword and sorcery tales that has ever been brought to the screen. This is do in no small part to Ron Howard's lively direction (something &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; could have used), some inspiring performances, fantastic action sequences, and a lot of well-placed humor. &quot;Willow&quot; rules.
B0000542D2|5.0|See the movie that inspired the Monkees (or at least, the producers of the monkees). This black and white, loosely structured film is a lot of fun. Shot and edited in an extremely short period of time, it seems to have benefited from being put in the can before anyone could fuss over it too much and leach it of its playfulness and originality. Unlike Dylan and Baez in DON'T LOOK BACK, the Beatles were playing characters, not trying to project their own PR images. And they seemed to enjoy doing so. While the Swingin' England costumes, hairstyles, and backdrop makes you wish someone had put up the pounds for color film, the b&w camera work evokes the other great b&w films of that era: Darling, Alfie, Georgie Girl, to name a few. What I found most amusing was how polite the Beatles were to the adults in the movie (George actually apologizes to a sports coach for running around on his \\"private property.\\") There are no clues that I could detect of the role these four baby-faced musicians would have in the counter-culture movement of the next half decade.<br />The music is great, of course...but the songs were either shorter than I remembered, or have been edited down somewhat. It would have been nice if the second DVD had some outtakes (maybe they used every frame they shot) or news footage from the time. Instead, it contains countless interviews with just about everyone connected to the film. Interesting reminiscences, but enough is enough. (I doubt that I'll ever play the second DVD again.)<br />More than mere nostalgia, this is a great movie!
B00006JDVV|5.0|\\"Reign of Fire\\" is a sci-fantasy film that assumes dragons are real, and once ruled the world before the coming of men. Now, they have been awakened, and the future world is bleak and overrun with the winged creatures. Quinn, the boy who discovered their underground lair and has now grown into manhood, presides over an abandoned English castle that harbors many survivors of the disaster. He is content merely to stay alive, but all that changes with the coming of the American Van Zant and his band of dragonslayers. Thus begins the final battle against the dragon menace in this brilliantly conceived storyline which is part Mad Max, part ID4, and part Jurassic Park. Quite simply, this is one of the best ideas for a \\"popcorn film\\" to ever come out of Hollywood, even if doesn't always live up to its potential. The actors deliver solid performances - especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays one of the coolest characters I can remember in recent history. The special effects are very special indeed, and the film's dragons look as real as anything you've ever seen on the big screen. The film does have its lulls from time to time, but overall it's a remarkable achievement that has been blasted by far too many critics. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try. I think it's destined to become a cult favorite.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have to applaud Christina Aguilera for giving us one of the best CD's of the year. I have always been a Christina fan and was a little off put by her change in image. BUT I bought the CD anyway and was not deceived by the first released song \\"Dirrty\\". The rest of the CD is a stunning look into her soul and what she's feeling right now. Her teen pop days are way over and I think that she is making the move in the right direction.<br />Before I read any of these reviews and simply listened to the CD, I immediately thought back to when \\"Janet\\" was released. That album broke new ground for Janet Jackson and I feel that this album will do the same for Christina Aguilera. <br />Congrats to Christina for being \\"Stripped\\" of all pretense and for being real.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I have not read a single word in the Harry Potter series of books, nor do I necessarily intend to do so. As for the film based on part 1 in the series, I can say that it is a pretty good fantasy yarn that is just dark, brooding, and complex enough to interest (some) adults, but not so much so that the younger members of the family won't find something to enjoy, despite the film's length. I am an avid fan of fantasy, but am cautious of break-out franchises, and before plopping down in front of &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; I was fairly certain I would dislike the film (especially given that it has the misfortune of competing with &quot;The Fellowhip of the Ring,&quot; which blows it out of the water). Much to my surprise, that was not the case. It's a good film with lots of atmosphere and capable direction. I'm eager for the next.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Resident Evil is, quite simply, the best video game to motion picture conversion to date. Now, granted, that may not sound like much given the ineptitude of films like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, but it is a genuinely good horror film by any standards, and has its share of creepy atmosphere and flesh-munching zombies (and worse). Sure it employs a predictable soundtrack of techno and metal riffs, but it's appropriate enough here. Resident Evil is a far cry from Dog Soldiers and The Brotherhood of the Wolf, but it's got enough of the goods to make it worthwhile.

B000001OAA|5.0|This album still gets high rotation in my CD player, 7+ years after its release. It's an incredibly unique CD that captured my attention when it came out. Garbage is comprised of Shirley Manson (Vocals, guitar), Duke Erikson (guitars, keyboards, etc), Steve Marker (guitar, bass, etc), Butch Vig (drums, efx, etc). This is one of the more innovative and original debut albums I have heard, a pretty influencial album if you ask me. There's a mix of everything here. This is by far their darkest album, there's lots of grungy type guitars, but they also manage to encorporate different noises, you'll probably hear different sounds each time you turn on the CD.<br />Shirley's vocals are captivating. Haunting at one minute, next she is seductive. There is not one bad song on this album. As one reviewer pointed out, each song could have stood on its own as a single. My personal favorite is the closing track \\"Milk\\", a high note to end the album on. Very haunting melody and lyrics. \\"Supervixen\\" has a unique start/stop sound to it. The album actually has a lot of lyrics that I think a lot of people could relate to, about feeling different from everyone else. \\"Queer\\" is a good example. \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" is a fairly depressing song that works itself into an anthem.<br />This CD works on a lot of levels, worth many many many repeated listenings. One of the best bands to come out on the 90s in my opinion. Give this one a shot, it's a great CD.
B00006M183|5.0|The newest studio album from Pearl Jam, to me, reaches, if not exceeds, the rank of &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy&quot;.  This album has a pefect mix of hard-core metal, with amazing solos and soft more instrumental songs, like those from &quot;Yeild&quot; such as &quot;Low Light&quot;.  Mike has terrific parts in almost every song.  My favorite would have to be &quot;Ghost&quot; or &quot;All or None&quot;.  You can tell that &quot;All or None&quot; will become one of those songs like Yellow Ledbetter that frequently closes an amazing live performance.  This cd proves that Pearl Jam can still make great music and since 1990 has never lost its ability to please its listeners.  This is a must have for any PJ fan as well as any music fan in general and as always PJ surpirses us with creative songs, like the chant &quot;Arc&quot; or the spoken, yet relative &quot;Bushleaguer.&quot;  I would bet that crowd favorites would be &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; which inculdes alot of keyboards from Boom, as well as &quot;Ghost&quot; and the very upbeat &quot;Green Disease.&quot;  Buy it now, it will be a great one to keep!!
B000002GVO|5.0|My FIrst Classic Rock Album! I bought this my sophomore year in H.S. Still own it and love it! Get this... It's a classic!
B00006V9A0|5.0|I am a very big fan of Bob Ludwig and the folks at Gateway Mastering Studios, so I was really looking forward to this new NIRVANA cd to hear the sonic treatment that they gave this highly touted \\"newly remastered\\" classic NIRVANA music. Generally the classic material on this disc was a disappointment. I own the original master recordings of BLEACH, NEVERMIND and IN UTERO, and the sound on this new NIRVANA disc does not even compare to the sound on these older original master recording CDs. From my listening tests, this new NIRVANA cd has compressed the dynamic range at least 4 decibles, and a full 6 decibles on HEART SHAPED BOX. According to the liner notes, Kurt Cobain was a master at the soft loud musical arrangement, and because of this a NIRVANA fan would naturally want to hear Kurt's music played back with as much dynamic range as possible. (For those non-audiophile Amazon.com customers, dynamic range is the difference between the soft and the loud passages of a musical arrangement.)  Gateway Mastering Studios has all of the latest high tech mastering equipment, and Bob Ludwig is famous for his ability to make music come to life with a realism that most engineers in the business can only fream of, so what happened to this NIRVANA disc? Well there are two possibilities. Maybe SubPop DGC's pressing equipment was not up to par to reproduce a full blown sonic experience of NIRVANA music and consequently compressed Bob Ludwig's digital masters. Or maybe SubPop did not provide Gateway Mastering with the first generation master tapes of NIRVANA's original songs. What ever the reason, this disc does not even come close to the original master recording CDs that are now in general circulation. Is this disc worth buying? Definately, at least for the new single alone. But buyer beware, the digital domain is fraught with many a gremlins, and this disc contains quite a few sonic demons.
B000069HKH|3.0|Okay, before everyone shouts to me, \\"You're not an American if you don't love this album!!!\\" this record is a good, solid, and mature effort, and a welcome relief to the disposable teeny pop we've all suffered through for five plus years.<br />However, this isn't the classic it's being hailed as.  Bruce tries to go for the gold with a concept album of sorts and he falls short, but not for lack of trying.  The main problem is his lyrics.  Too many times he uses the same phrases or the same key words \\"faith,\\" \\"hope,\\" \\"strength,\\" and granted, he's always had a fondness for them, but now it's on serious overload.  And the album is WAY too long.  15 songs, over 70 minutes, it's too much.  And given how some of these songs are forgettable, a little trimming would've helped the overall album.<br />But let's get to the good stuff: the title track, \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"Into the Fire\\" are all great songs, lyrically, melodically, and musically.  But we start getting into problems  when the burden of recreating the feelings of loss and bewilderment nearly crush him.  And that's when the lyrics get weaker, b/c they are the same lyrics of the previous track.  \\"Give me your kiss....\\"  \\"Your love, your dream....\\"  It cheapens the overall effect he's going for.  And I'll be honest, concept records don't work for me b/c they are too restricted.  And \\"The Rising\\" is a concept record, for anyone who wants to deny it.  It's all about Sept. 11, and that's the main problem.  He's restricted himself to write about one event, granted it caused a thousand feelings, but sometimes you can summarize them in one song, which he has in the title track.  But the record gets repeative lyrically and musically and I can't listen to it all the way through.  While individual songs may stand on their own, as album it ultimately stumbles.<br />But I will give Bruce credit for trying such a monumental task and though it didn't quite work in the end, it's still a better record than most of what was released this past year.
B00006V9A0|3.0|This cd does offer some new stuff despite the mass misperception.<BR><br /><BR>1. You Know You're Right<BR><BR>2. Been A Son (different recording)<BR><BR>3. Pennyroyal Tea (remixed)<BR><br /><BR>Other than that, it's all rehash! I personally love the new version of Been A Son which was mentioned in the book Come As You Are. It includes Chris's &quot;tasty bass solo&quot;. Pennyroyal Tea's remix is much better than the In Utero version, although not entirely that much different. Finally, You Know You're Right is a good song, but in my opinion not worthy of being a &quot;Greatest Hit&quot;.<BR><BR><br /><BR>It's true the cd lacks some hits including: Polly, Love Buzz, and Anuerysm. I recommend this cd to newcomers of Nirvana, but to hardcore fans, I'd spend it on something else. This cd is an obvious ploy to make money for Courtney Love, and lucky you, just in time for the holidays!<BR>
B0000636UN|3.0|I agree with one reviewer...this CD is TOO PERFECT.  Every beat is hit, every nob turned to the right level, every instrument carefully chosen and placed, every note calculated and sung...but somehow it doesn't rank up there with &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; or &quot;The Globe Sessions.&quot;<br />It's hard to explain why this record is a disappointment but that's what it is: a disappointment.  Things get off to a great start with &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; a song that lived up to its title.  &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; is fun...not great, but fun for what it is...a Pepsi commercial.  &quot;You're An Original&quot; gets back to Sheryl rocking but then we switch to huge balladry in &quot;Safe and Sound.&quot;  But then it's back to rocking and so on and so on.<br />And maybe that's the problem.  The album never swings too much in one direction and when it starts to, it switches back to the other side.  Something for everyone.  And that makes for a predictable record.  I could almost hear the next song coming up, I could predict it's melody, groove, and style before the previous track finished.  and that makes for a boring listen.  <br />But then it gets stuck in your head.  I'll be riding in my car and I'm still humming &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot; or &quot;Lucky Kid.&quot;  So I can't write off the record...but I can't whole heartily recommend it.  Sheryl could've taken some chances with this record, especially after she started to with &quot;The Globe Sessions.&quot;  But she didn't.  Maybe it's b/c the new pop landscape might've rejected what she had to offer.  &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; a surefire single I thought, peaked at 54.  And despite the fact that the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack sold 2 million units, roots music is still being largely ignored on the radio.  So maybe that explains this record a bit more, and why it's split down the middle: business vs. music.  &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is an album essentially about that debate.<br />Take for instance &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; a horrendously cheesy ballad I can't believe Ms. Crow would allow on record, especially after such artistic successes as &quot;Home,&quot; &quot;Redemption Day,&quot; and &quot;The Difficult Kind.&quot;  but then there's &quot;Weather Channel,&quot; without a doubt the most brilliant song on the record about depression.  It's haunting, it's sparsely played, it's something that radio and record execs would shutter b/c it makes them think too much.  Here's another one: &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; a wonderful ballad (even though it's way too over the top, I prefer the &quot;America: A Tribue to Heroes&quot; version) about regrets, heartbreak, and loss.  Though written before Sept. 11, it has an all new impact that makes a powerful song all the more so.  But then there's &quot;Soak Up The Sun,&quot; a nonthreatening little ditty that probably took 2 minutes to write and even the most tone deaf person could sing, even though it has my favorite opening line of all time: &quot;My friend the Communist.&quot;  But you get the idea?<br />So if you don't own any Sheryl Crow records, I'd stick with the first three.  If you do own them, you'll probably want this one to add to your collection.  But, if you're like me, after the last note fades away, you'll wonder what the album would've been like if Sheryl stuck to &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and &quot;Weather Channel&quot; and gave radio and her record label the middle finger.  After all, isn't that what &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is supposed to be about?
B00006SFBD|4.0|First off, compared to Opeth's previous release \\"Blackwater Park\\", this album is different. Don't expect the same formula. The song structures on Deliverance are simpler, and have less depth. Whereas on Blackwater Park, the songs have multiple levels and at times greatly layered soundscapes. Deliverance does not deliver on this level!!<BR><br />But if you are looking for progression in their song writing, and experimenting, than yes, Opeth have delivered. The singer has brought forward new singing styles, including his more cryptic sounding growl, and even some pretty mellow tracks that almost sound like Depeche Mode. The guitars have done some new things on here as well.<br />In my opinion Blackwater Park outdoes Deliverance. Deliverance isn't as complex.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I suggest everyone buy Christina's new album. She's finally doing her own thing and it sounds amazing. There is a little of everything on the album pop, rock, hip hop, even a hippie vibe on certain songs. If your interested in trying something new, this is the one to try.
B00006M183|5.0|Beautiful album (is that still an accurate term if I listened to it on CD?) through and through.  After much anticipation and hope, the release strikes hard, no doubt adding a slew of songs to a Pearl Jam catalogue that bursts at the seams.  Resonant, head shaking, poetic.  My thanks to Pearl Jam for living up to their own standards.  Bring on the tour in North America!
B00006M183|5.0|If you like the direction of pearl jam's music is moving towards you will love this album.  It starts out slow with &quot;Can't Keep&quot; and than pumps through the walls with &quot;Save You&quot;.  Matt Cameron on drums plays hard and keeps the song strong.  Eddie sounds great.  &quot;All you need is love&quot; has not been said enough says &quot;Love Boat Captain. Great song.  Album rolls through and you never have to skip a track.  &quot;I Am Mine&quot; has meaning that hits us all, &quot;I only own my mind ..... we're all different behind the eyes theres no need to hide&quot;. &quot;Thumbing my Way&quot; is a acoustic song which is written great and sung with great emotion. Eddie out did himself.  As soon as that is done &quot;You Are&quot; is a bit darker song which brings back memorys of old albums.  &quot;Green Disease&quot; up tempo sharing are great disease. The album ends with &quot;All or None&quot; slow and meaningful, great line, &quot;our destinations are the ones weve been before&quot;.  This album has a lot of the sound of No Code but you can tell that they have used influences from everyone they have played with.  Thier music is becoming very mature as it should be from the best band today.  Growing old makes all of the branches much thicker for good or bad.  In this albums case it is a good thing.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Mr. Lynch is certainly a talented director, and this film will backup his skills. Yet this film is really just a demonstration of Lynch's directing skills and not really a decent film in its own right...If the script was better than this film would have been an all star, but the story just leaves too many holes. Think about it, if the film was directed in a more conventional way, it wouldn't really get any praises. This is  just too artsy, I mean it looks good, but I just don't see any substance backing all the eye candy.
0448060191|5.0|This book was really good. It tells you how you should do things thing when you grow up. It is a romantic love story between 3 girls, who are named Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Beth dies, in the middle of the book. Over all it is a very good bokk 12 and up is a good age to read it.
B00006M183|5.0|In the late 90's many bands existed that put out a whole CD that was worth listening too, Since then most CD's consisted of one or two tracks that are good and a couple of decent songs, if we got that much, Pearl Jam has here an album that is great from start to finish and is good enough to listen too over and over again. This Album just plain rocks, Thank You Pearl Jam for giving us some good music to listen too once again.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This is yet one of my favorite romantic comedy movies of the 80's. With such stars as Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City), Estell Getty (Golden Girls), James Spader, G.W. Bailey (Police Academy), and Meshach Taylor (Designing Women).<BR>It's about a man Jonathan Switcher who isn't having much luck job wise (Who is these days), until he creates his masterpiece Mannequin, and finds her while working at a new job at Prince in Company (A failing store). She comes to life and tells him that she was born many years and centuries ago in Egypt, together they build magnificent store windows that helps Prince in Company get more than back on their feet. However, another rival company is trying to get their business back and by what ever means possible. As well as stealing Emmy (the Mannequin) to get Jonathan to work for them.<BR>I think this classic romantic comedy is still a hit today with great colorful characters such as Hollywood, the quirky cop, and the romantic story line between Emmy (Kim Cattrall) and the handsome Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy).<BR>Let's not forget the hit song by Starship called \\"Nothing's Going to Stop Us.\\" Everyone today will love this movie. Even though its corney as well as it's storyline Mannequin will be a classic 80's film throughout the years.<BR>The DVD is pretty average it has a trailer and a few other related movie trailers. I was hopping it would have the music video for \\"Nothing's Going to Stop Us\\" but no such luck. A huge plus is that it has a Widescreen or Fullscreen choice. So it makes up for all of the stuff it doesn't have.<br />So I would give the movie A and the DVD a C! But it is still worth the buy for this movie and if your a DVD collector. :)
B00006M183|5.0|Since the early days, Pearl Jam has been giving us what's rock all about. This album is another example of their way in music: simple, brilliant, inspirational and true!<BR>No vanity, no big production videos, no 'hot lookin' girls around... just 5 guys with their instruments doing what they know, sincere music. Thanks for all of this, for being always you. Let there always be people like you.<BR>For all you fans, buy this right away, you won't get disapointed! It's another awsome piece of art...
B000069CWE|3.0|it was an alright cd but it wasnt no hybrid theory. I dont like  rap and i am disappoined that linkin park went to that. i am a rocker and i hope linkin park can come back to the hard rock style that was showed in hybrid theory. if you dont like rap dont get this cd
B00004XMSN|5.0|&quot;The Bishop's Wife,&quot; is such an entertaining and heartwarming film, not just for the Holidays but anytime.  It deserves all the stars it can get.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  It's well worth seeing and Loretta Young, David Bivan and Cary Grant make a wonderful and all star cast.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is nothing short of remarkable.  Words cannot say or speak to the level of emotion that this film conveys.  <br />The film is centered around a young woman who, in her childhood, experienced almost no physical or emotional contact.  Upon discovering a hidden treasure of someone else's young memories, Amelie had found her epiphany and unlocked her meaning in life: to bring joy to others.<br />However, Amelie's route to doing so must be at her own expense.  She cannot know the joy of someone expressing emotion to her, she had the past to keep that from happening.  She must effect joy on those from a distance, bringing a cornucopia of amusing and elaborately plotted situations that were remotely devised without anyone discovering her.  However, when given her own chance for happeniness, when discovering that the man she loves wants to know her, she is unable to do it.<br />Here, the film shows a young woman with tremendous heart, yet tremendous anxiety.  This heroine also has the ability to touch the heart of the viewer.  Yes, through the magic of television, she makes the viewer cheer for her as she cheers for others.  The film is pure genius.  Bravo!
0140430350|5.0|i think this is one of my top favorites of all the classical works I've read.  William Makepeace Thackeray, shows his masterpiece here.  It's long, but well worth the read, and you learn a lot from it, and it really is a good and interesting story, with characters yoou really get to know.
B00005AUBA|4.0|The music found here is mostly soft, ambient and atmospheric rock. Mogwai seems very experimental, but in a casual, laid-back way. They're defanately not trying to show off. This is my first CD by Mogwai, so I cannot compare to older albums. A common complaint is that it is quite short, only 38 minutes, but it doesn't need to be any longer. I think two of the songs are less than a minute long though, and don't really seem to fit.<br />By &quot;minimalistic&quot; I mean the songs are a lot of repetitive, simple guitar playing, but not always. I'm not saying that's bad, I like it, but it's probably an acquired taste. Some standout tracks are &quot;Dial:Revenge,&quot; apparently sung in Welsh, and has a very nice tune, the epic, uplifting &quot;2 Rights Make 1 Wrong,&quot; the opener &quot;Sine Wave&quot; with its strange staticy electronic percussion, and probably the favorite by most &quot;Take me Somewhere Nice&quot; which really does take you somewhere nice with its dim, subtle vocals and strings that bring a warm, feeling.<br />If you like Godspeed, Sigur Ros, and other post-rock stuff like that, you'll most likely enjoy this too.
B00006M183|5.0|While the press will tell you that rock lives in young bands like the Strokes and the Hives, one listen to Riot Act proves that the veterans still have a huge claim in the rock 'n roll game.  Pearl Jam have always released incredible albums.  Often imitated, never duplicated.  On their seventh studio release, these grunge vets reveal a newfound energy.  Songs like &quot;Save You&quot; and &quot;Get Right&quot; will blow your mind.  You want anthems, but sick of the nasty sound of Creed?  Check out &quot;Love Boat Captain,&quot; &quot;Cropduster,&quot; or &quot;I Am Mine.&quot;  <BR>Eddie and co. seem to use all of the elements that made their previous albums great on this one.  Riot Act almost feels like a greatest hits collection while remaining all new tracks.  IT'S THAT GOOD!<BR>Do yourself a favor: if you're a old fan, buy this album.  If you're a new curious listener, buy this album.  You won't be sorry.
B00004U28G|1.0|This movie is silly! It is about a wild cross country chase. Are you a Jackie Chan fan? Yes, well Jackie only has a few cameo appearences. I suggest renting it before buying it!
B000069AUI|5.0|Being an afficianado of British rock, I had high hopes for the latest Coldplay offering.  All, I can really say, is that this album not only surpasses the first (no trivial feat, I can assure you) but is possibly the best album I have ever had the good fortune to hear.  Just about every song on the album is a musical gem... This is music that means something.  Do yourself a favour and buy yourself a copy.  It just may be the best investment you ever make.  Listen to &quot;The Scientist&quot; and see if you can disagree!
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is a gripping memoir about a young boy named Frank growing up in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. His troubled world is full of death, disease, and starvation which is further complicated by his father's drinking problem and the depression of his mother. Frank is forced to become an adult at an early age taking on the responsibility of supporting his family while his father is in England squandering away his earnings. Through all his hardships Frank learns to see life in a new light and dreams of the place where he can leave all his troubles behind and start a new life.<BR> Frank McCourt's tale leaps off its pages creating a vivid picture of his early childhood. Once I started reading this book I couldn't wait to see what happens in the end. Frank's life is so fascinating and tragic that it left me wanting to know more. Rarely does a writer capture life's ups and downs in such a remarkable way. Readers everywhere will be touched by McCourt's story of survival and growth.
B000060MMI|5.0|Out of all the sorta punk-irish CD's I have purchased over the years (Dropkick Murphy's, Pogues..you name it)...this is my absolute favorite.<br />I love the mix of the punk, traditional and sorta bluegrass sound this has.  Most of the tracks have a very fast punk beat to it with an abundance of traditional Irish instruments (including , a penny whistle, go figure) but there are a couple that are a bit slower which give you some breathing time to slam down that stout and get back in  the pit for more. The lyrics are brilliant as well, very tounge in cheek references to the old school Irish Catholic rhetoric.<br />As an added bonus, the title &quot;Rebels of the Sacred Heart&quot; is amazing....would make a might fine tattoo wouldn't you say?<br />This CD is right up  there with the Pogues &quot;Rum, Sodomy and the Lash&quot;, if you loved that, you will adore this.
B000002AVF|4.0|&quot;Daydream&quot; remains the most satisfying of all Mariah Carey albums she released in the first decade-or-so of her career. On the way from ballad-heavy blockbuster &quot;Music Box&quot; to her liberated post-divorce self presented very visibly (also on the covers) on hip-hop laced recent CDs, &quot;Daydream&quot; was the last album the singles from which mercilessly outclassed the competition on American pop-charts. For that matter, the singles deserved it but the album offers more.<BR>Exploring new grounds is the original &quot;Fantasy&quot; featuring samples from Tom Tom Club's &quot;Genius of Love&quot;. The song with not a particularly memorable melody, but hippy enough to leave a stamp as one of Mariah's signature tunes.<BR>Duet with Boyz II Men, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, was a result of clever marketing strategy and as such had an enormous chart success in America, but does not stand out on this strong collection. Rather, the playful &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; (another No.1 on the charts) along with &quot;Long Ago&quot; are the tracks that made Mariah sound very contemporary and paved the way to her R&amp;B future.<BR>The powerful voice is at work on the remake of &quot;Open Arms&quot;, gospel-influenced &quot;I Am Free&quot; and a definite highlight, power ballad &quot;When I Saw You&quot;, which has the singer in an understated mood first, before soaring to her usual heights on the wings of simple but enchanting chorus.<BR>Babyface collaboration &quot;Melt Away&quot; teems with positive chemistry between the two (although the Face's voice cannot be heard), even if it's a bit oversung. &quot;Forever&quot; rounds out the moods as if hailing from decades ago; way-too-sweet lyric is compensated by modest arrangement and innocent, vulnerable feeling to the song. The closer &quot;Looking In&quot; features auto-bio lyrics and sublime guitar work serving well to end the album at just the right moment.<BR>&quot;Daydream&quot; magic lies in its hidden cohesiveness and state-of-the-art production, proving that Mariah Carey's talent is too big to play down. The former Ms Tommy Mottola may have been helped by him (and certainly was) to launch the stellar career, but it was her writing, producing and singing skills that had a lion's share in her becoming what she was and -- despite the unlucky year 2001 -- still is.
0786915749|5.0|I had just finished reading Lord of the Rings triology when somebody recommended Dragonlance books.   It sounded more like children's tale but I decided to give it a try. Later I realized I like it more than Lord of the Rings, even if the plot seems to be 'inspired' from it.   The book talks about an unlikely group of companions, Tanis the half elf, Caramon the big warrior, Raistin, Caramon's twin and a magic user, Goldmoon and Riverwind the barbarians, Tas the cheerful kender and Flint the brave dwarf, who come together to save the world from the evil queen and her dragon armies.  The companions find themselves sucked into the war between good and evil and there's only one way to get out of it...their death or worse, eternal slavery of the evil queen.  Definitely among the best fiction I have read.   It is worth the money...BUY IT!  Follow up reading: Dragons of Winter Night (book 2 of 3)
0312979479|3.0|This book will have a grasp on you as soon as you open it. Ten strangers, a curious assortment of men and women from different walk of life, are summoned as weekend guests to a private island off the coast of Devon by a mysterious man U. N. Owen. Each guest identifies common relations with Owen and yet Owen is unknown to them. It is a pre-announced murder spree. One by one, the house guests fall prey to an unknown, myseterious killer in the house, according to the scheme walled up in individual guest room-the rhyme of ten Indian boys. This is a book that fills up with suspense, panic, and thrill. As more house guests fall prey, the remnants escalate vigilance but also distrust. Speculation and doubts roam in of their mind. And only the dead are above suspicion. This is definitely a page turner. I finish the book in a day, with perspiring hands, accelerating pulse and a cloud of speculation in my mind. Good read. 3.3 stars.
B000060MY6|2.0|I've read the reviews on here who say that if you want to be \\"spoon-fed\\" a plot, this movie isn't for you. And also ones that say if \\"ya can't follow it, sit back and enjoy the lesbians!\\" Here's my two-cents.<br />I couldn't follow it, and I didn't care that I couldn't. I love discussing movies, often for hours afterwards, but this movie did nothing other than make me sigh and go \\"here's another one that my 'artistically-holier-than-thou' friends will all analyze, and likely wrongly.\\"<br />All I could picture was David Lynch sitting back and having a chuckle at creating another bizarre movie. Which he has done. I enjoyed the film's visuals (minus, of course, the requisite and completely pointless naked lesbian scenes). I didn't like the characters or the acting one bit.<br />Can a movie be made featuring a lesbian couple that doesn't throw in the gratuitous naked scenes? Why do directers exploit lesbianism the way they do? David Lynch may be masqerading as a brilliant originalist, but at heart he \\"digs porn\\" and caters to a male, voyeuristic audience, complete with two stereotypical porn characters: the blonde, fresh-faced girl-next-door, and the sultry, dark haired vamp. Betty and Veronica, anyone? Perhaps an interesting cliche, but add the lesbian factor and the guarantee that they WILL be naked together at some point, and you've got a perfect recipe to please the schoolboy mentality in 50% of the veiwing audience. PLEASE.<br />So a part of this audience will sit back, watch this film, and then afterwards chuckle at how mindless some people are for not following its \\"brilliance.\\" Then, of course, will come the \\"private reflection\\" on certain other scenes. Lots of room for claiming to love the deepness of the film when in actuality, I feel it is a shameless exploitation of lesbianism with enough \\"wacky weirdness\\" to cover as an \\"artsy movie.\\"
B00006JKON|5.0|&quot;War Child&quot; came on the heels of the album-long epics &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; and &quot;A Passion Play&quot; and was originally intended to be a film soundtrack. The film never materialized, leaving a solid set of songs. David Palmer's orchestral arrangements shine throughout, and the album even provided a hit single in the US (Bungle in the Jungle, coincidentally the weakest track on the album). <br />This album also include remnants from earlier Tull albums: &quot;Two Fingers&quot; is a reworking of &quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean&quot;, intended to be on Aqualung, and &quot;Only Solitaire&quot; which was part of the aborted Chateau d'Isaster Tapes. <br />My personal faves are the title track and its semi-reprise &quot;The Third Hurrah&quot;. The former smolders, the latter smokes! Other tracks include concert fave &quot;Skating Away&quot; the rollicking &quot;Sea Lion&quot; and &quot;Queen and Country&quot; and the subtle &quot;Ladies&quot; and &quot;Back-Door Angels&quot;.<br />There are 7 bonus tracks added, including &quot;Rainbow Blues&quot; and &quot;Glory Row&quot; (previously available on M.U. and Repeat), &quot;Saturation&quot; (from the 20 Years of JT box)and &quot;Sealion 2&quot;, &quot;Paradise Steakhouse&quot; and &quot;Quartet&quot; (from Nightcap). <br />The highlight of this album, though, is the previously unreleased &quot;Warchild Waltz&quot;, an all-orchestral piece reprising the musical themes of &quot;Warchild&quot; and &quot;The Third Hurrah&quot;. Those who have Ian Anderson's &quot;Divinities&quot; album know the utter depth of his compositional skills, and &quot;Waltz&quot; shows that in spades. Solid support is given throughout by guitarist Martin Barre, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond (bass) Barrie Barlow (drums) and John Evans (keyboards and accordian). Ian also plays some mean sax.<br />I give this album 5 thumbs up--buy it!
B00004ZD69|5.0|The minimalist packaging suggests that it is a poverty-stricken indie rock band trying to be mysterious. The name evokes some kind of Nordic black metal thing. (Key words being &quot;Emperor&quot; and &quot;black&quot;). It was described to me as &quot;epic.&quot; So I bought it, not really sure what I was going to be hearing.<br />No one could have described the music in a way that could have me anticipating its greatness. To me, the music of Godspeed You Black Emperor! is surreally powerful and nearly impossible to describe without resorting to trite comments. The band is a nine-piece &quot;post-rock&quot; group, accurately depicted by others as a rock orchestra -- the instrumentation includes violins, cello, guitars, bass, kit drums, percussion, and French horn (\m/). Entirely instrumental, GYBE!'s music is identified by its moody epics of a build-build-build-crescendo pattern. Each song on _Lift Your Skinny..._ is around 20-minutes long, consisting of individual movements that are about seven-minutes long. Movements build like the swell of the ocean, until a crest breaks in climax...then it begins anew.<br />It may sound repetitive, but this is not the case. Within this framework the band deploys dynamic creativity and musical worlds to spend a lifetime exploring. Ambient stretches, crying strings, booming guitar themes, astutely complex percussion, spoken word samples...the works -- all comprise this band's music. GYBE! creates some of the most compelling soundscapes I've heard from anyone. Even if a movement relies on the same melody all the way through, the nonpareil textural richness makes a seven-minute expanse seem to fade away all too quickly. There is so much to hear, but the sonic images are fleeting, as in a dream.<br />Each song tells a story, but only the listener can articulate it. For me, the music explores feelings of love and sadness, deeply melancholic but often with a glimmer of hope to be found. The album is worth every penny for the downright stunning first track on the second disc, &quot;Sleep&quot;. It is unquestionably one of the  most emotional pieces of music I have heard, and it defines this band's power for me. The beauty of &quot;Sleep&quot; lies in its crush of melancholy which persists for the first 18 minutes, before hope blooms with a spine-tingling, triumphant finale. Every song, not just &quot;Sleep&quot;, is an impressive excursion through music and emotion.  This is the only band I have heard so in touch with the emotional conveyance of their instruments that the drums are sad. SAD DRUMS!<br />My plans for world domination are on hold -- my new objective is to get all of this band's albums (easy, since they don't have many right now). When that is done, I can get back to building my super-laser.stunning first track on the second disc, &quot;Sleep&quot;.

B00006M183|5.0|Before I begin, I will preface and say that I have been an devoted Pearl Jam fan since the beginning; however that is not to say that I am biased one way or the other - I am able to dislike music they make.<br />But this album, in my opinion, is the best to hit the shelves since Ten and Vs.  There are 15 tracks on Riot Act (The most of any) and I can honestly say I enjoy listening to every single one.  Whether it's from the short musical \\"Arc\\" that has no words, or to songs like \\"Love Boat Captain\\", \\"Greendisease\\", \\"Crop Duster\\", \\"I am Mine\\", \\"Save You\\", \\"Can't Keep\\", etc, etc, etc... The great song list on this album is endless.<br />Bottom Line:  If you liked Ten, Vs., or even Yield, you will love this album.  It's a great addition in the PJ books and I give it a 10/10.  I waited 2 years for this and it was more than worth the wait.  Thank you Pearl Jam.
B00005B36H|5.0|_Lateralus_ defies any description one can muster with the English language. German would be a better choice, but even then one must inevitably find the words to be failing. This is the 21st century's paragon of progressive rock -- a work of art so deep there probably is no bottom. <br />If you are still reading, I have not yet been dismissed as a sycophantic Tool freak. This album is a uniquely spiritual experience for me. It can be heavy and dark and brooding, but ultimately _Lateralus_ is cathartic for the soul. Even \\"Ticks & Leeches\\", the angriest song on the album, is a purifying release. The culmination of the record's power, found in the \\"Discipline/Reflection/Triad\\" trilogy, is like the musical embodiment of a spiritual sojourn -- the soulful cry of Adam Jones' guitar, the crippling rumble of Justin Chancellor's bass, the elephant stampede of Danny Carey's drums, the winding croon of Maynard James Keenan's vocal. Individually, they are interesting but it is their magical synergy that makes Tool unique (among other things). No band creates the aural panorama Tool does -- no one comes anywhere close. They are utterly beyond compare. I would trace back some influence to King Crimson, obviously, but I believe influences are also rooted in abstract mathematics and the ancient musical vernacular of Africa, and who knows what else.<br />Now I'm probably just sounding capricious and fanciful. I thought I was coming to a point with the review, but I don't really think there was one. Hmm. Well, I used to like this album a lot. I grew to love it. Now I am so overwhelmed by its greatness that I can only stand paralyzed during its full 79 minutes. Only then can I devote my full attention to the music, and truthfully, I don't think I have a choice -- _Lateralus_ obliges the entirety of my brain. No album has the effect on me that this does. I'm almost scared of what Tool will do next.
B000063UR2|3.0|I enjoyed Legend when I first purchased the Theatrical version on VHS, and this DVD makes this good movie into an even greater experience. Now, the dvd gives you 2 versions, 1-the US theatrical release which runs at 1hr.30min,2- the Directors cut which runs at 1hr.54min with a new score implemented. I found the Theatrical release enjoyable but I always thought it needed a more in depth script, the actors were very good, the settings were great, the effects were awesome for its time, the story was a unique idea, and the directing was fantastic. Unfortunately, this is all working off of a just above average script, which simply needed to implement more action and more character depth. The first half leaves you wanting more, the second half engrossing you. <BR>The Directors cut gives you basically the same movie, a slow start and a good end, with some new scenes added in w/ new music but nothing to make the movie any more enjoyable (like for example: T2 or The Abyss). <BR>The extras I like, not a whole lot but great for the bargain . I love the \\"lost scenes\\" option. <BR>The best part is the 2 uniquely edited endings, one for the theatrical release and one for the directors cut. They both are basically the same ending; the directors cut working more off of the 2 lead characters feelings for each other thus better on a directions point of view, and the theatricals more charming \\"movie like\\" ending working off of the entire cast. Both work very well but I personally would like the theatricals ending after the directors cut film. <BR>In the end, if you've never seen this, give it a rent and if you like it, this dvd is a MUST HAVE, especially for the price. If you didn't think this was all that good, don't bother.
B00006CXXU|2.0|I personally think that Christinas voice is good (except when she just shouts), but in this album, most of all the songs are ballads, A cousin lend it to me, and i didnt finished it, it starts good, but it became kind of boring, Some songs has nice lyrics, but the beat is poor, I have just one advice, if you enjoyed the first cd of her, this would seem to you disappointing.

A new heros in town and i bet he'll be back again and again .<br />I know everyone who rents this movie will end up purchasing it .
B000002AGE|2.0|I hadn't listened to this for years, but lately I've been getting out my old LP's and checking them out.  I was surprised at how bland this recording is.  &quot;Birdland&quot; is one perky tune, sure, but the rest sounds so generic.  My wife said it reminded her of John Klemmer.  The advent of Jaco Pastorius was the beginning of the end for this band.  He was a truly gifted bassist, but his musical ideas were nothing more than run-of-the-mill.  Once Wayne Shorter decided to spend the rest of his career coasting, Zawinul and Pastorius took the band into increasingly dull directions.  &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; doesn't stand up over time.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I first heard of Laura Pausini through her Italian songs...was impressed when I saw her performing with Lara Fabian (another of my favourites) recently in Italy!<br />I really like this album, because Laura brings such a fresh new sound with her voice.  No vocal aerobics here, just a really good sexy raw sound that I have not heard lately with other artists!  She proves that not only can she do upbeat songs like her great single Surrender, but also some really beautiful ballad songs which she is known for in her Italian and Spanish songs! Just love Everyday is a Monday!<br />I highly recommend this album and think she has a very promising future ahead of her in the English market!! Hope that a tour results from this album!
B00006G8LB|1.0|I preordered this video because everyone was raving about it for months. I still can't believe how devoid of a plot, the shallowness of the characters and this untiring Yo-Yo \\"webbing\\" all over the city that quickly grew old. I'ld rather read the comic book!!!!!
B000002KXO|4.0|Fleetwood Mac was one of the great bands of the 1970s--but by the early 1980s the band was beginning to fragment under the twin weights of failed love affairs and competitive egos.  By the time MIRAGE was released in 1982, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Christine McVie were all involved in various solo projects, and although the album was generally well received its title proved phrophetic: with the exception of the single &quot;Gypsy,&quot; MIRAGE faded quickly away.<br />But time has a way of putting things into perspective.  MIRAGE is certainly no RUMORS, certainly no TUSK--but it is remarkably skillful.  And it has a surprisingly consistent sound: most of the arrangements are clean, the back-up vocals are amazingly liquid, and Buckingham eschews his usually edgy guitar in favor of a much more deliberately controlled sound.  The result is decidedly more &quot;pop&quot; than previous Fleetwood Mac recordings, but it also has an unexpectedly bell-like quality, rather like wind chimes made of guitar, piano, and the human voice.<br />What prevents me from giving this particular recording five stars is the material, some of which is noticeably weak.  &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; starts well, but its chanted chorus is both uninspired and a little annoying; &quot;Empire State&quot; is dismissable; &quot;Only Over You&quot; has a rather perfunctory quality.  And although very well done, &quot;That's Alright&quot; is so completely different in style that it feels out of place on this album.<br />But when Fleetwood Mac strikes gold, it is 24 karat.  &quot;Love in Store&quot; is solid opener, with Christine McVie's faintly blue voice playing off well against the up-beat content; McVie scores even more significantly with &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; which echoes the emotional power of &quot;Songbird&quot; without repeating that song's actual style.

0380789019|5.0|Let me start by saying that this was the first thing by Neil Gaiman that I ever read. I was immediately sucked in and finished the books within a few day, held captive by Richard Mayhew's story. <br />Door, the Marquis, the scary Croup and Vandemar, and the other characters confuse Richard, who at first does not understand the strange new world that he has fallen into. Or rather, put himself into, unintentionally, when he helped out an injured young street girl, not knowing who she was.<br />Neil Gaiman is a fantastic writer, he is my favorite, and I am proud to say that I now have my copy of Neverwhere signed by him!! His other works, such as the Sandman series, Smoke & Mirrors, and Stardust, are wonderful as well. Highly recommended!
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam's newest record, RIOT ACT, has been released today.  To understand RIOT ACT, it helps to understand what's happening with Pearl Jam's fellow bands of the grunge scene.  This review helps explain the context of what is going on these days, because those fans who keep waiting for another TEN or VS. to roll out just simply have no clue.  There will never be another TEN just like there will never be another NEVERMIND.  But there will be Pearl Jam, and, hopefully, for many years will be around to show us what a real rock and roll band can do.<br />The year's 2002.  Cobain's been dead eight years.  The compilation NIRVANA has been released, showing off the `long lost' Nirvana cut \\"You Know You're Right.\\"  A Nirvana box set has been indefinitely postponed because of legal wranglings among bandmates Krist Novoselic and David Grohl and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love.    Layne Staley died this year because of drugs.  Jerry Cantrel has gone solo.  Cantrel's record, Degradation Trip, show us just how badly drugs ruined Alice in Chains, ruing their chance at a fully productive career. Soundgarden broke up five years ago (has it really been that long?).  The Smashing Pumpkins called it quits in 2000.  Scott Wieland has been in and out of drug treatments so many times he almost defines that old cliche of `sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Bush is still going, but they were never innovators in the first place.  Who's left of the old crew?  Not many.  Of the major players, Pearl Jam alone has persevered, and even they have long ago left grunge.<br />Pearl Jam has traveled a long road since they broke out with their debut TEN, emerging as a seminal Seattle band along with the likes of Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains.  Pearl Jam, of the major bands from that scene, has always been the most classic-rock oriented of the bunch.  While Nirvana was essentially an indie-rock band with some heavy undercurrents and Soundgarden was just heavy, Pearl Jam, from the very beginning, has tempered their sound with the sensibilities of the `classic rock' of the 1970s.  It's no surprise Eddie Vedder's favorite record as a teen was The Who's QUADROPHENIA.<br />While Nirvana blew apart the country musically with their seminal NEVERMIND, it is Pearl Jam that kept grunge going.  Nirvana was rooted much more in a punky, indie sound while Pearl Jam made 1970s rock informed by 1990s angst.  Pearl Jam stayed within in the grunge movement, though, and helped shape the genre for its short life, being one of it's major players.<br />Of course, the Seattle scene, one could argue, ended when Cobain was found dead from his own hand.  Grunge petered out.  It's my belief that, while maybe not in their personal lives, Pearl Jam was on the same downward spiral musically as Cobain was in real life.  Their first three records (TEN, VS., and VITALOGY) get progressively darker, bottoming out at \\"Immortality.\\"  Everything Pearl Jam have done since then is very drastically different from the grunge sound they helped pioneer.  <br />Since VITALOGY, Pearl Jam given the world four records (1996's NO CODE, 1998's YIELD, 2000's BINAURAL, and 2002's RIOT ACT).  None of these records sound like grunge but they all sound like Pearl Jam very naturally evolving.  Pearl Jam was on a crash course and I believe Cobain's death got them out of their own downward spiral.<br />These four records sound much like a classicist rock band than anything else.  NO CODE is very radical. NO CODE is very startling because just a mere two years ago these guys had released the very dark, angry, almost nihilistic VITALOGY and now they'd grown reflective and, well, rather subdued, like they've lost all their rage.  They loosened up; they've grown philosophical and reflective.  Refer to my review of NO CODE for more about my beliefs on how important this album is in the Pearl Jam story.  While NO CODE is the first album length work we had from the band since 1994, the \\"Merkinball\\" E.P. helps foreshadow this change in their career.<br />Since that record, Pearl Jam has been playing whatever music they want, sounding like a 1970s leftover.  As far as current musical trends, Pearl Jam hasn't been relevant since 1994 when grunge fell apart, and quite frankly the world is better for Pearl Jam pursuing their own path.  The late 1990s saw us in a wasteland of teeny-bob boy bands on one side and dark, entirely too serious angst `new metal' on the other.  Even Cobain made fun music, but not bands like Creed.  These are serious times and the world is just so terrible, so we must make serious music.<br />Pearl Jam, with RIOT ACT, hasn't changed the direction they are moving in, and have been their entire career.  Eddie Vedder and the boys are so far left of what's happening in the music today that, ironically, they show just how relevant they really are.  Pearl Jam shows us that when a band evolves and goes where it needs too to survive and prosper that, whatever's going on around them, they will be better for it.  For those awaiting another TEN, RIOT ACT will not soothe that taste.  Just like people, bands change and their identity evolves.  There will never be another TEN from these boys, and if there was it would be a regression.  People calling for another TEN or VS. haven't been with Pearl Jam since 1995.  <br />For those looking for one of America's great rock and roll bands making great music, totally out of step with mainstream (Thank God) and showing how impressive they actually are. RIOT ACT hits home, and it hits hard.  Pearl Jam shows us that they can still write a melody, they are still growing musically, they can still maintain their political stance without becoming a parody of themselves, and most of all, Pearl Jam shows us with RIOT ACT how a great band makes great music.
0440180295|5.0|... Slaughterhouse-Five is a convoluted tale, and thus difficult to describe.  On first inspection, it is the story of Billy Pilgrim, a drafted soldier who survives the infamous firebombing of Dresden.  It¡¦s the meaning, however, the overall effect of the book, that is important.  The novel is not actually about a man who lives his life out of chronological order, or a man who was abducted by aliens from the fourth dimension, or even a lost soul in a world full of pain and countless sufferings.  It is about an average man, a boy really, trying to cope with war, who¡¦s horrors nobody can easily endure.  In his creation, Vonnegut highlights the same twisted humor that must have been shared by anything that created such a world.  Billy is representative of every poor person forced to face offhanded death and hatred.  It is a moving experience to join this category so vividly, as you will be while Vonnegut¡¦s work unfolds.<BR>     Kurt Vonnegut dispenses entirely with a beloved part of great writing: foreshadowing.  Somehow, Vonnegut tells you the whole story in the first few pages and then keeps you enthralled for two hundred more.  Slaughterhouse-Five is not simply the story of a young optometrist turned soldier.  It is about the inescapable desensitization to death and the unhealthy alterations the mind of a human must undergo to make sense of so much destruction.<BR>     Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the defining postwar novels.  Gripping yet horrifying, this astounding novel will be embraced by any reader looking to be moved to a whole new perspective on war, humans, and life in general.<br />-...
0440133688|5.0|Since I am not a medical professional, I certainly cannot comment on the accuracy of Shem's book. But, as a member of an ethnic group that values black humor I can testify that this one hilarious title.<br />The characters are interns in an urban teaching hospital. As such they are under pressure no human should have to endure. Their response is to laugh, darkly. In my opinion if they hadn't laughed they'd have lost their minds.<br />There are so many wonderful characters--the Fat Man, the resident who knows all, Little Otto, \\"whose name still rings no bells ding, ding in Stockholm.\\" I'm not explaining Little Otto to you; go read the book. <br />_The House of God_ was written in the 1970's and is a product of that time. Shem needs to revise the book to tell the world what horrors managed care has brought to the lives of overworked and underpaid interns and residents. I have my suspicion that wrangling with insurance companies has tripled their insane workload. <br />If you are fortunate enough to be under the care of a good physician, read this if only to appreciate how damn hard they work.
B000065V1V|5.0|This album is great, a post-modern album within the creator's vast boundary and age, with all the feel of a classic. An album's worth can be deceived by production but here it really stands out. So where do we start?<br />The covers, all great throwaways, Bowie does his business here. The Pixies' Cactus, Neil Young's I've Been Waiting For You, and an obscure oddity I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship. Bryan Ferry must be kicking himself - great coverer as he is.<br />His own highlights? The bookends Sunday and Heathen. The latter really is Sunday part 2, both moody and atmospheric - great. Slip Away - great ballad - apparently about a TV show star called Uncle Floyd. Slow Burn - great rocker with guitar by Who great Pete Townshend, it could be about 9/11. Then there's 5:15 The Angels Have Gone - a stunning ballad(?) with a truly great drum solo - the cd's worth it for this song alone. The rest is not bad at all either, one of my favourites being A Better Future - for Bowie's artistic return indeed! Get it now, I can't stop playing it in the car, neither will you.
B000065U1N|1.0|People that view such blatantly jingoistic codswollop as entertainment are truly misguided. Is a thoroughly biased and unapologetic representation of the ugliness of conflict (especially on a continent like Africa) what could be considered a 'popcorn' film? Some might call it propaganda, especially considering the geopolitical (and socioeconomic) status of the world at present. Utter filth. Read up on a few alternate sources of history, open your eye's instead of watching something so easy to imbibe from the comfort of your armchair. Please. THE REPRESENTATION OF SUCH EVENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ENTERTAINMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!
B00006M183|5.0|Just when you worry if Pearl Jam can make yet another brilliant and breathtaking album they of course do it again. While on the whole completely different than any previous album, \\"Riot Act\\" shows Eddie, Mike, Stone, Matt, and Jeff growing as artists, even while releasing their 7th studio album, their place already engraved into rock history.<br />Much of what makes \\"Riot Act\\" great is that the band has pulled back a bit, most of the songs seem urgent, simple, not overworked to death in the studio.  Songs like \\"Can't Keep\\" and \\"Get Right\\" display this element perfectly.  \\"Love Boat Captain\\" shows Vedder shamelessly speaking of love with such sincerity that we can't be critical of it. As a lyricist he is usually so subtle, but his brief breakaway into pure emotion in the song is so gut-wrenching and powerful that you can't imagine any other line to sing than \\"All you need is love.\\"<br />One of the few experiments in production, however, does work in a real magical way.  \\"You Are\\" has pounding drums and effects-laden guitars that unite with Vedder's echoing voice as he sings \\"You are a tower and I'm the key\\". On the other hand, \\"Thumbing My Way\\" is so un-produced it could have been lifted from any good-quality live performance.  The band lets Eddie's voice and guitar stand on their own.<br />Perhaps the most blatantly political song can be found on \\"Riot Act\\". \\"Bushleaguer\\" takes sly digs at our president and fat-cat sponsored government as a whole. With a detached bitter spoken verse, the song knows exactly who it's aimed at, \\"A confidence man, but why so beleaguered?/He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer.\\"<br />The album has other surprises as well, including some near-punk tracks and even a haunting monk-like chant.  While no doubt this album will be as or more ignored as \\"Binaural\\", the band's remarkable previous effort, at least those who search for honesty and artistry in their music still have a band they can consistently turn to.
B00005RDVW|5.0|Of all Walt Disney's animated films, \\"Peter Pan\\" is my personal favorite.  This classic tale of the little boy who never grew up has Disney stamped all over it.  It also varies refreshingly from the versions that preceded it.  In previous plays acted on the stage, Peter Pan was always played by a young woman, but in the Disney version he is all boy.  He's brash, mischievous, more than a little cocksure of himself, able to fight and defeat a grown pirate captain, and on top of all this, he can fly.  What else is needed for a children's hero?  Tinker Bell is one of Disney's best inventions.  On the stage she is a blob of light flitting here and there; only in animation could she be realized as a real pixie, vain, conceited, totally devoted to Peter and madly jealous of Wendy.  The three children, Wendy, John and Michael, are very well done in the movie, and the opening family scenes are priceless.  When Peter and Tinkerbell sneak through the children's window, and zoom back out again with the children in tow, we want to sprinkle on some pixie dust and fly right out there with them.  Second star to the right, here we come.  The scenes at Neverland are funny and original, and the pirates are a riot.  One of Disney's most hilarious, and underrated, characters in all his films, is the crocodile, Hook's nemesis, who can't wait to get another chomp out of him.  (Poor Hook is reduced to a bundle of shattered nerves every time he hears that tick-tock, tick-tock coming towards his ship.)  The only negative in this film is the scene in the Indian village; the stereotypes that were accepted without question in the 1950s are almost embarrassing now.  However, it can't and doesn't detract from the fun.  The songs are okay, nut nothing special; it's the action and animation that make this movie.  Of all Disney's animated films, \\"Peter Pan\\" was the one I used to wish was real when I was a child.  Maybe there is a little of Peter Pan in all of us.

B000059QY2|5.0|This outstanding production of one of the greatest operas ever written is a fantastic way to introduce yourself (or someone you know) to opera for the first time, as well as a production that more experienced opera fans will cherish. The story and music are perfect, the acting and singing superb and the cinematography is excellent. This production grabs you from the beginning and never lets up. Don't pass up this DVD!<br /><br />Although the cover features a photo of Pavarotti as the lecherous Duke of Mantua, this production belongs to Ingmar Wixill, the real star, who simply shines as Rigoletto. He is a superb actor and manages to convey all the complexity of personality that the character of the hunchbacked Jester demands.  You will in turn despise him, pity him, and ultimately empathize with him as the tragedy unfolds. Other reviews have criticized him for not being a strong enough singer to pull off the role convincingly. I disagree completely with this. When he cries out &quot;Mia Fillia!&quot; (my daughter!) in despair it will send chills down your spine. The coarse, complex character of Rigoletto should not be sung by a honey voiced baritone anyway. Watching and listening to Wixill sing the aria &quot;Cortigiani, vil razza&quot; still gives me goosebumps after many viewings.<br /><br />Pavarotti is of course superb in the role of the Duke, acting fickle and singing his famous arias. &quot;Questo o quella&quot; and &quot;La Donna e Mobile&quot; are from this opera and he is in top form. What others have called his &quot;mugging&quot; for the camera to me portrayed very well his fickle nature; because you don't see it often it doesn't strike me as overdone. Pavarotti's real gift is not his acting but his voice (of course) and I unequivically add that his use of language or diction is distinctive and outstanding. If you listen carefully to the way he colors particular words and phrases to add meaning as he sings them you will come to appreciate him all the more.<br /><br />I must confess that the first time I saw this production I disliked Gruberova as Gilda in  the first act. Gilda seemed to me to be an airhead, and although Gruberova's voice is beautiful, she didn't seem to know what to do with her hands and didn't add any depth to the character. That changes as the story unfolds, however, and Gruberova's Gilda develops more complexity. All of the characters in this production are complex, but Gruberova seems to develop her character the most over the course of the production. When she  sings the word &quot;anguish!&quot; during &quot;tutte le feste al tempio&quot; as she tells her father about how she met the duke, I am totally with her in that anguish. Then, when held in her father's arms again, she is a frightened little girl. I am convinced she is perfect as Gilda in the quartet that comes near the end of the opera.<br />The other characters are excellent as well. Maddalena is voluptuous, and Sparafucile the assasin repulsive (but perhaps has more honor than all the rest!)<br />It is pointless to me to compare a film to a staged production. The film maker has different skills to bring to bear than does the director of a stage production. Camera angles become formost rather than placement of the characters on the stage. I personally like the way the focus changes in the film and the way the cinematography matches the mood of the music. But nothing will take the place of a real opera production on stage.<br />I highly recommend this production. Enjoy it for what it is and you will treasure it.BR>I must confess that the first time I saw this production I disliked Gruberova as Gilda in  the first act.

B00006RAKP|5.0|If you are tired of having to go through many compilations of Elton's hits to find just the right one to listen to then this set is the one you need. Universal finally got something right when it comes to Elton.  Although this package does leave off a significant amount of Elton's Top 40 hits which probably could have filled a third CD and part of a fourth, most of the major ones are represented here and thats enough to make this one the definitive Elton John hits compilation, which apparently was Universals intent.  The 4-track bonus CD is a bit weak, especially when compared with its 9-track UK counterpart and even the tracklisting on the UK version of the collection is a bit more adventurous then the USA offering.  All that aside, the packaging is attractive and the booklet is informative and full of photos from years gone by of &quot;Elton and the boys,&quot; as John Lennon once said. And finally the sound is terrific, all of the tracks on this set are remastered. A very nice collection  indeed.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Super DVD, but not widescreen.  Outer box and DVD both marked &quot;Widescreen&quot; edition, but to my dismay, the DVD was Full Screen.

0792839749|5.0|this has been a favorite all my life. Where else could you find a  character scary enough to rival Dr Who's Cybermen (the Child Catcher)...see Benny Hill in a straight (nearly) acting role (the Toymaker)...a pseudoerotic Queen of Vulgaria, and just HOW did an American END up raising two kids by himself in Southern England at the turn of the century? there is a greater force at work, I tell you...Anyway, doesn't stop this old punk sneaking &quot;Music Box&quot; onto any CD he burns for his latest flame....and an endless source of amusement trying glibly to work lines from the movie into everyday conversation...(&quot;But it doesn't GO though, does it?&quot;)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I find it incredible how this movie gives an impression of (show)life in fin de si`ecle Paris (absinth!) while at the same time it is one of the most innovating musical movies ever made. I like the incorporation of songs like Sound of Music as well as Elton John's Your Song and even more uptodate stuff. The dancing is great. I couldn't help falling in love with Nicole Kidman who has these beautiful eyes. And she sure can sing! The same can be said about Ewan McGregor. Of course the story is full of drama.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Billy Wilder was that rare breed of film-maker, director only begins to scratch the surface of his talent. He was equally adept at screwball comedy, romatic comedy and dark humor. As examples you need not look further than Some Like It Hot (Screwball), Sabrina (Romantic) and Sunset Blvd (Dark Humor). In fact if there could be such a category you might say Sunset Blvd is \\"Comedy-Noir\\". Because on one level we are dealing with murder. We know this, as the central character speakes to us from his recent earthly departrue. Remember he's found face down in Norma Desmond's swimming pool in the opening scene. So the film rolls out as a classic West Coast Cool murder yarn, the likes of The Big Sleep or Double Indemnity. It's when we're introduced to the wackey world of Norma Desmond that we begin to glimpse into her wretched soul. She has lost touch with all but her \\"wax-work\\" contingent of equally faded stars. Dark Humor?...Where else do you find a chimp and a butler veying for the attention of their morbid goddess. Or how about New Years Eve at Normas? Just you, Bill Holden, Norma, Max and a ten piece combo. There's tubs of bubbly and caviar and you can dance all night on the marble floor Valentino used to tango on. Sound like a gas? Why not you can have anything your heart desires. Afterall Norma's buying.    Yes, Billy Wilder was THE master comedic film-maker in his day or any other day. No one else could have made this movie and succeeded the way he did. A George Cuckor or a Frank Capra might have done well with such a project. But Billy Wilder knew how to tell this tale. He knew the humor would ooooze out of the woodwork like the damp musty air of Norma's empty estate. He knew we'd all find it so titilating and grotesque when Norma makes her big scene before her final audience, The Beveraly Hills Police. The camaras roll one last time as yesterday's glamorous movie goddess desends her palace stairs....A star so morbidly out of touch that she has frozen herself in timeand can not face a world where the audience has long gone home and the studio only wants her to rent her out-dated, relic of a limousine.    Oh Billy Wilder you sure knew who to spin a yarn. Just think of what good fun he could have had with the likes of some of todays big time celeberties. I'm sure he and Dominick Dunne could have come up with some great \\"Comedy-Noir\\" from today's tabloid sensations. How about a little tale involving a grid-iron star of yester-year, an interracial marriage and a double homicide?....Or how about that one about the gigolo who poisons the tobacco heiress?....Then there's the one involving The legendary record producer who shoots the beautiful young aspiring film star in his Beverly Hills estate. And who could resist the one about....
038541627X|5.0|Isaac Asimov was one of the most prolific writers not just in science fiction, but in all of literature. Having written upwards of 500 books (distributed throughout every category of the Dewey Decimal System), compliling the definitive Asimov omnibus, clearly, is a monumental task. This, the first in a three volume series (I have never come across the two subsequent volumes), collects a good portion of Asimov's short fiction (though, indeed, not as many as the title implies) - including some of his earliest work, and some of his best. This collection includes about 50 stories, comprising the previous short story collections Earth Is Room Enough, Nine Tomorrows, and Nightfall and Other Stories in their entirety. Included in it are some of the classic science fiction short stories of all-time: Nightfall, The Last Question (one of my absolute personal favorites, as well as Asimov's own favorite of his writings), and The Dying Night; as well as personal and sentimental favorites such as The Ugly Little Boy, Jokester, Dreaming Is A Private Thing, Profession, and Breeds There A Man...? It also includes such widely anthologized pieces as It's Such A Beautiful Day, The Fun They Had, and The Machine That Won The War. The collection also picks up several lighter pieces - such as examples of Asimov's poetry, which show that, despite his often leaning toward the cerebral in his stories, the good Doctor was also one big goof. Though by no means a complete overview of Asimov's short fiction, this is a very good place to start if you are new to the author - or if you want to get a good portion of his works in one convenient place. One need not go into the individual merits of these stories: Asimov's reputation precedes itself. This is some of the greatest science fiction ever written, essential to any fan of the genre, or of imaginative writing in general. Very highly recommended.
B00003CXXP|3.0|This film is unlike any other.  Rarely has there been a film that began so masterfully both technically and artistically, only to decompose into an amalgam of illogical writing and seriously flawed cinematography.  Despite this criticism, the acting in this film is first-rate, particularly by William Hurt and Haley Joel Osment.  There are concerns over some of the casting decisions made for the voice-only actors as well as concerns with the dialog for some of the characters in the second act (although the actors did a splendid job portraying the characters - several characters simply seemed out of place in this film).  To get a better idea of what was going on in this film, it is necessary to look at the three acts individually.<br />Act One:<br />Again, this act is nothing short of sublime.  The ebb and flow of tension created by both the narrative and editing is masterfully achieved.  The extent of unease that the audience feels is rarely established in other films and is only occasionally reached by some of Kubrick's own films.  Numerous questions are raised in the first act, and it is clear that Steven Spielberg is making a film that does not intend to insult the viewer's intelligence.  The composition of each shot is flawless as well as thoughtfully edited.  The musical score is quiet and is incorporated into all of the scenes logically without being pedantic.  Although the use of CGI often detracts from films when it is not judiciously included, (needless to say, this misuse occurs quite frequently in other pictures), the use of CGI in this act, although not always necessary, is subtle and is not at all out of place.  The only objection is the choice for the voice of Teddy.  He sounds too grandfatherly.  Even the choice for the voice of the Hal 9000 computer in 2001, for example, was too emotional sounding although it was less of a departure from ideal than is the voice of Teddy.<br />Act Two:<br />Unfortunately, despite everything that has been achieved up until this point, the first evidence of the unraveling cinematic technique becomes apparent.  The first problem is the character Gigolo Joe.  Jude Law is magnificent as this character, however, the personality and behavior of the character does not fit the tone of the rest of the film.  Simply put, he is too goofy and does not behave in a likely manner.  In addition, the character does not move the plot forward at all from his introduction to his inexplicable disappearance.  Gigolo Joe is as important to this film as the \\"lime in the coconut\\" song is to the film Practical Magic.<br />The next issue is that the pace of the film begins to go haywire (not unlike the whole of Practical Magic).  It doesn't make sense for a film whose first 45 minutes is serious cinema to turn into an ADD festival.  The composition of shots goes into George \\"Throw-everything-possible-into-the-frame-so-the-new-Star-Wars-trilogy-becomes-a-hit\\" Lucas mode.  The CGI is excessive, and the score gets too raucous, which raises an interesting question:<br />What happened to the music from Der Rosenkavalier?  This music was dramatically recomposed.  Often this is done to fit the music into a time constraint or to add something that the original is lacking when it is necessary.  Although the recomposed music has a good beat and is easy to dance to, it is not apparent why the recomposition is necessary.  In fact, the score for the second act is way off base, and would have worked better even if the Der Rosenkavalier music in its original from (though edited for length, obviously) was the only music used throughout the entire act.<br />One final point, when a well-known actor plays a major role in a film, it is often effective because there is enough material presented by that actor to wash away associations with other roles that the actor has played in previous films.  However, when a well-known actor plays a cameo in a film, the effect is not only comedic, but also parodistic.  Robin Williams' and Chris Rock's cameos are comedic, and that was probably the intention.  However, the side effect, which was either not intended, or worse, foolishly intended, was that of parody, e.g., F. Abraham Murray's appearance in Last Action Hero.  Of course, Last Action Hero is a parody, so in that film, F. Abraham Murray's role makes sense.<br />Act Three:<br />The director had to make a choice of what to do tie up the film.  Luckily, the second act improved after the arrival to the underwater Manhattan.  The film would have been partially saved if it had ended after the protagonist arrived in Coney Island as the plot was already fairly tied up.  However, the epilogue, which became another act, destroyed the integrity of the work.<br />The various illogical plot elements of this act will not even be mentioned here.  The biggest problem was the flash forward into a sequence that looks to have been made by a different group of filmmakers altogether.  In fact, while first watching the video, the question of whether or not the main feature had been recorded over some other longer \\"direct to video\\" feature that hadn't been completely recorded over arose.  Alas, because there are no movies titled Ice Pirates: This Time it's Personal or Close Encounters of the Sixth Kind, this sequence really was intended to be part of Artificial Intelligence.  It does not improve the incredulity of this act that Ben Kingley's voice is distinctive and highly recognizable.  Finally, the use of narration is awkward as the beginning of the film has no narration nor does the rest of film.  Best to either use narration consistently, or use none at all.<br />In conclusion, this film was disappointing since it had so many elements of classic films, but the departures in the second act and the failure to conclude with a short logical epilogue irrevocably compromises the overall structure of the work.
6305949972|5.0|What could I possibly say that would do justice to this masterpiece of modern cinema?  Tim Burton expertly blends the creepy and the kooky with a great storyline and excellent characters to acheive a film that can enchant both the young and the old alike.  This film is on my top-ten list of all time.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It follows in the unconventional direction of the stellar KID A, but AMNESIAC is an entirely different experience. It's more song-driven, acoustic and somewhat more coherent, resulting in some of the most beautiful music Radiohead has ever committed to tape. The only misstep is &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors,&quot; because it goes nowhere, and surely sounds like a Kid A outtake, but those are overshadowed by the somber &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; the rockin &quot;I Might Be Wrong,&quot; and the jazz-influenced &quot;Life In A Glasshouse.&quot; Get this album if you're a fan of the band, and while this CD may take some time to get warm and fuzzy to, it's another classic by the band.
0201485672|5.0|A little while back I was introduced to a word I had never heard before, Refactoring. I was told to <BR>get Martin Fowler's book and read it so I could gain a better understanding of what Refactoring <BR>was. Well folks, I would classify this book as a 'Hidden Treasure'. <br />Although it is not a flashy or well known title, I believe its impact can be much deeper and long <BR>lasting than many of the mainstream, more popular technology books. The underlying theories <BR>that it teaches can be applied for years, even when languages change.<br />There are only a couple of things I would change about this book, which I will mention below. <br />Preface<BR>The Preface it brief enough, and gives the definition for the word Refactoring. This is a good thing <BR>because right form the start you get the true definition of Refactoring. In short, refactoring is the  <BR>process of changing code to improve the internal structure, but not changing the external <BR>behavior.<br />Chapter 1: Refactoring, a First Example<br />In this chapter Mr. Fowler tries to start by showing a simple Refactoring example. The problem is <BR>that the chapter then goes on for 50+ pages. Mr. Fowler explains his reasons for doing this, but I <BR>think that a simple example should have been much simpler. Especially when it is in the first <BR>chapter of the book. It's not that this isn't a good chapter. I feel it's just too soon in the book. I <BR>would have put it at the end.<br />Chapter 2: Principles of Refactoring<BR>This is an excellent chapter. The definition of Refactoring is discussed as well as the following <BR>questions: Why should you refactor? When should you refactor? What do I tell my manager? This <BR>last question may seem funny, but when you read this chapter you will understand why it is in <BR>there. This chapter also discusses common problems that occur during Refactoring, and <BR>Refactoring and performance. <br />Chapter 3: Bad Smells in Code<BR>In this chapter things that cause code to 'smell' are discussed. When code 'smells' it could be an <BR>indicator that refactoring is needed. 22 different 'smells' are discussed. My favorites were <BR>Duplicated Code, Large Class, and Lazy Class. This is a chapter full of awesome hints.<br />Chapter 4: Building Tests<BR>Building tests is an important part refactoring. Refactoring is done in small steps, and after every <BR>step you should test. In this chapter the discussion covers the processes and methodology of <BR>applying tests during refactoring.<br />Chapter 5: Toward a Catalog of Refactorings<BR>This chapter is a quick setup for chapters 6 to 12. Mr. Fowler explains his method for cataloging <BR>the individual refactorings. What is pretty amazing is that he has taken a lot of time naming and <BR>detailing each refactoring.<br />Chapter 6: Composing Methods<BR>One of my favorite chapters. Mr. Fowler opens by saying, \\"A large part of my refactoring is <BR>composing methods to package code properly.\\" This chapter is all about that. 9 total refactorings <BR>are explained. My favorite ones are Inline Method and Extract Method.<br />Chapter 7: Moving Features Between Objects<BR>Sometimes you need to move things from one object to another. This chapter discusses the art of <BR>moving features between objects. 8 total refactorings are discussed and detailed. My favorite <BR>from this chapter is Extract Class. <br />Chapter 8: Organizing Data<BR>A very large chapter that discusses in meticulous detail 16 refactorings that will make it much <BR>easier to work with data. One thing that becomes very obvious in this chapter is that certain <BR>refactorings can go either way. What I mean is illustrated by these two: Change Value to <BR>Reference and Change Reference to Value. So some refactorings are not just one way deals. It <BR>just depends on the situation.<br />Chapter 9: Simplifying Conditional Expressions<BR>This is a very useful chapter since conditional logic is a common occurrence in the programming <BR>world. Because conditional logic has a tendency to get very complex, this chapter has 8 <BR>refactorings that will help you simplify things. <br />Chapter 10: Making Method Calls Simpler<BR>The 15 refactorings in this chapter help teach us how to make method calls easier to deal with. <BR>They range from the very simple Rename Method to the more complex Replace Constructor with <BR>Factory Method. <br />Chapter 11: Dealing with Generalization<BR>Here are 12 refactorings dealing with the situations that arise from generalization. Inheritance, <BR>Delegation, and Interfaces are some of the topics discussed.<br />Chapter 12: Big Refactorings<BR>Kent Beck co-wrote this chapter with Mr. Fowler. They discuss what they call the 4 Big <BR>Refactorings: Tease Apart Inheritance, Convert Procedural Design to Objects, Separate Domain <BR>from Presentation, and Extract Hierarchy. These refactorings are of a more all-encompassing <BR>type than the smaller individual refactorings from the preceding chapters. The co-authors do a <BR>great job at putting in a nutshell what would normally take very long explanations. <br />Chapter 13: Refactoring, Reuse, and Reality<BR>William Opdyke writes this chapter. He discusses his experiences with refactoring as well as <BR>other subjects like why developers are reluctant to refactor and reducing the overhead of <BR>refactoring. This chapter is an excellent 'putting it all together' chapter, and really helps put into <BR>perspective the ideas that the book teaches.  <br />Chapter 14: Refactoring Tools<BR>Don Roberts and John Brant co-author this chapter. They discuss, as the chapter title would <BR>indicate, refactoring tools. <br />Chapter 15: Putting It All Together<BR>Kent Beck gives a quick 4-page wrap up.<br />One other thing I would change about the book is that I would want there to be examples in other <BR>languages besides Java. I have practically no Java skills. For me the book would have been an <BR>easier and faster readif it would have had examples in VB.net. Fortunately I understand enough <BR>to get the idea of what is being taught, and that is the most important point.<br />Well as I said above, this book is really what I would consider a 'hidden treasure'. The things <BR>discussed will help many people write better, more understandable code for years to come. I <BR>would give it a 9.5 out of 10.  It is well worth the {price}
0440180295|5.0|LISTEN: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. The hero of Slaughterhouse-Five, Billy Pilgrim, is never sure what part of his life is going to occur next. Kurt Vonneguts genius, creative, and moving novel tells Billy Pilgrims story in just that way. Billys life begins in the upstate New York town of Ilium in 1922 and ends more than 50 years later, when he is a prosperous bourgeoisie optometrist. However, the book swings back and forth through time revealing pieces of his life one by one. The novel is a strong anti-war story, dominated by the horror of the experience of Dresden. However, these facts are broken and reorganized by another component in Billys strange life. Aliens from the planet Tralfamadore abduct him late in his life. They teach him that they can see time all at once. This is how Billy comes to experience his life as unstuck in time. Warping from his death to his childhood and from the ever-present experience of Dresden to his abduction.<BR> Slaughterhouse-Five was a terrific book. The pages would not stop turning because I wanted to see what piece of Billys life I would see next. I recommend this book to anyone that likes to be engulfed in a book.
B00006M183|4.0|It's difficult to tell if Eddie Vedder's voice is getting softer because he's becoming more refined, or just wearing out after years of howling at the moon.  Regardless of the rust on Vedder's pipes, Riot Act shines much in the way Yield did a few years back.  <br />  The wide variety of tracks, from the crooning \\"Love Boat Captain\\" to the electric echo anthem \\"You Are\\", are each done with proficiency.  This is an agile group of musicians with differing interests and backgrounds, yet the final product remains suprisingly cohesive.  I don't quite buy in to the waltzing single, \\"I Am Mine\\"--Vedder sounds too comfortable singing on the low end of his baritone range, and the tune ends up dragging.  <br />  Pearl Jam is still closely guarding their fragile integrity, continuing to reclaim their identity from an well-meaning but ignorant public who thought they had them pegged a decade ago.  The opener, \\"Can't Keep\\" is remeniscent of \\"No Code\\"'s opener, \\"Sometimes\\".  It's an understated, crystalline declaration of independance--a disclaimer that states in no uncertain terms that the music that follows is (to borrow another Pearl Jam line) not for you.<br />  Regardless of their continuing self-concern Pearl Jam is looser, more comfortable in this album than any previous, and it makes for great listening.  The music is slower, the voice is quieter, the message is wiser.  Pearl Jam continues doing their own evolution.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you are a fan of jazz vocals, you know that there are many greats. Ella Fitzgerald is one of my favorites, Johnnie Hartman, Dinah Washington, Joni Mitchell (yes, she's jazz, not rock), and there are the great blues singers, too. Somewhere in the middle of this is where you can't really tell what genre you're listening to. But you can always tell a great voice and you can always tell great lyrics. Greatness involves real emotions, is not staged, phony or forced. A great artist can do the near impossible almost effortlessly, seeming not to break a sweat. (It's a lot harder than it looks). That's what distinguishes the top performers from the crowd of &quot;really good&quot; performers.<br />Norah Jones has a great voice, and her material is approaching great, but not quite there yet. But I expect she'll be there on the next release. I don't buy many recordings any more, but although I resisted this one for a full day, I eventually got it and am not sorry. If you're not familiar with the great jazz and blues singers of the past, I envy you, because there are many delights in store, but it's not a mistake to start with Norah Jones. She can hold her own.

B00005RYKV|2.0|I had to smile when in the second-last scene a character's dialogue (subtitle) include the word \\"inscrutable\\". That is the term I had been contemplating since about 10 minutes into this vapid two hour flic.<br />I'm really stunned by some other reviews saying things like \\"Japanese version of The Godfather\\" and \\"accurate portrayal of the Yakuza\\". The only Godfather this might compare to, on rating alone, would be Godfather III which was a bomb. And this is a valid portrayal of Yakuza gansters only if your average Yakuza is a suicidal halfwit with the emotions and intellect of a delinquent street urchin.<br />\\"Brother\\" has a stylish light-jazz soundtrack, very hip art direction and a cool aesthetic look which are enough to make you want to like the film.<br />Unfortunately, that's a tall order. The dialogue is juvenile (at least the english subtitling anyway), perhaps the Japanese language is better. The characters are plastic and one dimensional. The script is ludicrous, not the slightest grasp on reality of gangster society. Law enforcement is virtually non-existent in this movie since the gangster can slaughter each other in non-stop extravagant violence and almost never encounter the police. Killing is wanton and practically without any character motivation or response much of the time ... you're just left wondering. Compared to other gangster flics, there is almost no credibility in any part of this story.<br />This movie is optimized aesthetic silliness, with mindless two-second murders by the dozen, all committed to a jazzy sax soundtrack. At the midpoint, I was pondering whether to continue watching as the movie descended into the abyss. I only persisted to the end in order to see how low would actually sink.<br />This movie is as bad as \\"Knock Off\\", \\"The Negotiator\\", and \\"Showdown in Little Tokyo\\", probably worse.<br />If you really want to see an ultra-hip, stylized, aesthetics-over-plot film, try \\"The Odd One Dies\\" (Hong Kong, 1997) or \\"Fallen Angels\\" (1995), both with Takeshi Kaneshiro. Or an equally obtuse and bizarre film, but nonetheless very stylized action pulp noire, try Seijun Suzuki's classic \\"Branded To Kill\\" (1967). Or better yet, try \\"The Big Hit\\" (1998) with mark Wahlberg and Lou Diamond Phillips, which is another mindless but entertaining killing spree which doesn't take itself too seriously.<br />\\"Brother\\" is a disappointment. It is very nicely art-directed, and not much else. This is not the \\"Godfather\\" of the Yakuza genre. I am not flying solo in my critical view, the 69 reviews on RT have it at 51% thumbs down. One reviewer summed up my feelings well in his comment: \\"Rarely has such an artful aesthetic been used to craft such sadistically violent junk.\\"...

I like music that is challenging and philosophical - and this album is also very sensitive and mystical.  Qualities that are rare and beautiful to find in such a truly humane human being.
B00003W8NO|5.0|My children and I loved this movie. I thought it was very well animated. Disney is terrific in pleasing a child. This movie can easily keep a childs attention. My children watch it over and over again, even my 11 and 12 year old sons love it. It will make you laugh and might even make you cry. I think Disney gets better and better with their movies and this one is definately a must see!!
0790749815|3.0|For those of you who are Hitchcock fanatics, pleased with only the most complete and perfect versions of his films, keep looking. This movie is as great as it ever was, but the DVD treatment here is pretty bad. The picture and sound elements need some major help. The extras are nice, but you are paying for the FILM after all aren't you!? So move right along and keep your eyes open for a Criterion Collection edition. This film deserves MUCH, MUCH more.

B00006M183|5.0|Almost two years after their last release, PearlJam come back stronger than ever, and with the perfect mood to reassure everyone, that they have not stopped to rock!<br />Upon first listening to the album, youll be delighted in the \\"Vitalogy\\" sounding energy that claims the album's atmosphere, but this time, the songs have more maturity and ease, in the likeness of \\"Binaural,\\" which makes this album stand out more than the rest. This different atmosphere is the sound of the band having restated their musical stand, and having a clear way in their future. Its Pearl Jam redefining their own sound.<BR> <BR>One of the best tracks on the album has to be \\"You Are,\\" a hard rocker, composed by Matt Cameron modulating a guitar through a drum machine. \\"Save You,\\" \\"Get Right,\\" and \\"Ghost\\" fit well into this category as well.<br />The calm songs are \\"I am Mine,\\" \\"Cant Keep,\\" which is fairly hard to get used to since its a weird opening track, but clearly sets the tone for the record, while \\"Thumbing My Way\\" is a serene and lovely melodie, while \\"all or none\\" sounds like a lament song. And last but not least, \\"Love Boat Captain\\" (which is co-writen with a non band member) in which Ed sings: <BR>\\"...it cant be said enough: \\"all you need is love.\\"<br />\\"Green Disease,\\" which has a chorus composition that reminensces \\"The Who,\\" and \\"Cropduster\\" have an aural mood very alike to those in \\"yield,\\" like \\"mfc\\" or \\"in hiding\\" respectively. \\"Help Help\\" and \\"Bushleaguer\\" make one recall songs like those on \\"vitalogy\\", but are clearly distinct, and surely better resolved, and the latter one has resitation like \\"im open.\\" \\"1/2 full\\" is very Neil Youngish and folk oriented while keeping the same PJ rock, \\"Arc\\" is Ed letting his voice go. Its good to finally hear him let go that way.<br />All in all, Pearl Jam have managed to create one solid record. With wonderful tunes and surprising melodies, there is nothing more youcould ask for. Their maturity is certainly reflected in the songs,and their themes, while they sound as good as ever. This album is a must for anyone who truly appreciates good music, and a jewel to any PJ fan. <BR>Rock on!
B000002UB3|1.0|It is understandable how fans of the Beatles continually rate this album so highly, and I would agree if I were ranking solely versus the rest of the Beatles limited catalogue.<br />Evaluating Abbey Road on its own yields great songs by George (Here Comes the Sun, Something) but they are toally offset by childish songs by Paul (Maxwell's Silver Hammer), self indulgent songs by John (I Want You - gee, don't go overboard on the lyrics, John) and goofiness by Ringo (Octopuses Garden).<br />Evaluating the album versus others of its time (Cream, Hendrix, Led Zep) sadly exposes just how far the Beatles were behind the times. 1 star. Sorry.
0785813500|5.0|This book is perfect when getting more than acquainted with Edgar Allan Poe.  You get to taste all of his works.  If you don't think that you would enjoy his style, then you should think again because this book is so genius that it is for anyone and everyone.  When reading his stories, many things about his life are revealed.  If you research his life, you will find that many of his stories are written relating to something from his life.  For example, Annabel Lee is a story directly from the death of his wife.  His complicated mind can begin to be decoded with this book.  There is no other better way to go than to have his COMPLETE works of tales and poems.  I am currently trying to finish this book, but I don't plan on reading it just once.  If you decide to get this book, be sure to thoroughly understand each piece because it is the only way to completely enjoy his writing style and apparent partial insanity.  I personally enjoyed the way it warped my mind to think like a madman.  My personal favorites also end with the failing of someone's mental stability.  The way he portrays his characters is brilliant, and he doesn't fall short of making each character real and seem even three-dimensional.  I recommend starting with the story \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", and \\"Berenice.\\"  Amazingly insane characters fill these stories and you will not be able to put the book down.  I give this book, and especially Edgar Allan Poe, 5 out of 5 stars.  I believe it to be a \\"must-have\\" novel in your collection.
068484267X|4.0|Born in the slums of Brooklyn, NY, Frank McCourt embarks on a childhood journey that takes him back to his parents' homeland, Ireland. In a period of national depression Frank's family finds no other choice of staying alive than going back to Ireland where they would have to face the hardships of poverty, and bear their father's reckless vice of drinking away their money. <BR>Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is yet one more poignant story that recounts how a child is forced to survive around the ignorance of their ambiance, and the social prejudice that abounds between our human races. It is the story of fighting to see your dream come true. <BR> In this captivating novel I was able to sympathize with McCourt through his accounts of how life treated him and his family, as will anybody else that reads it. The story wraps its readers, zooming in and out of events that forever took a toll on the lives of all of Frank's family. This novel is a stunning memoir worth to read anytime by anyone; it transports its readers into the Irish essentials and ways of life.

There were a few good tracks, such as &quot;Infatuation&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot;(which is why I did not give the CD 1 star), but I was not impressed by the majority of the CD.  Christina has definitely created a new sound in her music which did not catch my attention.  Only buy this CD if you are a truly devoted Christina fan.

0316096199|5.0|Loved the author's second book, \\" The Lovely Bones\\" so much that I felt compelled to read her first one.  I knew a little of her background from various interviews but had no idea the full extent of her horror. <br />Her memoir is both sad and inspiring-such a young girl to be facing so much so soon. The maturity forced on her from growing up with a dysfunctional family obviously prepared her to deal more successfully with the rape. Still, the crime was horrific and her resiliance is amazing.
0345404475|4.0|Philip K. Dick's novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" describes the aftermath of a nuclear war that left the earth devestated and thus forced its inhabitants to build up colonies on Mars. Some of the remaining corporations develop human androids destined to serve as slaves on Mars, who/which, however, sometimes kill their masters and escape. On Earth, these androids are trapped down by bounty hunters such as Rick Deckard, who is assigned the task to \\"retire\\" 6 extremely intelligent androids of the Nexus-6 type.<br />While telling the story of Rick Deckard's hunt, Philip K. Dick also discusses big philosophical questions and uses metaphors to illustrate his ideas. Central metaphors that recur throughout the course of the novel are the kipple and the nuclear dust that seem to be omnipresent. Both the kipple and the dust seem to be an active force  covering not only objects but human beings as well. Thus the dust in particular extinguishes life and makes it even harder for the remaining people to distinguish between artificiality and reality. Moreover, the dust rules feelings, emotions and life itself, and one cannot escape from it. Throughout the book the dust creates a mysterious atmosphere and forces the reader to not only concentrate on appearance, but rather take a closer look at the inherent character and someone's genuine emotions.<br />One of the most important androids created by the Rosen Association (one of the corporations that manufacture androids for the use on the colonies) is Rachael Rosen, who ironically seems to accompany Rick Deckard on his hunt for the artificial human. Although he clearly detects her as an android (using the Voigt-Kampff test) in the beginning of the novel, he develops emotions and empathy for  her and even considers the possibility of quitting his job because of the attraction that he feels towards her. Furthermore, her beauty and perfectly human features mislead him in the way that he fails to view her merely as an androidprototype. Thus it becomes clear to the reader how closely connected human and artifical life with both their advantages and downsides really are.<br />Equally interesting is the role that animals play in the world Rick Deckard lives in: His greatest dream is to own a real animal, the ultimate status symbol in a society that is characterised by the coexistence of human and artificial life. Since many animals are already extinct due to the nuclear dust, artificial animals are given a great importance. Thus the reader is asked to draw parallels between the influence of artificiality in both human and animal life, and to, one more time, appreciate the value of authenticity and true emotions.<br />On the whole we (who are not big fans of science fiction) considered the novel to be interesting, because it made us think not only about futuristic but also present life by raising big philosophical questions, such as \\"What defines life?\\" Furthermore, Rick is a character that one can easily identify with, because he is questioning the system (e.g. the concept of Mercerism) and shows genuine emotions and empathy. The ending of the novel rounds up the topic, that is discussed, in a very realistic way, and at the same time serves as a warning of the ethical consequences that technical progress (such as genetic engineering etc) might bring about. Therefore we can recommend the novel to everyone who is willing to learn more about a futuristic society and the conflict between artificial and human life.

B0000524CY|5.0|Without a doubt, the most horrifying theatrical experience of a lifetime.  In my experience, the most horrifying scene of the whole movie is in the \\"boring\\" first part.  It involves Father Karris' dream of his mother and all the guilt associated with her death.  Earler in the film, we see Damien with his mother and his mother admonishes him with \\"Dimmie, why do you do this to me?\\"  In Father Karris' dream, we see his mother coming out of a subway in slow motion, the only sound is Damien's fitful sleeping.  Then we see his mother silently cry out \\"DIMMMMIIEEE!\\" Then, MY GOD!  Did I actually see that?  There are four frames, tachistoscopically added, of the most horrible demon's death-mask like face! Chalk white with blood-red bags under its eyes.  In the DVD version, if your DVD player is on a computer, screen-save that face and make it your Windows wallpaper!  It will screw you up permantly!  You will never think of \\"Cap'n Howdy\\" in the same way!

So for any fans new to style of Alfred Hitchcock -- be warned, this is no Vertigo, Psycho or North by Northwest. The material is light and fast-paced, not overly heavy or intense, as the previous titles, with the exception of North by Northwest.<br />It is a fun, swiftly paced romantic adventure that displays Hollywood (and the French Riviera) in all its grandeur and glory.

I think everyone who is a Harry Potter or a classical music fan should pick this one up. WAY TO GO JOHN!!!(..)
B00005AR3G|5.0|When I first saw this, I watched it with two of my fellow camp counselors and my six campers.  I was laughest the loudest out of all of them.  Then my councelors came next.  This is great for adults as well as kids.  Why?  Because of Kronk.  His jokes are mainly adult humor oriented and man are they hilarious.  David Spade's sarcasm is easily discernable by both kids and adults.  Tom Jones's song to begin the movie is a fun song that gets you ready for the movie.  Sting's song to end the film is touching and kind of a cool down after the exercise session that was The Emperor's New Groove.  When I bought this, I watched it twice a day for about two weeks straight, it's just that mich fun to watch over and over again.  Buy it and watch it and you won't be able to get enough of it.  Wendy Malick and John Goodman are perfectly characterized on the screen as the simple townspeople and Eartha Kitt is a wonderful villian, one of Disney's best villains.  She has a perfect voice for a bitter old lady.  All in all, this is a very satisfying movie.  Adults and kids alike will love it.  Buy it and watch it as often as I do, you won't be able to help yourself.  This film gets my highest recommendation.

B00001QEE9|4.0|I bought this dvd about 4 months ago, my daughter already knows the lines, she loves it. It is a charming, entertaining and funny movie for the whole family. The only downsize that I found for this movie is that it is too expensive for the features it includes. There's just the original theatrical trailer, which is just a scene of the movie, which is not something you will die to see. I think Disney could have include a short documentary of how the idea of Pinocchio was conceived, or the origins of the story, or maybe a video of when you whish upon a star as they did with Snow White's Some day my Prince will come and maybe a cartoon, just something to compensate the price. Besides that, it is a wonderful movie by the story itself.
B000002KJM|3.0|The debut ZZ Top record may not be the bands strongest release.  However, the guitar stylings are pretty close to grade A.  Plenty of rock, a load of the blues, and some stylish slide licks thrown in for good measure by Billy Gibbons.<br /> Pretty consistent throughout as all the songs are at least good but none are really over the top. Shakin' In Your Tree stands out a little more from the pack with the tasty guitar licks and cool vocal harmonies.  Just Got Back From My Baby's has a cool tone as well.  And you cannot deny the energy of Backddor Love Affair and Going Down To Mexico.<br />Not their best release but certainly a good start.  3 1/2 stars seems about right.
B00006IU73|5.0|with every PT release the music gets better and better. if you want melody,emotion,brilliant musicianship and production then look no further than this band. all other bands pale into &quot;insignificance&quot;. this cd is indispensible. check them out &quot;live&quot; as well.
0064407667|4.0|This series is finally getting some much deserved recognition (a spot on CBS' Sunday Morning sure can't hurt sales). And while some may wonder if Lemony and his creations are doomed to the perils of hype, I for one probably wouldn't have bothered reading this first book if it were not for the hype. I must say I found \\"The Bad Beginning\\" to be enjoyable in a most delectibly wicked way. This is not the Great American Novel, nor is it even Harry Potter, but then it was not intended to be either. Shades of Roald Dahl come to mind, but not to the point where this seems like pure imitation. It is indeed pure inspiration and I delight in the fact that children can peruse these sophisticated tales of morbid melodrama.
0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a true story of an American Special Operations mission in Somalia. The mission was to quickly capture a top lieutenant of warlord Mohamed Aidid and get out. But when an American helicoptor is shot down, everything falls apart. Mark Bowden, the author, conducted many interviews with the soldiers who fought and the commanders who oversaw the mission. The book takes on the thoughts and feelings of individual soldiers as they are fighting thousands of Somali militia and civilians. Many American soldiers were killed or wounded. This story reveals many of the blunders and lack of prepeartion in the American military.
B00005MP58|5.0|Wonderful through and through!  It is faithful to Jane Austin's book in every way, the acting is great, each character is delightful, and the  wardrobe is true to the time period. And of course the story itself is the best every written!... I also think Mrs. Bennett steals the show.  Excellently done from start to finish.  I watch this movie once a month, and never tire of it. Highly recommended!...
0440180295|5.0|Have you ever felt you could stop a glacier?  Harrison Star, from the book Slaughterhouse-Five, told Billy Pilgrim that glaciers would be as easy to stop as wars.  Billy, the main character, was considering writing an anti-war book.  Billy is an interesting fellow.  He believes in aliens, thinks he has visited their planet, and furthermore, believes the reason humans are such a sad race is because they can't see the fourth dimension.  Billy is different, Billy can see in the fourth dimension.  Or, at least more than any other human can.  Throughout the book Billy travels to different times in his life, this way seeing the fourth-dimension like no other human.<BR>Kurt Vonnegut, the author of the book, has a vivid imagination and a sense of humor like no other.  Vonnegut blends humor throughout the book in a perfectly hilarious manner.  For example: Billy learns from the Tralfamadorians that when people die, they keep on living in the past.  Because of this, there are no funerals on Tralfamadoria, and whenever one of their friends die they say, \\"So it goes.\\"  Every single paragraph that includes the death of someone ends with the same sentence.  So it goes.  Reading over this, it doesn't seem very funny, but while I was reading the book it just started to hit me and I began laughing.  Maybe most of Vonnegut's jokes require you to spend some time reading his books, but that's fine because this book is certainly worth reading.  And I recommend it to anybody who feels they are up to a nice challenge.  This book requires some thinking, actually a lot of thinking.  Some of which I didn't do, and still thought it was a great book.  So, read this book, think a little.
B00005ASGI|4.0|This is another great Trek pairing.<br />\\"A Private Little War\\" is Trek's take on what was then our expanding participation in Viet Nam.  Here, Kirk and crew journey to an idyllic Eden of a world populated by noble nomads and settled villagers and, unfortunately for everybody, fair game for the Klingon empire.  Though barely on the edge of the industrial revolution, villagers are now armed with flintlocks, and have engaged in a genocidal war against the nomads -a noble band led by the heroic Tyree.  A close friend of Kirk's on his last sojourn their, Tyree allows Kirk to hide within his tribe while he and McCoy investigate Klingon backing of the villagers.  Spock is unluckily struck by one of the primitive flintlocks and spends much of the episode in the Enterprise's ICU.  Down below, between ducking Klingon's, Kirk and McCoy bitterly debate the morality of bringing the tribes into technological parity with the villagers, with Kirk in favor of giving Tyree's people a fighting chance, and McCoy arguing how that would only prolong a bloody and suicidal war (almost a completely win-win situation for the Klingons).<br />This was a great episode, deftly referring both to Viet Nam and treatment of indigenous tribes in 19th century America.  McCoy especially shines in his moments arguing with the Captain, while the script gives Kirk the coldly logical position normally reserved for Spock (it would probably have been too cold; perhaps that's why they had him shot down in the opening scene).  Also look for 1960's TV fixture Nancy Kovack as Nona, Tyree's bewitching wife.  Kovack had a recurring role as Darrin Steven's former flame on \\"Bewitched\\", exposing her to all sorts of nose-twitching witchcraft.  As Nona, a \\"Kunutu\\" woman, she now gets to cast the spells.<br />\\"Gamesters of Triskelion\\" is perfectly campy Trek, with Kirk, Uhura and Chekov kidnapped during transport by a highly advanced race of beings (is there any other kind?) called \\"Providers\\" who force Kirk and crew to battle in mortal combat with other kidnapped aliens (one of them, a beautiful humanoid who's wicked in the ring).  You'd think the Providers would have long tired of the repetitious gaming (they bet using \\"quatloos\\", but you never see one) and would have long settled on developing the slaves to try living normal lives as a more amusing form of entertainment.  \\"Gamesters\\" is campy trek, using interior sets (even for outdoor scenes) and featuring Shatner in full \\"lounge mode\\" as he courts his fellow prisoner.  One caveat though, this episode features a moment in which Uhura is assaulted just out of camera shot.  It's very suggestive, but by the end of the episode, there's just about no closure.  It was perhaps a bit too campy for its own good.
B000062XM3|5.0|I know you already seen thousands of good reviews about just how great this movie is. Well it is in everyway of course but I really want to discuss the bad reviews. I decided to be open and read the one star reviews which turned out to be utter ... They complain on how this movie is the most predictable movie ever and that it is nothing more than immature thoughts from children hitting puberty. One person was as assnine to say this movie is a joking display of 9/11 (#1. That topic is as old as ... and 2. it didn't happen yet in 1999 and just because the word terrorist is included or a picture of a building falling down means nothing).<BR>   Well I can assure you Chuck Palahniuk is not a teenager and two if you have a brain and aren't the stupid, useless, mindless, superficial, blue collared robot that this movie describes you would understand that this movie isn't telling you to pee in grandma's soup or punch your friend, its just a pointer at how boring and mundane everyday normal materialistic life is and the decay of society. I love this movie because I agree with it and I understand if you don't agree with it but not for stupid made-up reasons. I read one review most likley by an old woman that said she was offended by the violence but got the message. Thats fine even though I didn't agree w/ her values.

0140177396|3.0|The book, Of Mice and Men, is a book that had an involved story once you got involved with it. The style of writing was the hardest part to understand. It was told from the third person, but the speaking parts had very poor English, so it was hard to understand.<BR> Lennie and George are the main characters of the book. Lennie is an extremely large man, but he is not to smart. George is a small man, but he is smart, so he watches out for Lennie.<BR> The two man men are drifters. They travel around to different ranches. They work on them. The reason they keep moving is that trouble follows them wherever they go.<BR> Over all, I think this book was a good story, a little hard to understand, but a good story. The only rough spot was the way the book was written. The language was very poor. It made the characters seem like they were really there and they lived at the time. So I have to recommend this book.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|OK, I broke down and saw this film, despite all of the reviews.  Like everyone else, I like the first film, thought it was fresh and new, etc.  Well, this second film was off.<br />The main problem I had was that all of the funny gags were used in the preview trailer.  Rodger Ebert calls this a \\"Coming and Going Attraction: If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.\\" (Ebert's Movie Glossary, 43)  So there was really no point in suing this movie, since we already saw all of the comedy.<br />Secondly, the first film was funny because the humor was fresh.  The problem is that the humor was not taken to the next level, but the same types of jokes were repeated.  Seeing Jack Jeebs' head get shot off was funny the first time, but seeing it get shot twice was no longer funny.  There is a difference between telling a joke and merely repeating a joke.<br />To improve the story, first I would have begun with Jay and Elle as partners for continuity's sake.  She could have been an anal partner, or a bully, or what ever.  I would have Jay neutralize her, and send her back to the morgue.<br />Next, I would have T take Elles' place, and have Jay neuralize him after a misadventure, and then have Frank the Dog be the partner, but use it for juts one shot.  I thought the scenes with Frank were a bit overdone, and there was no chemistry between Smith and Blaney.  And the little black suite was more of a curtsy visual gag, but not really funny.<br />I thought it was interesting that Jay had two personalities.  When he was the senior agent, he acted responsible and decisive, but when he went back to being Kay's partner Smith started playing him as a buffoon again.  I'm thinking of the scene in the pizza shop where they puzzle over the old picture of Kay.<br />What is interesting is that people actually act like this: split personalities depending on who is around.  Orson Scott Card in his preface to \\"Speaker For The Dead\\" mentioned he had this problem in describing the Brazilianfamily with all the children:  he had to create about three personalities for each child depending on who was around.<br />Zed could have pointed out the difference in Jay's behavior at the end, and not have the weird locker-room scene at the end, which was really a retelling of the same joke that they ended MIB 1 with.  The point could have been that Jay and Kay need each other, or something like that.<br />I thought they had several subplots, such as the romance with Jay and the Light, but nothing really went anywhere.  This film is really an action comedy, and adding a romance element was just too much
B000003TA4|5.0|A punk platter bashed out and produced to echo-ey, fuzz-box glory by Butch Vig. Either their &quot;sell out&quot; or their &quot;masterpiece&quot; depending on your view of things. There are not many CDs worthy of 5 stars. This and In Utero are two CDs well deserving of that ranking.<br />Song for song, the best experience you can ask for. I've had this album since 1994 (when I was turned on to it from In Utero), and I'm still finding new things in the mix. I never realized the &quot;hospital sounds&quot; in Drain You, for instance.<br />Any record that has one side composed of tunes like Smells Like, In Bloom, Come as You Are, Lithium, Polly and Breed (not necc. that order) is a cut above the morose junk on the airwaves.<br />This ate both Michael Jackson and Metallica for breakfast when it exploded from nowhere in '91. It left behind a wake of snarl and wreckage that still hasn't been met face to face.<br />Try to find &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; if you can. Some pressings contain it, some don't. &lt;i&gt;Savage&lt;i&gt;.

B00005JL78|4.0|First of all, I am a \\"half-fan\\" of Speilburg.  He has a keen eye and good dramatice sense.  However, he gets into gross humor, and  that can destroy a film.<br />Anytime you deal with prohecy and deastiny, you are going up aganst Shakespear's play Macbeth.  THis film does a good job of holding up against the Bard, and I think their expelebation about predestination, determinism was the most concise I have seen: <BR>\\"Why did you catch the ball?\\"<br />\\"It was going to fall.\\"<br />\\"How did you know, since it didn't?\\"<br />I think the effects were beautiful, from the 3-d home videos and the Tron llightcycle cars to the breakfast cereal box.  Speilburg understands that the effects are not a move, but just aids to storytelling.<br />This move is really a tribute to Orson Welles obscure film \\"The TRial,\\" starring Anothny Perkins and filmed in Ygoslavia and PAris.  See the film , and you will see the similarities.<br />What bugged me were the gross jokes.  In fact, the second half of the film was devoted to gross joke after gross joke. ...P>For example, the eye jokes got old after a while.  Everyone knows that amputatum need to be freezed to be preserved.<br />And what about the mouldy sandwich joke?  This was more like something out of the Three Stooges.  It did nothing for the plot, and was an out of place gag to get cheap thrills<br />I also thought Max Von S's slip that revelaed that he was guilt was also rather predictable and hacknyed, though his actins, as always, is superb!<br />SO, I reccomed reading Macbeth and seeing Welles' \\"The Trial,\\" as better choices.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan was one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. The story is about four women who came from China to America and how their experiences affected the lives of their daughters. The women are reminders to their daughters of their heritage in America. I could relate to this book because I am South Asian and my mother had made many struggles to come from Pakistan to America. She reminds me of the true importance of my identity as a woman and a minority. I could relate to many of the issues the daughters go through with their mothers and reading this book also shows the perspective of the mothers. The Joy Luck Club brings up very realistic issues between the relationship of a mother and daughter.<BR>     Jing-mei has to take her mother&#146;s place playing mahjong since she has passed away. Her mother had organized this gathering in China and had started it again in San Francisco as the Joy Luck Club. The purpose of the Joy Luck Club is to reward oneself and spend time with family and friends and enjoy food. Jing-mei is told of something she needs to do in order to carry on her mother&#146;s last wishes. The aunties guide her into memories and stories that she must remember her mother by and to carry out her duties as a daughter. <BR>     This book has a lot to do with remembering your heritage while living in America and to appreciate your parents. After reading this book I had realized the importance of my own family, especially the women, and what the sacrifices they had made for their children.  <BR>     Finding yourself within your heritage and going back to your history is something so powerful that it never leaves you and it becomes a part of you, your values and your life. Although I may not understand everything my mother tells me because of the language and culture barrier we have between each other, after reading this book I had realized that there is more importance in making the effort to do so.
0670888796|5.0|This is it! These are the letters, words, sentences, paragraphs that made Christmas the celebration that it is today - the family parties, the feasts, the excitement, giving to the poor. Virtually every way we celebrate this magnificent Holiday (except the mall part!) comes from this book written by Charles Dickens.<br /> First off, this is the unabridged version. Nothing added - nothing taken away. That's as it should be. (Unfortunately, as great as they may be, the movie versions truly do not do the book justice - although I must say the George C. Scott and Alistair Sim versions do come fairly close).<br /> One thing that surprises me about this book is how few people I know that have have actually read it, but they've seen one version or another of the movie countless times! They don't seem to realize that when books are put to film, so much is taken out for length or for other reasons. A Christmas Carol is no different. In fact, if you watch all of the different movie versions available, you STILL would not get the complete book, even though each movie adds one thing or another from the original story that the others may not.<br /> There are countless copies of this story available in various book form, but this particular version is probably one of the best that I have seen. The illustrations attempt in some part to keep in the same spirit as in Dickens' original. But the best, most interesting part of this version (besides the story itself) is all of the little facts, explanations, and trivia put into the margins throughout this book. They give the modern 21st century reader more of an understanding of what 19th century English life was like. A couple of examples: when Dickens writes of the Cratchit family taking their goose to the bakers to be cooked, I wondered why would any one take their food OUT to be cooked and then picked up later. This book explains that few poor people in this time period had ovens large enough to roast a good family sized bird. They were big enough to cook a small bit of meat and that was about it. In order to have one of those rare Holiday meals, they had to take it to the large baker's oven at an appointed time for cooking.<br />Another fact I did not know was that in the story, Scrooge's sister, Fan, was based on Dickens' actual sister in law, Mary Hogarth.<br />There are also a multitude of paintings, drawings, and sketches from Dickens' time showing his time. Now you can see, as accurately as one can considering there were no cameras, life of the rich, middle class, and poor as it actually was. There's a picture of Queen Victoria and her family celebrating Christmas. There is also a beautiful painting of a poor labourer's family Christmas celebration. There are sketches from the first edition of 'A Christmas Carol.'<br />If you plan on owning a copy of this most wonderful of all Christmas novels, this is the version to get.ough to cook a small bit of meat and that was about it.

B00006J9OV|3.0|I cannot agree with the previous reviewer on this DVD. I had anticipated an enthralling experience watching this production on DVD, but the first few minutes into the overture, I already knew I'd be disappointed. 1) The Tempi by Levine is excruciatingly slow, sometime you would wonder whether the music is frozen. Into the drama the tempi got better but his generic approach makes it hard for singers to follow sometimes, especially for Weikl's prince role. But the slow tempi seem to be effective allowing buildup of dynamics. 2) It's surprising that an 1992 production on DVD would have less than ideal visual quality. Images are not crisp enough, and overall lighting is dark (as often happens with Met production, except for some recent ones such as Cosi, Tristan und Isode). The singing by the first three leading roles, Meier, Jerusalem, and Moll is all very good. Especially with Moll.<br />This is a fair production and poor DVD work. Considering that not many Parsifal productions available on DVD, I have no better choice.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera has fooled us all. She wore a top that resembled a napkin to the MTV Video Music Awards. And then she recorded a video full of other scantily clad women and risqu dancing. And to top it all off she posed nude on the cover of Rolling Stone.<BR>But when Christina declared that her new album Stripped was a reflection of her true self, she didn't mean that she is a promiscuous sex kitten and wants the whole world to know. She meant, as one of her interludes exclaims, that she's not perfect but doesn't care; she's not a diva but she knows what she wants; and finally she's not a virgin, but nor is she a slut. <BR>This is why I maintain that despite the hormonal hype Aguilera's album Stripped is not as dirty as we thought. In fact, it is, in my opinion, a great example of musical artistry and breaks the mold created by today's boy bands and pop princesses. <BR>Now there is one song, \\"Get Mine Get Yours,\\" that would probably upset your local Christian group because Aguilera sings about having one-night stand with someone she meets at a club. But songs like this are the exception not the rule. <BR>The album as a whole is a melodic blend of hip-hop, soul and rock with heartfelt lyrics mostly written by Christina herself. The album is stripped, but not of class and taste. It's stripped of all of the tiptoe-through-the tulips, lollipop sounds and lyrics that continue to flood radio stations across the country.  And, contrary to popular belief, it's not a soundtrack to a porn flick, like many of today's songs tend to be. <BR>Christina tells of the bliss and blues of love with songs like \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" and \\"Walk Away.\\" On the track \\"Impossible,\\" a song that bears resemblance to Aretha Franklin's \\"Ain't No Way,\\" Aguilera teamed up with the talented Alicia Keys to compose a feel-it-down-your-soul tune about trying to love an emotionally unavailable man. <BR>The song \\"Beautiful,\\" though slow and solemn, can lift spirits with self-esteem-boosting lyrics like: \\"You are beautiful no matter what they say... \\"We're the song inside the tune, full of beautiful mistakes/And everywhere we go, the sun will always shine...\\"<BR>One of the things that sets this album apart from most is Aguilera's vocal strength which comes through from track to track. But the reason Stripped should be a part of every young woman's CD collection is because of songs like \\"The Voice Within,\\" \\"I'm OK\\" and \\"Keep Singin' My Song.\\" These songs could be packaged in a first aid kit for surviving everything from crushed dreams to broken homes.  <BR>And the song \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" which features bad girl rapper Lil' Kim, speaks to the double standards women must face when it comes to sexuality and the belief that women should be seen and not heard. All together these tunes can strip away a girl's shyness and insecurity and make her want to \\"take a deep breath and say it loud... can't hold us down!\\"
0385484518|4.0|Morrie's message in this book is for all ages. Being a 17 year old, you wouldn't think that the lessons Mitch is trying to obtain from Morrie would have any affect on my own life. But everything he wanted to know, I did too. <BR>   Death, life, love, and self acceptance are things that I deal with in my everyday life. I loved this book because it brings together the most important aspects of living, and relates it to the reader. I think that everyone can relate to this book, and learn something from it. With so many emotions and feelings I have at this point in my life, Morrie's thoughts on \\"detaching yourself\\" from them really hit me. I completely agree with having to expierence something fully inorder to understand the emotion. \\"By throwing yourself into these emotiongs...over your head even, you experience them fully and completely...and only then you can say, 'alright. I ahve experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion'.\\"(p104) My favortie quote: \\"When you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\"(p104)
B00005UEAR|5.0|These two CDs are easily the most immediately appealing of the Dream Theater studio albums. The first disc contains 5 songs, each of about 10 minutes length. \\"The Glass Prison\\" and \\"The Great Debate\\"  are the heavier of the tracks, bringing to mind Tool and early Metallica, particularly TGP. \\"Blind Faith\\" wins the award for spanning the widest variety of music there is - from the easy and calm intro, to the punk-esque transition and then Jordan Rudess's classical piano solo into one of the coolest jazz/fusiony solo's I've heard in while back to the original theme - and it just plain rocks. \\"Misunderstood\\" starts off with a nice acoustic guitar riff and after a few minutes of increased building and tension, it explodes into a very grungy, super-distortion chorus before fading back down into a somewhat odd but cool end. Finally, \\"Disappear\\" is definitely the hardest song to get into on the album - it is somewhat uncharacteristic of most of Dream Theater's other work, but intriguing, nonetheless; it features a lot of weird flangy guitar effects and drums are really minimal. The song is more or less a spotlight on James LaBrie, who deserves a lot of credit for holding his own on the rest of the disc.<br />Disc two is really the gem of the CD set. Lasting a good 45 minutes or so, the piece covers a lot of ground in terms of musical styles, starting with an orchestral rendition of the whole song in 6 minutes in \\"Overture\\", moving to a slightly poppy 7/4 feel in \\"About to Crash\\" (if 7/4 can be poppy) and then hammering away with the hard rock/speed metal feel of \\"War Inside My Head\\" and \\"The Test that Stumped Them All\\". Then the piece settles down into a slow ballad highlighting James LaBrie's falsetto and a lot of flangy guitar effects in \\"Goodnight Kiss\\". The transition from \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" into \\"Solitary Shell\\", a really cool acoustic tune that makes you really appreciated DT's musical versatility, is really masterful. Finally DT closes the album with a really rocking-out make you happy rendition of \\"About to Crash\\" taking the form \\"About to Crash (reprise)\\" and a slow building, climactic ending with \\"Losing Time/Grand Finale\\". The minute-long ringing of the gong at the end really lets you slowly and safely ease out of the music. <br />This Dream Theater album covers the widest variety of ground of all their CD's covering jazz/fusion to prog. metal. It's an absolute must for a prog. fan of any degree, and it can really open the mind of any soon-to-be prog. fan to the world ruled by Dream Theater,  that of progressive rock. It easily takes a place in my top five CD's of all time. It was the first DT album I purchased and I can say that I've made an excellent use of one-hundred some-odd dollars on their CD's since then. If you're not already on the way out the door to buy it, get going.
B00005JJX8|2.0|I had been waiting a long time for the DVD release of this classic romantic mystery. What I had been most anticipating was viewing the delicious technicolor cinematography which garnered an Academy Award for Robert Burks. What a disappointment! The picture quality is grainy and the colors are somewhat washed out. This I could see on the late, late movie on my local T.V. station. So, if you just want to enjoy the story and the entertaining performances by Grant and Kelly, go ahead and buy it. However, if you were looking forward to the beautiful visuals, save your money.
B00006V9A0|1.0|come on. 14 songs that all nirvana fans have and 1 tune you can download from the net? talk about being hungry for money. This CD and Kurt's journal are the last intent to suck blood out of his poor body. The video of you know you're right is morbid. Kurt is long gone and they are trying to bring it back to the new generation. Leave him rest in peace!
B000004756|5.0|This is the finest guitar recording I have ever heard, certainly, in my opinion, the best recording ever for Paco, John, and Al. Most reviewers and listeners will disagree with me, pointing to the excellent 'Friday Night in San Francisco' as the definitive session for this trio. That certainly is an amazing date, but this recording is deeper and the playing is at such a level that I am blown away every time I listen to it. What is so impressive is the uniqueness of all of the compositions. On some recordings the tunes seems to blend together, but not on this one. All of the compositions are so different, yet so pleasing, that even after 30 listenings this CD seems as fresh to me as the first time.<br />It is hard for me to convey to the reader the superbness of the playing on this date. The 3 guitars are flawlessly, seamlessly and intricately weaving the music like a beautiful and complex tapestry, but the sound is always pleasing to the ear. There are no wasted notes, no irrelevant riffs made to impress the listener. The trio is creating and improvising at a level of communication that is utterly astonishing and amazing. I have never heard such power, beauty, intricacy and melody from any guitar combo that can compare to this one. It wasn't until the 10th listening that I was able to even begin to appreciate the music on this date. I have been listening to music of all kinds for 40 years and I rate this CD as one of my all time favorites.<br />There are 9 tunes on the CD, all different. Some are powerful and quick, while others are slower, but every cut has some amazing moments. It is worth the price of the CD for the last cut alone, 'Cardeosa'. This track is one of the most amazing pieces of music I've ever heard. I won't bore you with any more details other than to say, if you are looking for world class musicians at the very peak of their creative powers, you must buy this CD! Listen to it at least 10 times before you make up your mind, because you will hear new things every time.things every time.
B00000064G|4.0|I suppose it's a commentary on our times that it took a Volkswagen commercial (produced nearly 30 years after the album's release, no less) for people to appreciate the spare virtuosity of Nick Drake. In spite of the gloomy undercurrent of despair in each of the albums tunes, particularly &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, I never get tired of listening to it.<BR> BTW-I have a newborn grandniece who loves the title tune...whenever she hears &quot;Pink Moon&quot; on the car's CD player, she smiles!
B00004RFFS|5.0|The first time i saw this movie i had no idea that it was based on a book! the movie was incredible and when i found out that it was a book i went and got it. thanks to this awsome movie i found a wonderful author.
