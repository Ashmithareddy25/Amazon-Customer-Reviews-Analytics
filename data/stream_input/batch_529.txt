B000777J2S|1.0|As an amateur musicologist I must admit that for the first time I really do not get it. I listened to a ton of songs by Antony and the Johnsons and was left uninspired, unimpressed and as a final result, uninterested. It sounds like a really bad impression of late career Roxy Music. Actually it really reminded me of the Tindersticks which are another band I have not been able to find value or joy in. I know both of these bands have their following but I am perplexed at what would make anyone think this is listenable or inventive in any way. Perhaps if you are into cabaret jazz or 40's vocalists I could see finding a kinship here but to win the Mercury prize only degrades that award in my eyes. Any comparison to the Smiths is laughable whether it be style, sound or critical weight. <br />Don't get me wrong, it's not that I am trashing Antony &TJ it's just that like most of the music press coming out of the UK right now it seems to me to be all about hype over substance. I sat listening for hours hoping to hear what some people have in their music and was left with the impression of a morose swim through a sea of molasses. <br />With so many great things finally happening in music gain and so many true originals finding their public voice why would they get so much respect as the Mercury prize? Erasure's Nightbird shames their effort as well as recent offerings by Bloc Party, Bright Eyes, The Arcade Fire, Interpol and the Killers (if they count for this year), The Tears, Franz Ferdinand, Peter Murphy, even the Rolling Stones who I have disliked for 20 years have put forth their strongest effort to date. <br />Well if you like perhaps the Tindersticks, Sigur Ros and Goldfrapp and have a yearning for slow cabaret jazz I would run to the local indie record store to buy this album...everyone else should run in the opposite direction and hope this does not become a trend.
0316172324|5.0|Gladwell is a great journalist and in his latest book, he explores snap judgments. This book brings intuitive decision making to our attention and will provoke more research.  As most senior executives use snap decision making in their day to day activities, this book is valuable and somewhat practical. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend Gladwell's earlier book, The Tipping Point, for cutting-edge information about marketing success through word of mouth.
0451450523|3.0|I collect unicorn figurines, etc., so this title was one I very much looked forward to reading.  It was not disappointing, but not a blockbuster, either.  But, that's because a book of fantasy must be very special to earn a 4 or a 5 from me.  I did read it and have mailed it to a friend who likes fantasy more than I do.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Well in answer to E2O's review, the box to contain all 10 seasons is available for those who purchase season 10 alone. There will be a mail in coupon inserted into the season 10 boxset, so those who have been loyally buying each DVD set will not need to purchase this 10-season boxset just to get the box. <br /> <br />I only started watching 'Friends' seriously in June of last year, when I decided to buy season 1 on DVD. Pretty soon, I had all 7 seasons that were available, and was anxious to get the next seasons. 'Friends' is a witty sitcom with characters that everyone will come to love. Sure, it's had its low points, but in my opinion, it's been pretty rewarding to follow this series loyally. I personally enjoy watching episodes with more emotional storylines, because that's where you see how well these actors portray their characters. <br /> <br />I have not seen season 10 yet, and I'm currently running through seasons 1 to 9, just in time for November, when I will finally get to watch and savour season 10. It will be bittersweet.

B00005JN5X|3.0|To be fair, calling this movie simply eye candy is not completely doing it justice.  It is far too dark a movie to be categorized as such, and it is also clear that Gilliam has some aspirations beyond simply producing a visual spectacle.  If one really works hard at it, one could find the allegorical qualities in this film, as the captive children children in the forest could represent the captive population of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia.<br /><br />It is possible to see what this movie would have liked to have been. Unfortunately, the story-telling gets so muddy at times that any subtle messages that might exist simply get lost in the tangle of special effects and visual spectacle.  It also doesn't help that the Jacob Grimm, the central character who should have the most depth & complexity, is played by Heath Ledger, who has rarely displayed any particular acting talent.  Matt Damon (as Wilhelm Grimm) is adaquete but unremarkable in a role that has not been given much nuance by the script.  The supporting talents of Jonathan Pryce & Peter Stormare are put to entertaining use, but their characters are such broadly-drawn caricatures that they do not truly contribute to the development of the story.<br /><br />Younger children will be easily frightened by some of the abduction sequences, not to mention a few gruesome deaths.  I would imagine that those 12 and older will not find most scenes to be too jarring.<br /><br />And the rest of us?  In all probability, one will find this movie making precious little impact at all.  It is fascinating to watch while it is on the screen --- and the big screen really is the best medium for this film --- but once it is over, I very much doubt that many people will be drawn to see this movie again.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I just went to a Gavin DeGraw concert after listening to him for around 6 months and I am so happy I have this cd. His voice is not doctored, he sounds just as great in person. I have given this cd to at least 4 other people. I cant wait for the next one!
0739313126|5.0|I could hardly stand to turn my CD player off once I started listening to this \\"book.\\" I found the book fascinating. I'd never given any thought to the Holy Grail before this book, but found myself doing independent research on the subject after completing the CDs. Whether the premise of the story is true, fiction or otherwise, I can't remember the last book that grabbed my attention as this one did.<br /><br />The narrator, Paul Michael was fantastic! I've since begun a search for other books he's narrated.
1570629706|5.0|I admit that it has been several years since I read this book.  I also admit that as it is one of my favorite novels I am not an unbiased source (but who is).  With that grain of salt having been swallowed this book is foremost a tale about the birth of a new kind of spirituality.  Siddhartha is about the process experienced on the road to enlightenment.  I feel that some other reviewers who were perhaps not at the right point in their lives to appreciate that this is a story of the process rather than a how to.  It is not a self help book or a short-cut guide to enlightenment.  The novel tells with simple prose which is different from any of Hesse's other work in its simplicity.  It tells of the human frailty and failings of a being that leads to the discovery of the Buddhist philosophy.  The story pushes for you to think about what Siddhartha discovers, especially in the scene by the river, and to understand how this revelation relates to your world view.  I found this book at a time in my life when I needed to, and I hope it finds you at the right point in your life as well. The fewer expectations you have the better.  A very short novel, nothing more.  If you have ever been curious to know more about Buddhist thought this book encapsulates the most intrinsic tenets of the religion.  I hope you experience this book.  It is just a story, don't miss the forrest for the trees.  I hope any of this helps you to chose to read or to know it is not for you.

B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson's Thriller is still one of my favorite albums of all time!  The powerhouse hits of Beat It and Billie Jean are on here.  I have played this album numerous times since I first heard it in mid-1983.  I can't tell you the many times I slam doors on the You hear the door slam line on the song Thriller. This album has that kind of effect on you. After Thriller, nearly every artist tried to see if they would outsell Michael with their 9-song albums. All during 1983, 1984, and 1985. Even doing Michael Jackson-sounding songs too, but you can't beat the real thing. That album broke many sales records and still continued to sell for 2, 3 even 10 years after it worldwide. On the Budapest concert that came on HBO in 1992, fans were fainting--Michael has this magnetic effect on people worldwide when he performs!  I still like the funky Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', the overlooked Baby Be Mine, the lush Lady In My Life and others.  It has yet to outsell the Eagles Greatest Hits album in America, but it might catch up to it one day.  This album wins on strong music making, funky rhythm arrangements and some infectious catchy songs that can't go out of your head. Every current artist now, from Usher to Justin Timberlake, to Beyonce, to Omarion, to the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, say that they were heavily influenced by this album.  I don't think Michael's going to stop. I think he has another classic waiting in the wings to unleash to all of us, so it's not over yet. Thriller is still a favorite to many of us!
B00005JLWN|5.0|I had looked for a while to get this movie.  If you don't see Batman in this, your eyes are closed.  There is a lot of action and good effects.  It's Aldous Huxley's Brave New World revamped.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Stupid and incoherent horror movie that plays more like a video game than an actual film with Keanu Reeves doing his best but failing to bring any substance to his role and the rest of the actors failing as well thanks to the script, which is really badly written. Only Rachel Weisz come out of this mess with her dignity intact because she brings more to the movie and her role than she really needed to. Her performance is actually way better and much deeper than the movie itself and she and her character would have been better off as the lead in a better film than this because they are both the only real and complex thing about the entire movie. It's like she's the only real person in a computer-generated cartoon that should have been a real flesh and blood horror thriller instead.  <br /> <br />My two star review goes to Rachel Weisz's effort in respecting herself as an actor and in respecting the audience with a great and intelligent performance. Too bad the rest of the film does not even try to make the effort she does in doing that.  <br />
B0007GAERG|1.0|What is all the hype with this album? I only purchased it after hearing We Belong Together on the radio. I thought it might be something new and fresh. Unfortunatley I was wrong. <br />Boring, Dull and forgettable. <br />Don't waste you hard earned cash.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's album, Chariot, is straightforward, no-nonsense style rock and roll.  Sticking with a tried and true piano-guitar foundation, he delivers a set of songs that are reminiscent of old school rockers.  It comes as no surprise to see on Amazon that Gavin himself recommends music from Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, etc.  Judging from the sound of Chariot, these must be among the artists who have most influenced his music.   <br /> <br />Chariot bears solid songwriting with infectious melodies.  These tunes range from the gentle (\\"More than Anyone\\") to the defiant (\\"I Don't Wanna Be\\") to the rambunctious (\\"Chemical Party\\").  I love the piano backing in these songs.  As Gavin opens the album, Gavin's first line is \\"This is the start of something good,\\" and I can't help but apply that to the prospects of his musical career.  He's been quite successful with this album, and his roots-rock music is the type that will continue to draw an audience as long as he continues to play, so I think this is only the beginning for Gavin DeGraw.  We'll likely hear many more good things from him in the future.
B00005JOHU|3.0|\\"Lord of War\\" opens with the creation of a bullet. It's molded, packed, shipped, plucked out of a bucket, loaded and fired into a child's head.  <br /> <br />Writer/director Andrew Niccol's film blunt like that, and clever. It darkens world events we thought blessed. Americans celebrated the end of the Cold War. So did freelance gun dealer Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage). The fall of Communism left bunkers of weapons and war vehicles without an army to use them. Yuri, a Brooklyn son of Russian immigrants, swoops into the Ukraine, cleans out the stockpile, and moves the \\"merchandise\\" to third-world dictators. The mass genocides that have rages through both of our Gulf Wars - in Africa, Bosnia, Southeast Asia - partially owe their existence to peace between two superpowers.  <br /> <br />Yuri owes his fortune, his New York penthouse, his trophy wife Ava (Bridgit Moynihan), his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his soul to it. Starting with Yuri's first Brooklyn gun deal in 1984 and progressing through the viciousness of West Africa that rages still, \\"Lord of War\\" traces his descent into the amoral, reckless, killing coward he becomes by movie's end. It's not necessarily a tragedy - Yuri's a willing crook, part nihilist, part purposeful ignoramus - but a sober essay on gluttony as a way of life, fueled by international apathy. \\"The ones who know don't care anymore,\\" Yuri says. \\"And the ones who care won't know.\\"  <br /> <br />Yuri's lifestyle eventually leads him to the wars of West Africa in the late 1990s, specifically Liberia, run by a goofy fascist named Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker) and his son, Andre Jr. who owns a golden gun and drives a Ford Fairlane with two women dressed as Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders in the back. The Andres are Yuri's best clients and his worst temptation: They'll deliver him anything - enemies included - in exchange for guns.  <br /> <br />\\"Lord of War\\" occasionally pauses to consider Yuri's personal life. Vitaly starts as a partner, but his distaste for the work presses him toward self-destruction and addiction. Leto does his wild-eyed thing to some effect. Moynihan had A looks and C skills, serving the role of the bland, pretty Ava well. Unremarkable beyond her looks - and aware of it - she places conscience above comfort to aid her husband's Javert, Interpol cop Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).  <br /> <br />Yuri crosses key moral lines in West Africa; fully given over to his sins, we doubt his attempts to go straight when Ava initially confronts him. But the last act falters; it needlessly shoehorns Vitaly back into the business and fashions a cynical, unlikely anti-climax between Yuri and Valentine that seeks to shift the debate from our charming villain to the system that permits his existence. Ever the dutiful liberal film, \\"Lord of War\\" tacks on a postscript about the no good, very bad UN Security Council, but I'll better remember the scene where Yuri stumbles around in Liberia to discover two growling hyenas. It's fitting company for him.
B000002UVZ|3.0|You can pull two albums out of REM's cannon- \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" and \\"Monster\\"- and you're left with two distinct phases.  The phases are old- southern gothic 1980's alternative heavy folk guitar music, and new- 1990's mellow, quirky pop.  (REM were so much better when they did the former.)  The other two albums are hard-rocking experiemnts which are somewhat out of place (though welcomed) in light of the rest of the band's work.  Even though all of REM's albums garner crital acclaim, most of the fans of REM that I know are into the band's early work.  For example, I have never heard of anyone who loves \\"Up.\\"  But then again, I don't know any Moby fans. <br /> <br />For those of us who love the atmosphere of the early REM albums, LRP embodies the southern gothic ambiance that used to define the band.  And it rocks.  It may not be the quintessential work of early REM (see Murmur), but it is certainly the most spirited delivery of that original style.   <br /> <br />\\"Begin the Begin,\\" \\"These Days,\\" and \\"Cuyahoga\\" are among the most intriguing rock songs of the 1980's.  Supporting that are more simple, yet beautiful folk-rock songs like \\"The Flowers of Gutemala\\" and \\"Swan Swan H.\\" The only lame track on the disc is \\"Superman\\" which recieved considerable airplay in the 1990's. <br /> <br />As far as the strength of the material goes, LRP is second only to \\"Murmur.\\"  But, because of its raucous flavor, it is much more fun.  Solid songs and kick-ass guitar licks make this REM's best album.  I wish the band had continued on in this direction.  But... <br /> <br />The next REM album was \\"Document.\\"  This marks the end of one band and the beginning of another.  All good things come to an end.  A fine alternative pop band was born, but the original REM was gone forever.  For example, compare \\"Shiny Happy People\\" to \\"South Central Rain\\"- sound like the same band?
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|...this is his worst effort to date in my opinion. <br /> <br />I simply didn't find the film funny.  Don't get me wrong - it wasn't especially bad.  Just a bit blah!  Can't recall laughing out loud at any time. <br /> <br />Sandler's character usually connects but this time he failed to hit the spot. <br /> <br />I'm also a big fan of Chris Rock but in films he's only as good as the lines he is given and the role here was sadly lacking.  Might be an idea for Chris to stick to stand-up.

1573223085|2.0|look, read the book.  it made me so angry, i had plenty of conversation material for months to come.  basically, pink's neo-liberal strategies set the ideal game plan for yet more dependency of underdeveloped nations on developed nations not to mention greater payoff for the rich while the poor struggle.  come on people!!  using art as a hegemonic device is a GOOD THING?<br /><br />and, frankly, as an art educator, i had to laugh at pink's complete ignorance of art education theory and practice, finding it hilarious that he actually believes he has come up with innovation.  tune in pink - these ideas have been battled by aestheticians for decades, and NONE of them support using \\"high touch\\" for exploitation of the poor.<br /><br />his book reads like a tabloid, as it should, considering the lack of well-researched material.  and so, if you want to read the diary of a a man who learned how to draw a \\"realistic\\" portrait of himself and then found the secret to individual success and world domination - be my guest.  but, have a few laughs along the way.  not even da vinci exhibited so much egotisim.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|When a band like P.O.D. (Payable on death) emerges from the metal underground and takes the world by storm, obviously there are going to be bands that emulate the gods of P.O.D.  System of a band falls under this rule.  Like Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down is yet another \\"rip-off\\", so to speak, of P.O.D.  I understand why P.O.D. would influence such a large number of bands, but do these bands have to steal every essential element of the band they are influneced by?  Rage stole P.O.D.'s politics, Limp Bizkit committed thievery by stealing their bass-driven melodies, and System robbed P.O.D. of their sporadic time signatures.  To put it frankly, P.O.D. was raped, and bands like Limp Bizkit only add insult to injury.  I give System of a Down credit for their success, but I feel that they owe most of it to the founding fathers of Socio-political Rap Rock, P.O.D.  I think people need to be more aware of P.O.D., because it seems that they have faded into the ether, leaving a legacy unknown to today's youth.  Peace Out-Franky
B000002GVO|4.0|this album by the eagles is a very good album but not great.it starts off like a greatest hits and gradually goes into forgettable  tunes.of course we all know \\"hotel california\\" thanks to the radio overplaying it.it's unfortunate because it is a great song and arguably their best.\\"new kid in town\\" and \\"life in the fast lane\\" follow,which makes for a perfect album so far.than you have \\"wasted time\\" and the reprise which are good.\\"victim of love\\" is next,another good song.unfortunately the next 3 songs i could do without,seemingly just filler,eventhough they aren't terrible songs,only that they are forgettable.in my opinion the ultimate albums to buy from them are their greatest hits vol.1&2 which show their greatest talents from a band great on beautiful harmonies.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|I purchased this CD (and The Stooges) primarily to give my modern stereo a work-out. Anyone who has the pre-remastered Stooges CDs knows how muddy the quality was on those past releases, especially compared to today's artists and their CDs. <br /> <br />Not only did Elektra do a phenomenal job remastering the tapes, they turned both albums into necessary collector's editions for any Stooges fan. In addition to a legendary album remastered and brought up to today's standards, you get a bonus disc full of unreleased material.  <br /> <br />The second disc here is for anyone who missed Rhino's ultra-limited release \\"The Funhouse Sessions\\" boxset.  While not as inclusive as a 7-disc boxset, it's definitely the more affordable way to get a glimpse of the creative process behind this album.  We're treated to multiple takes of the songs, each one remastered to the same high quality as the first disc.  Additionally, two songs that were left off of the final album see the light of day here.  Finally, the shortened single versions of \\"Down On The Street\\" and \\"1970\\" are tagged on the end of the second disc. <br /> <br />Unlike the remastering job that Columbia did with Raw Power, Elektra kept the rawness and the energy intact and created a mix that sounds great. None of the overmodulation and distortion -- you can turn this mother up LOUD. A very clean mix that still manages to keep the volume, danger and intensity of America's greatest rock band. Ever.

From one end of the spectrum to the other.   <br /> <br />I don't have a fancy degree in movies but I liked it :-)  The humor is in the details, the pacing of the scenes, the warpedness, and in the slowness.  The subtle ways Napolean or one of his friends says or does something, anything.      <br /> <br />There is no plot.  But there is a plot, just noone tells you what that plot is.  It's a few months in the life of Napolean and his  wierd family.   <br /> <br />And MAN Napolean can DANCE!

Cale's original mixes (too \\"arty,\\" as explained in the liner notes) for \\"No Fun,\\" \\"1969,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\\" and \\"Little Doll\\" are included; at their best, they're completely different songs from the versions we all know.  \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" is the stand-out, with Cale burying the guitar and bringing the piano and bells to the fore, creating something so familiar yet so different to what is probably the Stooges' most well-known song.

0064409422|5.0|People warned me not to reread, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".  Oh, it's way too simplistic!  Oh, it's way too didactic!  Oh, it's way too.... you get the picture.  Admittedly, I hadn't picked up the book since my mother first read it to me (with the exceedingly beautiful illustrations of Michael Hague) when I was five or six.  Doing so now, I was astounded to find that not only is the book an exercise in writing a perfect little children's tale but that the religious elements, while present, are there if you need them and not there if you don't.  In and of itself, this is the quintessential children's fantasy novel.  It has villains that can be redeemed, evil that cannot, a hero that is frightening and furry all at once, brave kids, and lovable characters.  The writing is brilliant, the descriptions delightful, and the book accessible to all kinds of kids, regardless of age or belief system.  A class act from a particularly classy writer.<br /><br />It's World War II and the children of London are being shipped out to the countryside to escape potential bombings.  To their delight, they find themselves arriving at a large mysterious mansion of a home.  A kindly professor rules the roost and the kids have fun exploring the place.  That's when Lucy, the youngest, decides to explore an old wardrobe sitting alone in one of the abandoned rooms.  Inside its door, Lucy discovers the land of Narnia and meets up with a faun by the name of Mr. Tummus.  When the other kids eventually discover Narnia as well (including the beastly Edmund) they discover its curse, its self-proclaimed queen, and a lion named Aslan who will save them all.<br /><br />Here's what I love about this story.  First of all, it's undoubtedly the most English children's book ever written.  I know that \\"Harry Potter\\" has a fair share of Britishisms, but there's nothing to compare to English children saying things like, \\"Sharp's the word!\\".  I wonder to myself how many hundreds of thousands of people alive today can remember how much they wanted to try Turkish Delight after reading this tale (and how many, once they did, were disappointed).  Narnia is a perfect little paradise of mannerisms.  People have tea all the time and giants speak with comfortable cockney accents (complete with calling Aslan, \\"your honor\\".  Another thing I loved about the book was the number of details I hadn't noticed as a child.  How many papers have been written regarding the White Witch's striking similarity to Hans Christian Anderson's, \\"Snow Queen\\"?  Also, I had no idea that the Witch was supposed to be a descendent of Lilith and not Eve.  Finally, I enjoyed discovering on this latest reading that perhaps Edmund's personality could (in part) be blamed on the old British boarding school system.<br /><br />Is this book perfect?  Goodness me, no.  It's dated in all sorts of ways.  Perhaps the most striking problem comes in the form of Father Christmas himself.  The appearance of Santa Claus in the middle of the book brilliantly ties an otherwise incongruous element of Christmas to the original myth.  The problem comes with Saint Nicholas goes about handing presents to the four children.  He hands Peter a sword and shield (ooooh... aaaah) then gives weapons to the girls as well with careful instructions to never use them.  Say what?  Father Christmas (and, by extension, Mr. Lewis himself) justifies their lack of use by saying, \\"battles are ugly when women fight\\".  I suppose they're downright civilized otherwise, right?  And how are we to deal with the fact that the Witch fights?  Little jarring elements like this crop up occasionally throughout the story.  Fortunately, they're few and far between.  Nothing so large as to detract from the otherwise remarkable nature of the storytelling.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien once complained that his friend Lewis didn't put enough work into creating an alternate fantasyland.  After all, Narnia hasn't its own written language or culture or highly specialized geography.  For all of Tolkien's sneers, the book has worked itself deeply within the public consciousness.  Even to this day, elements of this tale remain with me.  I remember always being deeply disturbed by the fact that the children grow up in Narnia, become old, then stumble through the wardrobe and become kids again.  Wouldn't that do something to your head?  Sounds more like a Charlie Kaufman conceit than an element in a children's book.  But it's hard not to love Narnia.  No matter what version you read, no matter who has done the illustrations or how large or small the book is, this is truly a story for everyone.  A must-read for every speaker of the English language.re or highly specialized geography.  For all of Tolkien's sneers, the book has worked itself deeply within the public consciousness.

Gone are the silly love ditties, the Motown covers, the shake your bum tunes in exchange for thought provoking, powerful, dramatic pieces of music.

0060989157|5.0|YES, I'm proud to say that I AM a Crue fan, and have been for many years, as it shall remain. From the bottom of my heart I adored their concert here on 8/20/05. It was the best money I've spent this year. Second to no other except \\"The Dirt.\\" Nonetheless, fan or not, this book would have capivated me from the very beginning.  <br />Each member tells it in his own words, which is extremely rare these days! The complete honesty word for word was so enticing as I read, I had a hard time putting it down at times when I needed to.  <br />These unforgetable icons, be it rock stardom or by reputation, are not only heros of their own sort, but heros to us as well. By showing everyone that it's ok to make mistakes, just fix them, BEFORE you die. Nikki, Vince, Mick & Tommy are vulnerable, desperate at times, and very much just as human as you and I.  <br />I am a mother of 2 and would use Motley Crue as role models for them, should they choose a rock n roll venue. Their music speaks volumes alone, the book is one more advantage to us. <br />The purest form of honestly at it's rawest.  <br />The photography in itself is awe inspiring, but it's the story that is the backbone of this rare find in literature.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Overall, this is a great film. A lot of footage never seen before. The biggest criticism of this documentary is the absence of Ramblin' Jack Elliott, who played a huge role in making Dylan who he was in the early days. Elliott was the original Woody Guthrie protege, and Dylan's early persona was probably more a copy of Elliott than Guthrie, who was already too sick to play. Maybe Elliott didn't want to participate in this film? Who knows? He's still alive, unlike Dave van Ronk, who's in it quite a bit. Nevertheless, his absence is a big hole.....
B00003CXTG|5.0|Touchstone Pictures collaborated with Jerry Bruckheimer Films for \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" an epic story of two life-long friends (Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett) and a lovely nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who are caught up in the tragic attack of December 7, 1941, \\"A date which will live in infamy,\\" which preceeded this country's involvement in World War II. The performances in the film, particularly of Ms. Beckinsale, are right on target. The soundtrack is excellent. True, the movie DID play loose with history (the real reason behind the attack, etc) but it's Hollywood, what the hell did you expect, for Christ's sake? My favorite scene is the one where Danny (Josh Hartnett; it just happens to be my real name, by the way; what a coincidence) and Evelyn (the lovely Ms. Kate Beckinsale) are in the parachute hangar. I wish that the scene had been more sensual, but it's good as it is. Erotic without being explicit. The sound quality is AMAZING. It enhances the experience even more. Look out for cameos by Alec Baldwin, Dan Akroyd, Academy Award winners Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding, Jr and others. I don't understand why people hate this movie; did they expect Hollywood to stick to facts? You rarely get that from them. I know the actual history of the attack and had no problem with the liberties taken. Great film. It was much better in the theater. On DVD, it's magnificent. Rated PG for intense war violence, images of wounded, brief sensuality and mild language.
0316172324|5.0|Once in a while, a book comes along that changes the way you see the world. Blink is one of those books.<br /><br />Psychologist Malcolm Gladwell explores the decision-making process of the sub conscious mind. Almost as fast as the speed of light, the brain processes information, evaluates input, sorts and prioritizes data and responds with a judgment, all in the blink of an eye. As humans, we are constantly, unknowingly, making snap decisions every minute we are awake.<br /><br />If we could slow down time to its smallest elements and study ourselves in the process, we might understand more clearly how and why we make the decisions we do. In the knowing of how that works, might come a better understanding of how to make more informed, more thoughtful, right decisions.<br /><br />Gladwell looks at married couples, police officers in the line of fire, combat troops, autistic people, and many others to grasp the complexities and simplicities of the decision-making process. Learning how we \\"think without thinking\\" may teach us how to see more clearly and critically and to make better choices along the way.<br /><br />Blink is a fascinating work.
B000AL730O|5.0|Intimate production, better than average songwriting, and great singing.
B000A88EV4|4.0|I first saw this in a little run-down art house theater.  The auditorium was empty except for an old woman and two strange men who, lured by the title and the fishnet stockings on the original poster, had obviously come expecting a different kind of movie than the one they got.  There were times during the screening when I almost felt as if the theater had become part of the movie.    This is a film that's fascinating, but, damn, it's a bit of a ride.  I'm frequently catching it late at night, on IFC, and even just a few moments almost always wear me out -- definitely a movie that brings to your attention when you need to go to bed.  I appreciate \\"Naked,\\" as a filmic experience, and it is indeed an incredible one, but I have to wonder if this is what movies are supposed to do.    Still, it does what it does and what it does is unlike anything else you could want to find.      David Thewlis may have made a mistake starring in this because he is so brilliant, so engaging, so horrifying, so smart, so black that to this day, I still have a hard time seeing him as any other character -- whether he's in \\"Gangster #1\\" or \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\\"  It's great work.  He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, he'll make you carsick.    I'd also like to nominate the scene between Johnny and the security guard -- their discussion of time, and space, and barcodes and apocalypse and Dadaist nuns -- to be elected to the office of the great scenes of the 90s, and to take a place on the larger list of the great cinematic moments altogether.
0393312836|4.0|Would you rather have a zombie good-natured son or a disturbed delinquent son?  The issue of free will has been a intriguing issue since Christianity--Jesus wants to have you love him out of choice and the ability to choose makes one human.  So, Burgess presents this question in a colorful futuristic scenario.  Although this is a confrontational topic, Burgess does an excellent job of presenting this issue, developing both sides of the argument without bias. <br />Break-down: <br />\\"The pro-free will argument\\": <br />The ability to make decisions and feel emotions and development of abstract thoughts is what defines the human race from our sans-opposable thumb cousins...you guessed it, the monkey and ape classification.  Once you remove these characteristics from our catalog, we fail to be humans.  Burgess presents this side of the dispute by showing the vulnerability of Alex while under the institutionalized processing.  Furthermore, he goes back to his family, only to be turned away.  It is nearly impossible to sympathize with this still impressionable teenager. <br /> <br />\\"The pro-processing argument\\": <br />Burgess does not directly show the implications of this argument, but he tactfully subconsciously places vivid memories to exaggerate the violence induced chaos of Alex and his gang.  We would not have such specific and painful accounts of the attacks of Alex and his gang if Burgess were trying to weigh the issue.  We get every gory detail of rapes and fights; we also experience their lack of remorse and moral vacancy.   <br /> <br />Finally, <br />Because Burgess puts Alex back in his original state avoids the stereotypical \\"clean ending\\".
B00008RH3L|5.0|this one, and Barton Fink are my favorite cohen brother movies. this movie from 1990 is fantastic gangster drama...with style to byrne.
B000148KK2|4.0|This is a complicated album. Very unlike her past recordings. It is almost all new music. composed by Krall and sometimes Elvis Costello, her husband. The lyrics are also complex, and deep. It sounds autobiographical. Some of the musical is lyrical, more not very. Yet this deserves three or four listens--cetainly more than one. It is good, maybe great in spots. She does it well, except for hard-to-understand lyrics some of the time. However, most lyrics are printed in the libretto. <br /> <br />Give this a try if you like Diana Krall. This may be the girl she wants to be.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|\\"Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.\\" - Oscar Wilde <br /> <br />The Brown Bunny is nothing short of spendid.  As someone who deeply respects the works of very, very few directors alive today, I feel Vincent Gallo has proven, without a doubt, that he belongs in the ranks of the world's finest filmmakers. <br /> <br />Gallo understands fully that film has a transforming, transcendental effect when it is employed as a visual medium.   For those of us who have had relevatory experiences with film, for those who know what I mean when I say \\"art is a religion\\", the ranting and raving of critics like Ebert and the disdain of the uninformed are simply par for the course.   <br /> <br />Thank you Vincent, for _Brown Bunny_, an absolutely stunning work of art.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This is a film that many will not want to watch.  Early on, I came as close as I ever do to turning a film off for any reason other than sheer boredom.  We are presented with a chaotic whirlwind of sound, light,profanity, and suggestive body placement as two men (Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel) frantically search for someone called Le Tenia (Jo Prestia) in an S&M club, capped off with a stunningly graphic (and technically impressive) sequence in which a man's head is beaten in repeatedly with a fire extinguisher in one long, seemingly unbroken shot.  All of this appeared to serve no purpose, just vile, ugly behavior below the level of an animal.  I was sickened.    But I stayed with it and I'm glad I did.  It soon became apparent that the story was unfolding in reverse.  As director Gaspar Noe follows his characters back to the beginning of this nightmarish evening--through an even more horrific and graphic rape scene, also presented in a single, unblinking take--and even earlier, we are able to process the violence.  It becomes the tragic shadow that hangs over the lives of three likeable people (Cassel, Dupontel, and the beautiful Monica Belluci) and forces us to contemplate our own lives.  A similarly tragic shadow may hang over any one of us, but we are blessed with ignorance; otherwise, our lives would be unliveable.  This is a serious film that does not employ violence as a payoff, but as a point of departure for consideration of the human condition./
1591396190|5.0|But certainly not deceiving, like so many \\"how to manage well\\" works of the last several decades.  I found this book not just inspiring, but also immediately useful in reframing how business can be done.  There are many very good summaries of the contents by other reviewers in this forum, so I will not repeat.  The central point is so straightforward and simple that I whacked myself on the forehead and wondered why someone hadn't expressed the point of view so well earlier.  That central point to me was that a business, maybe any business, can for a time break into an area of low competition, high customer value with their product or service.  It is almost too obvious that this is where most enterprises would truly like to be, rather than beating their heads daily or hourly against teeth-grinding, sometimes destructive competition.   <br /> <br />I personally found the analysis useful, and being of quantative nature, actually liked doing the listing and charting to generate ideas.  The reader will probably spot some areas (small, to be sure), that can be safely ignored: <br /> <br />     - The authors' comment about spotting an \\"incoherent strategy\\" by a jagged value curve (p. 42, hardcover) is nonsense, as you could generate many value curve shapes by how you arrange the value items across the bottom of the graph. <br /> <br /> <br />     - The \\"principles of fair process\\" (p. 174) is stuff that has been written about a zillion times, and the correct answer is mostly a \\"if it comes out right, it was the right way\\" kind of thing. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend this as one of the best marketing books I have seen in some time.
B00007AJF9|4.0|This film about Queen Elizabeth I's (Cate Blanchett) rise to power takes liberties with history but presents a compelling tale of treachery, conspiracy, and ruthlessness.  Even as Elizabeth ultimately triumphs over the forces that seek to drive her from the throne, there is something poignant and tragic in the way she must abandon her humanity to do so.  \\"I have become a virgin,\\" she declares at the end.  She enters court caked in white makeup that makes her appear inhuman and untouchable, and everyone in attendence is awed by the transformation.  Contrasted with the playful young woman in the early part of the film, she presents a moving example of how lonely it can be at the top.  Indian director Shakur Kapur acquits himself well and cast members William Attenborough and Geoffery Rush deliver great performances./
0316172324|3.0|This book has one of those eye-catching titles (congratulate the author for that marketing coup!) that makes you want to read the dust jacket.  I found the first part of the book interesting, and the last half a bit confusing.  In the first part, I suppose the key point was: at least give your first impression a fair hearing - maybe a book can be judged by its cover, and Mr. Gladwell sure tried hard on his own book.  I do not agree, though, that this first impression, the \\"Blink,\\" is an irrational process, as opposed to a thought-out course of action.  That blink is just as rational and natural to the human brain, only much faster.  Rational thought and action doesn't mean writing every decision out on 85 pages of 8x14 legal paper, in ink and in grammatically correct sentences. <br /> <br />The second half of the book was less interesting.  I still do not understand Mr. Gladwell's story about the SWAT team shooting, much less which point he is trying to make.  Should the \\"Blink\\" have been ignored, or should it have been trusted?  Nevertheless, the first part was good enough for me to recommend reading the book.  The part about judging someone by what their dorm room looked like was quite good, based on what I have seen through the years.  The impression shouldn't be of how smart the dorm-room-owner is, or how kind he/she is, or how effective.  Dorm room condition does seem to be a good indicator of the person's mental process - how neat or sloppy, how careful or careless with property. <br /> <br />I didn't buy it, but rather waited for it to become available in the library.   Best way, I think.
0596007124|5.0|Reading a design patterns book for me is interesting when I find that nugget of coolness, the rest of the time it is plain boring.  However, this book really keeps it interesting for the most part and still drives home the design points.  I think it would make a great book for someone wanting to get into design patterns, which is important for anyone writing OOP.  Also, it is a good all-around reference book for the serious and seasoned OOP programmer.  I have GoF, and I refer to this book more often.
B0009Q0F5U|4.0|If you watched the first season and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this album. If you loved the first season you will love this album. I was brought to tears by some of these tracks on first listen when I was reminded of the scenes from the series. <br /> <br />That said many tracks on the album work mostly as filler. The score on the series is meant to fade into the background in parts, which works well for television but not as well for an album. While this soundtrack isn't as bad for fading into the background as the miniseries soundtrack, that is still true in parts. However, there are enough good tracks to justify purchasing this album, especially if you want to support the continuation of the series.
B0000CFW87|5.0|There is so much to be said for this amazing collection of vocal tracks from national sensation Josh Groban.  His rich baritone is as soothing as it is powerful, and so smooth that you'll hardly believe your ears.  Tracks such as \\"Oceano,\\" \\"Per Te,\\" and the widely-played \\"You Raise Me Up\\" shine with his incredible talent.  Flowing from one verse to another, you'll find your mind intensely focused on his beautiful voice, not often caring what he's saying since most of the tracks aren't in English. <br /> <br />Other tracks such as the powerhouses \\"Si Volvieras A Mi,\\" \\"All' Improvviso Amore,\\" and \\"My Confession\\" do a marvelous job of showing off Josh's incredible vocal range and tenacity.  Moving from one pitch to another with astonishing skill, Josh's voice will move and touch you.  Indeed, Groban himself penned the moving \\"Remember When It Rained,\\" another track that flows gently, slowly building to a powerful finale.   <br /> <br />From high to low pitches, verse to chorus and back again, his voice never falters -- remaining forever brilliant, you'll find yourself yearning for more.  This young star is destined to see more good fortune -- until then, we can only patiently await to get even CLOSER to him.
0451169514|5.0|Last night, Friday September the 23rd 2005, I finished one of the most incredible tour de force pieces of literature I have ever read. No, actually, it's THE best tour de force piece of literature I have ever read! Reading this was not like reading a novel - it was more like and experience. Over the month or so that it took me to read, I fawned over Bev Marsh with Ben Hanscom, ran for my life with Mike Hanlon with Henry Bowers and his gang in hot pursuit...I faced the leper outside the house on Neibolt Street with Eddie Kaspbrak, I rode pillion on Silver with Bill Denbrough, I faced the werewolf with Richie Tozier, and found myself locked within the Standpipe along with Stan Uris and two dead boys... <br />What I'm saying is this book is like a portal into another world - or rather, a portal into Derry, Maine in the years 1958 and 1985. The book feels more like a film than words on a page, so vivid and clear is the description. It is at times tender, at times moving, but constantly terrifying and disturbing. Truly, this book is not for those of a weak stomach. It paints a brutal, violent and bloody picture, and contains a terror that seeps into your bones and turns your spine to jelly. But \\"It\\" is so much more than a \\"scary novel\\". It is a beautiful and tear-jerking insight into that magical kingdom of childhood, and the loss of innocence and everything else worth living for as the characters grow up and become adults. It is incredibly layered and expansive - over 1000 pages long. But, unlike \\"The Stand\\", for example, there was not one moment when I felt like the story was being unnecessarily dragged out or in need of tighter editing. The pacing of the book was simply perfect. Everything is important, everything there for a reason. The characters are simply the best I have ever read about: truly, you feel by the end that you were in that group, and eight, ethereal, invisible, non-existent part of the Losers, but there all the same to experience their horror, pain, joy and grief. But there are two other important characters, of course: It, call him (or her!) what you will: Bob Gray, the Leper, the Spider, the werewolf, the drowned boys, Pennywise the Dancing Clown...the deadlights. And the other character is the town of Derry itself, a haunted city, an urban sponge of brick and glass and chainlink that soaks up the evil and hate in the world and holds it within itself, quietly permeating every nook and cranny of every building on every street. The fire at the Black Spot...Claude Heroux's massacre of William Mueller's posse in the Silver Dollar...and the creature of It itself, an evil entity, as much a part of the city as the foundations on which it was built. <br />Yes, this is simply the finest novel I have ever read. King's sheer genius and the book's utter brilliance is something I cannot convey with words. I know that my experience of reading it over the August and early September of 2005 is one I will always remember, something that I will always be able to look back upon and smile.
B00030GMO0|5.0|This is a great CD to dance to.  Very catchy music.  I defy you to sit still ... Nice counterbalance in that the lyrics tend to be dark and ironic.  Super produced dance music ...

Mr. Brightside still my favorite song of theirs.

B0007P3582|1.0|Throughout 2003, 50 Cent's \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" was a welcome break from all the overcomercialized pop albums coming out of \\"The Lou\\", such as \\"Nellyville\\" (Nelly) \\"Murphy's Law\\" (Murphy Lee) and \\"Jackpot\\" (Chingy). Hailed as the savior of rap, 50 followed it up with a very mediocre effort on G Unit's 2004 LP \\"Beg For Mercy\\", which still had a few good songs. In 2005, \\"Fiddy\\" and his G Unot cronies hope to sell alot of clothes, lunchboxes, energy bars, and whatever other licensable items they can get their greedy little fingers on because the G Unit label is more a symbol of musical farce than musical excellence. \\"The Massacre\\", in contrast to \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is garbage. If you liked that album, you'll only need a few minutes to realize how bad this one is. 50 Cent now personifies the type of rapper he was apparently going to spare us from 2 1/2 years ago - an overrated, overmarketed, \\"entertainer\\"; with his own clothing line, own energy drink, vitamin water, etcetra. He has become the New York version of Nelly. 50 Cent can't rap to save his life and his subjects are all the same (Yes 50. We all know you got shot 9 times, and didn't die). This was a conscious decision by 50 Cent to become a commercial rapper. He has lost all respect and hopefully he won't make more music; he sucks anyway. Not only are \\"Fiddy\\"'s musical skills terrible, his actions in dealing with other rappers also create problems, like claiming he wrote The Documentary - an album from a real MC, not a half-assed sellout rapper who keeps speaking on the same bullsh*t. At least Nelly didn't go around starting problems. F*ck G Unit.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|A band that brims with excitement and delivers their musical repertoire with great energy and passion. I'm leaving off a star only because I believe it is on their current tour (2005) that they have truly mastered the stage. They are absolutely electrifying to see live. The X & Y album has proven that more guitars and rocking' songs are a step in the right direction. The ballads are beautiful, but no one wants to spend two hours watching Chris Martin swaying at the piano. What we are treated to now is a spectacular live ROCK show that is infused with total commitment, musical expertise and keen showmanship (captured brilliantly on the video screens, as well as the stage). Noboody is slacking in the band. They come out with a spirit of perfection and keep it going for the entire show.<br /><br />The ballads now coalesce smoothly with the epic rock sounds. The band seems more confident in their tight delivery and the powerful effect it is having on massive audiences throughout the world. They are constantly pushing themselves to become better and better; and the results are certainly paying off. I see about 30, or forty, great concerts a year and Coldplay has proven to be one of the top five experiences.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I'd say this is one of Dylan's fluffiest albums yet lyrically, but it knows it's light.  The music is wonderful.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is Dylan's longest running band.  This album is a good sampling of what you'll hear musically at his shows these days.
B0000VD04M|5.0|makers ever. This film left me stunned and enchanted. Depp is really powerful as Ed Wood. Wood comes off as one of the most childlike humans on a serious mission without the skill or means, but enough gumption and belief in his mission to make some really bad films, so bad that they're classics. This is a kind of behind the scenes drama of a group of people who don't really have the big name, big money to be taken seriously or be given credit to make a film. But the people are all too real and gain much empathy with the average movie goer. It's like an outsider's view for the outsider.
B00003CY6M|4.0|\\"Serendipity: (n) Faculty of making positive discoveries by accident and or chance.\\"<br /><br />I saw this movie with a group of my single girlfriends, and it was so sweet. This movie mixes in chance with hilarity and a lot of love, making it a great movie.<br /><br />Here's a very condensed version of the plot. The two characters, a witty English girl who believes wholeheartedly in chance, and a determined hopeless romantic man meet while shopping for Christmas presents in New York. When they both want to buy the same pair of black gloves, they meet and have a date. However, both have partners, and so they are parted. The girl, Sara, writes her name and phone number in a book and puts it in a bookstore somewhere in NY. The man is determined to find that book. Several years later, they are both engaged to be married but still cannot get each other out of their minds. Is it too late?<br /><br />This romantic movie isn't chocked full with adventure, but it will make you feel great at the end. I cried real tears towards the super-sweet ending.<br /><br />Watch this movie if you yourself believe in serindipity-or if you just want to see the cutest romantic comedy of your lifetime.<br /><br />The acting isn't the most excellent I've ever seen, however, it is pretty above par.<br /><br />Great movie, overall.
B0009S2T0M|3.0|Oldboy probably does rate five stars when it comes to the traditional categories.  This is an intriguing story with passionate, yet not overdone, acting.  The scenery is so intelligent I'd call it landscaping.  However, there is a Korean word that describes my difficulty with this film--JONGSEO.  My clumsy translation of the word is \\"intuitive moral spirit.\\"  Director Park embraces a postmodern \\"whatever works\\" ethic in this revenge film about an obnoxious drunkard who finds himself imprisoned for fifteen years, and then embarks on a quest for revenge and answers.  He does not know why he was taken captive.  During the journey the victim grapples with revenge, love, and ultimately right and wrong. <br /> <br />My reason for downgrading the rating is the conclusions this film draws.  \\"Even though I am a beast, don't I have a right to live?\\"  This is the key line of the film.  However compelling this plea may seem to be, the bottom-line for Oldboy is that traditional mores, be they about family, love, and even compassion for humanity, are meaningless.  Whatever passions may captivate us, proclaims the story, we have the right to act on them...because even beasts deserve to live. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  5 stars for cinematic qualities, but one star for degenerate social commentary.  Those viewers with religious convictions are especially encouraged to avoid this movie--it will leave you feeling unclean and despondent.
B0002OERI0|1.0|this cd sucks. you can do yourself a favor and throw it away and buy 1039 smoothed out slappy hours instead and listen to some ok punk. nothing on american idiot is punk.... just more commercial pop for little girls! i mean come on! if you want real political punk you should listen to some Reagan Youth, Anti-Flag, the Unseen, Cheap Sex, even some Adolescents (they have a few political songs)... so yeah... listen to real punk not this crap
B000002U9W|4.0|Pink Floyd's 1970 masterwork \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" sometimes tends to get put off to one side as far as the band's most important output is concerned. Granted, while it doesn't have the same immortal stature as \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"The Wall\\" or even \\"Meddle\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is still a very important album in the early Floyd catalog and is probably their most diverse and uniquely orchestrated work.<br /><br />The six-part 24-minute title track was composed in collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin who helped with its orchestral and choral arrangements. While some parts of the piece tend to ramble on repetitively, there are some genuine moments of greatness heard especially in the piece's recurring brass fanfare which echoes themes reminiscent of The Who's \\"Tommy\\". The tape loop collage heard before the finale is particularly striking and offers a glimpse of things to come for the band. Overall, the \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" suite is probably the closest thing Pink Floyd has ever come to modern classical music and despite differences of critical opinions, it is an absolute triumph.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album are three shorter pop-oriented pieces. \\"If\\" is a beautiful acoustic Roger Waters-penned ballad and is a suprisingly positive uplifting love song. \\"Summer '68\\" written by keyboardist Richard Wright is an upbeat swinging affair that features a slight nod to The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" with its tightly arranged brass and layered vocal harmonies. \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is a mellow folk ballad written by David Gilmour which has a definite Crosby, Stills and Nash influence and features some great steel guitar playing in the background.<br /><br />Closing out the album is another underrated epic, \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" which despite its title, is not psychedelic at all. The sounds of Pink Floyd roadie Alan Stilles making breakfast in drummer Nick Mason's kitchen are heard throughout the entire 13-minute track and connect the piece's three instrumental segments. The opening \\"Rise and Shine\\" segment is primarily a minimalist piano and organ-based piece. The middle section \\"Sunny Side Up\\" is a relaxing acoustic guitar piece while the closing section \\"Morning Glory\\" is a slow rock-oriented number. Like the album's title track, this piece offers a glimpse of things to come for Pink Floyd with its random-chance musique concrete sound effects and looped pieces of speech. Although the band themselves have dismissed \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" as 'rubbish' over the years, it is actually quite a pleasant piece of music overall.<br /><br />Over the last 35 years, Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" has aged gracefully. Sure, there are parts of it that are over-indulgent and tedious. However, the good outweighs the bad with this album. The band ventured out into unknown territory and in this reviewers opinion, they succeeded in every way.<br /><br />An interesting side-note is the fact that this is a 1970 release with a 52-minute total running time - a generously long album for its time and above and beyond, a triumphant underrated orchestral rock masterpiece!!!instrumental segments.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|After listening to this album for the first time I was tempted to throw out every other album i owned. <br /> <br />Bob nails it - love, losing, anger, passion, human interaction, chance, romance, poetry, metaphors, imagery, everything in the roller coaster of life. <br /> <br />Amazingly enough, though this official release doesn't contain it, the original New York versions of the songs heard on the Bootleg Series are even better.  Several of the songs are more raw, less \\"studio\\", and seem to capture his true original meaning.  Buy both - worth much more than the price of the CDs.
0679428895|5.0|This seemed less a historical novel to me than a rather scathing critique of our own times. At the end Harris even makes some strange and cryptic comments on the goings-on of these days, including an odd thought about \\"global warming.\\" (no, not at all the predictable global warming comment). If it is all a metaphor for the current Zeitgeist then what Harris has to say may not make a lot of people happy. <br /> <br />The favorable straight-up reviews are solid and those seeking a fast-paced and well-written historical novel should grab this. However, if you're the sort who likes books that may be more than what they seem (you know who you are) then i think you'll like this a lot.
0385512058|5.0|There are a lot of networking books to choose from. Out of the three I read biased on Amazon reviews, I like this one the best.  <br /> <br />I don't want to be like the any of these authors, they have too many loose contacts, but there is a lot of learn from them.  <br /> <br />What I like about Keith's book is he considers networking and making friends one in the same, or close to it. That for a great life, business and pleasure do mix. He lays this out in such an honest way that I can see it really does work for him.  <br /> <br />I tell you what, he convinced me to try working on making friends. And I can report it's working, in a honest way.  <br /> <br />Thanks Keith. <br />

B0009A1AS2|5.0|I honestly don't understand where all the flak on this album is coming from. In my opinion, this is a highly solid album that carries on the Dream Theater that I have come to love. It is definitely less heavy than 2003's Train of Thought, but I appreciate their willingness to take more of a diverse approach after their relentlessly angst-filled previous outing. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Octavarium has two of Dream Theater's best songs: Panic Attack and Sacrificed Sons. Panic Attack can only be described as a sort of metal Liquid Tension Experiment song with vocals. The riff is relentlessly heavy and very fast, with a great driving bassline and the awe-inspiring solos from Petrucci and Rudess we've come to expect. The lyrics get a bit contrived at points, but it's a minor quibble, because Panic Attack is in my opinion tied with The Glass Prison as the best song to come out of a Dream Theater album since Metropolis Part II. Sacrificed Sons is also a fantastic song, and is without question the best song ever written about 9/11. It starts off in a very ballad-like fashion, but don't let that fool you. After the first chorus, the band really starts rocking. Petrucci's guitar work really takes center stage here, with his powerful riffs driving the tempo, especially during the final verses. Just a fantastic all around song. <br /> <br />Octavarium is rounded out with 3 songs that are still great, but not quite the classics that Panic Attack and Sacrificed Sons are. These Walls is a more proggy song than most on here, with Rudess's keyboards doing most of the flashy work. But Petrucci shows that sometimes a little can go along way, and the slow but thumping guitar work on These Walls is just as easy to rock out to as any of his most complex solos. These Walls ends on a great note, the last minute or so is just so polished and dramatic it really reflects on the track as a whole. This is Scenes From a Memory style Dream Theater, walking the line between prog rock and metal.<br /> <br />The Root of All Evil is the continuation of Portnoy's saga of alcoholism, picking up where The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul left off. Like the previous two parts, The Root of All Evil is an unapologetic, in-your-face rocker. It reprises several lyrical themes from the previous two parts, but that's only natural considering they all share the same subject. This song will be sure to please those who liked the metal direction Dream Theater took on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and especially Train of Thought. <br /> <br />Finally, we come to the sprawling, 24 minute title track. Octavarium is Dream Theater's giant shoutout to all their influences. There are pieces here that sound like progressive pioneers Pink Floyd, Rush, and Yes, and even some metal bands like Black Sabbath or Iron Maiden. Octavarium does drag in parts, but that's only natural when you're writing a song that long. Octavarium really picks up at Full Circle (which I believe is Part 4 of the song, but I'm not sure). Here we see Dream Theater driving up the tempo, building tension for the conclusion of the piece. The lyrics here are fascinating, with James LaBrie intertwining countless musical references. Among them are the Doors' Light My Fire, the Who's My Generation, and in what was the most surprising for me, Pink Floyd's Careful With That Axe, Eugene, which while a live staple during the early years of their careers was only released in their B-side collection Relics and is therefore highly obscure to modern fans. Eventually, Octavarium breaks into the full symphony backing up the band, with some breathtaking solos before the final part, which starts off with a soft riff and spoken verse and builds to thunderous proportions. Octavarium has its flaws, but the overall experience is highly satisfying. <br /> <br />Octavarium has two tracks which, while not my favorites, I can appreciate. The Answer Lies Within is a short ballad track. While not a bad song by any means, I've never been a big fan of their ballad tracks. I Walk Beside You is the song that has generated the most criticism from the fan base, which I think is unfair. While yes, it is very much a commercial song, both stylistically and lyrically, that doesn't make it any worse from a musical standpoint. While Petrucci definitely provides a different style of guitar playing and is much more mellow on this track, all the musicians are still alive and kicking here, and LaBrie puts together one of his best vocal performances in recent works. Dream Theater is simply broadening their style. Before this album gets drowned in the cries of 'Sellout!', remember that it's only one song. If it does succeed in getting them wider radio play, so much the better, because then Dream Theater will finally get the attention they deserve. <br /> <br />As much as I would like to say that I love every track on this CD, I really cannot get into Never Enough. I'm not sure why, I guess it just seems a little whiny to me. I tend to just skip this song when I listen to this CD. Still, nearly all albums have at least one weak song, and Octavarium's strong tracks more than make up for it in this regard. <br /> <br />In short, Octavarium is yet another solid release by Dream Theater. If Amazon permitted half stars, I would give it 4.5, but because it's Dream Theater, which puts it ahead of basically everyone still making music, I'm rounding it up to a 5. <br /> <br />If you're a Dream Theater fan, you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for a place to start getting into this band, I would not suggest this as a place to start. Instead, go for Images and Words and work down their discography from there.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|Guilt. That's what this film is about. Maybe you shoulnd't know that going in but if you've read prior reviews of it, you already know that. The lead character says at one point in what is either a snippet of a waking dream or a psychotic episode, \\"A little guilt goes a long way.\\" And it goes and goes for Trevor Reznick. Plus you get at least 2 Dostoyevsky references. I'm sure other reviews mention it as well so there you have it. Do with it what you may. Reznick does alot.<br /><br />But why is he so messed up. We get little hints that he was a pretty decent guy who got along with coworkers, drove a cool car, and does ok with the ladies. But now his workmates hate him, he drives a crappy pick up, and his woman is a hooker. Figuring out what's up with Trevor Reznick is part of the viewing process as you enter into his world of sleep deprivation and minimal food consumption. Something's not right in the world of a guy, who after a year without sleep, operates heavy machinery for a living. Clearly the guy's got to be a bit on the drowsy side. Every prescription warning label is all about not combining that quality with that activity. But Trevor continues to operate even as his coworkers notice his strange deterioration into a burnt out stick figure.<br /><br />Much is made of Christian Bale's weight loss for this film and it is amazing, creepy, and scary, all at once. He strikes a pose at one point for his heart of gold call girl Stevie, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, that is meant to recall Concentration Camp victims. It fits since clearly this guy is on the Krakow diet plan. Problem is his is a self imposed prison that has him wondering who's out to get him and why. A strange new coworker shows up that no one will acknowledge, pictures and post-its are found where they shouldn't be, the latter with cryptic messages including a game of Hangman hinting at a way out of this nightmare that wont let him go.<br /><br />But the mystery is not so much as to whether he's going nuts as it is to why. Both protagonist and viewer embark on stark and gritty tour of his nightmarish dreamscape to get at just what's eating Trevor Reznick.<br /><br />Trevor himself is doing precious little eating and at least twice in the film someone says to him, \\"if you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.\\" And he doesn't. At least not the Trevor he was at another point at least a year prior. His physical form has begun manifesting the inward dessication that has turned him into someone quite possibly trying to become invisible or so insignificant he can quietly slip the bonds of reality without anyone noticing.<br /><br />It's this point of view that gives Bale's sacrifice meaning. Without it it seems like the same movie could have been made without putting it's lead actor through such dangerous deprivations. If you haven't seen him in this yet, it's pretty startling. You'd never know this is the same guy from American Psycho and Batman Begins. He wasn't required to go to such lengths. The script did call for a skeletal looking guy, but Bale took it to extremes in losing a third of his body weight. Certainly a robust figure would not have worked but I think the idea of him being an insomniac for a year puts us into enough of a clued in mode that something is wrong, he's on edge, and possibly going mad.<br /><br />But this is cinema. The visual representation of all this does come across in a more visceral way when you see what this guy looks like. And when you see him as escaping the bonds of reality both physically and emotionally, you clearly get a better sense when you see the emaciated version.<br /><br />The Machinist has a certain dream like quality that's effecting me more afterwards than it did during my viewing it last night. That's probably purposeful. The film is shot at a languid pace and with a sort of bilious green color pallette. It's like for Reznick, since he cant sleep and dream, life is becoming a paranoid nightmare and is losing its color, becoming very washed out. The look reminded me a bit of the colors used when we're inside The Matrix in that film. There is was meant to convey the green tint of a computer screen, which is not far off from its use here. Inside the Matrix the people playing their roles are really asleep in a sort of nightmare. Reznick is in a waking nightmare and as out of touch with reality as those serving the machines. Things are given an even more dreary look here with a more grey tone mixed in, a tone that presumably matches Reznick's mood.<br /><br />As for the role of machinery in this movie, besides possibly serving the ironic purpose I stated above, maybe all the gears, levers, and gadgets we see moving about and causing two dangerous situations in the movie, are metaphors for those of the brain, which for Trevor are operating under dangerous conditions. The warning about heavy machinery and drugs that induce drowsiness puts me in mind of the usual accompaniment to that warning, which is not to drive. Operating heavy machinery and driving a car both figure into this tale prominently. I won't say how here.<br /><br />But is the journey into Reznick's mind worth taking? As i watched the movie i was on the fence about this. There isn't alot of mystery to solve. Clearly he's losing it and the reasons why became mostly apparent to me before it was revealed in the final minutes. The slow pace is not for everyone, but I like atmosphere in a movie and this movie has a nice blend of old time Hollywood psychological thriller pacing and feel along the Hitchcockian mode and a modern arty element. The intense atmosphere revolving around guilt, murder, and mental instabilty definitely draw something from Crime & Punishment, which is playing on a marquee in the movie. There is another ref to The Idiot as well, which may have more to do with the nature of his relationship with Stevie. The pace is purposeful and part of the storytelling device. That it is staying with me is a testement to Director Brad Anderson's attempt to create a dreamlike landscape and a haunted character study. Though there is no happy Hollywood ending there is a note of quiet redemption and victory. I could have used a bit more meat to the plot, but irregardless any movie that manages to get under the skin and stick around for a bit is a worthwhile see and gets my approval.
B00005JNX0|5.0|the new movie madagascrar has cridicts looking at it from a whole new angle. it is truely a magnificent explanation of what animals actually feel like being kooped up in a zoo, having that complete urge to be in the wild and experienceing life. i think that it is a metaphore for the human race, being pressured to be in a place and follwo beliefs that you dont trust. <br /> <br />i stats off with a thrill seeking zebra wanting to be released into the wild. the zebra, played by Chris Rock, is a character of adventure an bewilderment and has the need to be let loose. however his best frien alex the lion, played by Ben Stiller, dissagrees, he feels that living in the zoo is wonderful, and that even thinking of going to the wild is terrible. the character of alex the lion, is a very egocentric type, he hold respect for his friends but is at the same time, quite narrow minded.  <br /> <br />when the zebra leaves the zoo, his friend alex and two other friend go to help him. these friends are a hippo played by Jada Pinket Smith and a giraffe played by David Schiwmer.  <br /> <br />as the story reaches its climax, alex the lion, marti, the zebra, marvi the giraffe and the hippo, are released on to the island of madagascar. where they learn what it is like to be wild and free, and put there friendship to the ultimate test.  <br /> <br />the graphics of the movie is astounding and runs smoothly. this movie is garrentted to keep you in stiches, so if your looking for something that will make you laugh, or something to enjoy with the family, madagascar is the perfect one

B000002UJQ|5.0|If you don't like \\"OK Computer\\", that simply means that ... erm, well, you don't like it! There's nothing to explain. If you want your spine to tingle, your hair to stand on end, and maybe the odd tear, then you'll love this. <br /> <br />Some people get it, some don't - it's as simple as that. If you do, this is a musical landmark that will just keep growing on you the more you listen to it.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|I have been a Jamiroquai fan for quite some time and feel that this is one of their best albums to date and well worth the 4 yr. wait.  I didn't hate \\"A Funk Odyssey\\" like some on here do but did feel it was one of their weakest albums (overall).  If you agree with me on that then don't worry, this album more than makes up for that album's weak spots.  Buy this, listen and enjoy!!!
B0009YA386|4.0|The Editors and Interpol are the musical equivalent of Armageddon and Deep Impact. Except, unlike the movies, these bands don't suck. I'd say The Editors rock out a touch more than Interpol but the two bands really sound amazingly similar. I was slightly disappointed with Antics and this album definitely holds its own against Turn On The Bright Lights. They've got the goods and I hope the album gets released domestically because there's an audience for the Joy Division/4AD/whaterver you want to call it sound over here as well.

B000099T2L|5.0|The rest of the songs on her cd are very much more mature and BETTER than the singles she put out. Theres not much to say about the album, its one of the best out there.

B000055Y12|3.0|Director Alfred Hitchcock's uneven adaptation of Leon Uris' \\"Topaz\\"  does not rank among his finest efforts. However, the 1969 espionage thriller is not without merit. There are classic Hitchcockian touches scattered amidst a rather overlong story, particularly his imaginative use of sound during the New York segments. Though lacking in star power, the international cast (particularly John Forsythe, Frederick Stafford, Roscoe Lee Browne, John Vernon and Karin Dor) is better than expected.  Unfortunately, the film suffers from several lengthy dialogue sequences that bog down the globe-trotting narrative. \\"Topaz\\" cries out for more action - and less talk - from the Master of Suspense.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I admit that before watching this movie I thought it would be a boring documentary with no real point but to bore on about useless information and facts with no real emotion or humour, rather robotic to be honest however this movie came across as funny and rather frightening. We all know Michael Moore as the big guy from \\"Bowling For Columbine\\", yet on this movie with all the controversy surrounding it he affirms himself as a wonderful director and comedian. Now you may have thought he had no real connection to 9/11, however one of his colleagues was killed in the WTC disaster. All the more reason to bash Bush and create one of the more revealing and controversial movies of 2004.<br /><br />This movie exposes some shocking truths about the Bush administration and how they reacted to 9/11. It leaves some questions for the viewers to answer themselves though it answers lots of questions many Americans were just too afraid to ask.<br /><br />Did President Bush really win the 2000 election?<br /><br />-That is really one of the points that you have to decide for yourself, however you are given lots of evidence. Fox may have actually decided the fate of that election. All the other news organisations apart from Fox called Florida in favour of Al Gore thus supposedly handing him the presidency, however when Fox called Florida in the favour of Bush the other channels followed suit and Bush won the elction, however the person that called Florida in favour of Bush was actually his first cousin.<br /><br />Michael Moore's profile of a woman from his home-town was simply breathtaking. Lila Lipscomb from Flint, Michigan is profiled in the film because her son is in Iraq fighting. Then she finds out that her son has died and she goes to Washington and to the outside of the White House. Her portrayal is amazing.<br /><br />This movie has made me wonder how on earth he won a second term in office and makes me come to respect life even more. After watching this movie you will be hopefully the wiser and not vote to keep him in office if he run for a third term or more!will be hopefully the wiser and not vote to keep him in office if he run for a third term or more! <br /> <br />
0151008787|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. Since there where such good recommendations I hoped for a book that would grip my attention. But after 70 or so pages I could not continue, I found it desperately BORING. Just some endless summation of names and streets. May be some friend of mine will be happy with this present. <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|... it keeps going and going. Donnie Darko is one of those films that, even with a re-release, never really got out of its cult status because most people are too afraid to think. I'll get more on that later.<br /><br />The main character in the movie, Donnie, is obviously borderline schizo. Or so it seems. But I won't spoil anything for you. Basically, he sees a vision of an oversized bunny which prophesizes that the world will end in a little under a month. Donnie gets to experience everything he's ever wanted to do during this time and still has some left to save the world.<br /><br />As simple as that synopsis may sound, it can't do the film justice. There are plenty, and I mean PLENTY, of subplots that are pretty interesting. The characters are also worth a look because, although not every one of them experiences growth, the majority of them who do grows in an odd yet interesting way.<br /><br />The direction and cinematography are pretty good, even if they do hint at past movies like E.T. and Silence of the Lambs. The effects are excellent for an independent film, and the simplistic, ambient score matches nicely with the movie's atmosphere.<br /><br />The plot might be the determining factor whether this film appeals to you or not. As you may have heard, the whole film, beginning, middle, and ending, are open to discussion. Although Kelly did a good job of handing us the appetizer and main course of the meal, the bastard kept the dessert. But I think this helps with the longevity of the movie; it's easily one that begs to be talked about, scrutinized, and criticized.<br /><br />Another determing factor might be its subtle preaching. One might not catch on to it early on but as the film progresses, it becomes more evident. Sometimes I think that the movie tries to address too many things at once, resulting in a, if you will, mental overload. But again, this can be cured with repeat viewings.<br /><br />I hope Kelly didn't run out of ideas after this film. I truly believe that this movie is his welcome call to the artform, both scriptwise and direction-wise. This work is among my all-time favorites not because of what it is but what it tries to be, and that beats the many offerings Hollywood has given us recently, which never tries to be anything even though they can be something.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: Director's Cut (Rating = 4 stars, since I can't place two reviews here.)<br /><br />I've recently watched the two versions back to back and decided to compare the two.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The addition of a few pages of The Philosophy of Time Travel into the movie makes the plot easier to comprehend for first-time viewers.<br />- Almost all of the deleted scenes are placed back into the movie. As a result, it feels more complete and in some instances, adds more poignancy to the film, the best of which shows Donnie's relationship with the rest of his family.<br />- Some of the special and sound effects have been revamped, all for the better.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- For someone who has seen the original version and have discussed it at length with others, the Director's Cut almost feels like it dumbs down the complexity of the former. I for one recommend seeing the first before the Cut. Formulate and research your theory first before Kelly does it for you =)<br />- I have a big, if not HUGE, problem with the changes in music. Echo & the Bunnymen's \\"The Killing Moon\\" is replace by INXS' \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" during the beginning of the movie. While the latter is a good song itself, \\"The Killing Moon\\" was such an integral part of original version. It's instead relocated to a another scene where one needs to listen carefully in order to hear it. Some of the score have also been altered or moved around.<br /><br />It's an all-around nice version of the film though. There are a few good things added or changed, but there are also bad. This altered version doesn't take away the major aspects that made the original version/story/whatever good though. Again, here's to hoping that Kelly will eventually squeeze more genre-bending, mind-blowing, odd spectacles in his career.d-blowing, odd spectacles in his career.
B000002HMH|3.0|If you're new to Metallica you might wonder why the bad reviews abound. The cause is simple: this is a sell-out of a band who once made genre defining, exploring music that was never boring. This is not a bad album by any means, but Metallica don't even try to reach the quality standards set with their previous albums.    The Black Album, which heralded the turn of Metallica towards mainstream was a compromise between commercialism and good thrash metal, but Load doesn't even try. Metallica before Load produced no fillers. I understand that albums nowadays contain fillers and are still regarded good, but this is not the case with Metallica. They simply couldn't have allowed themselves to produce fillers. I don't know what the cause might be, but such a turn cannot either be expected or accepted. And I must admit I tried everything I could to like this album but I never managed to achieve my goal. This is a mediocre album which has its few highs but there are so many dull moments that some tracks need to be skipped.    So this is the very beginning of the smouldering decay that Metallica very cleverly sung on And Justice For All's Blackened. Sad but true.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death is a good follower of the PERFECT album Brave New World, but it's worse than the previous album. Most songs are ok, but there are songs, like Wildest Dreams and Gates of Tomorrow, which are not as good as they supposed to be. The other songs are really good, and deserve a place in the collection of Iron Maiden fans. The guitar-solo's in the songs are even better than the songs on Brave New World and the lyrics are outstanding. But when you're looking for better tunes and vocals, Brave New World is better. Overall, I think this is a good album and worth the money, but if you want the best of Iron Maiden, you should buy Brave New World...
B000001FDQ|5.0|Look, this album isn't for everyone. Probably 90% of the people who own this album play electric guitar (myself included). It caters to a very specific market, and if you aren't impressed by viruosity, and need a catchy chorus to hook onto, look elsewhere. But as far as instrumental, progressive, \\"guitar-nerd\\" albums go, this is one of the very best. <br />I guess what make this album so magical is the abilty to paint a picture with the music. It's basically heavy metal guitar, with the obvious classical influence, but there is a lot of subtlety and color as well. Take the song \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\". The title alone changes the whole atmosphere of the piece, recalling a distant place and time, hidden deep in our collective unconsciousness, unlocked and made real by Yngwie's transcendant playing. Throughout the record tympani, harpsichord, pipe organ, electric keyboards, and acoustic guitar are used to great effect to color the basic mood created by the heavy guitar/bass/drum combination. And the solos are the lynch pins- at once both mesmerizing and stimulating-convincing you that, if someone can play like this, anything is possible; the epic battles and myths that this music conjures seem all the more real, all the more vivid, all the more tangible. There's definately a sword-and-sorcerers vibe here, emphasized by the classical bent, and this will either turn you off or suck you in. <br />Another reason this album works is that it has all the elements of any classic record- it isn't too long, it has a very good ebb and flow to it, and it keeps moving. It knows what it wants to say, says it, and ends.What I consider the finale of the album is the breakdown in the second to last song, \\"Little Savage\\". The marauding main riff gives way to a beautiful melodic, lyrical solo, as expressive and soulful as any in rock; this in turn leads to a stunning Bach-like harpsicord motif that just breaks my heart every time I hear it.  The last song is a short classical guitar pieceentitled \\"Farewell\\". It is a reprise of the same theme used at the beginning of the album, but a little gloomier, a little sadder, with a wistful quality that recalls the same mood as the last scene of an epic movie, or the last chapter of a great book. It's sad that it is over, but it will be ready and waiting for the next adventure. <br />I like this album if you can tell. I'm not big into the shred-fest neo-classical pretentious 80's thing- I'll take Page and Clapton , thank you- but this album is special. I think Yngwie peaked on this one, I don't own any of his others albums, and don't see the need to. He said it all perfectly on this one. I've owned a copy of this record since the '80's, and as my tastes grow and evolve, I still come back to it every few months, sometimes years, throw it it, and drift away.
B00006879E|2.0|Maroon 5 are just a hopeless band that are trying to create music that 'sounds' like Stevie Wonder's. That is how desperate they are, I mean you can't re-create music as innovative and as unique as that. Also it sounds nothing like it, their 'infusion' of RnB and Rock just doesn't work at all and is disasterous at most. Their one 'average' song would be \\"This Love\\" and I feel generous giving this album 2 stars and calling that song average.
0679411585|5.0|People alot more educated and articulate than I have covered the points of why this book is as good as it is. I only want to add two points. <br />     If you are a Soldier, Sailor, Airman or Marine, you MUST read this book. Weither your job is to close with and destroy the enemy or repairing mess kits, you will learn more about leading troops than any leadership FM Ive ever seen. If youre Combat Arms, you will learn that even when everything goes wrong, you can still not only hold the line, you can win. You will see things that you can apply in training your own troops. You realize that the harder you train on the basics(even on the seemingly unimportant things), it all comes together when the poop hits the propeller and your men go on \\"auto-pilot\\". Even if youve \\"been there, done that\\" there are lessons to learn. Always remember, if you stop learning, the enemy just beat you. I went through 2 highlighters on my copy. <br />     The other thing is that I saw an Ia Drang vet, CPT. Nadal, CMDR A/1/7, wrote a review here. What I wanted to add is thank you, CPT. Nadal. You and every trooper at X-Ray, Albany, Columbus and everyone in support elsewhere in this Op (and their families) showed us what CAN be done, regardless of the odds. You, and ALL of your brother and sister vets, set the standard for the rest of us to follow. This was just one battle in the war. There were 1,000s of others that only those who were there will ever know about. Each one proved that teamwork, training, audacity, knowledge, bravery, comradery and faith can carry the day. We can only hope we, as the next generation of warriors, lived up to the example that you and the rest set.  God bless you and yours.
B000002UAR|5.0|.... who didn't buy this album.  There's not many of them left in the world, but if you're one of them, you absolutely should be purchasing this record right now.  This album was released decades ago and it still is pretty high up there on the sales rank.  That ought to tell you something about the timelessness of this album.  Every song is brilliant, but you should expect no less from a Beatles album.  There is no reason why you should still be a lonely person without a Revolver album; you've got to get it into your life today!
0451199871|4.0|When the body of a young blonde woman is found in the library at Gossington Hall, the home's owners, Colonel and Mrs. Bantry are mystified.  They have never seen the girl in their life; how could she have wound up murdered in their house?  Mrs. Bantry calls in her good friend Miss Marple to search out the truth that several detectives cannot find, and bring the murderer to justice before he kills again.<br /><br />Miss Marple is just as puzzled as the Bantrys as to why the blonde was found in their house.  The victim, Ruby Keene, was a dancer at the local hotel and had fallen into the affection of a hotel visitor, the wealthy and crippled Conway Jefferson.  His son-in-law and daughter-in-law definitely had means to murder Ruby, but their alibis are solid.  And the other suspicious characters without alibis, have no motives for the killing.  Miss Marple has her work cut out for her, but as usual, she rises to the challenge and surpasses the efforts of the local constable and a retired Scotland Yard detective.<br /><br />\\"The Body in the Library\\" is a quick-paced, witty mystery.  Agatha Christie uses several cliches in wonderful and clever plot twists as the mystery surrounding the murder begins to unravel.  The ending seems a little rushed, and there are often too many detectives looking into the case, which is perhaps why Miss Marple outwits them all.

B000667FN8|1.0|The title says it all really, Simple Plan are trying to be the next Good Charlotte and are trying to garner critical acclaim along the way, of course they aren't going to get anywhere with music like this. Their singles are really unoriginal and the choruses are just pathetic. They sound exactly like Good Charlotte which is a bad thing. They think they are 'punk' and pretend their music is that genre. Well if you know punk, punk was basically started underground and in clubs during the 70's-80's and Simple Plan trying to replicate that era just doesn't work. Their music is more commercial pop-rock.<br /><br />They still ain't getting anything, and still ain't getting anywhere. Avoid this album at all costs, please I beg you!

0316172324|2.0|The two stars are for the interesting subject matter of the book only...the 'adaptive unconscious'.  Unfortunately the author is not a subject matter expert.  He relates a handful of anecdotes he's obtained from others and tells them over and over throughout the book.  This book was in desperate need of another editor.  The author should stick to shorter format periodical writing.  You won't get anything more out the book than what you can find in the reviews below.  Save yourself the money and look for another read.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Easily the best of the Coen brothers flicks.  I can see why AMC rated this number three in greatest gangster movies of all time.  Number one: Goodfellas. Number two: The Godfather.  With company like this, why would you hesitate to watch it?  Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, the entire cast brought a realism to their characters that is rare.  The settings were so perfect and everything played off each other so well, you actually felt like you were there.  Easily number two in my all time top 5 movies. (Behind Chasing Amy and before Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)!!!  Kudos to the Coen's!!!!
B000ASSDVA|3.0|There are no Spanish subtitles and no Spanish audio track, as though it did not occur to the producers that some Spanish-speaking people might be interested in seeing this movie about Spain's national hero.
B00005KHJR|5.0|There is an unusual quality about this film. It is a film that almost defiantly refuses to be pegged into any one genre and yet it welcomes viewers who would enjoy films of almost any genre. You can enjoy the police drama, the historical elements, the tests of religious beliefs, the music, the folk lore, and so on and so on. I don't know why The Wicker Man makes me uneasy. There's nothing to be afraid of but as you dig along with the clever copper you start to realize that something very unhealthy is unraveling here. The Wicker Man is not only overlooked, it is practically shunned by so many. Don't be put off by it's unusual appearances, take a look and be taken in. <br /> <br />This special dvd set is exceptional.  Great wooden packaging and lots of extras.  A treat for the eyes and ears and brain.
0060839872|5.0|This is one of the great books of our time, but it is a fairly difficult read. If that doesn't concern you, there is no reason to continue reading the reviews. Just buy it. <br /> <br />WARNING: If you do continue reading the reviews, do not read the one entitled \\"Spaghetti thoughts put into words.\\" He gives away a pretty significant part of the ending. You will enjoy it more if you don't know what's coming.

B000003TAW|5.0|There are certain albums that just make you go, Man, I wish I had a highway and a bunch of friends in the backseat right now.  <br />Fortunately for me, this is usually the case when I'm listening to The Blue Album. If your friends don't know these songs, make them learn them so you too can all drive around singing at the top of your lungs, too. <br />Anyways, The Blue Album is fantastic - their second best (after Pinkerton, of course). My favorite tracks are \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" (the sing-along capactity is unlimited), \\"Say It Ain't So\\" (the words are snarky and very clever, and it has a tune that you won't mind getting stuck in your head), and \\"Only In Dreams\\" (eight minutes of Weezer showing off their musical skills with some great lyrics at the beginning and end). <br />Just remember, you aren't a true Weezer fan unless you have this album.

0783240287|5.0|This was a delightful production of a stage show. The songs are addictive and the story is well told.  My only concern was the costuming for the Potipher's wife scene.  Altho the actresses were fully clothed, the detailing on the fabric was very graphic.  I realize it was meant to represent the sexual nature of the storyline but for some families viewing this with children, they might find it inappropriate. <br /> <br />But overall, it was thoroughly enjoyable and  touching.  Great music, great lyrics, great fun!
B00005JODA|3.0|\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a \\"supense-thriller\\" where the main plot involves a British diplomat named Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes, seeking out who is to blame for the murder of his liberal activist wife, Tessa, played by Rachel Weisz  <br /> <br />First I am going to focus on what is good about \\"The Constant Gardener.\\" For starters, the director is Fernando Meirelles who made the outstanding \\"City of God,\\" a much superior film about life in a crime stricken neighborhood in Brazil. While I much prefer this earlier film, Merielles still manages to present an authentic portrait of life in Africa with its stunning beauty -both human and natural. But he shows it to be also a land haunted by disease, poverty and corruption. The movie bravely tackles the weighty political topic of corporate greed and maliciousness, in this case a multinational pharmaceutical giant named KDT. The bottom line is that life is cheap in plague ridden Africa, especially when death is being bought by a big money corporation with millions in profits at stake.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie fails in other areas. I especially found the relationship between Justin and Tessa to be poorly developed. They enjoy a quick sex romp after meeting at one of Justin's lectures in England. Shortly thereafter, she manages to tag along with him back to Africa where he serves his diplomatic post in Kenya. They are married, apparently in quick order, though the movie never really depicts their courtship. Instead the movie opens up the question of whether Tessa is an unfaithful wife only using Justin because of his access to power. Meanwhile, his love for her is never fully explained, beyond his own loneliness and lust. Hardly the foundation for a devoted, caring relationship.  <br /> <br />After her murder, Justin goes on a desperate and dangerous rampage to track down who killed her. In this respect, the \\"suspense-thriller\\" aspect of the movie is lacking, as it is clear she was killed for her political actions and the culprit turns out to be the most obvious suspect. Not enough \\"twists and turns\\" for a movie counting on mystery to provide the desired dramatic effect. Also since the basis for Justin's \\"love\\" for Tessa is founded on questionable grounds it just doesn't ring true to life when he turns from a passive British diplomat into a sort of heroic warrior willing to take drastic actions and make ultimate sacrifices to discover \\"The Truth\\". It would help if Tessa was a more likable character. Instead she is a rich, young idealist who is on a mission to \\"save\\" Africa without regard to who she has to lie to, steal from or manipulate along the way. She is shown to be reckless and self-righteous rather than thoughtful and consistent in her actions. At one pont, she even admits to Justin that she is an activist because it is what gives her life a sense of purpose and without it she is a \\"nobody\\". Certainly honest on her part. But it doesn't help to emotionally endear her to the audience.  <br /> <br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a decent movie, in some aspects. But I find it highly suspect that so many critics have jumped on its bandwagon as being \\"Oscar worthy\\" and of the highest caliber. I think this is probably because so much mindless junk comes out of Hollywood that when a movie that is serious and with good intentions finally shows up the critics are willing to fall all over themselves to exaggerate its praise. Meanwhile, countless smaller, but better, indie films come out that are hardly given notice. Personally, I much preferred the charming and inspiring documentary, \\"Mad, Hot Ballroom,\\" about Latino kids from inner city New York schools learning how to ballroom dance. Also highly recommended is the overlooked \\"Saving Face, a funny and intelligent movie about a young Chinese-American woman coming to terms with her lesbianism. \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is worth seeing. But there are also much better films out there that are being largely ignored.
1573223026|4.0|I quite liked this book. The characters were all unique in his or her own way, and along with the storytelling it gave the book an interesting feel. Not only did we get to know what one character thought, but we got to know what they all thought. This is much different from the typical main character only point of view. Certainly not a memorable book, but a good one none-the-less.
B00005JMAH|2.0|It may come as a sad surprise HP fans, but not everyone has read the Harry Potter books. And, believe me, you HAVE to have read the book for this movie to make any kind of sense. For that alone, I'd give HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban three stars.  <br /> <br />Some HP fans are raving about how this movie is 'darker'. I beg to differ. This movie is TRYING to be darker. The dementors scared my little brother, but they were really rather silly. They fluttered around and froze things. The scenes they were in got even weirder and more detached from reality.  <br /> <br />My father, who has not read the books, couldn't connect with any of the characters, and didn't even want to. No one in the movie was very likable, and it was hard to be sympathetic to Harry, who was extremely one-dimensional. I felt sorry for Lupin, but that was only because I read the books, and I don't think they got the right actor to play him (though David Thewlis did fairly well with the material he'd been given).   <br /> <br />Snape was only in the movie for about ten minutes. Most people would agree that Snape is one of Rowling's most interesting characters, and Alan Rickman is a wonderful actor, so this was very disappointing. <br /> <br />The director clearly assumed that the audience would know what was going on, so he was very lazy about setting scenes, introducing characters, and explaining things. Even if everyone in the audience had memorized the book (and not all of them have), he should have been less lackadaisical about providing a decent setup.   <br /> <br />Ron couldn't be in a scene without saying b***** h*** at least once. This apparently counts as 'mild language'. <br /> <br />Some scenes made no logical sense. Why, for example, do Snape and Dumbledore discuss important matters while walking through a dorm room filled with (supposedly) sleeping children? This seemed like a really pathetic way to provide vital clues for the hero. The director might have tried to make it a bit moreplausible.  <br /> <br />Some scenes were so stylistically arranged that I was certain they were dream sequences - but they weren't. <br /> <br />Some scenes were meant to be funny, but weren't. Some scenes weren't meant to be funny... but were.  <br /> <br />I'm giving this movie two stars, because it was not a 'good' movie. Good movies have characters the audience can connect with, plots that are new, engaging, and unconfusing, and, most importantly, have a point.  <br /> <br />This movie had none of the above. Instead it had a limp little conclusion that should have come at least a half hour earlier. It wasn't a good movie.      <br /> <br />I'll leave it to others to decide if it was a good portrayal of the Harry Potter books...

Both were throughly entertaining and prompted my purchase of the DVD. <br /> <br />I likely classify myself as a senior citizen by admitting to liking this musical so much.  Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are very good as Henry Higgins and Elisa Doolittle.  However it's Elisa's ne'er do well father that steals the show.  This musical dates back to the time when it was common to include more than one memorable song.

Midnight is undoubtedly one of the most dynamic vocalists anyone of any genre will ever hear. And after you buy these two classics , go and buy Midnight's new solo album , \\"Sadaka\\", his first published work in over a decade. I'm sure eager to see what all those years in exile has done for his writing abilities , I'll bet his words will better fit his awesome voice now.

B000059HCI|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is a stark, graphic and troubling depiction of the horrific fall into the abyss of drug addiction by four people.  Set against the panoramic background of Brooklyn's Coney Island using some amazing cinematography courtesy of Matthew Libatique, the story surrounds a trio of young drug addled adults played respectively by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly.  Leto playing Harry Goldfarb and Wayans playing Tyrone Love are low level drug dealers hoping to make that one big score.  Connelly is Leto's middle class girlfriend who has aspirations of becoming a fashion designer.  They find their dreams however slowly dissolving as their heroin habits increase and their existence becomes seamier and seamier.<br /><br />The unquestioned star of the film was Ellen Burstyn stupendously effectively portraying widowed housewife Sara Goldfarb.  Burstyn spends her days enthralled with an inspirational game show.  She receives a phone call informing her that she's been selected to appear as a contestant.  As a result she convinces herself to lose weight to improve her appearance.  Unable to diet she resorts to visiting a diet doctor.  Amazingly Burstyn gets hooked on diet pills and undergoes an astounding transformation with the help of a talented make up artist.  Her fantasy of appearing on TV gets replaced by drug induced hallucinations culminating in institutionalization.<br /><br />This is not a pretty movie but is very effective in elaborating how drugs destroy the hopes and dreams of the main characters.  The musical score and the special effects chronicling the ingestion of the pills and heroin were an excellent augmentation to the storyline.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Great archival footage... Revisionary Dylan myth themes    Ramblin' Jack Eliot - a major Dylan influence - is omitted.    The BEATLES 1964 takeover of the US music scene isn't mentioned once.  Dylan doesn't acknowlege that their emergence spurred his morphing from full-on folkie to folk rocker in 1965.     And someone else mentioned that they left out the part of Dylan's acceptance speech after JFK died - the part where Bob says he identified in a strange way with Oswald.  They cut that out of Bob's history - probably anyone would want to forget saying that.    THe recording of BLonde on Blonde isn't even mentioned - even thought that's the last album he would make before his cycle accident.    Otherwise - NDH has great old footage of Bob - especially the '66 footage, but also the full-length songs in the extras section of disc 2.    In some ways the documentary isn't long enough; the Dylan story covered in this doc. needs 6 hours to really do the job.  I appreciate the effort, though, but not the revisionary stuff on the part of the producers.
B000AADYYO|4.0|Opeth's newest release is a very good interpretation of what this band is.  Im actually glad that the band has picked up a keys player (I mean its no like it doesnt fit, its not Dream Theater keys playing so whats the harm). The heavier stuff on this album is really the good stuff. I didnt quite know what do make of Damnation (although very good), it just got boring. Opeth is starting to get boring and i hate to say it. They are incrediable song writers and i think it would be very great if they would release an album that gave us about 5 minutes of metal madness with some structure and solos and a chours lol.  I love Opeth but i definatly need to see a change or else im going to lose interest like so many others that already have.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Bad Clone of star trek II: the wrath of kahn, but lacks the nicholas meyer/ harve bennet panache.  At least this new release will include all of the deleted scenes, or will it? will have to wait and see. the previous single disc release was a disgrace, very little special features or deleted scenes which can be found in the novelization.  This movie and the cancellation of enterprise (which was a very good sci fi series, probalbly the best since next gen) looks like the final nail in the coffin of the star trek franchise, how can it ever recover?  It's funny to think that the best trek in recent years have been the garfield-stevens/shatner outings in book form.
0446677450|5.0|ENOUGH.    Enough with the Robert Kiyosaki bashing.  It's time to set things straight once and for all: THIS BOOK IS AMAZING.      My name is Monroe Mann.  I am the author of a number of critically-acclaimed books, the owner of two successful businesses, and a budding stock market and real estate investor.  I'm also right now in Iraq, training the 4th Iraqi Army.  I can say with authority that this man is completely on target.    True, Robert does not tell you specifically how to start and run a business, does not show you step-by-step how to get into real estate, and does not guide you through the ups and downs of the stock market... but that is frankly irrelevent if you don't actually DO SOMETHING WITH THE INFORMATION.  Most how-to books talk about how to do something, but most readers just sit on their couch and do nothing with the information because they are looking for the quick fix.  They talk talk talk when they need to do do do.      Without the right attitude, though, it is impossible for people to do do do.  Robert realizes this.  He realizes that first and foremost, he needs to change the mentality of the reader--the sick and poverty focused middle-class mentality of nine out of ten people you meet walking down the street.  Without the right attitude, no progress can or will ever be made on the road to riches.      So, what Rich Dad Poor Dad DOES do (which is infinitely more important than showing you how to become rich) is infuse within your psyche and soul the mentality of a billionaire, the mentality of someone absolutely determined to become rich, and who is GOING to become rich--no matter what it takes.  A lot of people don't like the book for this very reason.  It forces them to take responsibility for their poverty and middle-class incomes.  It forces readers to admit that THEY are the cause of their mediocre lives.  I have even spoken with people who make claim that Robert's 'Rich Dad' doesn't exist, and is just a marketing tool, and as a result,don't buy the book.  HELLO!  Are these people for real?  Who cares if his 'rich dad' is real?  Who cares if the entire story is just a metaphor through which to teach some of the most life-changing financial lessons of our time?  The principles are sound... so roll with it.  Moreover, if it turns out that this 'rich dad' IS just a metaphor, then kudos to Robert Kiyosaki for his breathtaking creative marketing prowess.    After you read this book, it is abundantly clear that becoming rich is not a quick and easy snap of the fingers, but that with the right game plan, it is not only possible, but highly probable.  He teaches that the only three sure-fire ways to wealth are as follows:    a) Owning Your Own Business  b) Investing in Real Estate  c) Investing in the Stock Market    It's a sad reality, but reality nonetheless, that few people in this world are actually looking for the true road to wealth.  Far too many Rich Dad readers are looking for that get-rich-quick scheme--WHICH REGRETTABLY DOES NOT EXIST.  I am telling you: THIS BOOK WILL PUT YOU ON THAT TRUE ROAD TO WEALTH!  It's not a straight road; it's not a wide road; it's not an easy road.  But it is THE road, and I am beginning to realize that only the lazy criticize this book.  'Cause how hard is it to pick up another book and delve deeper into the subject?  Why are you wasting time criticising this book when you could be out there starting a business, investing in real estate, and developing your portfolio?  Why?  I'll tell you: BECAUSE IT IS EASIER FOR CRITICS TO BASH THIS BOOK THAN IT IS TO TAKE THEIR LIVES INTO THEIR OWN HANDS, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS, AND BECOME RICH THROUGH THEIR OWN BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS.    Buy this book right now.  As long as you're not a lazy person (and you're not, right?), you will benefit from the lessons Robert Kiyosaki has to impart.    A) I recommend this book wholeheartedly, but you won't truly benefit from it unless you read Cashflow Quadrant immediately following.  That is the second book in the Rich Dad series.      B) Also read 'The Richest Man in Babylon', as well as 'Unlimited Streams of Income'---both available here at Amazon.    C) If you want to invest in real estate, the finest books I have ever read can be found at [...].  Buy his 'NO MONEY DOWN' real-estate program.  If you're looking for a step-by-step program, complete with all of the contracts and forms you need to make it a reality, you need look no further.

B0000AUHPK|5.0|Too few classics have been made into movies that value the author's plotline and characterizations.  This movie exalts and personifies Bronte's book with stirring, wild intensity.  From the dark wildness of the moor to the brutish, brooding character of Heathcliff to the wild, unpredictable Cathy, this movie captures it all.  Heathcliff is brilliantly and memorably portrayed, and Binoche does a surprisingly good job in portrayal of both Cathy and Catherine.  The characters literally walked off the pages of the book into this movie, giving a stirring, vivid performance.  A wonderful movie not to be missed.
B000002KGT|4.0|There seems to be a lot of breaking up of marriages in rock music, from richard and linda thompson to exene and john doe. So it only makes sense that one of the most famous seventies bands stayed in form, with two couples breaking up in one band. The only catch is that they make heartbreak sound like so much fun. Yes this album gets overplayed and probably sounds better to less worn out ears, but rumours still stands on its own merits. rumours is the ultimate california rock album.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the most amazing collection of movies I have ever seen.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|One of the funniest films of the year. <br /> <br />Think early Jackie Chan meets the Matrix. <br /> <br />The classic \\"bad guy\\" makes good scenario is worked to great effect, with state of the art CGI and live action wire work to make an audio visual treat that doesen't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br />The battle scenes are excellent, if over the top in places. This works because both the makers and the audience know it is overboard, that is what makes the film such great fun.  <br /> <br />Most action/scifi fans should have their eyes and ears peeled for some subtle and not so subtle homage to the best films in the field. <br /> <br />Serious martial arts fans may not appreciate it, but it is intended for a wider audience. <br /> <br />I found it a visually stunning treat, the story is plausibly consistent, given the film has already marked its territory as a comedy. <br /> <br />Great fun, lavishly made, get it for the comedy and be amazed by the entire package. <br /> <br />The DVD has plenty of extras, but there is no doubt it is the film that makes the entire event worthwhile.
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation\\". This famous Henry David Thoreau quote is often cited but nowhere is it more apt than in the life of Lester Burnham. The life of dreary feigned cheerfulness that he lives in suburban America bores him to tears, but that is all blown out of his mind by the arrival of the young pretty nymphet Angela Hayes. <br /> <br />With clear parallels to Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita' this movie is as much a feast for the mind as it is a cinematographic feast for the eye. The red rose petals bursting forth so often being a striking representation of the rebirth of Lester's life after so many years in monotonous solitude and also of the budding beauty of youth that Angela makes her own. <br /> <br />What makes 'American Beauty' so encapsulating is the anger that is always on the verge of bursting out of the characters. Lester is stepped on and belittled by his family which fuels a fury that is boiling beneath his calm exterior. Angela is a release for Lester, both from the mind numbing boredom he suffers, and the sexual frustration that his wife forces on him. Make no mistake it is not love or anything like it that pulls him towards her, it is nothing but a combination of boredom and pure animal lust. <br /> <br />'American Beauty' is a remarkable film that has left it's mark on the cinema world and beyond. It's dark depiction of middle class suburbia has spawned a line of similar creations such as 'The Stepford Wives' and T.V. show 'Desperate Housewives'. But no matter how many movies or T.V. shows come in it's wake, it is doubtful that any of them will match the dark, bizzare fascinating nature of this classic.
B00006BTCA|2.0|To me, Interpol is the musical equivalent of an amalgamation of last night's dinner scraps (my mom used to call these things \\"casserole surprise\\") - it looks familiar but doesn't taste nearly as good. <br /> <br />Interpol is best in small doses.  In fact, if I listen to PDA as a single, it's actually an excellent track.  But, if I listen to the entire CD, the songs begin to merge together, and by mid-album, I'm falling asleep.  Lately when I listen to Turn On the Bright Lights, I find I get completely bored at about the time Hands Away comes on, and I end up switching to a different album.  So, admittedly, I am more familiar with the first half of the album.  However, I did listen to the CD all the way through before writing this review (the things I do for Amazon), and I have to say that I haven't been missing much. <br /> <br />If you like Interpol, great, but if you're buying into the Pitchfork hype, then I suggest looking elsewhere.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Once upon a recent time I was watching Sci-Fi, and stumble with Firefly.  And I liked it...  I was a Fan of Josses previous work, so I kept watching.  Couldn't believe that I missed it the first time around when it was on Fox.  Well, I decided that I wanted to see the hole first season without commercials before the Movie came out, and I did ;-) <br /> <br />I enjoyed it very much, like the music and all... <br />Love the way that guys mind work...  Can't wait for the Movie...

B0009S2T0M|5.0|15 years of Imprisonment, 5 days of vengence. Wow. If you like movies, you will LOVE Oldboy. Simply a masterpiece of modern cinema, Park Chanwook has crafted a wonderful story of pain, love, desperation, and most importantly...Vengance. Oldboy is a must-own, for anyone who can stay in one place for 2 hours.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|I was told to check out Pitchfork for all my indie purchases.  I bought this CD and Interpol's Turn On The Bright Lights based on their praise, and I consider both albums to be complete disasters (although, Interpol is, admittedly, less of a disaster than Arcade Fire).    Instead of sounding innovative, Arcade Fire has actually produced a CD that is quite pedestrian.  I actually felt sorry for them during most of this album because it was obvious that they were just trying too hard to be emotive, and it all seemed kind of pathetic to me.    While listening to this album I had the uneasy feeling that they would suddenly say something like \\"look what I can do,\\" followed by a bombardment of screeches and off-key bellows.    To their credit, I will say that some of their songs (like Neighborhood #1) began excellently, but escalated to a climax that was so painful, it was everything I could do not to press the skip button.    In short, Arcade Fire is simply over-hyped.  After these latest Pitchfork debacles, I've decided that I'm better off on my own, and I suggest the same to you.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Despite the appalling circumstances under which \\"Firefly\\" was originally aired, the DVD shows it to be a work of intelligence, thoughtfulness, creativity, and humor, and well worth anyone's time. <br /> <br />All of the actors are excellent, although Nathan Fillion is brilliant as Mal, and the characters are believable, sympathetic, and real.  These are not flawless white-hat heroes; they're not even flawed but superhuman and Automatically On the Side of Good, like Buffy or Angel.  Moral issues are addressed but always in deep shades of grey, and legality and morality are firmly separated.  The crew of \\"Serenity\\" is made of regular people in difficult circumstances, doing what they need to, trying to make a buck, stay alive, maybe get a little ahead, and - above all - keep flying. <br /> <br />The show is violent, sometimes graphically so; frequently emotionally intense; and most of all, side-splittingly funny.  There are deeply satisfying moments, some unanswered questions, and an impressive level of depth and characterization in the brief space Whedon was given to work.  The only downside to watching \\"Firefly\\" is the agonizing disappointment to realizing that it's only fourteen episodes, and over all too soon.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I have seen this movie for the first time maybe 10 years ago, and taped it from TV. After that, the videotape suffered great damage due to the great number of times I saw, and saw it again. When I bought a DVD player, of course this was one of the films I most wanted to buy...but it was extremely difficult to find wherever you looked for it. Until finally! <br /> <br />By now, I know the initial John Houseman's monologue when telling a ghost story to the kids by heart! Actually, I pretty much know the entire sequence of the movie...It's a definite classic. <br /> <br />It's not a gore movie, as most of Carpenter's. It's a suspense movie, it could pass as a Hitchcock! The only scene with some decomposing characters is when a ghost from underwater turns is face under moonlight while trying to hit Adrienne Barbeau on the roof of the lighthouse. You get a glimpse of is face covered with larvae... <br />Otherwise, the mood of the movie is always pretty dark, shadowy, and even the cellebrations being held for the 100th anniversary of Antonio Bay seems too distant, as if suffocated by the fear of that unusual fog. All the scenario, on the coast, is quite melancholic; the wind constantly whispering, the sirens groaning, the night falling slowly over the city, the shadows moving, the dark church amidst the trees, the isolation of the radio station...so great! <br /> <br />And the cornerstones of every great film! Old Mr. Machen telling the ghost story which would become the sinopsis of the all picture, Adrienne Barbeau crying for help in order to release her son from the fog, and later hit by the fog herself, the fog invading all the streets as the survivors seek for refuge in the church...Not to mention the classic living-dead situation, in which the corpse of a fog victim rises and writes down how many more victims it needs... <br /> <br />Of course, there are no spectacular visual effects, there are some screenplay flaws, this is not perfect. But, is there such thing as aperfect movie? \\"Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?\\". <br /> <br />For the lovers of a good, oldfashioned ghost story, this is compulsory in your collection.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|This film cost $130 million to make, but only earned $120 million in worldwide gross plus $10 million for TV rights.  You might think that means it broke even, but in movie math that means it only got half of its money back.  It was released almost two years after it was completed, so the studio knew it had problems.  What are the problems?<br /><br />Well, it isn't a bad movie in the sense that while you are watching it you want to throw something at the screen.  Yes, it has a preposterous underlying idea - that a civil war ironclad from the confederate states, laden with CSA gold, somehow traveled across the ocean and maybe ended up trapped in the Sahara desert.  But so what?  A lot of movies have more preposterous ideas than that and make hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br />All the actors do a good job and play the movie straight.  There is some action, danger, fighting, and even some not too gory dying.  You would expect that with Penelope Cruz there would be some real sensuality, but not in this movie.  She is Dr. Eva Rojas from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) risking life and limb to track down the source of a plague before it becomes an epidemic, so she can worry about love later.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are childhood buddies who have gone through school, the Navy Seals, and life afterwards together.  They work for \\"The Admiral\\" Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy) under whom they served in the Navy.  In their current job they bring up sunken historical artifacts for various countries around the world.  This also gives Dirk occasional time to indulge his speculations about what happened to the Civil War Ironclad with all that gold that no one else believes exists.<br /><br />Fate brings Dirk and Eva together and drives them both north of Niger into Mali for different purposes.  They both end up finding something very different than they expected, all the while Giordino provides the sidekick relief (and is often the most fun and energetic character on the screen).  In the end, well ... you have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />I think the problem is simply one of chemistry and lift.  Dirk and Eva are the love story, but Dirk shows more interest in the gold than in Eva, although he knows which is more important and does his duty.  He does fall for her, but always seems more comfortable with Giordino.  It is a movie worth seeing once, but to be a big blockbuster you need a large portion of the audience to say, \\"Wow!\\" and come back several times.<br /><br />So, rent it, enjoy it as a good family adventure action film.  It is fun, just don't expect to be knocked off your feet.k relief (and is often the most fun and energetic character on the screen).

6304698690|5.0|This movie is visually stunning and the children are remarkably agile actors. I loved the book as a child and have seen various versions of the story including one for stage. This one is by far the best. All the same I recommend that you read your kids the book before showing them the movie.
B000AA305M|1.0|Buyer beware. This copy-protected CD won't play in my old CD/DVD player.  I am puzzled by the copy protection.  This seems like a CD that would appeal to an older audience, not likely to be ripped and shared with a bunch of teenagers or college kids.

0140177396|5.0|At first when I started reading the first two pages..I thought the rest of the book would be a horrid bore. Boy, was I wrong..the characterization in this book is incredible...you can set a vivid image in your mind of the Salinas Valley. <br /> <br />The story touched me so..and even made me cry..the reference of what happened to Lennie.a brawny character with an \\"imagination of a 10-year-old\\" and his misdoings lead to his terrible demise. <br /> <br />I referred to the scene back when Carlson shot Candy's \\"ancient\\" dog..George led the doings..beacuse Lennie was just hurting himself every step he took..and he rather have himself do the deed rather than a \\"stranger\\" as in Curly. It was only for the best and likely.  <br /> <br />I chose this book and \\"East of Eden\\" for my book report..I am 12 years of age..and in 7th grade. I would recommend this book to anyone, I'm just mad at myself for not reading this fantasic classic earlier.

B00005JXY3|4.0|This movie could have been a really bad idea, but it's not bad at all.  Not great, but worthy enough of the previous film.  The story actually focuses more on Miyagi than Daniel.  The beginning gives us a nice cameo from the evil John Kreese, but soon Daniel and Miyagi are in Okinawa because Miyagi's father is dying.  Miyagi's old buddy, Sato, has been harboring a hatred for Miyagi for over 40 years coz Miyagi stole his chick and made him look like a schmuck in public.  Most of the movie has Sato trying to force Miyagi into having a death match with him to regain his honor.  In doing this, he does things that make him look even more and more dishonorable.  He destroyes Miyagi's family dojo, destroyes his garden and threatens to even destroy the village!  Daniel's not off the hook either.  He gets harassed by a whole new group of bullies in Okinawa.  The leader is Sato's nephew who's played by the guy from Better Off Dead that tries to get John Cusack to race and talks like Howard Cosell.  Daniel also falls in love.  Apparently Elizabeth Shue couldn't be lured back, so she was written out via falling in love with another guy.  Daniel now says the word \\"karate\\" with an annoying accent, he slices through six slabs of ice, punches a guy in the crotch and rescues a girl during a storm.  My only complaint, and I'm sure most agree with this, is in the final fight scene.  That whole deal with the drums and Daniel swinging his arms back and forth.  Isn't that a little lame?  Like you wouldn't be able to dodge that.  Of course in reality Daniel would certainly have lost that death match, but that wouldn't be a very good way to end the film.  Plus, we wouldn't have had that cinematic masterpiece, Karate Kid 3 now, would we?
0767817664|3.0|My kids found this movie amusing and, reading the reviews here, I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thought this was not a very good vampire flick. I liked the story line but the acting in some cases (Stephen Geoffreys and Chris Sarandon) was quite shoddy. I loved the \\"seduction\\" music and was a bit ticked when I bought the tape and found it a vocal instead of the sexy sound I heard in the movie.<br /><br />William Ragsdale was quite good as Charlie, all hormones and teenage lust, and still fairly normal in spite of his dingbat mother. Amanda Bearse is sweet. I liked her maturing transformation on the dance floor. In fact, this is Sarandons one good moment in the film. The dance is all about seduction and he does an incredible job. As long as he isn't trying to actually spout lines he does all right. Stephen Geoffreys was bloody awful and I do not find it a mystery that I've seen him in nothing since.  Johathan Stark as the modern day \\"Igor\\" is very, very good. A great addition to a small budget film and I wouldn't mind seeing him in other things, he was that believable.<br /><br />Roddy McDowall is not a great film actor. Maybe he is better on the stage, I don't know. However, he gives an adequate performance here as PETER VINCENT, VAMPIRE KILLER. I think Vincent Price (who I adore and who was also NOT a great actor), could have had a ball in this role and it's a shame that he didn't get the chance to try. Regardless, McDowall also has some fun here and he is amusing to watch.<br /><br />To me, this is a nice old vamp flick, good with popcorn and a group of teenie-boppers. I don't think the older teens will like the lack of special effects and adults will see the lack of acting talent.  Great to rent, good to buy only if you get a good deal on the price.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|I went and saw this movie in theaters the first day it was out. I entered the theater expecting to see another of Tim Burton's wackey, strange, but fun, movies. And I did. Ignore the people saying that Depp plays a horrible wonka. Gene Wilder plays a good, heartwarming wonka, but the thing is, Burton's Wonka is SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT!! You think he wanted to make an identicle wonka? But anyway, the movie was extremely funny, mainly when wonka slams into the glass elevator. The enviorments are rich with things to see, and Danny Elfman does a great job at the score, helping to keep the odd, demented feeling of the film, especially during the opening scene. Don't step into the theaters expecting another happy tale, step in expecting another great, funny, Tim Burton film!
B000053VAZ|1.0|\\"Benny and Joon\\" is an unworkable mix of realism and anti-realistic romanticism. Joon is not \\"quirky\\", she is dangerously and violently mentally ill. Her condition is so severe that she has burned through all the available certified and experienced caretakers. To try to make her character bearable, the writers trot out one of the oldest, tritest cliches: with great mental illness comes great artistic talent. With this woman's output, her brother should have hooked her up with a gallery; they'd be financially set for life and the artsy set could buzz about this tortured artist (a concept I thought went out of vogue in the 30s). <br /> <br />Benny has completely sacrificed his life to try to care for his sister, with no apparent progress for either of them. The writers here reveal that they know nothing about this sort of situation, because he would not be able to hold down any sort of job that involves leaving Joon alone for even 5 minutes. The unthinking romanticism is applied to his character too, because he never once shows an iota of resentment for the loss of his life. <br /> <br />Sam, a sort of proto-Willy Wonka by Johnny Depp, appears to be either developmentally disabled, borderline autistic, or severely depressed as a result of the dysfunctional family we hear about as the character is introduced. Naturally, in the unnatural world of Hollywood, he is The Savior. <br /> <br />After the first half of the movie depicts the tragedies of the main characters, it suddenly realizes that it needs to get out of the dark corner it has painted itself into. Once Sam and Joon declare their love for each other, nothing that happens makes the slightest sense either in the real world or in the limited universe of the movie. Apparently all that a dangerously violent person needs to do is say, \\"I want my own apartment\\" and locked mental wards will be thrown open to her and she will become able to function on her own. <br /> <br />The only ways I can see to make this a \\"feel-good\\" movie would be to either a) switch off your brain before it starts and wallow in the nonsense; b) ignore the nonsense and wallow in the tragedy that has been depicted; or c) after it's over, get down on your knees and give profuse thanks that you never had to live in any of those situations. Since (c) isn't available to a lot of people, and (a) and (b) are not the least attractive, I would recommend avoiding \\"Benny and Joon\\" like the plague. \\"Comedy\\"? Not anywhere near one.

I did not know a lot about these guys, or what the cd would amount to, but I lucked out and have myself one of my favorite cds that currently gets loads of air time. <br /> <br />There are no truely weak tracks on the disc, but there are certain ones that are better than the rest.  The prime tracks are 1, Club Foot, 2, Processed Beats, 6, Lost Souls Forever, 7, Running Battle, and 8, Test Transmission.  This cd is a unique mix of rock n roll with a lot of drive and attitude, and a little mixing of dance floor.  All tracks would fit in well at your favourite dance club.  A good cd to turn way up while driving in the car, and roll the windows down and let everyone get a feel of the vibes.   <br /> <br />the only reason i would not give this 5 stars is I do feel some tracks are decent, but have a \\"filler\\" feel to them.  All in all, a great debut album that leaves me anxiously awaiting their sophomore effort.
B000AL730O|5.0|As a boy, I grew up with The Beatles. I felt the little hairs on my arms stand up when their first hit aired on the radio, went to see all their movies (yes, I believed The Beatles lived together in that big house with four doors), got stoned with Sergeant Pepper and even more with the second side of Abbey Road, worried when I saw how they grew apart in Let it Be, was heartbroken when the Fab Four finally split up. <br /> <br />I followed McCartney on his adventures as a solo artist and with Wings. Even though he wrote some of his best work during that period, his albums always lacked something, and often a lot - even Band on the Run had parts that I wanted to skip. Too many albums followed. I kinda lost interest after a while. <br /> <br />And then came Chaos and Creation. After playing it for the second time, I found that I was humming some of the melodies and riffs in my mind. I just had to play the album over and over. Then something weird happened. Tears started running down my face. Huh? This never happened to me anymore... not since A Long and Winding Road, anyway. But it did. And the album just keeps getting better. <br /> <br />History will have to prove if this is Paul's best album, as I suspect it is. It shows all he has to offer: great melodies, a voice that still lends itself to every mood and genre, lyrics that go from poetic to weird and from silly to corny. But hey, that is Paul. Honest and sincere, sometimes with a hint of irony, but never cynical. And the combination of those ingredients creates music that goes straight to the heart. <br /> <br />Much of the quality of Chaos and Creation is due to the excellent production. So, thanks to everyone who helped McCartney create this album. But above all, thanks to Paul for touching me again with his music now, just as he did when I was a boy.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is not just an animated movie; it's a work of art and a work of love. It's a feature movie that just happens to be animated. The scope of its story is immense and the philosophical issues actually challenge the audience's intelligence in an age when everything is dumbed down for cheap laughs and comfortable feelings. Akira is truly a landmark.
0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond asks then answers the age old question, \\"Why are some societies more advanced then others.\\"  This in depth look into the question (well over 400 pages) goes back to pre-historic times to answer and Diamond spends 33 years of research to answer.  Many of Diamonds arguments are valid. In my mind Jared Diamond is a genius who was not afraid to answer what many thought before was an unattainable answer to Yali's question of \\"Why do you white men have so much cargo and we New Guinieans have so little?\\"  Many critics argue that his answers are too simple.  But why can't life have simple answers sometimes.  Why must we look too deep into things and believe that thiungs have to be bigger than what they are.  I would encourage all to at least read this book.  You may not agree with all of Diamonds points, but you will come out of it feeling as though some of it you will agree with.
B000001Y16|5.0|The cd is just a flat out classic.    I own every cd pac released while alive, and this one, and this is my favorite of them all.  This is a cd that you can easily play from start to finish without skipping any tracks.  The album starts out strong with 3 classics:  Hail Mary, Toss It Up, and To Live & Die in L.A.  Then goes into a mix of social and fun songs, and finishes off with some political songs and a strong ending that compliments the intro.    The worst part of this album, imo, is this stupid part in the song Me and My Girlfriend when you hear this girl shooting a gun yelling out things, just lame, but only a short part.    The Tracks.    1. Bomb First (Intro): 10/10 - Great intro, sets the stage.  2. Hail Mary: 10/10 - Classic  3. Toss It Up: 10/10 - Classic  4. To Live & Die in L.A.: 10/10 - Classic  5. Blasphemy: 10/10 - M.O.B. (I like the following part lol)   \\"They say Moses split the Red Sea  I split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly\\"  6. Life Of a New Outlaw: 9.5/10 - Good song  7. Just Like Daddy: 9.5/10 - Another good song  8. Krazy: 10/10 - I really like this song.  This song is definitely in my top 5 favorite 2pac songs.  9. White Man'z World: 9/9 - Pretty good song  10. Me and My Girlfriend: 9/9 - Silly part that is annoying forced a 9 here.  11. Hold ya Head: 10/10 - Another one of my favorites  12. Against All Odds: 9.5/10 - Good song that finishes off the mood started in the intro, great way to end this cd imo.
B000002U9W|5.0|Back in the good old Napster days, there were always a couple of live versions of the Atom Heart Mother Suite available which are also excellent.  AHM is one of my top 5 favorite albums.  I was around 12 when this came out.  What a shame kids today can't discover new music in their childhood and have it with them for the rest of their lives.
B0006U4UAU|3.0|After hearing so much about this band and not really knowing anything that they've actually done, I checked this out at a local public library. Well, this continues that current indie trend of the dance-punk. There is quite a bit of hi-hat used in most of the songs. It's also got lots of spoken word tracks as well. I feel that with this album that there isn't a whole lot to say, but even though it won't have much length, I can tell you that if you don't really mind the length of some of these songs that you might be okay. That has always been the problem with me: the songs seem to go on longer than necessary. <br /> <br />There happen to be the highlights though, songs that stop the album from being just dragging. I particularly like the two versions of \\"Yeah\\" quite a bit. Something about those stand out quite a bit. Also, there's \\"Tribulations\\" on the first disc which is a standout track, complete with its synth that gives it a new-wave feel. <br /> <br />So, yeah, that's all I can really say. It's not really awful by any stretch of the mind, although sometimes it's rather average. But it all depends on what you're looking for. If it's the dance-punk thing is for you, LCD Soundsystem is probably that too. It's decent, so I'm not gonna stop from recommending you this.

B000003TAR|4.0|The more I listen to this record, the more I think people who do the whole \\"Nirvana vs. Pearl Jam\\" thing don't really know how to enjoy a record. They are NOT the same bands at all and it has to do with what style you want. If you want Zeppelin-rock, talent, and (in later records) experimentation, it's better to go for PJ, obviously. If you like punk, Nirvana is the one for you. This is probably Nirvana at their most punk, too. And arguably, had it not been released on a major, people would be calling it \\"indie\\" (God I'm glad they don't). Where the last album, \\"Nevermind\\" was way more \\"clean\\" sounding, \\"In Utero\\" shows the noiseman himself, Steve Albini, producing an ugly album for a band who was making surprisingly un-mainstream stuff (but not more heavy like \\"Bleach). <br /> <br />Oh, and look at the price people: $7.99! $7.99! $7.99! <br /> <br />Haha, I ended that like a Nirvana song. If you listen to songs on this album, you'll realize that several times that Kurt usually will repeat a line throughout the last minute until the song's fading out (\\"Rape Me\\", \\"Dumb\\", etc.). It kind of lessens it on repeat listens, but is otherwise just fine. <br /> <br />It starts out greatly with \\"Serve the Servants\\", which is a track that shows the growth in the album, and just really good songwriting from the band. You'll sing along with the rather simple chorus. I like the way that the band wrote the music on \\"Serve the Servants\\"; it's got a great structure. Great riffs and drumming. I like the urgency of the performance of the song. Then you have the classic \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", a great song of the addiction he'd gone through, especially since fame. \\"Milk It\\" is very much like the album's suicide note or something. \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is one of my favorite Nirvana songs ever. The structure seems somewhat drawn out at first, but the lyrics are some of the best Kurt has written, and then as the album goes on, there are still other highlights. \\"tourette's\\" is just a simple, fun punksong. It's also very short. People may say it's dumb, but do you really expect the song in which lyrics weren't printed to be the intentionally deep track. \\"All Apologies\\" is just so great to listen to. It kind of recalls Joy Division, even. Even though I think JD were way better, this track is where you can hear some of the final thoughts of it. Depending on how you see it, the chorus could be seen as a kind of  <br /> <br />Then there's the only song I don't really like on here, \\"Rape Me\\". I realize he wanted to make an anti-\\"SLTS\\" song, but clearly, people are still listening to the former in spite that. I dunno, it seems lame for intention to me to use the same chords in it. To me, there's a lot more to offer on here than this. It's not terrible, however. However, Kurt got his wish: The album only sold half of what \\"Nevermind\\" did and his star was fading more as time went by. <br /> <br />I give it four stars just because I feel like people (myself included) give too many albums five stars and I think the \\"Unplugged\\" performance blows this out of the water, as hard as it may seem to believe. And also, while \\"Nevermind\\" may have been more shiny I have to admit I slightly prefer it just because I think it's more consistent. And even if you don't find yourself liking it, not only is it a bargain; it's interesting. I think it's an album you'll at least like listening to once. All of their albums, however, all have some quality.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|SOAD is definitely different, and that's what's so cool about them. I love the singing, the melodies, and playback value. The fast to slow and hard to soft kind of feel, gives the band a real original feel that is not rivaled by any other band. Gotta give this CD props, even though it doesn't need any.
B000002PCS|5.0|This entire CD is just wonderful.  The music fits the sweeping and romantic mood of the film so perfectly that if you close your eyes and listen, you can almost see the actors in each scene.  Completely instrumental, thankfully, which adds to the impact of each piece.  Though the film quickly came and went, if you have a chance to see it, I'd highly recommend it on a rainy afternoon with a full box of tissues!
0345360338|3.0|Sharon Kay Penman proves once again that real life can be just as exciting as fantasy.  Using a wide cast of characters Penman masterfully recreates some of England's most important history.  We're introduced to such characters as Henry III, Edward I (yes this is the scary guy from Braveheart), Llewelyn Fawr and most especially Simon de Montfort the English champion of the common man.<br /><br />Since this novel already boasts many excellent reviews attesting to both its quality and its content I'll point out a few weak points.  First of all the novel's Welsh characters, who Penman painstakingly introduces in the first part of the book, get thrown on the backburner for much of the story.  This was done because as Penman continued to craft Falls the Shadow she realized she had far too much material to fit into one novel and thus moved much of the Welsh content to the following book (I believe The Reckoning is this books title).  She left just enough of the Welsh plot in the novel that I was extremely disappointed there wasn't more.  Secondly while Simon de Montfort was clearly a great man I suspect Penman may have seen him through the rose tinted goggles of a historian enamored by the tales surrounding an extremely charismatic leader.  He's touted as a Christ figure complete with his one moment of righteous anger in the temple (in this case at King Henry rather than the money lenders) and a savior like heroic death complete with divine lightening storm as he dies for his just cause.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this novel down and find myself possessing a much stronger knowledge of English history durring the mid-13th century as a result of reading it.  If your at all interested in English history or you have enjoyed any of Penman's previous works I'd advise picking up a copy of Falls the Shadow.

0792844882|5.0|Having been a fan of Elizabeth Berkley long before this movie was made,was thrilled to learn she got the lead. I really dig watching Liz in this movie, she is beautiful as always and does not let anyone push her around. Just watching her hitchhike at the end and beginning of the movie is enough to make any man smile, I just wish I could have been the driver picking her up! Great movie, here's to hoping Elizabeth will star in the much needed sequel Showgirls 2. Recently I saw her starring in the movie Student Seduction, Elizabeth Berkley is easily one of the most beautiful and talented actresses today, she is in the same league as beauties like Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Ashley Judd, and Hilary Swank.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|amazing.  enough said.  this is sigur ros's sunny day album.  more accessible?  perhaps, depends on your definition of accessible.  it by no means has a mainstream type feel, but it is the bands most accomplished work to date.  they never fail.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|A poor boy finally gets his chance when he wins a golden ticket into an eccentric mans' candy-making factory with five spoilt children. All sorts of surprises await for Charlie around every twist and turn. Including an extra special surprise. <br /> <br />I had no idea what to expect of this film when I first walked into the theater. I left it thinking \\"Woah! That was nothing great...\\" <br />All though a lot of the sets are better, such as the giant candy room, it just didn't have the magic like the orginal did. All though Johnny Depp is a great actor, he just couldn't pull off Willy Wonka. He wasn't believable, his voice was too irritating and fake. Gene Wilder was a thousand times better. The child actors were very irritating (though I suppose that's what they're meant to be like) and nothing compared to the original kids. Although I must say that the new Charlie was a lot more likable than the orginal. The Oompa-Loompas  were very different. They weren't orange, they all looked the same, and they were not dwarfs but a normal man srucken through CGI. <br />Over all, an okay film, the original was better in some places. Worth seeing it in the theaters, just don't expect much.

B00005REQR|2.0|to my dissapointment, not everything by the original daevid allen era gong is indispensable. this is radio gnome invisible pt. 1 with  the finest space rock lineup anyone could hope for but the final result of this album comes of sounding like a tentative rehearsal where in many places allen scats some of the songs' improvisations and their arrangement lacks coherence and development. instrumentation is limited to supporting the vocals and chants and rarely gets the opportunity to expound any ideas or feel each other out. in the end, daevid allen displays some infectious song writing ability but it appears that the new members just weren't ready to record yet. this is steve hillage's first appearance for gong but you wouldn't know it as his guitar is barely noticeable. things change remarkably for the next albums 'angels egg' and 'you' which are two of the greatest psychedelic albums ever recorded.
B000AP04FG|4.0|This movie reminded me of all the old black and white dance-and-banter movies I used to watch, with loads of style and deadpan wit, and a good coating of gloss. There isn't much substance-this isn't the sort of movie to go in depth- but there's some really surprisingly good acting. Brad Pitt is a down to earth, old fashioned skills sort of killer; Angelina Jolie is slick, high-strung, part of a big-money-and-loads of neat toys assasination outfit. They do a brilliant job. I really enjoyed it. There's an attention to detail in some aspects that my friend the gun enthusiast would get a kick out of. (Those yellow sunglasses actually have a purpose in top-level competitive shooting; they make your vision ever so slightly better.)<br /><br />My husband and I - both former military - watched it in the theater with a bunch of teenagers, and I think we laughed so hard we embarased them. It's really a good movie, it works on the blow-em-up level as well as a slightly more sophisticated one.
B000002VCB|3.0|This album was a huge disappointment to me. I rate most of the songs highly, but not to the same level as the previous three albums, or to any that came after it. Definitely a harder rocking album than average Alan Parsons. <br />I can't stand three of the tracks. 'You lie down with dogs' is a tuneless rocker. 'I'd rather be a man' is another hard rocker and also tuneless, lacking the melodic ambience of most of Parson's songs. <br />'Don't hold back' is without a doubt the worst song in the entire APP catalogue. terrible, simplistic melody and out of tune singing by what sounds like a female thrash metalist trying to do something less thrashy. Strange analogy, but listen to her voice, you'll see what I mean. <br />'Lucifer' is ok, but I can pass on it. 'Winding me up' is not that bad, but a bit twee for my liking. Chris Rainbow was to sing far far better on future APP releases. <br />That leaves four songs, which are excellent. 'Damned if I do' features Zakatek's second lead vocal. I always found his voice slightly on the gruff side, but it suits the music here, and this is an excellently orchestrated and well crafted song. <br />'You won't be there' is an excellent ballad. Nice melody, good melodic singing. <br />The last two tracks are the best. 'Secret garden' has beautiful instrumentation, and I like the middle section, which sounds like Chris Rainbow's multi layered vocals and some Beach boys influence.  <br />The last track is exceptional. the guitar riffs at the end are beautiful by Ian Bairnson and the vocal delivery is excellent. The melody is as good as anything Parsons and Woolfson have written before. <br />Listening to this last track makes me want more of the same. Overall, it is not a bad album, but I dislike three tracks intensely and find a couple of others merely ok. Whereas, with almost all APP albums, I usually only find one dud track. <br />Still, I advise a purchase, but only if you are familiar with APP work in general. 3 stars.
B0009MAO46|5.0|That's it, I'm officially old. Kids today have seen \\"Mind's Eye\\" and \\"Beyond the Mind's Eye\\" as history lessons, not the latest and greatest in the beginning world of  computer animation.... and this movie, so wonderful when it came out for the perfect use of that developed and more mature animation, amazing for breaking new ground and blazing new paths... is now a classic kid's movie.<br /><br />Somehow though, like all classics, it's still good enough to make adults love it too.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Star Trek V is certainly not a highlight of the series, but I do not feel like blaming this completely on director William Shatner. As you may or may not be aware, there is much of this film that was cut out due to budget difficulties, and the late arrival of models to the studio forced the special effects to be rushed. <br />Also, due to the success of the humorous Star Trek IV, Paramount forced some cheap laughs into Shatner's originally dark script. There is also a bit that is left unexplained, including how the Enterprise reached the center of the galaxy in a number of hours, and why Spock's half-brother has remained a mystery until now, among other things. <br />Despite its many flaws, there are some aspects of The Final Frontier to be appreciated. In some bookend scenes, we get to see some bonding moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. There was also some well-done set design, in particular Paradise City. Also, shooting smoke into the sky on the location where they shot Sha Ka Ree, blocking out the sun, really did have a mystical effect. <br />Anyways, I believe this is a film that must be seen to be judged fairly.
B00005JM02|5.0|...but then I figured enough other adults would be there that I'd be ok. And guess what? In a theater with 30 some odd people, only 4 were kids. Funny, huh?

That mucking around with history phase. They should never get involved with the real world, they just make a mess of it.<br /><br />I absolutely love the seagulls.

B00078XGRO|5.0|After a somewhat lacking film in Star Trek: Generations, First Contact really picks up. This movie focuses greatly on Picard, and Patrick Stewart really gets a chance to act. <br />The Borg, our nemeses from The Next Generation have returned, and now they are time travelling to disrupt the Earth's past (This raises some questions of logic, but since it serves the movie, I can not complain). Will, Deanna, and Geordie go to Earth to help repair the first Warp ship, while Picard and the rest discover the Borg have survived, and are forming a collective in engineering. There are some good action sequences, including a suspenceful spacewalk scene on the Enterprise-E. <br />This episode in the series shows a bit of progression from the last movie. The ships in this movie seem to fit with the style of Deep Space Nine. Geordie no longer has a VISOR, but instead has ocular implants. The Enterprise-E introduces the Soveregin class vessel, a bit less comfortable than the luxurious Galaxy-class, but having a better exterior design. <br />Fans of DS9 will notice the brief appearance of the Defiant, which is damaged in battle, but designated by Picard \\"Adrift, but salvageable\\". Fans of Voyager will also notice a cameo of the Enterprise's Emergency Medical Hologram, who Dr. Crusher uses to distract the Borg. <br />I saw this before I was a big Star Trek fan and I liked it, so I can confidently recomend this to non-Trekkers.

1400095913|5.0|I haven't read such a good book in a long time, never mind such a good first novel. The language is lovely, using aliteration often in Dexter's inner voice -he's a funny poet inside, if also a monstrous one. The whole situation is treated with such lightness and dry humor. Then ending was a little clumsily written, but still brilliant. I've been waiting so impatiently for the next book in this series. I'm torn apart that I gave my copy of this book away. On the one hand, someone else is now being hooked; on the other I don't have it to re-read anymore. On the one hand I did a good thing; on the other I'm frusterated... While waiting for the next book in the series to be paperbacked I might have to get another copy of this one so I can read it again.<br /><br />I'm also  deeply torn over getting the next book in harcover. I mean, I never get hardcovers on purpose, they take up way too much room.... but I wanna *read* it! Wah...
B0000683DH|5.0|After the special effects showcase that was Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Wrath of Khan was ready to film with a lower budget and a less-known director. However, this installment helped to shape Star Trek for years to come. <br />In TMP, they attempted to make the cast look younger, like very little time had passed. However in this one, Kirk is having a midlife crisis on his fiftieth birthday. There is much more focus on the characters in this one, and the special effects are there for the story. Also, gone are the space pyjamas from TMP, replaced with red, militarisitc uniforms, which would be the standard for the rest of the original series movies. <br />The character Khan from the original series episode Space Seed returns. We find that after he was exiled, the lush planet he was set down on suffered from the explosion of a nearby planet. Few of his crew survived, and his wife was one of the people to die. For all this, he blames Kirk, and when Chekov and his captain, Terrel arrive on the planet, Khan forces them to take him up to their ship. <br />This movie also introduced Saavik, a female Vulcan cadet who would appear for the next few films. We also see Kirk's ex, and he meets his son, David Marcus. <br />I know that this movie is great for Trek fans, but a friend who never saw Star Trek liked it, so I would say that anybody should give this movie a chance.
B00009YOQW|1.0|When you look at the design, you will see the center is more \\"cut out\\" than the rest. While this is necessary to allow for different sounds, this center piece of wood needs to be thicker. My 2 yr old Grandson broke that piece after playing with it for about an hour or so. {It was broken by being hit with the drumstick} The toy had to be thrown out. there was no repairing it as the break was sharp and dangerous. <br /> While it does help the child create many different sound & again, all that is needed is to make that one piece of wood thicker.

B000002AH1|4.0|I think the liner notes to Freddie Hubbard's album \\"First Light\\" express Miles Davis' situation in the early and mid-1970s the best: by entering the world of jazz-rock (fusion), Miles was simply living off reputation alone as the preferred jazz trumpeter.  Only a few years before, Miles scored hits with \\"In A Silent Way\\" and the landmark \\"Bitches Brew\\" - and it seemed, as if by doing so, Miles phenomenal jazz trumpet becomes ever so minimalistic and easily tired leaving others, like Freddie Hubbard, to gain the title of #1 jazz trumpeter in the early 70s.<br /><br />Not only was Miles living off of reputation alone, but this reputation seemingly allowed him to boast of friendships with Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone, to exploit these friendships through creative measures, and allow his sidemen to take the forefront of his music while he, himself, settles back and offers the occasional off-key blast.  In fact, Miles' work on this album is quite unexceptional.  His solos, for the most part, are easily notated with quarter or eighth note trumpet blasts or squeals rather than actual full measures of solos.  If this album were any measure of Miles Davis's talent, then he'd be equated with the likes of William Hung, Pimp Daddy Welfare, and any novice attempting to play the trumpet.<br /><br />While this record clearly does not boast of Miles Davis' particular skills in any shape or format, it does possess some of the finest work by his sidemen: Keith Jarrett, Jack Dejohnette, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, and Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Ron Carter from his Second Great Quintet during the mid-1960s.  Because of the truly great level of playing by these men, this is some of the finest jazz-rock (fusion) I've ever heard.<br /><br />\\"Sivad\\" begins with a funky groove supplemented by keys, bass, and drums - and as it delves further into time, it melts into a casual conversation between each respective instrument.  \\"Little Church\\" reminds me of Close Encounter of the Third Kind with its ambient rhythmic support.  \\"Funky Tonk\\" lives up to its name, while \\"What I Say\\" is a 21 minute investigation into the world of drums, keys, and bass with Miles' occasional trumpet blast and an extended solo by Gary Bartz.  Each song is clearly enjoyable and sets the standard for jazz-rock (fusion) for many years to come.hird Kind with its ambient rhythmic support.  \\"Funky Tonk\\" lives up to its name, while \\"What I Say\\" is a 21 minute investigation into the world of drums, keys, and bass with Miles' occasional trumpet blast and an extended solo by Gary Bartz.

B000002UA5|3.0|The first of this two-disc set is comprised of rather raucous renditions of some of the Floyd's earliest material. The live versions at times outshine the studio versions, and listening to David Gilmour's guitar work on Astronomy Dominie in particular shows the listener why he was chosen to fill Syd Barret's shoes as a guitarist. Gilmour is unequaled, perhaps the most under rated player in popular music. Careful With That Axe, Eugene also betters it studio counterpart, the build-up is scary as all hell, and the screams near the end are chilling. Very gripping, and an indispensable document of their early years. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the majority of the solo tracks that comprise disc two. The only song I have adopted into the Classic Floyd Cannon is Water's Grantchester Meadows. The vocal melody is brilliant, the words even more so. And the tender folk ballad ends with a delightful bit of found sound - a fly buzzes round the ears until it is chased and swatted. What remains of the solo material is either underdeveloped, self-indulgent or just plain unlistenable. It shows that  as a band they are an unparalleled musical  force, and as individuals they are marginally  creative, at best. Buy this one for the live tracks, if you are a fan of early period Pink Floyd, and skip over what you don't care for on the studio disc.

Your vehicle got stuck in the snow and he and his son came over and pushed and shoveled until you got momentum, then all you had time for was to wave your thanks. No, we're talking about what the Qur'an teaches. What its members are supposed to believe and do.<br /><br />I'm giving this book five stars despite two significant oversights. First, for not discussing the proverbial fork in the road that separates the Jews from the Arabs and the bitter dispute about Jacob's birthright, which Esau foolishly bargained away. Islam doesn't believe a birthright can be bartered away, even though Hebrew thought and tradition indicates it can. Morever, the prophets that followed also adequately show that God Himself recognized the barter of the foolish Esau.<br /><br />Finally, not enough emphasis is placed on the Qur'an or the people. I've read the Qur'an in vain, seeking wisdom, depth of thought, mind-boggling prophecies and, most importantly, the mind, will and resolve of the God of Abraham.<br /><br />If more Muslims understood the God of \\"the Book\\" (which is to say, the Bible), they would see the being they call Allah is a cheap carbon copy of Jehovah, being closer to the wrath of Zeus but lacking the wisdom of Odin.<br /><br />An example! You want an example. On page 143, the author notes the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:7, 46-47: \\"Blessed art the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.\\" Further: \\"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you reserve for that? Do not even [the wicked] do that? And if you only greet those who believe as you, what more are you doing than do others.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, heeding those words will gain you respect and love from others and it will not lead to bloodshed. Yet the wrathful, supposedly merciful Allah, has another philosopy, greet your brethren and kill the others: \\"Muhammad is Allah's apostle. Those who follow him are ruthless to the unbelievers, but merciful to one another.\\" Qur'an 48:29<br /><br />I'm convinced if it were the predilection of men to study religion, especially their own in relation to others, that Islam would have died out long ago. Most thinking people couldn't, wouldn't follow this Genghis Kang type of theology that preaches a dangerous intolerance that's known to less ignorant victims throughout the world. I'll bet you thought the Serbs just loved killing Bosnians for the joy of commiting murder, huh? No, they killed the Bosnians because they'd had it up to here with Islam's sick intolerance of other faiths, the illogical taxes on NOT being Islam, their ridiculous laws on how the others should DRESS, EAT and DRINK. Muslims in Serbian-dominated areas were left alone, why not Serbians in Muslim-dominated areas?<br /><br />Where Jesus taught his people to \\"Search the scriptures,\\" Islam expects only obediance and submission. And since Muhammad is supposed to be Allah's \\"last messenger,\\" spiritual guides are only that. With no revelation from Allah, no guiding spirit, many of Islam's self-appointed leaders go forth and command blood baths to the extent their followers are willing to carry them out. All by the authority of the Qur'an.<br /><br />The author also exposes the myths surrounding the crusades. Most casual students only see the top of the iceberg and rely on Islamic leaders to record how unjust the crusades were. I can't speak for the author, but I believe there will be room in hell for many people on both sides who shed innocent blood.<br /><br />In the meantime, I recommend this book only if you're unwilling to read a history of the Qur'an and the Qur'an itself. I don't know who conjured the words that the prophet recited, but it wasn't the God of Abraham. It wasn't the God who led Moses out of Egypt or said the greatest of all commandments was to love one's fellow man.<br /><br />To Muslims I recommend this book. I also recommend they look for the telltale signs of inspiration that would come from a book dictated and commissioned of God. I can find none. Reading it makes my heart stone that man would murder his fellow man with such casual disregard. \\"Allah assigns a person to participate in jihad...and nothing compels him to do so EXCEPT 1) belief in Allah...that he will be rewarded by Allah with a reward or booty, or 2)he will be admitted to Paradise [if he is martred].\\"<br /><br />Before I cut anyone's throat, I'd certainly find out who's holding the keys to the gates of Paradise and who dictated what to whom and under what circumstances. Making the wrong decision could land a soul in a world of hurt, and for a very long time.<br /><br />Finally, cultural differences abound between Islam and most other religions today. As the author notes, The Qur'an and Islamic law treat women as nothing more than the possessioh of men, the Qur'an sanctions wife beating and it allows for child marriages.<br /><br />Again, this isn't your kindly neighbors; Islam is a religion that thankfully is neglected by most of its adherents. What scares me is that the fundamentalist extremists seem to be smart enough to interpret the book correctly, but spiritually blind enough not to see who its author is.ms I recommend this book.

0345440927|3.0|Tracey Hogg shares her secrets for maintaining order in a house where a toddler resides in Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers.  Those familiar with Ms. Hogg's first book, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer, know of her affinity for acronyms.  The acronym for this book is HELP.  She encourages parents to learn how to become HELPing parents, rather than \\"authoritative\\" or \\"enabling parents.\\"  She uses examples from real-life cases of how HELPing , authoritative, and enabling parents handle various situations with toddlers.  The goal is for readers to guage where they are on the continuum and correct behaviors that aren't HELPful.<br /><br />The most useful section of the book, for me, was the chapter on R&R (Rest and Rituals).  Ms. Hogg breaks down each event in the day (ie:  mealtimes, nap time, bath time, bedtime, etc.)  and explains what she says and what she does to prepare a toddler for each of these.  If a toddler is given consistancy in his or her daily roultine, then Ms. Hogg maintains, a lot of the battles commonly associated with toddlerhood will be thwarted.<br /><br />Other useful sections include how to get a toddler to sleep through the night, how to get a toddler to be less clingy, and how to prepare a toddler for the arrival of a new baby.<br /><br />Although I found this book to be more useful than her first, I still found some of Ms. Hogg's points debatable.  She still categorizes toddlers into five basic personality categories as she did in Secrets of the Baby Whisperer.  I was still unable to categorize my two children into these categories.  When I thought that I finally figured out the category of my child, I would read later in the book about how that child would typically handle a situation, and it didn't at all apply to my child.<br /><br />She also provides some unconventional advice about letting your toddler regard his/her crib as a place to play.  I had always heard that a child should see it as a place to sleep.<br /><br />I think that Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers is worth reading.  At the very least, you'll get some ideas about how you can make life a little less chaotic (if it is that way in your house) through the use of rituals.  That in itself should make a household with a toddler more manageable.think that Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers is worth reading.

B000002VCZ|5.0|If you liked the smooth AOR that defined Alan Parsons during their heyday in the 1980s then it doesn't get any better than this.  All of the vocals are silky smooth, the songwriting is pure pop heaven, and instrumentalism is unsurpassed.  From a vocalist/guitarist point of view, this is one of the few \\"10 albums on a desert island \\"must haves\\"\\".  Any guitarist wanting to understand what it is that makes good leads great owes it to themself to figure out note for note transcriptions to \\"Sooner or Later\\", and \\"Same old Sun\\".  The added bonus is that you can croon with Woolfson when you're not noodling the leads.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Not a single word in any of the songs makes sense at all, and the actual music is awesome too.  This is truly the greatest music will ever get...EVER!

B00000I8BX|5.0|taking the title as the leaders of the Industrial Metal Scene with the relese of this beast. A flawless assualt of brutal riffing and pummeling drums set to beautiful electronica arrangements and samples, Is where Obsolete shones above previous FF albums. Burton's wide range of vocals are perfected here, Moving from Audible growls to Raging screams and of course numerous different forms of clean vocals. Dino breaks out-o-the-box here with some far more complex riffs then he's used to, And still keeping it melodicly tharshy through out! Raymond, Keeping it simple,Heavy & Brutal with pummellings to bang your head to for numerous years. Christian, Putting down Bass lines that accent both the Drums and Guitiar well, Bringin' the band together for a mass of mechanical tormentations.<br /><br /> Its easy to see why this album is today considered the best Fear Factory has to offer. And the Extra tracks are worth the extra change! WAY worth the extra change!<br /><br />[][][][][][][][][][][][]TRACK REVIEW[][][][][][][][][][][][]<br /><br />SHOCK ****** A brutal assualt right off the get go, Easily one of the heaviest original tracks. The speedy riffing and pummeling drums will have your head nodding in seconds, about 11 seconds to be exact! And You'll want to yell \\"SHOCK!!\\" each time Burton does.<br /><br />EDGECRUSHER ******* A Crowd fav. No wonder with an allmost eerie use of the Bass & Electronica turned quickly into a thrashy beast. If your a Fear Factory Fan, And can't sing at least the chorus to this right now, Then your not a true FF fan!!<br /><br />SMASHER/DEVOURER ****** Excellent Vocals and very chant worthy! Not as heavy as the past two showing you the willingness to perform many different styles. Excellent end, Starts with a simple whisper and leads to a pummeling finish of heavy beats.<br /><br />SECUREITRON ******* This song has a pretty cool intro for itself, Sounding like police banter. Then quickly turns into one of the most original metal songs i've ever heard. Burtons Vocals shine brightly here, With memerable lyrics and vocals. I love the chorus here, One my favs!<br /><br />DESCENT ******* A Very Melodic track, My fav vocals and lyrics by vocal ever! Very deep bass sets the dimmer mood on this beautiful track. This is honestly my second fav song by Fear Factory to date. The first is coming up.<br /><br />HI-TECH HATE ****** Back to the Thrash! After the past couple more melodic tracks Fear Factory throws out this raging beast to assure you they haven't gone soft! Some of my fav guitars and bass on the album. Great chorus, Chanted oftenly live! MASS DESTRUCTION FOR ALL, COWARD, COWARD, COWARD!!!<br /><br />FREEDOM OR FIRE ******* Very speedy drums here, With speedy and crunchy sets the stage for another fan fav. Being a Mosh Maker naturally the Chorus is amazing. This song has less Electronica then most on the original track listing.<br /><br />RESURRECTION *MY FAV* Being one of my fav songs.. Ever. Ressurection is a balanced song, With a crushing chorus of melodic and strong vocals by Burton. The muicianship in this song is amazing. Tha band really came together for this one.<br /><br />TIMELESSNESS ******* This is basically a dark and melodic end to Resurrection. This seems like Burton wanted to prove his worth as a vocalist, as his soft vocals gain a strength unseen in the death metal scene.<br /><br />CARS ****** A very good cover of Gary Numans classic Cars. His vocals are even included in the creation. One of my fav covers ever, Very fun. Crunchy and cover worthy riffs.<br /><br />0-0 ******* A VERY different approach for FF, This is a very dark and almost demonic sounding song. Brutal, Very brutal! With pummeling drums and the most differential vocals on the album.<br /><br />SOULWOUND ***** This song just seemed abit repetitive. Its a good song just compared to the others..Filler!<br /><br />MESSIAH  ****** My fav Drums on the album. The pummeling double bass echoing, as Burton yells the word \\"Messiah\\" every now and then. The chorus doesn't actually kick in until your about 1:58 into the track, Delivering yet more pummelling double bass.<br /><br />CONCERTO ****** Very low toned clear vocals set a dark theme to the final track. With thrashy Guitar and bass ending out the album.<br /><br />If you don't already own this album I suggest picking it up now! You are truely missing out on a genre making album, And masterpiece.

B000002ADT|5.0|What's there to say that hasn't already been said about \\"Kind of Blue\\"?  If you are new to jazz or would like to start a collection, you've come to the right place and with the wonderful sound quality and remastering job, this is the disc to get.  This album will never get old and generations upon generations will be listening and marvelling at what these guys did back in the mid 50's.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is probably the sweetest album of the world!! Every song <br />is like great. Tunnel of Love, Skateaway, & Expresso Love gimme <br />a lot of love on this CD. Solid Rock is also great one of my <br />favorites on this CD. Romeo and Juliet could be the weakest tune <br />of the album but is still great but a live version is heavier. <br />Hand in Hand , great!!! Buy this album.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|This was the cd that I was waiting for.  After my cassette version disintegrated years ago, I decided to wait for a proper remastered version to become available before getting a replacement.  The wait was very long but finally the wait was worth it.<br /><br />The remastering quality is brilliant and the album has never sounded better.  The extra tracks are good too and unlike in other albums do not detract from or otherwise demean the main album material.<br /><br />Boy George's antics may sometime detract from Culture Club as musicians and make it difficult to take them seriously but Boy is this album a good one (pun intended).  All the tracks are wonderful and showcase the band as the great singer/songwriter/musicians that they are.<br /><br />Great tracks, great sound quality, what more could you ask for?  Go get this already!

B000002KIE|3.0|I disagree with \\"Rock Snob\\" that considering this album as a work of art displays a lack of musical understanding or ability.  As a musician who has not only performed live for pay and recorded cds I'd like to think that I know something about music as well.<br /><br />The Sex Pistols and this album are very important in the whole history of rock and roll because of its influence on countless other bands and musicians to come such as Nirvana, The Clash, Green Day and other punk bands not to mention Heavy and Thrash Metal bands.  Although they by no means were the first and only to start the punk movement as many others could lay claim to this honour e.g. The Ramones, The Velvet Underground and even Blondie but the Sex Pistols did have talent but they just chose to play in a certain discordant style to put their message across but that doesn't mean the album isn't good or that they're not good musicians.  I thought the guitar solo on \\"God Save the Queen\\" was pretty good.<br /><br />You have to listen to the album for what it is and what it stands for and as an early representative of the punk rock genre, this is actually very good.  I'm just waiting for my remastered version to be shipped to me soon so that I can fully enjoy a little more closely what this classic must have sounded in the studio.  This was never meant to sound like pop or classical music anyways so how can you say this sucks unless you compare it to something else?  If you say compared to other albums in the genre, this sucks at least I can respect and understand your rationale but how can you possibly say that about a band and album that virtually created the whole frickin genre?<br /><br />Ironically, \\"Rock Snob's\\" reaction to the album is probably precisely what the Sex Pistols intended and were hoping for anyway.<br /><br />My recommendation: a must have for any serious music hobbist's collection but try and get the remastered version as the volume levels on this one are very low.  Peace!Peace!

0312935080|5.0|I've been reading Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels in order and they just keep getting better and better.  In this novel, we return to an incident referenced obliquely in the first two books: Harry Bosch's killing of Norman Church, a murderer known as \\"The Dollmaker.\\"  Bosch had violated police procedure by going to the Dollmaker's apartment alone, and had shot the Dollmaker after incorrectly concluding that he'd been reaching for a gun.  Nonetheless, the LAPD concluded that the Dollmaker had indeed committed eleven brutal murders.  Although makeup from nine of the victims was found in the Dollmaker's possession, Bosch now finds himself a defendant in a federal court civil trial brought by the Dollmaker's wife, where he is accused of having violated the Dollmaker's civil rights.<br /><br />The description of this trial, which weaves throughout the novel, is riveting.  Mrs. Church is represented by a high-profile attorney known for her legal skills and air of righteous indignation.  Bosch is represented by a Deputy City Attorney.  (This novel takes plenty of potshots at the Los Angeles City Attorney's office, with quotes like this: \\"These guys like Bulk, they couldn't make it on the outside .  .  .  If he had to win in order to eat, your lawyer would be a thin man.  He needs that steady paycheck from the city coming in, win or lose.\\")  Nonetheless, Bosch is hopeful that given the ample evidence against the Dollmaker, the jury will enter a defense verdict.<br /><br />But wait -- as the trial begins, another body turns up, murdered the very same way as the other victims.  Known as \\"The Concrete Blonde,\\" she was murdered after Bosch had killed the Dollmaker.  Could Bosch possibly have killed the wrong man?  Or is there a copycat killer about?  If so, can the police find him in time?  Will any of this affect the ongoing trial?  And what will the jury verdict be?<br /><br />This is truly a can't-put-it-down novel that has everything you want: an exciting detective story; a fascinating trial; well-drawn, multi-dimensional characters who defy stereotypes; and Michael Connelly's on-the-money description of the City of Los Angeles and the people who live here. It has just enough plot twists (but not too many) to make the ending completely unpredictable, but believable.  (This is an area where Connelly's previous novels suffered a bit.)<br /><br />While I enjoyed \\"The Black Echo\\" and felt that \\"The Black Ice\\" was an excellent read, \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is by far the best of the lot.

B0006MT314|5.0|I love this album tyler hilton and bethany song is my favorite. Every song i love. I  love it it is a awesome soundtrack. The best yet. Can't wait for the new music in the next new season. This one is going to be hard to beat. I love it. Love one tree hill and tyler hilton!
B0002858YS|5.0|A year ago I said that Keane were the biggest band of 2004 in Britain, and I was right. Now I'm saying, a year later, that the biggest band of 2005 in Britain is far and away The Killers. Coldplay have now gone global and Radiohead are still AWOL, leaving new acts to break into the industry. The Killers have succeeded perhaps more than any new act this year. Their debut album, \\"Hot Fuss,\\" was released in June 2004, but despite the hype, didn't really set the charts alight. That all changed in January 2005 when the band re-released one of the album's best songs and began their swift ascent up the charts. Hot Fuss is one of the biggest selling albums of the year shifting well over 1 million copies and propelling the band into the super-elite of multi-million selling acts.<br /><br />On the cover of my copy of Hot Fuss, the UK Independent newspaper is quoted as saying: \\"A classic debut, destined to become one of those unifying albums that everyone plays to death. Five stars.\\" It doesn't really get much better than that, or indeed, true. The album has spent the entire year in the Top 40 and shows no signs of budging! To begin with, I didn't take too well to The Killers. I was bored of the onslaught of new rock bands. You also couldn't escape this band in early 2005. They were everywhere, and I got majorly annoyed! However, over time something clicked and I gave in and bought the album. I haven't looked back. This is truly an amazing album.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine.\\" This song opens with the sound of distant helicopters getting closer, as synths slide up and down and the driving guitar beat crashes in to land. This song just blows you away from the first minute, as a scene is set up in the first verse and explained through the proceeding choruses and verses. I love it where Brandon Flowers sings, \\"I swore I'd never let her go-o!\\" The next song is one of the best on the album. \\"Mr. Brightside\\" opens with a distant guitar and soon explodes into a rock anthem for a generation. This song has such a melancholy feel to it, which teenage boys around the world no doubt relate to immensely. \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" was my favourite song for ages earlier this year. The synths in this song are incredible and so powerful. The arrangements of both vocals and instruments is so simple yet so effective. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is the biggest and most famous song from the album by far. This song crashed into the UK Top 3 earlier this year and became played to death! That's one of the reasons I grew to dislike the band. However, maybe in a few month's time, I can listen to this song more frequently. Don't get me wrong, it's a stunning powerhouse of a track that races along on its driving bass beat like a galloping race horse! Overexposure is usually not very good, though, but one can't deny the brilliance of this song. I can see people pounding their fists in the air for years to come in clubs to this classic.<br /><br />\\"All These Things That I've Done\\" is a superb piece of music and acts as the centrepiece for the whole album, dividing it into halves. The intro this song is amazing and Flowers' classic chant of \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\" is practically anthemic! And come on, who doesn't nod their head furiously when Brandon sings, \\"I need direction to perfection, no no no no?!\\" Maybe that's just me! \\"Andy, You're A Star\\" is a bit of a let down in that it isn't as up to the standard of the first five songs. Brandon sings about Andy, a guy at his school who he is clearly smitten with. The guitars are a bit 'off' for me, though. This one will please the gay fans, though, including me! \\"On Top\\" opens with spiky synths that dazzle and explode as the guitars and drums pound in. This is another brilliant song that deserves more attention, because Brandon's vocals are really stunning in the verses.<br /><br />\\"Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll\\" is another superb song that may take a while to grow on you, but once it does you'll be waving your arms in unison with all your mates. The chorus sways with beautiful rock simplicity, while the voice is just brilliant as usual, dominating the whole song. \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" has been called a filler track by many reviewers, but I definitely don't think so! Okay, this song might not be the strongest on the album but it's not weak. This is a very synth-orientated song, and more dreamy than anything else on the album. I love the way the verses are arranged, because they're very memorable and the synths simply melt your heart as they dance around like neon lights in a night sky. The final minute of the song puts more emphasis on those gorgeous synths, coming right after a funky trumpet section! \\"Midnight Show\\" is a bit of a let down and probably my least favourite song on the album. It just never really grew on me, I'm not sure why. The album closes with the beautiful \\"Everything Will Be Alright.\\" This song is very hazy and foggy, like a cloudy scene with vocals penetrating the mass.

The chorus sways with beautiful rock simplicity, while the voice is just brilliant as usual, dominating the whole song. \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" has been called a filler track by many reviewers, but I definitely don't think so! Okay, this song might not be the strongest on the album but it's not weak. This is a very synth-orientated song, and more dreamy than anything else on the album. I love the way the verses are arranged, because they're very memorable and the synths simply melt your heart as they dance around like neon lights in a night sky. The final minute of the song puts more emphasis on those gorgeous synths, coming right after a funky trumpet section! \\"Midnight Show\\" is a bit of a let down and probably my least favourite song on the album. It just never really grew on me, I'm not sure why. The album closes with the beautiful \\"Everything Will Be Alright.\\" This song is very hazy and foggy, like a cloudy scene with vocals penetrating the mass.

B00003CXCT|1.0|The newer trilogy sucks in every way imaginable. <br /> <br />You will be releasing a $70.00 Original Theatrical Cut Trilogy boxed set in about 10 years from now after you've made as much money as you could on these crappy enhanced boxed sets, won't you? <br /> <br />I sure hope so!
B00005JNTX|4.0|The title of this review, which is an excerpt from the John Hartigan story, embodies its essence; somebody is in need, and somebody else that cares will do whatever he can to help.<br /><br />There's little doubt that Bruce Willis owns Sin City. In his most memorable, most powerful and possibly best performance to date, Willis portrays the character of John Hartigan, a near retirement cop that has one final mission to accomplish. This is probably his most important mission that will define him for better or worse and would change his life forever.<br /><br />John Hartigan and Nancy Callahan's story is the most moving out of three sub-stories that incorporate Sin City. The other two, led by Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen respectively, are quite interesting and more graphic, though their violence is relatively easy to take thanks to the results of the CGI special effects that are used whenever blood is supposed to be present and thus giving the film a somewhat surreal feeling.<br /><br />All in all, it's a wild ride that passes too soon leaving  the viewer anticipating the upcoming sequels.
0316666343|3.0|The first 100 pages or so of this book had me hooked.  What a fresh idea - narration from the grave by a young girl!  But once it turned to the details of her sister growing up, it became tedious and quite cheesy.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This is one of my favorite CD's and made wonderful stocking stuffers last year.  It's ageless and classic.  The teaming of Nora Jones was genius!  I only take away from a 5 star review because of the one with Elton John, didn't enjoy that one.
B000056MOQ|5.0|Musically this DVD is of superb quality. Von Karajan's conducting is - as usual - fantastic; the vocals are strong and without the shrill whine that passes for singing in too many performances these days (why do modern composers feel the need to use choirs composed mainly of squeaky voiced pre teens); the Orchestra is in great form; and the photography is very well done. Catholics will probably have no problem in following the Mass and relating it to the music, but people unfamiliar with the Catholic Eucharist will find themselves lost at time. The written notes on the performance are useless and I suggest that sacred music specialists will find reading Nel's article on Mozart's Coronation Mass much more useful.
B000002KKS|5.0|once Ozzy left the band, not many people were probably expecting Sabbath to drop an album this good. well...surprise! it's not just good, it's great! with Dio on board as the new vocalist, the band sounds revived and Heaven And Hell ranks up there with Black Sabbath's best albums. every single song on here is an absolute standout cut. you can't go wrong with this record if you are fans of Sabbath, Rainbow, or Dio. excellent. highly recommended.
B000A78Z82|5.0|There's plenty that has been said about Devendra's gifts -the praise being quite deserved- yet when it comes to Cripple Crow being some sort of step back in his musical development, I believe its critics are being a bit too harsh.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, all comparisons aside, the material here belongs with and should meet the expectations of those who have been deeply impressed by his prior output. Banhart's mature musical vision is, specially considering how young he is and how adventurous he remains when it comes to writing new songs, nothing less than remarkable.<br /><br />Before I ever heard this album, some people whom I know and respect warned me that I may find it boring or disappointing. Well, that has not been the case for me, you may find Cripple Crow less obscure, more accessible than prior albums but this is not to say that this guy has even come close to \\"selling out\\" or \\"losing his touch.\\"<br />The fact that these songs may hit you immediately or have you under their spell at first listening, should not be a reason to criticize them. After all, \\"accessible\\" should not be an indictment on Banhart, and songs like \\"Now That I Know,\\" \\"I Feel Just Like A Child,\\" or \\"Hey Mama Wolf\\" definitely belong to the same imagination and mischief present in prior albums.<br /><br />If you are looking for proof of breadth -something this album's critics said it lacked- just gather \\"Luna De Margarita,\\" \\"Chinese Children,\\" \\"Korean Dogwood\\" and \\"Little Boys,\\" and you may recognize the kind of adventurous musical range that alternative Folk has not seen since the Incredible String Band.<br /><br />In addition to those, I'd like to mention the few he sings in Spanish. If your definition of Folk transcends the Anglo tradition, you'll find delight on Banhart gift for Latin American melodies, particularly the beautiful \\"Santa Maria De Feira,\\" as well as \\"Luna De Margarita\\" and \\"Quedate Luna.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this is an very good album, and for me, possibly as satisfying in its own right as \\"Ni&ntilde;o Rojo\\" or Rejoicing In The Hands.\\" If you have been floored by this guy creativity and disregard for the safety of prior successes, you may buy it without worries nor hesitation.o\\" or Rejoicing In The Hands.\\" If you have been floored by this guy creativity and disregard for the safety of prior successes, you may buy it without worries nor hesitation.
B000059MEK|3.0|as far as french robotic funk dance music goes, it doesn't get much better than this. the songs \\"One More Time\\" & \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" are so infectious that you can't help but want to dance in a silly robotic sort of way. they are not only good goofy dancefloor anthems, but they are well crafted pop songs. the rest of the album is here and there. i like the haunting 2001 Space Odyssey style electronic moods of \\"Crescendolls\\" and \\"Verdis Quo\\", but there are plenty of songs that just sound like Daft Punk by the numbers such as \\"Digital Love\\", \\"High Life\\", and \\"Too Long.\\" yes...just a bit too long. an appreciation of high cheese factor is needed to properly go along with the flow of this album, but when that flow is there, most of these songs seem pretty unstoppable.

B000002H2Z|4.0|awesome record by The Cure. Head on the Door captures their weird pop stylings and lovely little melodies in a very focused band effort. the song \\"Screw\\" was alsways one of my favorites by them. also contains the classic Cure songs \\"Close To Me\\", \\"Inbetween Days\\", and \\"Kyoto Song.\\"
B00006JDU9|4.0|Though the three new prequels in the Star Wars saga are not as dramatic and involved in storytelling like the original trilogy, the extras features beats any DVD I own.<br /><br />Lucas's reasoning for the incredible number of special effects is to fufill some of his original visions of what the Star Wars universe was supposed to look and feel like.  Unfortunately, I think this desire overshadowed the storytelling which, IMHO, was not as deep and inspiring as the original trilogy.<br /><br />The DVD though is feature-packed and my reason for buying it is specfically for this reason.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Prior to buying Takk I hadn't listened to Sigur Ros in a good year.  Let's face it; the two previous albums (especially the untitled album) were very dramatic and emotionally draining.  The music worked for me when I was feeling down, or a little dramatic.  Times change, and people do too-I did, and in that process I lost my love for a truly spectacular band.<br /><br />With that said, let me tell you about Takk.  This album is softer, sweeter, and quieter.  There is more attention to detail, and less is focused on the noise factor.  The reviewer below me must have not heard their old albums, because this is their most quiet piece of music to date.<br /><br />This is the kind of music you listen to before photographing your children building their first snowman, or you riding the bus on a foggy morning in a rural town to school.  It's an appreciation for the little things, and this comes through in the music as you grow to see that each note is of equal importance to the ones before it.<br /><br />While ( ) and AB before it led is into a dramatic world of Icelandic culture searching for beauty in their simple way of life, Takk shows us the exactly how to get there, and how beautiful it can be.  The sheer subtle beauty within every Icelandic whisper can penetrate even the most jaded of ears.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it higher.  In my 2005 top 5.

B000AL730O|4.0|Paul McCartney proves again that he can make a quality CD if he puts his mind to it and works with a collaborator who can provide creative tension and honest feedback.  I'd give this well-crafted CD 4.5 stars.  It is worth repeated listening and has legs; it should grow on people who have eclectic tastes in music and listen to it without preconceived expectations.  Don't purchase this CD expecting big Wings-like hits or rockers.  Although most of the songs may not be as great as McCartney's best Beatles, Wings, and solo gems, many are quite good, and a number of songs would have fit comfortably with late-period Beatles (imagine if the Beatles had done them!): Promise to You Girl, Fine Line, Jenny Wren, Friends to Go, English Tea.  The well has not yet run dry! <br /> <br />I generally don't purchase music because of the quality of the lyrics (it's frosting for me, so I'm not going to comment on the lyrics), and I don't have high expectations of McCartney's lyrics, though he is capable of a good lyric if he sets his mind to it.  That said, it is refreshing that there is more emotional counterpoint and depth in this album and somewhat darker tonal shadings than the typical McCartney album.  People should expect that McCartney is never going be Dylan or Costello. <br /> <br />Here are my brief comments about each song. <br /> <br />Fine Line.   <br />Catchy verse.  Like McCartney's Beatles songs, this song effortlessly segues between verse, bridge, and chrous.  Shadings of the propulsiveness of Lady Madonna with a dash of I Am the Walrus strings. <br /> <br />How Kind of You <br />Although the melody could be better and although the melody and arrangement are not well-matched in my opinion, especially at the beginning, sonically and texturally, this song covers interesting ground and bears a closer listen. <br /> <br />Jenny Wren <br />McCartney is a master at writing simple intimate acoustic melancholy melodies that effortlessly shift from major to minor keys and back.  I love this kind of music.  It has a nice melody, and it stylistically evokes Blackbird.  The Rocky Raccoon-like ending undercuts the mood somewhat though. <br /> <br />At the Mercy <br />The opening of this well- produced song is unexpected and takes getting used to, a staircase of flats in a minor key.  But as it shifts back and forth from minor to major keys, it gets more interesting, and the song grows on you.  Worth a closer listen. <br /> <br />Friends to Go <br />Friendly, comforting Traveling Wilsbury-esque song evokes the spirit of George Harrison. <br /> <br />English Tea <br />This ditty echoes Martha My Dear but not quite as catchy. <br /> <br />Too Much Rain <br />According to McCartney, a sideways rewrite of Smile.  A good song which moves around a bit and has its moments but doesn't quite jell as a whole for me. <br /> <br />A Certain Softness <br />A soft, slinky Latin-styled, lounge song with touch of jazziness-not for everyone, but pleasant to listen to.  Loved the piano counterpoint. <br /> <br />Riding to Vanity Fair <br />I didn't care much for this melody, but others might find it more interesting to listen to for the lyrics and atmosphere. <br />  <br />Follow Me <br />A pleasant slower tempo relative of Hope of Deliverance.  Sounds as if this song could have been produced by Jeff Lynne. <br /> <br />Promise to You Girl <br />My favorite song of the CD!  A jaunty piano-driven that also would have been a worthy complement to Lady Madonna.  The harmonic bridge recalls Bohemian Rhapsody.  I love the melody and tempo changes, the nice little guitar solo, and Wings-like period bridge. <br /> <br />This Never Happened Before <br />This beautiful \\"silly love song\\" captures the feeling of yearning and love as So Bad did-a new wedding standard?  When the verse segues expansively towards the bridge, a single note gushes with romanticism-wonderful! <br /> <br />Anyway <br />When it works, songs that have different melodic parts pieced together (e.g.,A Day in the Life, Good Vibrations, Suite Judy Blue Eyes, etc.) are special.  I think the different parts of this song would have worked better as separate songs.  Nevertheless, it is still a good song.  I especially enjoyed the quite-hummable cozy folk-country-like refrain. <br /> <br /> <br />Bonus Montage <br /> <br />Track One <br />Nice blusy jam. <br /> <br />Track Two <br />Shows that can write new-age music if he is inclined to.  Brings to mind Heather from Driving Rain. <br /> <br />Track Three <br />To me, the only throwaway, and it probably was.  Like listening to the traffic sounds crossed with electronic doodling.
B000001DYY|4.0|I used to listen to this album in college, nearly 10 (!!!) years ago, and I still like it.  I gave it 4 stars because I think \\"Everybody Loves A Happy Ending\\" is the best album TFF has done to date.  This album has some really good songs, but nothing really mindblowing, and nothing that really sucks either.  Actually, the lyrics for \\"Power\\" are pretty powerful when you think about it.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Tarantino's work or just like's any action, movie see this movie now, see it even if you hate Tarantino or action films anyway it's too good. good acting, good plot, good dialogue (It's dialogue is weird but in a good way), and a funny movie. The movie is good all around. see it now. you will want to see kill bill vol.2 probably right after, buy both movies or rent both movies.
B00000JR2A|5.0|yes, i remember anticipating the release of this album after \\"songs from the big chair\\".

B000AMPZGC|5.0|Danny Elfman is a genius, and now I believe more than ever that he should win an Oscar. The score is so beautiful and haunting!  <br /> <br />Here are the tracks I love and why  <br />1. Main Titles - Well it is a Danny Elfman MAIN TITLES! He's the best at writing titles for soundtracks. The clock part in the middle of the track is a great add on. I now know that the opening tracking sequence will have to do with a clock, which I'm 100 percent happy with   <br /> <br />2. Victor's Piano Solo - I love this track mainly because it was all on piano. Danny's also a genius at the piano, he doesn't really use it a lot in his scores but when it does it's simply amazing. I love the slip up that Victor has at the end... he's so awesome!  <br /> <br />3. Into the Forest - This is like, the third track that Danny's done that has to do with forests. The first would be Into the Woods from The Nightmare Before Christmas, and the second would be from Sleepy Hollow's soundtrack. I love this one because it starts out kind of dark and haunting, but maybe by the middle of the score it goes all out with the choir vocalizing with the crescendo and the creepy and loud score. Brilliant.  <br /> <br />4. Moon Dance - This track is simply brilliant. It's very beautiful... I like it just as much as Ice Dance, another one of Danny's greatest achievements. I'm going to make a playlist with just these two songs and listen to my heart's content. The choir at the beginning of the song isn't horrible either.  <br /> <br />5. Victoria's Escape - I love this track. It's very fast, very bouncy, and just plain awesome. The violins quickly descending at the beginning half of the track are great. I can't wait to see it played out on the big screen!  <br /> <br />6. The Piano Duet - It's basically Tears to Shed put to music. But its simplicity is what makes it so appealing. It's gets more complicated at the last half of the score, and it also gets more beautiful. It's amazing. I also can't wait to see this track put to the background. The end is the best part, where I suppose Victoria does the jazzy bit at the end and starts laughing. Oh man, this film will be great.  <br /> <br /> <br />There are tons of other tracks that I like. I know that if I add more, I'll basically put the whole CD and it'll turn out to be more of a review ... but if it were, I'd give this film an A+
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|I bought the album after hearing Breath Me on the final episode of Six Feet Under.  I was so impressed wth the song I quickly researched the name of the song and artist and purchased the album.  i was surprised taht it was an import so it took a couple of weeks to get the album. When it finally arrived I was not dissapointed.  Although I still feel that Breath Me is the strongest song on the album, there are many others that are excellent as well.  I played the CD in my car for 4 friends and my wife and they all started asking me, 'who is this', 'she's great'!!
0767803434|3.0|But despite that, I have to say I loved this film, and if the ending hadn't kept going on & on, I would have definitely given this movie four stars. It's an amazing film, and I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat, talking (yes, I was) to the TV, saying \\"don't do that\\" and other such nonsense.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm not sure why. Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.<br /><br />My problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.<br /><br />I did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.<br /><br />This soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being \\"too loud and blatty.\\" Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the drawn-out ending, and would most likely watch it again. Gary Oldman still scares me however.te the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the drawn-out ending, and would most likely watch it again.

B0009R1T7M|4.0|Ted Kooser, the poet laureate of America, writes in his book \\"The Poetry Home Repair Manual\\": \\"You'll never be able to make a living writing poems.\\"  Well, I have to agree with Mr. Kooser, as there simply isn't a great demand for poets or poems in the modern day USA.   <br /> <br />But, if one can put their poetry to music, then the sky's the limit.  Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Simon and Garfunkel and many other's found a way to meld poetry and music; now those names and the wealth & fame they generated are legendary.   <br /> <br />Well, it looks like an almost completely unknown artist from Holland, Michigan might be in the running for the title of great American lyricist, and perhaps ten or twenty years from now, the name Sufjan Stevens will be held in the reverent awe that so many of us have for those who proceeded him.   <br /> <br />Sufjan's album \\"Illinois\\" is one of the most refreshing and beautiful albums to come out of the \\"pop/rock\\" category in the past five years.  Of course, if you've been listening to pop/rock these past five years, that ain't saying much.   The secret to this album's amazing sound is that Sufjan is a product of folk music and literature, a surprising and rare combination that we haven't seen in quite some time.  You can also hear a spattering of jazz here and there, especially in the piano, which other reviewers have pointed out reminds them of Vince Guaraldi, as it does myself. <br /> <br />But the sound of this album is definitely of the folk-rock genre (not really \\"pop/rock\\"),  a genre that's been all but dead for the past twenty years or so.  As I listen to Sufjan's \\"Illinois,\\" it brings me back to the late 60's and early 70's, to those wonderful sounds made by people like Cat Stevens, CSN&Y, America, Simon & Garfunkel, The Mamas and the Papas, Janis Joplin, and all the rest that helped bring folk-rock to the front and center of the music industry and American culture.  Sufjan's music is firmly rooted in these old vines, but it's not a rehash of 60's protest music.  There is a freshness, a newness to his sound that makes you believe that a new era is dawning.  Is he as good as the greats from the past?  No, not yet; but then that's a hard crowd to compete against. <br /> <br />Sufjan's breathless voice reminds me of Steve Miller for some odd reason, perhaps it's the mellow approach they both seem to have towards their music.  But the lyrics and the orchestration are way beyond anything I've heard in the past twenty years.  Again, one has to go way, way back in time to find something comparable.  Even more remarkable is the almost home-spun way this album was made: recording in basements, living rooms and churches.  No mega-fancy recording studio here, just very good musicians doing what they love.  <br /> <br />There are a few songs on this album that are real stand-outs, though many songs on the album deserves some sort of recognition.  <br /> <br />The first is \\"John Wayne Gacy,\\" a song about serial killer who raped and murdered thirty young men, then hid them under the floorboards of this home.  When I saw this title on the cover of the CD, I thought it would be some kind of joke, but instead I was caught completely off-guard.   Sufjan uses Gacy as a vehicle to remind us all that we aren't that much better than those we demonize, and goes forth and sings one of the most beautiful and haunting ballads about Gacy that I've ever heard anyone sing about a serial killer.  But this song isn't about some sort of morbid curiosity or goofy melancholy, but an honest examination of our own human condition. <br /> <br />Carl Sandburg made a name for himself with his poem entitled \\"Chicago,\\" Sufjan is poised to do likewise with his song \\"Chicago.\\"  A simple, folksy song that has little to do with the city it's named after, and a lot about making mistakes.  Fun lyrics and some cool orchestration make this tune almost pop-like, but not quite. <br /> <br />Right after \\"Chicago\\" is the curiously titled song \\"Casimir Paulaksi Day.\\"  Again I thought it would be some sort of joke about the Illinois legislature, but instead we have a simple folk ballad about the innocence of young love, and the tragedy of youth ended by cancer.  Sufjan carefully avoids delving into melancholy and remorse, but rather gives us a very powerful, beautiful song that easily flows into the realm of the spiritual.  It's my favorite song of the set.   <br /> <br />Don't do what I did when I first played this album: I had my player set on \\"random\\" and heard the songs out of their intended order.  Upon finding my error, I turned the randomizer off, and listened to the tracks in their proper order-what a difference!  There is a very deliberate and powerful logic to the order of the songs. <br /> <br />Laced into every note on this CD, especially the three songs I liked the best, is something you almost never hear in today's music: humility.  Sufjan is doing his best to tell us about his mistakes, his weaknesses, his struggles.  No ass-kickin' cowboy here: just a guy trying to be honest about himself, and his humanity.    <br /> <br />Yet Illinois isn't the \\"perfect\\" album that so many make it out to be.  There are flaws, there are songs that shouldn't be on this CD.  It, like an overly long novel, needs a good editor.  Yet there is enough meat that one doesn't mind having to kick out an occasional bone or two.  As good as Illinois is, I think there are still better albums yet to come from the mind of Sufjan. <br /> <br />No, this CD isn't for everyone.   It won't \\"rock\\" enough for some young head-bangers, and that's OK.  But for those who appreciate a truly inspired, powerful, beautiful blend of music, there's not much better than \\"Illinois.\\"  <br />
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|I just returned from the Lautrec exhibit at the Art Institue of Chicago.  I was able to purchase the DVD  of the \\"original\\" Moulin Rouge with Jose Ferrer. <br /> <br />After having seen the original drawings the movie only served to bring home what a truly gifted artist Lautrec was. <br /> <br />It is a wonderful film, glorious in color, dancing and spectacle. <br /> <br />Don't short change yourself by watching Nicole Kidman.  Opt for this original film. <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|1.0|Musically speaking, I gave up on Paul a long time ago, so it's no longer surprising nor diappointing whenever he puts out stuff such as Chaos. God,as far as bass, guitar and piano are concerned there's just nothing there. From a guitar standpoint,what I really used to like with the Beatles was their use of more ''unusual'' chords in a lot of their songs (ie;She's so heavy). It was like ''Hey, that sounds cool. I've got to learn to play that!''.In Chaos (as well as almost all of the other Macca solo albums)there's just nothing new or creative anymore. It's a very empty record and if it were recorded by any other ''middle of the road'' artist it wouldn't even receive any attention at all. Sorry, Paul, but I still love you for all the great stuff you did with The Beatles!
B00005LQ04|5.0|I've concluded that Dario Argento can do no wrong (we can forget about about Phantom of the Opera). This movie is great,not flawless, but very good. Suspiria may have finally given Argento the recognition he deserves. <br /> <br />Here's the story in a nutshell: Girl goes to dance school in Germany. Girl witnesses other girl running off into the woods. Girl gets to school next day. Strangness insues. <br />Ok, maybe thats not the best synopsis, but plenty of other reviews can tell you more. <br /> <br />There hasn't been a film like it since. Argento's use of colored lighting is very unique. Some of the best camera angles, and editing I've ever seen. This movie will not disappoint. <br /> <br />Now for the dvd. The 3-disc version is the dvd to get. Its has all the features of the one disc plus Suspiria 25 anniversary Documentary, and the gut wrenching soundtrack by Goblin. <br /> <br />Argento's most well known film. Buy it as soon as possible <br />
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Dylan has always been an elusive subject. Myth and fact cloaking him well on his long journey, and it seems the more we know the more complex the man becomes. <br />In this 3 hour+ documentary Scorsese weaves a wonderful mixture of archival footage and interviews, with Dylan's insightful narrative, creating what is both an exploration of a career and a keen account of the 1960's music scene.  <br />No Direction Home helps explain the fascination with Dylan as visionary poet and prolific musician. <br />Scorsese manages to convey Dylan's impact on the folk/rock/country/blues scene illustrating how his mastery of tradition fueled and informed the progress of the genre. <br />It's a great in-depth look at a long and complicated career and it only covers up to 1966!! <br />And in the process of telling Bob's rich tale Scorsese reveals,  more than a little, of just how the 'star-maker machinery' turns a man into a myth.
B00005JN4H|5.0|This movie was hilarious. I just loved it. With Queen Latifah being one of my favorite actors, this movie was a hit! It was very funny. It was also kind of actiony (SP)? to! A great movie.
B0000CC5CS|4.0|Sarah Conner is dead (R.I.P.) and the Nuclear war never happened, stopped it, didn't they? John Conner is now a recluse living with no possible connection to civilisation, scared of being found again by the Terminator's that believe's will rise again. <br /> <br />T-X looks good naked and she can make her boobs bigger.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I can't believe all of these rave reviews of this movie. To me, I think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I myself have played the Final Fantasy 7 game to death and know who everyone is already. I am a big fan of the game since it has a decent story, but FF7 Advent Children fell way short for me.    The major problem with the movie is it is predictable beyond all reason. The plot was basically a repeat of a dummied down version of the game. The only major difference is there is a virus Geostigma killing those who have Jenova's cells within them, Cloud has a couple of kids, and there isn't a gigantic meteor coming to destroy the world. There were no twists, the plot was extrememly linear and unoriginal. How many movies have the bad guys taking advantage of little children? How many movies have copied fight scenes from The Matrix? How many movies have a bad guy who's sanity is questionable? The answer to that is TOO MANY.     I found it sad about how the movie handled all of the heros. You find out nothing about what happened during the past two years of their life. I guess nothind did since they just popped into the movie to save the day when the big bad monster appeared. I also found it strange how Cloud was still moping over the death of Aerith, and didn't want to fight. The movie gave no explanation why he became such a sissy in the past two years in the first place- no tramatic events, nothing.    If you want the plot here it is- three guys like Sephiroth search for Jenova. They attack the heros. The badies steal several children. Another fight like The Matrix. The bad guys summon a big bad monster which the good guys beat. Then the badies find Jenova's head. Sephiroth comes back to destroy the world and gets beaten by Cloud again. All the people are cured from their virus by magical water and happily ever after.    The only reason to watch this movie is to say that you have. The 3D graphics are good. Some of the visuals were stunning, but then again there was nothing original. You aren't missing out on much.
B0000542DH|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite casts. Woody, Juliette, Rodney, Robert, Toomy Lee Jones and of course the unsurpassed Steven Wright. I enjoyed every moment of this film, especially the acting. Woody Harrelson does a lot of raising hell when he's in jail. <br /> <br />To all those Americans who think it's too violent well that's they way its supose to be so we can teach our kids murder!
0446530891|3.0|OK the plot was implausible, but it kept me entertained on a long flight to a business meeting.   <br /> <br />This was my first read of DB and it certainly was action packed.  I rather liked Sean King, Michelle Maxwell and got a big kick out of Joan, the spider woman!!  <br /> <br />It certainly kept my interest (after acknowledging \\"hope this couldnt be real\\") and surprised me with a couple of twists and turns.  Will certainly try to find the next book which teams Sean and Michelle again as they form their own PI agency.  Hope the plot will be a little more realistic and not for the sake of an improbable wrong. <br />
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|I was there when the first X-Men movie came out and was very pleased with most of the film. Having Patrick Stewart as Professor X was a stroke of genius (though I wouldn't think that anyone else could play the part better). However, I thought that Wolverine was a bit on the mellow side, especially after reading the comic and even the cartoon fox. Thankfully, Bryan Singer gave him his sack back and he is the Wolvie we all came to love.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|I was never one for musicals. But closing in on the big five-o must have given me a new respect for the genre. Introduced by some of the biggest stars of the era, such as James Stewart, Fred Astair, Gene Kelly and a whole lot more, it's wall to wall singing and dancing. Beautiful color and sound. The dance numbers are fantastic, especially the one of Fred dancing on the ceiling and walls and the numbers with Cyd Charisse. Almost every big star you can think of is packed into this magnificent set.   And you'll be amazed at the big non-cgi production numbers that will never be duplicated. By the end of disc one, you'll be glad there's more. One of the best compilations ever to come out on DVD. It'll make you want to take up dancing.
0060012358|5.0|Terry Pratchett at his best.  This is a fantastic story about society, morals, struggles, and talking rats.  No prior storylines or knowledge about the discworld is needed.<br /><br />Only Pratchett could successfully give a clan of rodents and thier amazing cat such detailed and unique personalities.<br /><br />This is great to read to your kid, this is great to read for yourself.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney has always been my favorite artist.  The last few albums were listened to and put on the shelf.  I did enjoy Run Devil Run.  When I bought this cd and first played it in the car, I thought \\"Oh well, another to put on the shelf.\\"  I listened to it again tonight, and oh my, this is a great cd.  I have listened to it three or four times in a row while sitting at the computer.  It's been better each time.  Bravo to Paul for a fine piece of work.
B000008M54|5.0|I find it amusing that somebody would write a one star review for this album because it's not a blues album.  One would think that it would go without saying that an album with a cover photo of a band with accordions and mandolins isn't going to be Lightning Hopkins or Robert Johnson.  Then there is always a little bit of research that could be done before buying it.  Google is your friend. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a remarkable piece of work.  I first bought it (on vinyl, no less) back in the fall of 1988 shortly after its release and wore it out (although I still own that copy) before replacing it on CD circa 1992.  Over the past 17 years I seriously doubt that there has been a month go by when I haven't given this at least 2-3 spins, often more. <br /> <br />This is glorious stuff -- from the opening title track, to the exhilarating closer, \\"The Stolen Child\\" and all points in between (including a glorious cover of Van Morrison's \\"Sweet Thing\\" and luminous \\"And a Bang on the Ear\\") this is music that nourishes the soul and lets the spirit soar.   <br /> <br />It has been said that at any given moment, somewhere in Dublin there is a busker singing a song from this album.  I wouldn't be surprsied.  It really is that good.
0790729644|1.0|Oh, Hollywood, please forgive me for making millions with numerous films that contained blood, gore and revenge. I just needed the money, but now that I'm old I'm sorry.

B000002J03|5.0|Among some other Led Zeppelin cd's i know, this is definetly my favourite. Led Zep 1st was not bad, but it was lacking something that this album has. This cd is filled with essential Zeppelin, as well as contains some slower tracks like \\"Thank You\\" or some experimentation, like psychodelic part in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" or drum solo on \\"Moby Dick. Overall, it's an excellent album, worthy to listen on every moment. <br /> <br />1. Whole Lotta Love - This immortal riff opens the album. One of band's greatest hits. It has anything you want - heavy riff, great vocals, and psychodelic part in the middle spliting the song in two parts. Great. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. What Is And What Should Never Be - Another Zeppelin classic. Starts with a slow, nice jazzy bass, and then comes the strong chorus, and some solos. Very nice one. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Lemon Song - Great Blues cover. Incredible riffs and very cool lyrics, especially \\"Squieze my lemon, till the juice runs down my leg...\\" I like this one a lot. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Thank You - It is a simple nice acoustic piece. Nothing bad overall, but nothing greatest as well. Kinda similar to earlier track \\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\\". 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Heartbreaker - Yet another classic riff, and strong verses. Has a cool guitar improvisation in the middle. Amazing rocker. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />6. Living Loving Maid - It is a continuation of Heartbreaker. Fast, intensive rocking number. 10/10. <br /> <br />7. Ramble On - GREAT song! Especially the drumming in verses is awesome. I can't explain it in words - just listen to it. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Moby Dick - Starting with a strong guitar riff, this song turns into Bonham's solo on drums. What's fantastic that this solo is still being interesting and doesn't make me bored like some other drum solos do. 10/10. <br /> <br />9. Bring It On Home - Great way to finish the album. Blues cover, originally by Willie Dixon, with a rock part in the middle. Another Zeppelin giant. 10/10.<br /> <br />This album ROCKS. Just get it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady has always been a favorite movie. It has character and is fit for viewing for everyone.
6305428387|5.0|Very pleased with the quality of the DVD and the promptness of delivery.
B00006RCOB|4.0|There are no defects in the workmanship of this product.  Many of the older films made prior to DVD and enhanced sound systems, do not generate the quality sound that newer DVD's produce.  I would gather that this is because the older films did not introduce the higher quality sound capabilities when they were made.  Firefox is such an older movie.  I have rated this movie as a 4 star only because of sound quality.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Stephen Chow wrote, directed, and starred in this entertaining adventure, a cinematic ensemble of interesting and unique characters.  I haven't seen a martial arts film this good in a long time.  In my opinion, this was like the movie Grease without the singing and dancing, although there was some dancing.  I picture wedding parties doing the axe-gang dance all over the world.  In fact, I think an axe-gang dance video would be a big seller!  Workout tapes could follow.<br /><br />  From the opening scenes of the movie, where a gang leader takes out his anger and frustration on the local police department, to the rolling of the credits, Stephen Chow and his cast of dedicated actors have put together one of the best comedies ever.<br /><br />  But Kung Fu Hustle is not just a comedy.  It's a story with a message, a message about doing what's right, even if that means you are going to take a few lumps, serious lumps!  And what makes the movie so much fun is that director Stephen Chow knows when to jump back and forth between the serious and the not-so-serious scenes in this movie.<br /><br />  Chow's character, Sing, is best described as a gangster wanna-be who has a long series of failures in this film.  But we never stop wondering exactly what he will screw up next, and when he becomes entangled in a bit of gang warfare, his ridiculous antics rise in their comedic value.  There is a scene where Sing demonstrates his knife throwing ability that had me literally crying I was laughing so hard.  Stephen Chow is a natural on the movie screen.<br /><br />  Some of the clashes between the people of the besieged slum and their attackers are so visually stimulating that I shall never forget them.  When the two harpists come to kill the defenders of the slum, we are witnesses to some amazing cinematic treasures, as the special effects are top-notch.  Famed action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping goes beyond the call of duty in Kung Fu Hustle, working both the realistic approach to fight scene creation and the \\"hey, nobody-could-ever-do-that\\" sequences.  That unique tactic made the film stand apart from almost anything I have ever seen before.<br /><br />  I think Stephen Chow is a genius, and I am going to go rent Shaolin Soccer as soon as possible!  I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle.  It is a great movie!<br /><br />See ya next review!realistic approach to fight scene creation and the \\"hey, nobody-could-ever-do-that\\" sequences.

B0002B15WE|5.0|Easily the best Die Hard movie and a rare victory in this genre for the director and producers. I sat down and cheered Bruce on through this movie which is as rare as Michael Jordan being humble. This is the time of year to whack Die Hard in the old DVD, and listen to the sweet \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" tune.
B00005KB9R|4.0|Rather like the Beatles, Bob Marley's best album is whichever one you happen to be listening to. Burnin' was the second album Bob Marley made for Chris Blackwell's Island label (in conjunction with Tuff Gong), which, like the first, came out in 1973. It's a well named album as it is incendiary from start to finish with both he and Peter Tosh at their most revolutionary. They were at home playing much of the material as they had previously recorded several of the songs in versions produced in recent years by Lee Perry, so the performances were relaxed, assured and deadly, and several feature Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, who were both soon to strike out on their own.<br /><br />Two of the bonus tracks are unreleased out-takes but Reincarnated Souls had been the B-side of Concrete Jungle (lifted from Catch A Fire). This 2001 edition has now been superceded by a 2CD version with the band (without Bunny) recorded live in Leeds on the second disc
0385338686|1.0|I took a chance on this book and was completely let down.  I could have written this in a weekend, it was that predictable and silly.  I knew the entire plot by the time I got to page 20.  The relationships are murky and unresolved. The main character is vapid beyond belief and unbelievable in her stupidity.  She can't operate a washing machine, boil an egg or iron a shirt, yet we're supposed to believe she can swing multi-million dollar deals.   There was ZERO chemistry between Samantha and Nathaniel.  The characters are cardboard cutouts, stereotypical dummies, molded to fit this ridiculous storyline.   I think my IQ actually dropped from reading this.  What a clunker of a book.
B000002KOJ|4.0|By the time of this, her second album, Joni Mitchell was a buzz name. Fairport Convention and Judy Collins had recorded her songs to great effect, and she had appeared on Dick Cavett's talk show, sold out Carnegie Hall and met Bob Dylan on The Johnny Cash Show. She had a huge stockpile of songs, most of which any songwriter would sell their soul to have written. These include Chelsea Morning and Both Sides Now, published in 1967, which have now virtually become standards. The newer material showed new maturity and depth, such as the anti-war anthem The Fiddle And The Drum, and her dissection of a relationship, The Gallery, which gives full reign to her acute perceptions, while her mastery of own accompaniment skills on both guitar and piano excelled.
0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris's book is provocative and thoughtful, and therefore worth reading. However, I believe he misdiagnoses the problem of destructive faith as merely one of traditional religions. He is correct that certain writings and doctrines of traditional religions, if taken literally, and without regard for common moral intuitions, can lead to extreme anti-human actions. In an era where it is easy to get access to destructive weapons, this can be extremely dangerous to a decent world civilization. But the most destructive ideologies of the last 100 years have been those of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. None of these ideologies is based on a belief in God. Harris briefly describes Stalinism and Maoism as constituting \\"a political religion\\" and claims that the Nazis were \\"agents of religion\\" (p. 79 of the book). This is using the term \\"religion\\" in an extremely loose sense as any unquestioning faith that crushes human beings in the service of ideology. Furthermore, I do not think that most religious believers in the world use religion in the way described in the book, although too many do. The real problem is broader than fanatical religion, and is the problem of human attraction to fanatical faiths of any kind.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why-oh-why? Why was a show that was smart, hilarious, action-packed, origional, addicting, and all-around supurb canceled after just nine episodes? Ratings. People didn't not watch Firefly when it first aired on a Friday night time slot because, of course, they were out and about. Fox, clearly unable to see the potential, did move it to a different night or air commercials announcing the VCR or TiVO to these people and suggest they record it for later viewing.    However, now we all have a chance to own all 14 glorious episode on DVD (and we have a movie to boot!) all because of the rave reviews given by so many loyal fans. The fans of Firefly gave off such a strong response to the show that Joss was finally able to get something done with the project. Maybe Fox will become enilghtened to their horrible mistake and pick up the show again. This is definitely a series that you will want to follow.

B000002HO3|5.0|I've waited until now to review it since I last heard it in 1996. First time I heard Simply Red, it was about a minute of Money's Too Tight to Mention on the Rate-A-Record segment on Dick Clark's TV show American Bandstand in the fall of 1985. Nobody paid attention at the time when their album came out.  But it took the walking on the beach feel of Holding Back the Years for people to jump on this band quickly in early 1986, and they just exploded, gold and platinum album sales and hits left and right! Mick Hucknall's soulful singing is and still is wonderful today!  He is that good in clashing R&B and pop sounds within his band.  And I still love his wonderful remake of Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes' If You Don't Know Me By Now from 1989. But they weren't all about remakes; their original songs are great, especially 1992's Stars (which I still hear today), 1989's It's Only Love, some songs from their 1987 album, Fairground.  The band sounds rhythmic and dynamic in the performances, a full, live sound in their songs.  I recommend anybody to get this album, for Simply Red proved their thing in the '80s and early '90s. They're still performing today, 20 years later after their debut!  Talking about this greatest hits brings things full circle now!

0812550757|2.0|Orson Scott Card set a high standard for himself with \\"Ender's Game,\\" and it's hard not to compare \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" with its popular sci-fi predecessor. \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" catches up with Ender Wiggin a few thousand years after he blew away the Buggers. Ender is summoned to Lusitania, a remote colony where humans live a tenuous co-existence with the Piggies, an intelligent life form who inhabit the planet's forests.<br /><br />\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is a story that's difficult to pin down. This could be the novel's strong point, and also its key weakness. Card's wunderkind, now in his 30s, grapples with the guilt of exterminating an alien race. He also struggles to come to terms with his family, a smarmy computer that inhabits his head, and his Lusitanian devotees, who come to worship Mr. Wiggin with galactic aplomb.<br /><br />If you're a dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi fan, you'll probably go ga-ga for \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\"  Those who are less enamored of the genre are better served reading \\"Ender's Game\\" and stopping right there.
0780020685|5.0|This was my introduction to Samurai movies. I was not sure about buying a movie that is over 3 hours long, black and white,and with subtitles. Reading the other reviews convinced me. This is a Great movie. It stands the test of time like all great movies do. Truley a classic. You have to take your time and let the movie unfold at its' own pace. Just sit back and take it all in and enjoy the movie. I was so glad I bought this movie, I ordered three other Kurosawa movies from Amazon.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|L'auberge espagnole is a fun, unpretentious little comedy. It probably holds the most appeal to those of us who have participated in Erasmus or other international exchange programs and can identify. The coming-of-age angst and assorted melodrama are keenly observed and good-humored; it's impossible not to smile, cringe and reminisce when watching it. One caveat - the use of tired national stereotypes (the organized German, the flirty Italian etc.) was a bit unsubtle and unnecessary; but overall I very much enjoyed this movie.
1881273156|5.0|Easily read and easily used, this book is a welcome change of emphasis for couples with or without problems.  The catagorizing of ways of expressing love can give new insight into how we relate to one another.  As a pastoral counselor I find it a helpful and non threatening way to help couples begin to explore their interactions with each other.In addition the material is often applicable to dynamics with parents or with children.  <br />  This book does not pretend to be a total answer to problems, some are obviously in need of more extended therapy; it does however provide a clear, organized, concise method for understanding how we and our spouses not only wish love expressed but also how we best can help our partner to feel loved.

While at first you may wonder what they were doing when they wrote this CD, it later starts to fit together. This CD is sheer brilliance, pure and simple. Buy it today! You won't regreat it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|this album is a must for any radiohead fan. the conveyance of thoughts and feelings through the singers voice and the guitar affects and such are unforgettable and beautiful in their own right. tracks such as \\"exit music\\" and \\"let down\\" are some of hte highlights on the cd. for any music lovers this is a must for its absolute musical depth
B00004LN16|4.0|While some may say this a filler album, I disagree. Sure, it isn't as good as Back In Black, Powerage, Highway To Hell, and other older albums, but this is one of the best albums AC/DC has put out in awhile. That being said, this album is VERY different from the last few. The album is a lot more bluesy than past albums. \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\"(one of AC/DC's best songs EVER!), \\"Meltdown\\", \\"Hold Me Back\\", \\"Safe In New York City\\"(the chorus does get a bit annoying), \\"Satellite Blues\\", and \\"Give It Up\\" are all great songs. If your a casual fan, get the 70s and 80s stuff first, but this is a must have for the hardcore AC/DC fan!
0316096199|5.0|This story is such a sad one, a story so well written you can't put the book down. After reading Lovely Bones I had to see what else this author had written. This one did not disappoint! I loved it and felt sad all at the same time.
B000002KHF|5.0|i had the tape for a number of years and have worn the thing out, i found the CD and purchased it right away. The one song that i have always loved, Into the Mystic sounds even more wonderful on CD, now i can have it forever!
B000AMPZGC|4.0|I just gotta say...I absolutely love the piano solo and duet and wish they were longer!!  This movie and soundtrack are great! Still not quite Nightmare before Christmas...  but dang close.  I love the return to the Edward Scissorhands/Sleepy Hollow sound....can't get enough of that gothic stuff and the jazz is awesome! [...]BUY THIS! You will love it guaranteed!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is a wonderful selection of timeless music and a great addition to any collection! i love Ray Charles and the duets on this CD are absolutly spectacular! there is MPEG included on the CD that is a great tribute and remeberence of the late Ray Charles, I have listened to it numerous times since i recieved it in the mail.
B000A88F22|5.0|I'm really looking foward to getting this DVD w/ the bonus CD. Britney Spears puts \\"reality\\"in Reality TV. This show is really koo. I really enjoyed watching it on upn but I know I'll enjoy it more on the DVD. This show is really differnt from all those other so called reality show. I'm really looking forward to listening to the Chaotic song and the brand new version of the Mona lisa song. It's goona be big!
B000002L9B|5.0|This album sparked the so-called \\"Neo-Soul\\" movement years before it was adopted by other artists. Back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and Prince broke the music back down to its roots. This concept was later used by Tone Tony Toni, Brand New Heavies, and D'Angelo.
0312323859|5.0|I had to immediately purchase this book after I read the last page of \\"Something Borrowed\\"  I didnt think it could be nearly as good, but it exceeded all expectations.  you will not be able to put this one down!
B000A0GYD2|3.0|First let me start by saying this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. I can watch it over and over again. I like this series so much that even though I bought and own the first DVD set, I just had to buy the signature series. The reason I bought the signature series was because it says it is in 16:9 aspect ratio unlike the first set which is conventional 4:3. I thought to myself \\"they must have filmed it in 16:9\\".  <br />When I played the first disc it looked strange. So when I compared the two sets, I saw that the way they got the 16:9 was by zooming into the 4:3 video which essentially lops off some of the top and bottom of the picture. This has disappointed me. When you buy or rent a movie that has been converted from 16:9 there is a message that says, \\"This film has been modified from the original to fit your television\\". Well it would have been nice if this set said, \\"This film has been modified to fit your 16:9 television\\".   <br />I am a victim of clever marketing. I am disappointed that Tom Hanks would let something like this happen with one of his products. He has a fantastic reputation. I am disappointed.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is three syllables, AH-MAZ-ING!  In this beautiful computer graphics animated, action-packed movie, many of the fan favorites from the original Final Fantasy VII game return.  Characters such as Vincent Valentine, Tifa Lockheart, Yuffie, Red XIII, Cloud, and even the most malignant Squaresoft villian of all time, Sephiroth appear in this movie.  The story takes place two years after the Playstation game and the story doesn't necessarily require you to know much about the game (it's easy to pick up on the storyline).  This has probably been the best CG work I have ever seen in a movie.  The graphics will definately blow you away.  Highly recommended, 5 stars!!!!
B0000BWVCM|1.0|Bought only to see Hugh Jackman in something other than  \\"Kate and Leopold\\" and he was just fine -- the only good thing in the movie.  Otherwise, this is a puerile film for violence addicts with little or no entertainment value.  Best for folks under 18 with mentality under 9.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Unlike some people who reviewed here, I was at the shows, and have seen the videos and heard the audios and I know this will be absolutely excellent.  People who are expecting the ferocity of Cream in 1968, don't buy this, they are new and IMPROVED musicans who play differently, AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!  Looking foward to October 24, 25, 26, 2005!!
B000002UD0|3.0|Buying Walls and bridges would be a wise descion, if you are looking for something besides the well-known stuff like imagine.<br />That was some of my reasoning. However, don't really expect to be<br />blown away. It's o.k. there are some good songs. It's Lennon,<br />come on! \\" Old dirt road\\" was pretty good written with Harry Nilsson. \\" Scared\\" O.K. \\"#9 dream\\" pretty well known, good song,<br />it does sound a little dreamy. Also, \\" Nobody loves you\\" had some<br />Good moments.There's a lot of horns on this album. Not really a fan of that. Like, \\" What you got, Surprise Surprise.\\" which were<br />pretty funky, sounding a little like Stevie Wonder. \\" Beef Jerky\\", another funky track, an instrumental. Not bad. Before I heard it here, I heard, \\" Steel and Glass\\" on the Working class hero trubute album by Candlebox. It sounded pretty amazing.<br />Here, not so much.Almost not even like the same song. On the Candlebox version there's a verse that's not included here.<br />[There you stand with<br />Your toilet scent<br />And your mickey duck<br />And your donald f**k]<br />In closing the final track,\\" Ya Ya\\" was pretty pointless, only about a minute. Good to hear for something different.
B0000844MR|5.0|This movie is one of the best films that I can remember as a kid.  When i was young my brother and I would watch this movie religiously, it was our favorite movie.  After watching the new \\"Superbit\\" edition it was amazing.  It felt as if I had never seen it ever before.  The copy that we had was taped off the T.V. and over time had almost discintigrated from over use.  Now it's clear as day!  I'd highly recommend this to parents that will do anything to keep their kids quiet without having to deal with Barney or the Wiggles.  Garenteed to hold their attention and watch over and over... <br />
B00005JGAB|4.0|From the opening notes of punk classic Blitzkrieg Bop, you should know that this was the start of a rock 'n' roll revolution. Among the first punk records ever made, Ramones is a pretty strong effort.<br /><br />The whole thing kicks off quite well with Blitzkrieg Bop, Judy Is a Punk and Beat On the Brat. While their critics may argue all these songs are totally pointless, these are all classics, although they are simple. I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend is a bit stupid, but Chain Saw is great and Sniff Some Glue is dumbly funny. (the entire song is, \\"Now I wanna sniff some glue/now I wanna have something to do/All the kids wanna sniff some glue/all the kids want something to do\\" if you needed any proof.) I Don't Wanna Go to the Basement...yeah. Loudmouth is a perfect example of the dumb fun displayed on this record, as is most the second side in fact (Especially I Don't Wanna Walk Around With You). But Havanah Affair and 53rd and 3rd actually make statements, no matter how small they may be. The next two tunes are mindless filler, but acceptable. It closes with the awesomely-titled Today Your Love Tomorrow the World...I love that title!<br /><br />Perfect for any punk fan.
B000AADYYO|3.0|Don't worry, I will explain my title! just read on!    ************    Hearing Ghost Reveries was an odd thing for me. I was somewhat skeptical about Opeth joining Roadrunner; I also wanted to hear the borderline black metal album that Mikael had promised on the Lamentations DVD because Opeth are at their best when they are at their heaviest. Instead, upon hearing the new album I got the following idea in my head:    Opeth should break up.    Ever since their three masterpieces Blackwater Park, Still Life and My Arms, Your Hearse their sound seems to have been stagnating. Deliverance was a decent album, but somewhat weakened by their attempts to push their songs past the 10 minute mark. Damnation was OK, but compare any of it to \\"Epilogue\\" from My Arms, Your Hearse or \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" from Blackwater Park and it seems like a fairly mediocre exhibit of their softer work.    Then Ghost Reveries appeared. It, even more so than Deliverance, just sounds like Opeth going through the motions of making their sound. It lacks any of the power of their three masterpieces and since it is in basically the exact same style as those albums it is just worse on the whole. The biggest change in their sound since My Arms, Your Hearse has been the addition of more prominent keyboards on Ghost Reveries, but those go unnoticed at best, and sound awkward and out of place at worst. Everything else is pushing the boarders of Opeth's trademark sound without really improving on it or changing it in any way. For a \\"progressive\\" metal band Opeth do not seem to progress that much, even Dark Tranquillity or Soilwork have changed more over the course of their careers than Opeth have.     Besides the keys I only really noticed two other changes: Mikael experimenting more with his clean vocals and the changing of most of the heavy parts to almost wannabee Meshuggah chugging parts (see \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" for a prime example of this). Neither of these are good changes, since Mikael's experimentations are not very interesting and the \\"CHUG *pause* CHUG\\" style riffing is kind of boring. At the end of the album, you basically get 2 minutes of good, heavy Opeth on \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\", 2 nice soft songs in the form of \\"Hours of Wealth\\" and \\"Isolation Years\\" and a somewhat interesting intro to \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" that quickly fades into a boring song after that.    It is sad to see one of the last great Swedish melodeath bands fall into mediocrity - with this album it basically leaves us with just Dark Tranquillity left holding the banner high - but that is what happened. I guess I will stick to enjoying the three masterpieces by these talented Swedes.
B000002KIE|5.0|It's official--the Sex Pistols have tied with Jimi Hendrix for the,\\"Most Consistent Artist Award!\\" This means that all their studio albums were good. Sure, the Pistols only released one album (this one), but that doesn't make them any worse.<br /><br />Yeah, a lot of anger here, but they're actually raging about something MEANINGFUL (the crappy state of England at the time) rather than Green Day or Blink-182 (Who have frickin' commercialized and ruined punk). Anarchy in the U.K, God Save the Queen, EMI, Seventeen and Pretty Vacant would be the winners in my eyes, the best being Anarchy, which was banned along with God Save the Queen, two songs which later became two of the most influential songs in rock history. That's proof that genius is never recgonized during its time.<br /><br />Comparing Green Day to the Sex Pistols is among the Top Ten Dumb Things You Can Say About Music. While Green Day is mindless pop-punk (with the exception of a couple songs), the Sex Pistols influenced punk-rock like Kamakazis - they made one big mark and blew up right afterwards. While the Pistols (and Ramones, come to think of it) are totally awesome, I find Green Day a tad dull myself...
0446677450|1.0|At first reading this book will get the blood boiling of any person who is interested in getting rich. This book appeals to people looking for the 'quick fix' and not people willing to put in the time and the effort into their financial education.  This can be seen by the fact that Kiyosaki does not explain anything to do with finance but rather uses emotion to appeal to the reader.   <br /> <br />The book is particularly dangerous in the hands of teenagers and those at school.  Kiyosaki's dislike of the education system leads him to suggest that education (through traditional forms) is outdated and outmoded because of his bad experiences within the system.  The educational system which Kiyosaki scorns is the reason that some countries advance and other countries are left behind in the dust. <br /> <br />More dangerous than this book is the book Rich Dad's Guide to investing becuase, as well as oversimplifying sometimes complex financial processes, wrong information is often provided.  One example is in the explanation of the use of technical and fundamental investing.  Any first year finance student knows that these are in essence incompatible becuase on assumes that the market is ineffiecient and the other assumes that the market is efficient.  As it cannot be both, investors (and therefore authors) take one side or the other.  Kiyosaki however claims that the two can be combined with the right 'education'.  This sort of information can lead to ordinary people making rash decisions. <br /> <br />I must admit that i was a huge supporter of Robert Kiyosaki however since begining a finance degree im seeing how wrong many of his statements are <br /> <br />As a final note one of the other worries in this book is that Kiyosaki seems to equate happiness with having money and although i would love to be a millionare - there is something wrong with the concept that having a large amount of money would make you happy. <br /> <br />This book is good if you want to get excited and realise that you need to take control of your life however if you want answers to financial problems or to be set on the road to financial freedom other books which provide sound advice may be a better option
B000002P5W|4.0|There are several reviewers who believe that Axis: Bold As Love is the ULTIMATE Jimi Hendrix album. I would argue for Electric Ladyland. Actually, I think that Axis is Jimi's weakest album. It's still good, but has the most filler out of every Hendrix album. How about if we just scrap One Rainy Wish, She's So Fine and Ain't No Telling? Yeah, sounds like a plan to me. And Little Miss Lover isn't quite up to Hendrix's standards.<br /><br />However, this does have some of Jimi's finest moments. In my mind, Castles Made of Sand has the best damn lyrics ever to appear on a Hendrix tune, and that guy could write a song! He also pushed the fusion moment with If 6 Was 9, the Nonconformist's (i.e. people like me) National Anthem. Plus, there's a nice flute solo. And you'd be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful song than Little Wing. The title track is also great, as is Spanish Castle Magic, a metal-seeming track.<br /><br />Though it doesn't compare with Are You Experienced? or the earth-shattering Electric Ladyland, Axis is worthy of the Hendrix name. But watch for some of the weak moments.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|And by you, I do, in fact, mean me.  For the most part.   <br /> <br />I, as I imagine were many of those to buy the re-issue, bought this album at the insistence of Jack White, who just can't say enough good about it (he even wrote the introduction into the linear notes).   <br /> <br />When I first bought the album, I sat there, pondering, thinking of how to describe it to someone.  To try to relate it to a friend, I said \\"You know how Mick Jagger occasionally lets out a bit of a scream when he sings, like at the beginning of 'Sympathy for the Devil'?  Well ... imagine that, except in a hyper-accelerated and constant state.\\"  That is a highly inaccurate way of describing Iggy Stooge, but it at least gives some idea of what he sounds like. <br /> <br />The album is exhausting, in a good way.  From the scream at the beginning of \\"TV Eye\\" to the dolphin noises in \\"Fun House,\\" there's something odd and disctinctive about each track.  \\"LA Blues\\" is literally the musical equivalent of an orgasm.  I don't mean that in the sense that you'll have one while listening to it, but the song goes on and on for something like 4 minutes in just a sound of pure ecstasy, pounding drums, wailing sax, screaming Iggy.  It's all raw, and it works so well. <br /> <br />I've barely scratched the surface on the features of my second disc, but that's mostly just because it's hard to break away from disc 1.  This is an album that you'll pick up and not ever want to put down again.  But share the experience!  Keep in mind the words of Jack White, and once you get done with it, when you put it down, put it on your brother's pillow.  \\"You're it, like in tag.  [Give it to your brother] and run freely.\\"
B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is a real classic I first learned about from parodies on The Carol Burnett Show in the 1970s.  I didn't see the film until some 20 years later, when I found it fascinating.  William Holden (Rachel And The Sranger, The Earthling) plays Joe Gillis, a bankrupt B-movie writer who drives his car into the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard to dodge the repo men.  But the dilapidated place is occupied by two fascinating but weird characters, former silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her butler, balding, german-accented Max (Erich von Stroheim).  Norma hires Joe to ghost-write a screenplay for her come-back, but he soon finds he's as much a kept-man as a writer, enabling more than one of the has-been starlet's delusions.  The characters of both Norma and Max are fascinating enough to keep the movie going, and their relationship turns out to be more than it seems.  The cast includes a very young Jack Webb, actually speaking like a human being, and appearances by Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves.  Carol Burnett made great fun of the role with Harvey Korman in the Max role 2 decades later, but the movie (directed and co-written by Billy Wilder) remains a grand drama, character study, and serious comment on the Hollywood star system.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Seeing On Any Sunday when it was released, was an event of monumental importance for me and my family. My father was a professional Flat track racer in the Midwest for over 45 years, and he only recently retired from racing at the age of 63. I literally grew up with the racers and their families in this film and I had the priviedge of being my dads motorcycle mechanic during each race we were at. I got my AMA mechanics lisence at the age of 16 and this allowed me to be in the \\"PITS\\" with all the racers and their teams. I was the only girl mechanic at that time, and I remember very well waiting in line before the races with Dick Mann on one side of me and Jay Springsteen on the other...... this movie brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. I miss those days so much.... The life of a biker family is a special one and this AWESOME FILM captures all the smells and tastes and feels of the race track and the wonderful people who race and live to enjoy the sport of flat track motorcycle racing. If you love any type of motorcycles, whether just riding or racing, there is no other movie that will ever compare to this original version of \\"ON ANY SUNDAY\\".
B0007GADZO|3.0|Last night I was practicing Tai Chi in the park, listening to Passion and Warfare. It occurred to me that P&W still, however many years after he released it, has that magic about it. <br /> <br />This morning I heard Real Illusions for the first time. I have to say that it is very much a mixed bag. The opening track is pretty neat, but after that there were several tracks which left me thinking either \\"where's that Vai spark?\\" or \\"who stole this guy's balls?\\" The ballad \\"I'm your secrets\\" must be close to the worst thing he's done. I had to stop myself from skipping it on the first listen, and I promise you that I haven't done that with a Steve Vai track before. <br /> <br />Good points: the second half of \\"Lotus Feet\\" is good (although the first half is weak and meandering), and the last track \\"Under it all\\" is excellent, much more like the Steve we know and love. He even gets away with throwing a bunch of strange dialogues over the end. This track shows his real musical self, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Overall, I would have to say \\"iffy\\". Of course it goes without saying that in terms of musical talent, Vai slays anything on the charts or radio, but by his own exalted standards this album is definitely in the bottom half of his collection.
B00081U7HC|5.0|First of all, I compared the 10th and 15th anniversary versions side-by-side and here's what I observed on my 65\\" widescreen HDTV:    1) while the 15th anniversary version claims to be \\"anamorphic widescreeen\\", there is absolutely no difference in the size of the picture onscreen (the 10th anniversary version was also presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, making it \\"anamorphic\\");    2) that said, however, the picture quality of the 15th anniversary version is far superior to the 10th anniversary version, which is marred by dark shadowing and lots of grain - the 15th anniversary version is cleaned-up, with a much brighter picture and virtually devoid of grain or flecks;    3) while the 10th anniversary version was \\"edited for content\\", the 15th anniversary version is the full-length, unedited theatrical version;    4) the 15th anniversary version includes a few bonus extras and bloopers.    The bottom line is, if you're a fan of \\"Pretty Woman\\", a full-length, improved-picture version of the movie makes it a must-have. Get it - if for nothing else, your significant live-in lady will love you for it.

B0009S8H0I|5.0|Every now and then, a truly original, groundbreaking band surfaces amid all the bland pop and rock. Montreal's Arcade Fire is one such band. In their glorious full-length debut \\"Funeral,\\" Arcade Fire spins elaborate art-rock full of passion and atmosphere.<br /><br />Rather than trying to hook you the way most songs do, Arcade Fire builds up their songs to a musical (and emotional) crescendo. The album opens on a four-song cycle called \\"Neighborhood,\\" which deal with daydreams, neglect, fighting in a family, and just sitting around waiting for life to happen to you. All four things are pretty clearly considered disastrous -- don't waste time, make life happen!<br /><br />Certainly that get-off-your-bum-and-make-things-happen attitude carries over to the wild \\"Wake Up,\\" a howling anthem with an ever-evolving beat, and the well-named \\"Rebellion,\\" where Win sings, \\"\\"Sleeping is giving in/no matter what the time is/Sleeping is giving in/so lift those heavy eyelids.\\" You'll be emotionally exhausted when it reaches the wrenching finale, \\"In the Back Seat.\\" And it does all this while making you dance too. There are bonus tracks, including a vivid B-side and a live performance, which are the ones that stand up to the original work. The other two just don't quite gel.<br /><br />Most pop or rock songs are focused on \\"He/she left me/cheated on me and I'm miserable\\" or \\"I'm so in love.\\" Don't expect anything so obvious from the Arcade Fire. These are about living life in general, not just one part of it. Why's it called \\"Funeral\\"? Partly the fear of dying without having accomplished something.<br /><br />Musically, it will make your head spin. There's a blend of post-punk, rock, art-rock, pop, folk, classical, and much more -- like a punkier version of Neutral Milk Hotel or Modest Mouse. Woven together are xylophone, shimmering strings, swirling keyboard, piano, violins, and accordians. And they're all set to epic, crashing art-rock and disco rhythms.<br /><br />And Win Butler is about as laid-back as his music. He can belt out tormented vocals like few can, shout, wail, whimper, and just sing. And his wife Regine offers equally angsty backing vocals. Which is a good thing, because it takes good vocals to do justice to brilliant songwriting like \\"The neighbors can dance in the disco police lights.\\"<br /><br />The Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" is certainly a contender for \\"Best of 2004.\\" At the very least, it's a polished and wrenching debut, and likely to get you off your butt and out living life. If joie de vivre had a sound, this is what it would sound like.ythms.    <br />    <br />And Win Butler is about as laid-back as his music.

B000BHHVPO|5.0|Having watched the Live 8 concerts all day, I can say it isn't just a concert (although it's probably the best concert I have ever seen and I only wish I could have been in London to watch it live). This is a message of peace and ending poverty in Africa. Military force is not the answer. The reason Africa is having problems is because of debt reparations. It is forced to repay its debt to the US and other countries by buying weapons from the US and is not allowed to use any money that the US or other countries have given to Africa to establish schools, hospitals or any other critical, foundation infrastructure the country needs to bring it out of its depression.<br /><br />As far as the concert itself, it was simply stunning. For me, it really didn't get any better than watching U2 and Keane perform. Bono and Tom Chaplin are absolutely stunning performers, feeding off the energy of the crowd to really put power and emotion into their performances. Hopefully, all of the concerts will be produced in their entirety to truly capture the energy and the message of the events.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Often considered the greatest movie musical ever made, Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952, MGM) starts with a witty Betty Comden and Adolph Green script about the advent of sound.  How did it revolutionize the film industry in the late 1920's and for actors who could not talk?  The plight of the latter is immortalized by Jean Hagen, in the performance of a lifetime as Lina Lamont, an actress with a loud and squeaky voice.  As someone says, \\"Lina's a triple threat-she can't sing, she can't dance, and she can't talk.\\" <br /> <br />The movie's three main stars are Gene Kelly as matinee actor Don Lockwood (and the movie's co-choreographer); Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Seldon, the pretty actress Don loves; and Donald O'Connor as best friend Cosmo Brown.  All three are wonderful, and Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown give them fabulous songs to sing:  \\"You Were Meant For Me,\\" \\"All I Do is Dream of You,\\" O'Connor's show-stopping \\"Make `Em Laugh,\\" the title song, \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\", and the overwhelmingly colorful \\"Broadway Melody\\" climax. <br /> <br />The production values here are so colorful and irresistible-cinematography, production design, and costumes just don't get any more beautiful.  The movie is drenched in gorgeous color in every scene.  One could get drunk on this movie's visuals!  How, pray tell, they all three areas lose out on Oscar nomiations the year after AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (1951) swept the awards?  What was the Academy thinking?  Maybe one or two of them won for PARIS.  At least Adrienne Fazan DID get nominated for editing on SINGIN'.  Among the actors, only Hagen got nominated--and should have won the Oscar. <br /> <br />The version of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN that I am reviewing and that you should buy is the 50th anniverary double disk DVD from Warner Home Video.  Disk one has the movie shimmeringly remastered and with a lavish audio commentary by just about everyone still alive in 2002.  Disk two has two magnificent and informative documentaries, one on the Arthur Freed Unit at MGM and one hosted by Reynolds on the making of SINGIN'. Also on disk two are generous original movie excerpts from more than a dozen other MGM musicals that first used SINGIN' songs, and a deleted Debbie Reynolds song that someone had the brains to save in the vaults.  It is a glorious total set--under $25-- and worthy of this greatest of color musicals. <br /> <br /> <br />
0440180295|2.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5 is seen as his best work and a modern classic although, having completed it, I'm left wondering why. Blending science fiction with his memoirs Vonnegut has created a meta-fictional novel where time travel is a primary plot device; one that allows him the freedom to dismiss chronology in the telling of his tale.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran, having been a prisoner of war in a converted abattoir in Dresden. Years after the war he is involved in a plane crash which causes him to become \\"unstuck in time\\"; a strange condition that allows him to travel to any point in his life, or even to the planet Tralfamadore where the aliens that live there view life as a single representation of every moment. Through his frequent travels in time, Billy Pilgrim gets to relive many points of his life such as Dresden, his marriage, and even his death; all of these combine to show Billy's attempt at making sense of the world, his fatalist conclusions permeating the novel.<br /><br />The story of Billy Pilgrim doesn't start until the second chapter, the first, instead, being the author's apology for the novel's mess (although he states you can't make sense of a massacre) and how, in his mind, the book came to be. The prose is minimalist and repetitive. Phrases appear regularly or statements reappear reworded. The use of \\"so it goes\\" whenever something dies, be it a person or bubbles in champagne, is understandable, however, in its need to demonstrate death as something routine and cheap, it does become grating.<br /><br />There are many characters in Slaughterhouse 5 although I don't feel that any of them were given much depth. People appear for a paragraph and then Billy Pilgrim is off on his travels before you have a chance to get to know them. Even Billy failed to hold my attention, possibly because we fail to really get to know him. The author spends time telling us about him rather than showing him doing anything which, I feel, cheapens the experience. His condition, that of being \\"unstuck in time\\", leaves a nice ambiguity about the novel although it's highly probable that his travelling is a delusional passage between memories brought on by the trauma of witnessing the bombing of Dresden.<br /><br />Maybe the book is a product of its time or maybe there's something I'm missing but Slaughterhouse 5 is not a novel I'd recommend. Having no experience of Vonnegut's other work I can't say whether this book, being part memoir, is a typical example of his canon. While the novel is understandably a mess, I can't help but feel that the prose and characterisation are lacking and what, on paper, sounds like a great idea has been put through a literary slaughterhouse.

B0001ZXM54|3.0|I love ZZ Top, but I have to wonder what's going on here.  They just released a far more exhaustive box set, \\"Chrome, Smoke, and BBQ,\\" so why would they release what is basically a condensed version of the same set?  Are they going after the casual fan who maybe doesn't want to shell out $45 for the box set to get \\"Legs\\" and \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" on the same album? Sure seems like it.  Boys, you've been sold out by the record company marketing types.

B000A0GP0Y|3.0|I recently watched The Longest Yard remake with a younger friend of mine, who was unfamiliar with the 1974 version. She ultimately enjoyed it more than I did (although I still thought it was OK), and I'm sure not being influenced by the original didn't hurt her evaluation.  <br /> <br />What probably irked me was that the remake couldn't decide what kind of movie it wanted to be. Yes, there were moments which were faithful to the spirit of the original. Yet, there were other moments that were so ridiculously silly & unnecessary, they come close to killing the dynamic of the movie...purists and non-purists alike will likely cringe at the screen. Parts of The Longest Yard feel like a movie which happens to have Adam Sandler in it, other parts feel like a \\"stereotypical\\" Adam Sandler flick...I mean, for better or worse, just pick one direction and go with it!      <br /> <br />I guess the bottom line is this: if you haven't seen the original, you'll probably give this version of The Longest Yard alot more rope...but if you happen to be a fan of the original, this version is adequate but unspectacular. I recommend renting it first, then afterward you can decide if it's worth buying.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System's greatest cd yet.  11 songs that keep you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout the whole 36:11 wondering what twists and turns are going to happen next.  With \\"Hypnotize\\" coming out November 22, we have a lot to look forward to.<br /><br />1. Soldier Side Intro - 4 stars - Great intro to the cd and for the fans out there that thought this was an intro to B.Y.O.B. think again.  The new cd contains the song \\"Soldier Side\\" which will close out the new cd in dramatic fashion, something to look forward to.<br /><br />2. B.Y.O.B. - 5 stars - What is there to say about this song.  This song practically took the radio and charts by storm.  Great rythym throughout the whole song and the great lyrics that are expected by all the SOAD fans, this is just another one of their masterpieces that they have made over the past 7 years.<br /><br />3. Revenga - 3 1/2 stars - Not the greatest song on the cd, but a good one none the less.  Starts right out of the gates with a very quick beat which leads into a chant which persists throughout basically the whole song.<br /><br />4. Cigaro - 4 1/2 stars - Another great song off the cd that has great lyrics which sounds crazy at first but when you think about them have good meaning,  This song talks about all the big-shots out there that think theyre bigger and badder than everyone else.  Adds impact to this cd<br /><br />5. Radio/Video - 5 stars - A great change coming in the middle of the cd.  A much cleaner song with a very flowing guitar riff which slows down at times and has a great beat.  One of the best songs on the cd.<br /><br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like Im On This Song - 4 stars - The title pretty much says it all about this song.  Crazy.  Crazy Lyrics with an awesome beat make this one an interesting one to listen to.<br /><br />7. Violent Pornography - 4 stars - Good intro to it which follows with a very interesting verse followed by a slow chorus.  Another great song.<br /><br />8. Question! - 5 stars - SOAD's second single released off this cd.  Great song with an awesome guitar part which is a big change going from the heavily distorted guitar to the softer acoustic in parts.  With a great music video to go along with it, this is another one of the greats on this cd.<br /><br />9. Sad Statue - 3 stars - My least favorite song on the cd.  Not horrible but it seems to drag on at times.<br /><br />10. Old School Hollywood - 4 stars - Interesting music which contains an awesome synthesizer which adds an awesome element to this song.<br /><br />11. Lost in Hollywood - 4 /2 stars - Great song to finish off the cd.  Daron sings the entire song as a change and has a very great rythym throughout the whole song.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite System of a Down CD and i cant wait until the new one comes out in a couple months!.

B000001G16|4.0|Fresh off their last two hugely successful albums, Slippery When Wet and New Jersey respectively, Bon Jovi decided to take a much deserved break in the early 1990's. Jon Bon Jovi released his first solo album, Blaze of Glory in 1990, while guitarist Richie Sambora, who co-wrote nearly all of the band's biggest hits, released his first solo album, Stranger In This Town, in 1991. Many times when a guitarist in a successful band, particularly one that plays hard rock, releases a solo album, the music presented is more based on the guitarist's six-string talents rather than the music. However, while there is more guitar here than on the Bon Jovi albums, Richie's solo debut is all about the songs. Stranger In This Town is a strong album containing both the anthems and power ballads that Bon Jovi made famous but also a couple ventures into the blues which are among the best tracks.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Rest In Peace\\", which is essentially a 4-minute intro rather than an actual song. Consisting of keyboards and Richie's moody vocals and guitar work, it works very well despite its length. \\"Church Of Desire\\" is an awesome dramatic hard rocker with a great chorus that is one of the album's best tracks. \\"Stranger In This Town\\" is a killer blues complemented by both the glossy production and Richie's passionate vocals and solos. The album's single, \\"Ballad of Youth\\", is a great hard rocker with a memorable riff while \\"One Light Burning\\" is very melodic and laid-back. \\"Mr. Bluesman\\", another dramatic track that features both Richie and special guest Eric Clapton's tasty solos, is also an awesome track. \\"Rosie\\" and \\"River Of Love\\" are anthems that are decent but aren't as catchy as the ones Richie co-wrote with Jon Bon Jovi. \\"Father Time\\" is a bombastic power ballad that is similar to the ones that Bon Jovi made famous and is also very good. \\"The Answer\\" is a great acoustic tune that closes out the album. While not containing as many hooks and catchy songs as those on Slippery When Wet and New Jersey, Stranger In This Town is a strong album that shows Richie Sambora's exceptional talents as both a songwriter and a musician. Definitely worth picking up.ry When Wet and New Jersey, Stranger In This Town is a strong album that shows Richie Sambora's exceptional talents as both a songwriter and a musician.

B000001GQB|3.0|I can see someone admiring these recordings, since they are very well executed and crisply presented, with no major flaws. And I can see why Mozart was considered one of Karl Bohm's best composers if you like his foursquare, unsmiling approach. Apparently many other listeners and reviewers don't demand more than what this bargain set of the last six symphonies delivers.<br /><br />But Bohm's traditional Teutonic conducting sounds pretty limited to me, not because of the \\"authentic\\" movement now in vogue but because great Mozart conducting must be joyous, light on its feet, and full of wit and alertness. Bohm is brisk and efficient instead. Bruno Walter was born even earlier than Bohm, and yet he got all those things right.  That's why I return to him again and again, not to this set, much as I love the Berlin Phil.
014028009X|2.0|I definitely did not like both books about Bridget Jones. Annoying and boring. Somehow you will feel how hard the author tried to make up something funny, but it turns to be quite overdone. I would recommend Kinsella's books for a fun reading.
B00003CXC7|5.0|The 55-min documentary included is very good.  And also the featurete with the screenwriter.  The restoration works wonders, and makes Grace Kelly the most beautiful human thing to be captured by a lense.  The relationship between the two principals (Kelly and Stewart) was not in the original story, and puts over the table something we knew all along: Hitchcock is not about suspense (not only, at least) but talks about love and intimacy, men and women, sex and marriage.  If this is you first time with \\"Rear Window\\", I can only envy you and say: Enjoy!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is just a beautiful album.  Truly one of the band's best and a great example of pure good and well thought out music.  True, if you are into the top 40 scene, this is not an album for you.  This album is for those that enjoy quality music and composition.  I had read reviews on this album in Rolling Stone some time back and it rated extremely high, my sole purpose for getting it.  After listing to it just once, oh my god.  I was just blown away by it.  It has so many great tunes; Airbag, Let Down, Electioneering, Climbing up the Walls, and Lucky were the ones that stood out for me...but the whole album is excellent.  This is one of the albums that continues to be in my own rotation.  I don't know what these other people are talking about when they post negative about this album, but it is their opinion, such as this one is mine. A well deserved 5 stars for a wonderful album.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|Well, at least the movie is about the need to understand that the US is not alone in the world.  Or something like that.  Whatever.  I paid U$S 1.25 to see this, and is exaclty what is worth. The two stars are because some stunts are OK, and some false-looking CGI is still engaging, and the blonde is hot. and that's it.  The racist instances against white people are only a result of the sub-culture propelled by MTV and other music channels; or maybe the expression of the way of life of a reified lumpen-proletariat.  In any case, is incredible that the subject is considered mainstream.  Like always, black men cannot sleep with white women, and the higher ambition is not to love and be loved but to drive a (very) fast CGI car. Ok.  Next.
B00006RCSU|5.0|THANKS TO THE DAZZLING DIRECTION OF BAZ LUHRMAN AND THE DAZZING GOOD LOOKS OF THE STARS, LEONARDO DI CAPRIO AND CLAIRE DANES, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET IS ONE OF THE COOLEST MOVIES OF THE 90'S.  GREAT VISUALS!  GREAT MUSIC!  HOT CARS!  HOT ACTORS!  THIS MOVIE REDEFINED SHAKESPEARE FOR A WHOLE NEW GENERATION.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Could it be that this battery is actually running right by the Duracell bunny. Somebody listened to the complains of us photographer and really improved the quality of this battery. In the past the Canon batteries got drained quickly, especially by the use of flash, not this one though. I was able to do shoots for days without the need to charge my battery. Well done!
B00005JNTX|5.0|The comics rocked ! So does this movie. The Director does a fine adaptation and makes the movie look like a real comic page turner. This is a must for all those gory lovers. This film is made for the formule of successful films which is...Director + Cast + Sex + Violence + Action = Complete Fun.  <br /> <br />Go Buy It...And enjoy the pleasure of Sin...Sin City.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Looks like some people expected another Gene Wilder.  I'm glad it was nowhere near it. This version was much closer to the book. When you see a Tim Burton movie with Johnny Depp in it, expect anything but a normal, mainstream film. They always were a good pair. While Gene Wilder's version was good, I really enjoyed this one.  Johnny Depp's facial expressions were pretty comical and the other actors were excellent too. Some people just don't get it. Can't wait for the DVD.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This Movie is one of the best that I have ever seen ! Not only was it very sexy...it was also very stylish. All the three members of the cast give their best performances with Sarah Michelle Gellar standing out as the best ! Not only was she amazingly sexy, but she was also very very cool potraying such a negative character with such ease.  <br /> <br />A must buy for every teenager out there. I am sure you all will relate yourself to any one of the characters in this film. <br /> <br />The Collector's Edition Dvd gives you the choice to watch both, the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the Movie.  <br /> <br />A must buy...!!! Seduction...just got a whole lot better !!!

0805079076|5.0|This is one of the most intellectually fascinating books I have ever read. As soon as I started thinking about the design of language, I have wondered how language comes about. Who decided which verbs would be regular and which irregular? Why \\"mice\\" instead of \\"mouses\\"? Even as a child, I wondered \\"Who decides these things?\\" (Admittedly, I was not a typical kid.) Why does our language change? Why is English spelling so goofy? How did the Latin noun case structure evolve? Who invented the Arabic triconsonantal pattern?     By now, many readers have said \\"Huh?\\" and moved on to the next book. But if these are things you've wondered about, this is the perfect book for you, too. Deutscher tries to explain the mysterious processes underlying the development and decay of languages. In his style of writing, he is walking a tightrope; this is a book that is aimed at intellectuals who are not knowledgeable about lingustics. At times he's a bit too cute for his own good, but I will forgive that flaw because it's preferable to being too obtuse. Deutscher's book will never make any bestseller list, but it has made the academic discipline of linguistics accessible to those outside his specialty.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I thought this album was one of the greates albums out there.  It was because of my sister that I first heard about Green Day and I thank her for that.  I have also listened to International Superhits! and thought that was a great album too.  I am one of those people who replace the explicit language (when I am singing) because I don't like saying them.  I'm used to hearing explicit content in other songs (I do listen to System of a Down, you know) but I don't mind.  If you just got into Green Day, I don't know; You just might like this album!
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|Thank God that I did not let my 10 year old watch this film...for it being rated PG13, this movie was very vulgar, to the point of ridiculousness..really!!

B000AL730O|1.0|Disapointment doesn't come close to describing this album.  I should have known better than to take a chance and give it a listen.  I saw all the positive reviews here on Amazon and I thought that maybe it was possible that he'd achieved something the likes of which I haven't heard from him since the Beatles and early Wings.  This album is PAINFUL to listen to.  That he can't write himself out of a paper bag is nothing new.  But the vocals are atrocious as well!  After listening to this album I immediately replayed Let It Be just to remind myself that he used to be able to sing.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|I purchased this DVD for my daughter,who as become devoted fan of Hayao Miyazaki. Yet, it is a joy to view this film with my daughter. Where my daughter and may focus on different aspects of the story and/or characters. We both greatly enjoy the fun, and loving story.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|This album represents the new generation of youth that have been born into the rock the taino indians knew as xaymaca: a generation of youth raised on mtv, bet, the heavy riddims of the dancehall, the musical philosophies of rastafari, and cnn. As a child that was born into a priviledged upper-class family but with a father that well-knew and was personally involved in the ghetto realities so tied to politrics and the post-colonial, post-slavery world, damian marley is in a unique position. He has become to messenger between the haves and the have-nots, a messenger from the pain we feel as jamaicans and as citizens of this world to the listener of the first world. When the cry of \\"out in the streets they call it murder\\" sounds over the speakers, i am afraid something is lost in translation. This is not machismo or bravado. It is not something jamaicans are proud of that our murder rate tops colombia and south africa's. It is a small warning cry as to what hatred, division, and racism can do to a country, and by extention to the community known as mankind. This is Damien marley's message, a message of warning and of hope and of freedom in a dying world. This is not rap. You won't hear about car rims or designer clothes, and other such tangible, corruptible things. This album is illumination to bridge the spiritual and moral gap between what is happing in the post-colonial world and what will inevitably happen in the first. It is a moving story over a moving beat, tied in with the daily concerns of people everywhere. This record is jamaica. It represents what jamaica is in the 20th century in a way and with a beat that all can understand. It is the voice of the baby that is just now emerging from his mother's uterus, and it bawls to be heard.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|You know, there can often be a dissonance between musicians who refer to themselves as \\"artists\\", and the (sometimes) pedestrian product they produce, but this is certainly not the case with The Arcade Fire, as \\"Funeral\\" has considerable artistic merit. It's more than that, of course, the album is amazingly complex and energetic. It is buoyant at times, but, overall, I found it melancholic and reflective-which is in keeping with the title. My favorite tune is \\"Tunnels,\\" the first of the Neighborhood quartet. It's one of the few I recall hearing the first time and falling in love with. Really, you can listen to this one over and over again and never tire of it. If there were a 10 star system in place at Amazon, I would give all 10 to \\"Funeral.\\"<br /><br />By the way, I did some poking around because I don't know a whole lot about this band. I regret narrowly missing them when they came to Chicago, but did find a few bits of information at this site which looks to be under construction:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I'm very excited about \\"Funeral,\\" and I hope they make ten more just as good in the years to come.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|dont mind my pun.  Anywho, I jsut got the soundtrack and I must say it is wonderful.  But just a few little nicks that dont really matter, like how the harpsicord (used alot throughout the movie) is not a victorian instrument, that was a Baroque instrument.  But like I said that doesnt really matter or take away in anyway the quality of this amazing soundtrack.  Besides the piano songs (which every one likes including me, they are my favorite)  But I also love the bonus jazz tracks songs #21-24.  Buy this soundtrack now!!! it is really good!!!!

630514415X|3.0|I love Denzel Washington. I mean, I absolutely adore this man...he never gives a less than credible performance in any role he plays. Once again, he delivers as a less-than-perfect father in \\"He Got Game\\". This is more than a story about basketball - it's about human relationships, the bond between a father and son, and how that prevails even in the worst of circumstances.<br /><br />The story, set in the Coney Island housing projects in Brooklyn, NY (where it was also filmed), surrounds Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel) who has been imprisoned in Attica for the accidental murder of his wife. His son, Jesus (Ray Allen), a high school basketball star who is being hotly pursued to either go into college or sign with the NBA, has nothing but contempt and disgust for his father. If Jake can convince his estranged son to attend a certain university and sign a letter of intent, then his time will be reduced significantly, since this school also happens to be the governor's alma mater.<br /><br />It starts off with a lot of promise, when Jake is allowed out of prison for a week to try to talk to his son. But after a while, the plot starts to wear thin when Jake keeps approaching Jesus, and Jesus is always telling Jake to leave him alone. How long can this be stretched out before you get tired of the whole thing? Okay, you can throw in flashbacks of Jesus as a child and how his father pushed him hard to play ball; a scheming, opportunistic girlfriend (Rosario Dawson); money-hungry friends and relatives; and plenty of tempting offers to either take money, sign with the NBA, go to this college and so forth to thicken the plot. Everyone seems to want something from Jesus, and as a result he has very little trust for anyone around him, and understandably so. But even that tends to get monotonous because you keep hearing the same type of dialogue, only from different characters. But stay with it.<br /><br />This movie does show realistic situations that face talented high-school prospects that can play basketball, so Spike was on point with this. However, it is not the first film that touched upon this subject. There was also \\"Blue Chips\\" that had Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway in it as students/basketball players being heavily recruited for colleges and how they were being paid off, depending on what their decision would be. (At the time this movie was out, both Shaq and Penny were members of the Orlando Magic.)<br /><br />Ray Allen is an NBA basketball player in real life, but he is NO ACTOR, just like Shaq and Penny aren't actors, either. Whatever scenes Allen appeared in were kind of painful to watch because the man just has no skills in that area. He does try, though. And the rest of the cast aren't much better, most notably Milla Jovovich. She plays a grimy and pathetic prostitute who is repeatedly abused by her pimp. I found it difficult to believe that Denzel or any man would find her to be desirable. But then again, Denzel as Jake was just coming out of prison, so...<br /><br />I also disliked the fact that Spike had to throw in so many sex scenes. I normally enjoy Spike's films, but why must he exploit women? He makes them look like they are nothing more than lowlife sexual playthings who are out to use men for what they have. \\"He Got Game\\" runs rampant with this, even casting porn star Heather Hunter in one of many (unnecessary) sex scenes! What the hell?! Although Spike does it on a smaller scale in his other movies, and always has, it didn't bother me as much as it did in this film. It was excessive. I understand the point that Spike was trying to make, but come on - couldn't he leave a little SOMETHING to the imagination?<br /><br />\\"He Got Game\\" is definitely worth watching.

B000AL730O|4.0|Having back to back releases by the Stones and Macca, I find it interesting to see how fans (or music company folk) sell the artists by harking back to the good ol days...i.e. \\"the best since\\"...or \\"if this had been realeased in 1969\\"...forget that.<br /><br />  As it stands, this is a decent cd.  Quiet meloncoly Mac stuff.  I was happily surprised that it lacked the \\"experimentation\\" of previous McCartney only efforts (McCartney, and McCartney II). The songs are nice, memorable after a first listen.  Will they stand the test of time?  Probably not...but enjoy them while they are here.
B000003TAB|4.0|I LOVE THE SONG SLIVER. MOM AND DAD WENT TO A SHOW... DROPPED ME OFF AT GRANDPA JOES. AWESOME MELODY <br />OVERALL A SOLID ALBUM BUT IN-UTERO AND NEVERMIND ARE STILL WHERE ITS AT!
B0000CNY27|5.0|Yes folks this is it, probablly one of the best sci fis ever. Snake Plisken is THE antihero who is a rebel up against a society gone wrong. Everything with this movie is magic. Carpenter captures the setting of a dystopic America perfectly. Lee Van Cleef is good as ever in the role of the modern day sheriff,not to mention Donald Pleasence pretending to speak with an american accent.
B00004XPPK|3.0|The storyline is predictable. However, Rita Hayworth's energy,beauty, and raw sexuality makes this movie a true classic.  Co-staring is the unmatched glamour of age.  Glen Ford does a great job, along with a full cast who delivers a fine performance.  The movie has been remastered brillantly!!!
B0006GQMC8|4.0|My only question about this movie is: What in the world was the reasoning behind the casting of Angie Dickinson? Her appearance is not just extraneous, as was mentioned in a previous review, it was totally unecessary! The only reason had to be because she needed a job. Otherwise, this is a very good movie. Charles Bronson plays his usual strong character, which I always enjoy  and Lee Marvin plays Millen with determination & humor. Glad to see it on DVD.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Almost half a year ago, I got a SMS from my sister. It said; 'Check out this guy called Gavin DeGraw. He's great!' <br />I bought the Chariot Stripped CD, and that's how it all started. I immediately fell in love with his voice. There's something really special about it - it's personal, warm and it really sends shivers down my spine.  <br />The lyrics are amazing and really deep.  <br />This CD is, together with Savage Garden's, the best I've ever heard.
0679446230|5.0|The genius of this novel is that, while the lens primarily focuses on the rise, fall, and recovery of its temperamental hero, the real plot surreptitiously sneaks up and doesn't really take hold until the end.  Achebe doesn't taint his story with his own judgments about people or what happens to them.  He just paints pictures of African tribal life- barns full of yams, the fragility of new life, the mystic but revered Oracle, folk tales that sound nonsensical to a Western sensibility.  Then he tells the story about how things fall apart in such a subtle way that you don't really think about it until you're done.  And you'll never forget.
B0002EXH54|1.0|the remastered version of this megadeth sucks it doesent sound like megadeth at all. I love megadeth but not this one
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|I noticed a lot of people are hostile twoards this movie and I don't see how. It was pretty humorous to me, yes the swearing and some of the jokes did make the movie lose points but hey that's an Adam Sandler comedy for you. If you look past that you can see this movie was pretty humorous and there were actors that kept this movie up. I find the plot overall interesting and the ending I rather enjoyed. It wasn't the same old cliche stuff and I liked that. It isn't the most funniest comedy I know from Sandler, but I thought it was a good one from him.  <br />I know people who have seen the older version of Longest Yard and they said, despite the swearing, it was an actual good remake of it. And from the humor I found from Sandler's version, I may just watch the older version. I give the new version though a good 3.5 stars. <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|A wonderful cinematic interpretation of Frank Miller's series SIN CITY, this movie sinks its fangs right in your heart.  It's a genre movie, one of the very best of its kind, worth having in your personal library.  The fascinating thing about Miller's graphic novel series -- and this movie -- is the way it mirrors the city and county of Los Angeles and all their corruption.  That I grew up there -- and have since learned enough about the politics of water, one of the major reasons for that corruption (for more on which, see Marc Reisner's in-depth tour de force on the subject, CADILLAC DESERT:  THE AMERICAN WEST AND ITS DISAPPEARING WATER [Penguin Books:  1986, ISBN 0014-010432-1];  it's enough to make your hair stand on end, and gives the perfect subtext for SIN CITY) to make me swear I'll never go back there.  Ever -- adds enormously to its power, but non-Angelenos, current or former, will find it just as overwhelming as I have.  Nobody does it better than Frank Miller -- except for the producer, director, and actors who together lifted SIN CITY, the movie, light-years above so much of the other current and past cinematic fare.  If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT.  GO EARLY AND OFTEN.  REALLY.
B00023GGFI|5.0|I bought this LP in 1969. I then toiled for hours teaching myself how to play the lead in Messn with a fool. The technique, tone and style of JW at his peak is still unsurpassed. The music is simple put JW's guitar is a hurricane unleashed. His singing is also excellent. This man is no rock n roll blues afficionado. This man is the real deal.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I am a conservative Republican and disagree with almost everything that Green Day says in their songs.  That being said, I think Green Day has released the most influential album to date.  For their seventh album released, it is unbelievably different from their other albums; they dared to make a change.  With this album they have completely abandoned the pop-punk genre that they created and have created an album that is by itself in a brand-new genre.  The lyrics are possibly the most innovative part of this album; don't ever criticize this album until you know the meanings behind all of these songs.  No band has ever made an entire story on an album like Green Day now has. The lyrics are so powerful and meaningful.  Here is a breakdown of each song.    American Idiot (3/5): Not the most original sounding song on the album, but it is necessary as it sets the tone for the entire album.  Jesus of Suburbia (5/5): I was blown away when I heard this five-part masterpiece.  The transitions to each individual part were so smooth they were almost unnoticeable.  Holiday (5/5): Currently my favorite song in the whole world.  The guitar and drums are amazing, not to mention the powerful lyrics.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams (5/5): Got me hooked on Green Day.  Feels like a second part to Holiday.  Once again, powerful lyrics + powerful music = a great song.  Has a potential to get old if you listen to it too much though.  Are We the Waiting (5/5): Cool drums, lyrics are kind of weird in the chorus, but awesome feeling with many people crying out: \\"Are We the Waiting?\\"  St. Jimmy (4/5): Musically, not the greatest, but the aggressive tone of the song is a great way to introduce St. Jimmy.  Give Me Novacaine (5/5): For some reason, it has a vintage feel to the verse, with an awesome chorus.  She's a Rebel (4/5): Good song, but starts to sound too much like old Green Day.  Extraordinary Girl (2/5): Worst song on the album.  Lyrics are repetitive of She's a Rebel and has a weird Indian intro. Gets points for attempting something musically different, though.  Letterbomb (4/5): Took a while for this song to grow on me, but its alright.  Wake Me Up When September Ends (5/5): This song knocks me off my feet. Unbelievably emotionally powerful lyrics about the death of Billie Joe's father, and yet it ties in perfectly with the American Idiot Storyline.  Homecoming (5/5): This also took a while to grow on me.  While not as good as JOS, it has its highlights with \\"The Death of St. Jimmy\\" and Mike Dirnt showing off his vocal skills in \\"Nobody Likes You\\".  Whatsername (5/5): What a way to close off the record! This song deserves a single. Lyrics leave you hanging, as well as the transition from soft, muted guitars to a powerful chorus with just a dropoff at the end.    This album is unbelievable.  To compare this to a Blink 182 album or a Good Charlotte album or even an older Green Day album is just plain ridiculous.  Beware that if you buy it, you may not be able to listen to anything else for a while. I've had it for over 6 months now, and thats still the case for me. Its that good.

0060254920|5.0|What child hasn't dreamed of being a wild animal, untamed and free? Of having no boundaries or restrictions?     In the magical world of a young boy's imagination, a wonderland can blossom. Sent to bed without supper for misbehaving, the unrepentant and spirited Max lets his imagination soar. His bedroom transformed into an exotic wilderness, Max sets sail across a deep blue sea to where the \\"wild things\\" are.  After taming all of these fearsome monsters (turns out, he's the wildest of them all), the newly crowned \\"king of all wild things\\" leads them on quite a romp....until the lonely boy decides to return to the place where he is loved.     This journey into imagination is wonderful, whimsical and extraordinary. Small wonder that \\"Wild Things\\" was named the Caldecott Medal Winner for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year in 1964. Author/Illustrator Maurice Sendak has created a timeless classic - one which will always be among my personal favorites.     [...]

My library could live without it, but it's nice to have.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I'm definitely not a neophyte fan of Neil, but I bought this anyway.  The track selections are great -- a mixture of the familiar and expected (\\"Southern Man\\") and some real gems like \\"Helpless\\" and \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" than have been fan favorites for years, but were not hits as such.  The liner notes say that the tracks were selected by sales, airplay, and (where known) download stats -- not a bad way to go. <br /> <br />What's nice even for veteran fans is getting all these tracks with clean sound.  Yeah, one of these days we're going to get that giant boxed set with everything he's ever done in sterling sound, if we all live so long.  But for the moment, a lot of his stuff is only available in dubious first-generation CDs, so this is what we've got.  I'd go for it.
0823016285|5.0|I used to rely on a small book crammed with photos called _Unmasking the Human Face_.  Faigin has covered all of that and more.  In the back, there is a sketch guide to the quintessentials of each expression for fast reference.  The main body covers how these look in detail and somewhat varied lighting, discussing which muscles bulge, and how the shape of the eye is effected, and everything else necessary to let you get just the right subtle or dramatic look, that can determine the whole mood of the work.
B0007P3582|1.0|The first thing that anyone reading reviews for this should know is that obviously the 11-year-old kids that listen to this love it. It's even more pathetic when these kids write reviews that try to make it seem as though they know what they are talking about. A \\"hater\\" is what they may call you. <br /> <br />This is only natural however. The mainstream music industry designs their music on what little kids will listen to, with absolutely no regard to musical talent or artistical ability. 50 Cent is the face of such things, and is also the worst of it. <br /> <br />To be frank, 50 Cent is synonymous with garbage, crap, fake, wannabe, pop and many much more unpleasant things. 50 Cent has been getting away with having absolutely NO musical talent whatsoever. If you want to discuss this in terms of rap fans, he has absolutely no skill whatsoever. Kids think this is hip-hop, but the funny thing is that its truly just pop music or candy-rap. Not that I care, but this guy is in no way a gangster, in fact hes probably a model. He was not shot 9 times. No seriously, you actually belive that? Most people dont survive getting shot 1 time, you think he survived 9 shots? Thats a marketing ploy, thats what that is. Don't act like you listen to hip-hop, little kids, you dont even have the slightest grasp on what a real hip-hop artist is and you never will. You'll probably listen to another genre in 2 months anyway. Go buy a KidzBop cassete. <br /> <br />This album is truly just another peice of worthless mainstream garbage. Music is an artform. There is no art in this music. This is just commercial delusion formed by the industry teamed up with some model to make kids think they are listening to rap. It is somewhat surprising that kids dont even slightly realize the eceptionally low quality of what they are hearing, but if they did, they wouldn't care anyways. They dont seem to care that he says the same things in every song. \\" I gotta sick vendetta to get my chedda wit my berretta...and i'm so good, cuz im so hood...i'll take you too the candy shop, you can lick my little lolipop\\"  <br />Somehow people dont find anything wrong with those atrocious lyrics that reappear in every one of his songs. I'm 99% sure that chimpanzees and gorrilas can write better lyrics than that....but then again they can't survive 9 bullets or get they lolipops licked in da canyshop, so I dont see them overtaking 50 in record sales anytime soon. <br /> <br /> <br />Dont buy this crap unless you have the IQ level of roadkill.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|In spite of, or because perhaps because of, the buzz surrounding this film, I put off watching the film until just now.  I am not a fan of \\"independent\\" films in the least, and the subject matter looked pathetic. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, my wife insisted we watch it.  Napoleon Dynamite made me laugh so hard, at times I thought I would pass out.   <br /> <br />This film is a video yearbook of high school for the kids who were not the jocks and cheerleaders.  It is not an uproariously funny film, but is such an accurate portrayal of real high school life, with all of the subversive idiosyncrasies of teenagers.  The characters are vibrant and real.  Even the extras wear their personalities and hearts on their sleeves.  The film is obviously a work of love by the Hess brothers and the town of Preston, Idaho. <br /> <br />Naysayers, take my advice, don't put it off any longer, and buy this DVD.  Keep your low expectations about the film, and just watch it all the way through.  Soon, you too will be working \\"gosh!\\" and \\"decroded\\" into your vocabulary.  Plus, you can watch this film with your adolescent kids, and you'll both enjoy it.
B00005JNTX|4.0|To understand and appreciate this movie you'll need a little background information.  First of all, it's not one story, but a combination of three stories from the graphic novels of the same name, with a short clip from another story as an introduction.<br /><br />The introductory skit, starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, is from \\"The Customer is Always Right\\", the others being \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" \\"The Big Fat Kill\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\".<br /><br />Shot in a way that is as close to the original comics as possible, the movie is in black and white, except for certain highlighted objects in the frames that are vividly colored in stark contrast.  Without significant amounts of nudity, it earns its rating because of the violence which is central to the plots, and boy, does that white blood flow and fly.<br /><br />The movie smells of Tarantino, but he only directs one small, and of course totally weird, bit, the majority being done by Robert Rodriguez, and Frank Miller, author of the novels.<br /><br />Each segment is illuminated by star power such as Jessica Alba (Nancy), Rosario Dawson (great as Gail), Benicio Del Toro (outstanding as Jackie Boy), Michael Clark Duncan (Manute), Carla Gugino (Lucille), Rutger Hauer (Cardinal Roark), Jaime King (Goldie/Wendy), Michael Madsen (brilliant as Bob), Brittany Murphy (Shellie), Clive Owen (Dwight), Mickey Rourke (brilliant as Marv), Elijah Wood (creepy as Kevin) and not forgetting Bruce Willis (Hartigan), in one of his best performances ever.  I also liked Devon Aoki as \\"Miho\\" whose role brought back memories of Kill Bill and the Crazy 88.<br /><br />Without knowing the source, the movie would be a bit confusing, as characters can be seen appearing in all three stories, and after a while, some of the female stars start looking alike.  There's nothing light about this movie, and it may not be for everybody, but the action keeps coming and the blood keeps pumping, and it's hard to look away.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 24, 2005nda Richards, September 24, 2005 <br />
B000BB1MI2|5.0|There is no doubt that Tim Burton has a penchant for things that are eccentric and sometimes plain creepy.  This isn't a bad thing, however -- as he demonstrates in CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, being different can be fun and quite exciting.    For starters, the film has special effects and visuals that anyone would marvel at.  From the opening sequence onward, the viewer is awestruck at the Factory itself, the town below, and the sharp distinction made between these places and Charlie's little house.  The lighting is superb and the music is magnificent, making for a delectable opening sequence.  Grandpa Joe's storytelling then ensues with rich, vibrant colors and amazing scenery.    As the action continues and kids begin finding Wonka's Golden Tickets, we are introduced in turn to the winners (plus parents) and each of their peculiar quirks.  By the time the children end up in the Factory, we are formally introduced to Wonka himself -- a wonderfully odd, zany, and weird character in his own right (played beautifully by Depp).    The Factory tour consumes much of the rest of the film and accounts for a considerable amount of wackiness.  The verdant Candy Meadow, the River of Chocolate (plus the Waterfall!), and many other gorgeous locales await the viewer.  Each has its own peculiarities, but the adventure never stops as the group treks through the Factory, finding excitement and humor around every corner.    At the end of the day, this film radiates with Burton's creative talents.  I agree, however, that it is not for all ages.  Even some adults will be taken aback by the film's eccentricities, so letting really small kids watch it first might be reconsidered.  Keep in mind, however, that the wackiness is the only reason why this might be said -- the film is clean, fresh, and appropriate for children and adults (particularly the young at heart!).      My suggestion:  Let your mind go and relax as you take in the wild world of Willy Wonka.  And, if you have thechance, see this film in IMAX -- the true surround sound and size of the screen make it an unbelievable experience.  Very highly recommended.

When I find a great author I stick with them. <br /> <br />Everyone else has told you about how they liked this story, and what it was about, so I don't need to do that.  <br /> <br />Just know that if you are an avid scifi fan, and you like gritty characters, you will love this book. I just can't get over the concept of transfering your mind from planet to planet and down loading it into a new body. What a fantastic concept! <br /> <br />Good work Mr. Morgan. I look forward to your new works.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Being able to play in both DVD / CD (and SACD) players adds a new dimension to what is already great music from a legendary outfit
B00004YA0T|5.0|The reason that this is the best complete symphony recordings of Bruckner is that conductor Eugene Jochum had a close relationship with Bruckner himself and knew the music like the palm of his hand. despite any negative commentary or the fact the preferred editions are conducted by the eminent Herbert Von Karajan, this box set is by far the best. All the symphonie sound great, polished, romantic, idealized, spiritual, energetic, passionate and mysterious, especially the opening movement of the final 9th, which comes in both versions here. This is a true winner for a recording box set. Your other choice should be Karajan though. But Jochum masters the music with great affinity and brilliant technical musicianship. In this recording, particularly impressive are the 7-9th. The early symphonies are German-Romantic Wagner/Mahler style but entirely Bruckner's individualized style. It is music that is heavy, and not music for a beginner to hear. It is deep, highly emotional, music to meditate by. It's slow-moving, dream-like and powerful, horns and brasses sounding fatalistic at times, while the winds and strings evoking either intensity or quietness. Bruckner himself would love this set. He certainly approved of Jochum conducting.
0312323859|5.0|This was a great follow up to Something Borrowed. I enjoyed this book very much. It was truly reading for pure pleasure. The characters came to life like friends. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to escape from a hectic, high pressure reality to a relaxing read.

B000009PNY|4.0|I mainly bought this cd because of the band Failure being on here. But there also some others on here that I like as well. Never Let Me Down Again is done by the Smashing Pumpkins and it is a standout on here. Enjoy The Silence by Failure was the main reason I bought this and it is an amazing version.Another standout for me was Moster Magnet covering Black Celebration and Deftones covering To Have And To Hold. Overall the album may appeal to people differently but those were the standouts for me being that I am a fan of all of these bands and it was nice to hear their interpretations of these songs.

B000002LQR|5.0|This album is simply amazing. If you've watched the making of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, you would've noticed how much heart and soul the chilli peppers put into this well crafted masterpiece. It started with Rick Rubin who perfected the chilli peppers funk sound and them staying and recording at a haunted hollywood house.. kiedis' lyrics are honest and true and his voice, strong as ever. chad- amazing drumming.. frusciante and flea.. frusciantes diverse funkalicious guitar playing and even with his 12 string acoustic in breaking the girl.. flea- damn good bass playing. all in all, one of the best albums ever.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. It is not a western without the horses, or a soap opera in tights. This movie really keeps you thinking and guessing all the way through. The visual effects are stunning. It is far from a pat formula. See it on as big a screen as you can with the biggest sound system. It is great at yanking the rug out from under you of what you think is real.
0140367357|3.0|I have to admit that I bought this book because I read in an interview with J.K. Rowling that E. Nesbit is one of her favorite authors, and this is Nesbit's most famous book.  Sadly though, Five Children and It doesn't hold a candle to the Harry Potter books.  They're not even worth comparing.   <br /> <br />That said, this is a cute, (very) juvenile book.  The narrator has a pleasant, personable way of addressing the readers. And the book provides an interesting look into the personalities of early 20th cantury Brittish children. <br /> <br />There's little plot, however. The book is more a collection of short stories than a novel, as each chapter tells a different tale, and there is little connection between them. This seem to me to have been a very easy book to write. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book for early readers (first-third grade). Older kids and adults look elsewhere.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Review no. 391. A true piece of demented work by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Just about one of the sickest (but funny) movies I think I've ever seen. One of the factors here were that we can see the strings that gear the flick's marionette puppets. You get used to that rather quickly. A group of anti-terrorist world fighters lure celebrity Gary Johnston to join forces with them to stop future terrorist attacks. They eventually end up battling the notorious North Korea's head dictator Kim Jong II (just this dork's voice alone makes you want to kick him the face). Several twists and unexpected scenes. Without a doubt, the most memorable (or most morbid scene) depending on the way you think was the sex scene between show biz celebrity / performer Gary Johnston (voice by Trey Parker) and fellow Team America agent Lisa (voice by Kristen Miller). Almost surprised they didn't bring in handcuffs, a donkey or the bathroom sink. Also, most of the tunes in this feature pretty much sucked, except for two. Still, 'Team America' is well worth checking out.

0767836324|5.0|I'm surprised (a good surprised) that there are alot more 4 and 5 star ratings on here. Pretty much everyone I've talked to personally, didn't really care for the movie. I loved it! :) It has a different twist to the old time fictional legend that we all grew up with. Where Peter Pan isn't exactly my all time favorite character, I've learned to love this character in this rendition. It has some of the humor and the wonderful fantasy that we all adore...well for me anyway. :) It's a fun movie to watch.
B00005R2IS|5.0|This exciting futurist thriller tells us about a wild bunch permeated and invaded by a genetic wildness, they are the equivalent to a deadly plague, they rape, and demolish everything they want without any drop of scruples.<br /><br />The script gradually will increase of violence level, a couple first, then the best friend of Max and finally in the famous sequence of the merciless attack on his wife and kid. From that moment the thirst of vengeance will assume human form. And the visual sequences of high level physical and visual violence will burn at your eyes. This movie and Straw dogs are to my mind the only two films of this genre worthy of remark through the period 1968-1979.<br /><br />An anthological film from Australia, the great launching of Mel Gibson and George Miller, that reached instantaneously a status level. This is by far, the best sequel of the future saga.

0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is a fantastic and somewhat underrated novel from the pen of the late Mario Puzo. The novel is about the transfer of power within a Mafia Family from one generation to the next. It is at once a celebration of the criminal underworld and a sly critique of this life style that is at first, nearly undetectable, and then comes flooding in full force during the last pages with a chilling irony that is absent from the equally wonderful film version. <br /> Derided as a campy and trashy book (words no doubt flung at other books with risque or outrageous subject matter like \\"Moll Flanders\\", \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\", and even \\"Dracula\\"), it's actually much more literate, and beautifully written in comparison to modern bestsellers, which tend to be geared toward readers who don't really like to read unless the book is done in a breezy, \\"I'm your gal pal\\" conversational tone and revolves around finding Mr. Right or serial killers who enjoy having sex with corpses or whatever. <br /> Next to those quickie reads tailor made to arouse and amuse upper class middle aged American women, \\"The Godfather\\" novel seems even more like classic literature. Indeed, he has been called \\"The Balzac of the Mafia\\", a plaudit well earned, since like Balzac, Puzo was known for his dark wit, as well as criticized for his lack of a traditional (read:flowery) literary style, and a tendancy toward melodrama. Indeed there are echoes of the classic French writer Honore de Balzac's works in the Godfather, for example, in the hateful movie mogul Jack Woltz's breathless tirade during his dinner with slick Mafia lawyer Tom Hagen, in which he lambasts Don Corleone's Godson, fading singing sensation Johny Fontane.  Readers and viewers alike will recall being creeped out by that aged studio head's description of a young female lover he'd trained and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on, because \\"she was the greatest piece of a**\\" he'd ever had, and his rage at Johny's having stolen her from under his nose. That whole rant mirrors an early scene in Balzac's \\"Cousin Bette\\", where Monsier Crevel unsucccessfully tries to convinvce the Baroness Adeline Hulot to have an affair with him, explaining that his  motive is revenge against her husband, the Baron Hulot, for stealing away a mistress from him who's talents he had spent much time and money cultivating. And by the way, that particular book has just about as much (perhaps more) religious hypocrisy, ill fated weddings, treachery, rich historical settings and revenge plots as \\"The Godfather\\" novel itself (and like \\"The Godfather\\", the end of an important wedding celebration marks the end of the story's first act) <br /> And of course the whole idea of splitting the novel into books appears inspired by Russia's OTHER great writer (not Tolstoy) Dostoevsky, and his \\"Brothers Karamazov.\\" Echoes of that great works also resonate through the Godfather's main story, in particular \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\"'s focus on three, rather different brothers and their relationship to their loathsome father.  <br /> Not all of the actual novel made it original movie (about a quarter and a half), that's only because Francis Ford Coppola (naturally) chose only to film the storyline from the years 1945 to 1955, dealing with the brief decline of the Corleone Family in New York and its rise under the leadership of the Don's son and heir apparent, Michael Corleone. Fans of the movie who come to the source expecting the story to be told in a similar linear fashion will be in for a surprise as Puzo will interrupt to the flow of the story with some fascinating background tidbits or chapters (also like Balzac), some of which made it into the Godfather Part 2 (the Robert DeNiro scenes in Little Italy), some of which had no real bearing on the story (like the storylines deadling with Johny Fontane, and Lucy Mancini). It still remains a great read. <br />
B000059H98|2.0|Down below, grinalltheway has this picture nailed pretty well. I loved the original comic version and this should have been a fantastic film but it just ended up being a grand disappointment. I'm never sure who could have played Tank Girl but Lori Petty--too old anyway--absolutely could not play her. Other characters were so-so and the casting overall was amateurish. The directing? Well, this was probably one of the worst directed 25 million dollar movies ever. The film lacks cohesion and, more importantly, vision. One gets the impression that from the first production meeting to the last edit no one involved really knew what a Tank Girl movie should look like. It kills me that half-baked directors get jobs like these. <br /> <br />This film has its fans and that's not to be sniffed at; there are really no other decent \\"bad girlz\\" fantasy/action films out there. Just about any girl action character around now is there for the boys, not the other girlz. As a stopgap for a genre that should have more examples this is fine--there are times when being uncritical about enjoying a third-rate film is OK.

The dangers of sugar to society in general didn't begin recently, it has been around for centuries.  It also a somber warning about current medical practices - prescribe drugs & surgery first, locate the root to the problem, maybe; and a testament to the healing powers of the human body when provided with appropriate nutrition.

B000022TSY|5.0|I just bought the DVD to watch on a new big television when i get around to choosing one.<br /><br />I can remember when the film came out. It was even adverised in Readers Digest.<br /><br />By the time I had bought my first Harley and began to turn on it was the early 70's and the 60's were regarded as a definitive and Golden Time.The film was shown in Dampier in 1972 in a landscape similar to Southern California,.Red  scrubby rocky hills brooding on Time. Stained rivers run through sand.Startling glaring sunshine.<br /><br />So I could relate to the landscape really well, and the tolerant stoned behaviour and the bigotted persecution.<br /><br />The intolerance is noticed because as Hippies you want to make connection and seek recognition and acceptance from all the community.<br /><br /> You have something major to contribute, namely perception free of attachment.<br /><br />Thus you are working on being truly free.<br /><br />The structures in society are not fully based on an authentic rational psychology, they are based on inflationary projection of  influential people usually in a state of denial. The broader societal culture needs to allow individuals to experiment,to get things wrong, to apologise without wanting a pound of flesh. It needs to nurture and us and to maintain authentic nurturing behavioural examples that guide us.<br /><br />It is that insight and the practice of sincere positive sorting out your mind and your actions that makes Free people a threat to<br /><br />any one in Denial.<br /><br /> Control freaks need to control  the culture of society around them in order to maintain their equilibrium.<br /><br />This is one of the messages of the film. In a conservative confomist culture like the USA what are social democratic norms in countries like Australia or Europe were and are seen as a threat to that society's status quo. The National Denial Structure is about to be unravelled. The conceptual reality is about to be changed and they dont seem to have to tools to travel into new ways of perception.<br /><br />Any way would like a cd player on my Triumph so I can listen to the great soundtrack from this film.<br /><br />Technically it may have its faults but overall it got the spirit correct.Also the documentary is invaluable.<br /><br />Peace and go for a long ride man.w ways of perception. <br />Any way would like a cd player on my Triumph so I can listen to the great soundtrack from this film. <br />Technically it may have its faults but overall it got the spirit correct.Also the documentary is invaluable. <br />Peace and go for a long ride man.
B000002I77|5.0|a reviewer here actually said this disc was...boring?!?! Hmmmmm.<br /><br />I still find this to be one of Cobham's best releases. When Jan Hammer and Billy kick off 'Quadrant 4' you know they mean business.  Not only does Cobham have great fusion chops, the man is flat-out funky! He can lay down the fattest grooves. Tommy Bolin scorches on the guitar. So sad he couldn't overcome his subsance abuse and left us much too early. What a talent!<br /><br />Listen to Tommy and Hammer trade riffs in 'Taurian Matador', brilliant! Hammer is leading the charge and Bolin is right there with him, burnin' up the fretboard while Billy lends his usual brilliant support. This disc has remained a personal favorite of mine thru the years. Just a very solid effort from Billy and the boys.  R.I.P Mr. Bolin<br /><br />[...]

B000050FEN|5.0|when i heard saw was a rip off of seven i wondered what is seven? so one day i find it and sure enough it had a real saw vibe on it. but this was way better then saw, the murder scenes were ghastly and sometimes i think were x-rated. the whole movie felt grimy and dank. and sometimes i wondered who was john doe? anyway enough of the idle chit-chat. seven is about two detectives who are on the case of a ingenious killer who finds ways to make his victoms die by the seven deadly signs gluttiny, greed, sloth, lust, envy, pride, and wrath. as they get closer in honning in on the killer they soon realize the killer is approaching them. the one thing i thought could have been better was to give paltrow more screen time. but all in all i think is a scary, great movie thats a perfect night watcher.
0060989157|5.0|I grew up in the 80's when the Crue were big, but I thought  they really kind of sucked, musically.  But at that young age I was naive, it's about the Crue-attitude or Crueditude, Dude, not the music, idiot!   <br /> Years later I get nostalgic and think, dammit, I should have seen the Crue Live. Because after reading \\"The Dirt\\" there is substance behind the fractured noise. Knowing these guys went 200 mph, no brakes, no rear view mirrors, and leaving smoking craters wherever they went for a decade straight without caring for consequences.    <br />  I read the book in 3 days straight and admit it's chocked full of great stories.  10 years of mindless depravity leads these guys into the traps of alcohol, drug and sex addiction.  <br /> The early days of success had to be fun, before Hell took hold.   <br /> Now Tommy and Vince are on reality TV. <br />Tommy is funny because he has no short term memory. <br />Vince looks like a former porn actor, which he was, kind of. <br />  But still,  the Crue would have been fun to see back in the 80's when they were kicking the World's ass,  and I wish the Crue the Best because the Crue had attitude Crue-ditude, dude!
B00005JNQA|4.0|I was unexpectedly surprised by \\"The Interpreter\\".  I had been led to believe that this film was a bit of a pot boiler that should have gone straight to DVD.  In fact, I only saw it by accident when the DVD was left with me.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays an African interpreter from the Republic of Matobo who overhears a threat to the life Matobo's dictator.  She is assigned protection from Sean Penn who plays a federal agent.  The plot is ultimately foiled although not without some close shaves along the way.  Both actors a totally plausible, especially Kidman, who seems relaxed \\"in the skin\\" of a young bookish woman with a background in languages.<br /><br />Much of the film is shot on location both in New York and actually within the United Nations building in Manhattan.  I understand that this is the only time that the U.N. has actually given permission for such filming.  Even Hitchcock's opening scenes for \\"North by Northwest\\" were shot in a studio.  The U.N. location certainly gives the film some added cred.<br /><br />See this film.  It is a real surprise.  Director Sydney Pollack has done his job well.
B00004RFFW|4.0|I love the Lethal Weapon movies, though they get sillier as they progress, and more vulgar. As for a \\"Director's Cut\\", I couldn't tell much difference.  I don't know if that's my fault, or his for selling a flick with little change.  The intro of Leo Getz makes this one funnier as the novelty of Rigg's crazy \\"angst\\" lessens and/or gets tired.

So just listen to the audio samples for some of the tracks. You will then know if this CD is for you.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|As Andy Warhol observed, Bob Dylan didn't want the role of Voice of His Generation.  The more he tried to say, \\"I'm just me.\\" the more his fans would respond, \\"We're just you too.\\"  Assuming the weight of America's collective unconscious is a heavy burden.  He barely lived through it. <br /> <br />  The most telling bit of his comedic genius as a defense mechanism is when he threatens to play his harmonica about ten times during \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" with a complete straight face. <br /> <br />  This cinematic Confession to Father Martin is the ultimate document of rock neorealismo.  After all, art is a lie that reveals the truth--something Bob Dylan has always understood.
068484267X|3.0|This memoir describes Mr McCourt's difficult childhood in Ireland. There are quite a few entertaining and intersting passages but they are far outnumbered by page after page describing the same things.  <br /> <br />Some, but not all, of the topics that are repeated ad nauseum are -  <br /> <br />His father spending the family's dole money on beer, coming home drunk and making the children promise to die for Ireland. <br /> <br />The children having to go down the road to search for coal and turf in order to start a fire. <br /> <br />Masturbation is wrong and young McCourt worries aout going to Hell for it. <br /> <br />The neighborhood lavatory outside the family's door is terribly smelly. <br /> <br />The people in Ireland have strong negative feelings about the English. <br /> <br />The family has very little to eat - often such things as bread soaked in tea, a slice of tomato or a bit of ham. A holiday treat is a pig's head which is embarrising to buy but all that they can afford. <br /> <br />Protestants and unbaptised children will all go to Hell. <br /> <br /> <br />I liked the book through the first half but after that I found myself skimming over pages because they were not saying anything that hadn't already been covered numerous times before. <br />
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Martin Scorsese offers up a brilliant glimpse of genius -- from embryo to toddler to adult.  No Direction Home capsules the early years of Bob Dylan with marvelous stills and precious film clips.  The interviews are so well placed within the archival footage, it flows seamlessly as the era unfolds and we watch the birth, the growth and finally the full-grown genius that is Bob Dylan.  Dylan's conversational comments along with the peers who accompanied him on the journey are perfect in pitch.  This is a long-needed film and well worth the wait.

B000002PC6|5.0|Other reviewers have said it better and in greater detail so I'll keep it short and simple. I've been a life long Olivia fan beginning when her first songs were played mostly on the Country stations then did something unheard of at the time and began to be played on both Country and Pop stations at the same time. I wathced her go from girl-next-door to the sultry vixen in Grease as well as her Physical album...and yes I first owned it when it was an actual vinyl album with a fold out cover-slip and lots of great photos, that's the only downside to this CD, there's not engouh room for all the original cover art the album cover first sported, other than that it's pure Olivia gold.

B000068OCS|5.0|The film can only be appreciated when watched with full concentration--and a little patience for the first 10 minutes or so. But it makes a number of important statements in a powerful use of the medium. For the viewer who is willing and ready, it changes things.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I can't help but notice that now people when people hear My Chemical Romance they think only of the first song \\"Helena.\\" Granted that this is an excellent song, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is more than this. This album is an excellent combination of soft melodies and hard rocking. The songs, though never overdone, perfectly convey emotion and yet are not too \\"emo.\\" The tone of the album is constantly changing and no two songs sound alike. My Chemical Romance is beginning a new wave of music that blends emo, metal-core, and hardcore into a beautifully arranged 40 to 50 minutes of music. Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is certainly worth buying and, after listening, you will be changed for life.
B00000I07R|4.0|This guy just won't go away will he.  Bon Jovi continually puts out good music and finds ways to plese their fans.  \\"Bed Of Roses\\" was the big hit off this album, but the rest of the CD is just as solid.  Should please all fans of Bon Jovi and fans of late 80s-90s rock.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd is incredible.  Kanye West did an amazing job on everything with this cd.  It starts off amazingly with We Don't Care.  The chorus, beat, message, and flow is on point in this song.  Great opener.  Then there is All Falls down, which is another amazing track that I'm sure you have heard.  Following that are Spaceship, Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down, Get Em High, The New Workout Plan, Slow Jamz, and Breath In Breath Out.  Every single one of those songs is incredible.  The beats are all awesome and the lyrics are insane.  Then is School Spirit which is the first decent song on the album.  The album ends with Two Words, Through The Wire, Family Business, and Last Call.  All of those songs have an amazing beat with awesome lyrics to boot.  Overall, I think that Kanye is the best rapper/producer of all time and this cd is a timeless classic.
B00008PX8P|3.0|Before buying DVD's, I always look at the average customer review, and read the first few I see. Everyone seemed to think this was a great DVD, one of the best. While I won't say it was awful, I'll definitely say it's not all it's hyped up to be. The entire first disc is an awful concert (really, it just doesn't sound good, and I think that's pretty important in music). I kind of enjoyed the second disc, but unless you're a die-hard Led Zep fan, don't buy this dvd. It costs too much for one bad disc and one ok disc.

0060558121|5.0|This is the story of the battle over the spiritual soul of America. New Gods are destroying the old. The internet, money and science among others are waging a war on Gods of old. However, who is the instigator in this battle? And what part does ex-con Shadow play?<br /><br />In a world of constantly evolving beliefs and morals, this book stands to try to explain why we as Americans feel pressure to change our spiritual selves. Using Shadow to stand for our evolving society Gaiman shows how we WILL make it out the other side and how the new and old can coexist.<br /><br />With that said, the best parts of this book are the small bits of historical fiction interlaced with the main story that explain how some of the gods came to America in the first place. It has piqued my interest in old religions and an interest that goes beyond a book is the highest acolyte I can give.

That's when I saw this book on Amazon, and along with the first Magnolia book, decided to get them shipped to me.  <br />- I don't cook. Period. I burn pasta (yes, it can be done) therefore, I was a bit nervous about cooking ANYTHING from this book. But, I invited my domestic buddy Kathryn over and, we baked together - and they were DELICIOUS! NEARly as good as the real thing.

0380729407|5.0|\\"Something wicked, this way comes\\". You have to respect an author that is willing to take the title of his book from the master Shakespeare. Furthermore, Bradbury manages to incorporate myriad ideas for young and old into one true feast for the senses. No matter how many times I read this, I am always struck by the poetic manner in which the story is told. <br /> <br />This is the story of Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, and how they outwit the evil carnival and its twisted custodians. Seems like a great idea for a kid's book, yeah? And it is. However, add in thorough discussions on the nature of growing old and the character of good versus evil and what it means to be one or the other, and you have a dissertation worthy of any graduate student. All this is told in Bradbury's characteristic bouncy, playful syntax and is always a consummate pleasure to read. <br /> <br />This is required reading for the imaginative child or the adult looking to reconnect with their youth and the wonder therein. <br />

Classic literature is often difficult to comprehend, and can be quite defunct, but this book takes a clean, solid stand against common stereotypes.

Though old and historic, this timeless treasure will remain in the shelves of classic literature for years to come.

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|When the Sci-Fi Channel first announced back in 2003 that it was producing a miniseries version of the original 1978 TV series \\"Battlestar Galactica\\", I had many doubts about how successful it would be.  However, my doubts were quickly washed away as the miniseries proved to be compelling, engaging, extremely realistic, emotional and well acted.  It also had superb special effects, but a sometimes overlooked aspect is a soundtrack, which in the case of the miniseries proved to be very powerful in setting its dark and tense tone with its haunting, tribal-like drums and other percussion instruments, as well as a very melancholy score with vocals.  Under the superb direction of Michael Rymer, the men who composed this original emotionally charged soundtrack were Richard Gibbs, Bear McCreary and Kevin Kliesch (who was not credited). <br /> <br />Due to the huge success of the 2003 miniseries, the Sci-Fi Channel decided to produce a TV series based upon it.  The first season of the new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" TV series first aired in January, 2005 with 13 episodes and showed itself to be just as exciting and well made as the miniseries thanks in large part to the same casting as the miniseries and the continuation of the same haunting soundtrack under Bear McCreary.  (Richard Gibbs composed music for the second and third episodes of the first season of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\", but moved on to continue composing music for films for both the big screen and made-for-TV.)  Bear McCreary's continued musical compositions have been just as dark, haunting, tribal-like and emotionally powerful as the 2003 miniseries and has contributed directly to make this new, updated version of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" one of the most talked about and successful sci-fi TV series in the past year. <br /> <br />The first season prologue initially sets the dark tone, but the main title with its military-style percussion in the background and emotionally sad melody intensifies the feeling of just howdesperate the small number of surviving humans is in their flight into deep space away from the Cylons.  This pressing need for survival is also felt by Helo's predicament on the surface of Caprica where he believes he is alone with Boomer, and the three musical scores used are quite effective.  Probably my most favorite piece is the symphonic \\"The Shape Of Things To Come\\", which is used when Six is showing Baltar secrets on the surface of Kobol in the final first season episode. It is a curious mix of a cheerful future, but with dark undertones beneath. <br /> <br />I applaud all those responsible for creating such a wonderful and darkly realistic sci-fi TV series as \\"Battlestar Galactica\\". It's success would not have been possible without an incredible soundtrack to help capture the imaginations of the viewers. Hence, I rate the \\"Battlestar Galactica: Season One Soundtrack\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  As a side note, the soundtrack for the show's second season has evolved and is also equally appropriate for the events that occur there.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|If you thought the first soundtrack to the mini-series was good then this goes beyond that. This is just pure sci-fi at its greatness, blending an ethnic vocals over dreamscape and moving music. This really works with the series 1 and in my opinion this is one of the best sci-fi shows that are out that moment, even better than its competitors Stargate SG1/Atlantis. <br />Combining sturring score with a series that has greatness all over it, I'd buy the season 1 also with it, its well worth it.
0761129235|5.0|How often, as children, did we hear in Aesop's fables, (The Tortoise and the Hare) \\"slow but steady wins the race\\"? After reading this book, it seems so obvious!  But don't we always want to rush in, do it all, finish fast and have everything bigger, better, faster, more?  This book clearly shows that not only is the fast way not necessary, but you're just setting yourself up for failure.  The Kaizen Way is like Aesop: The moral of the story is consistent, effective effort leads to success. <br /> <br />This is one of the few self-help books that actually makes sense, because it removes the daunting task of trying to \\"heal it all.\\" It's fantastic book and concept for improving any area of your life, be it career, relationship, physical goals, etc. I think it would be extremely useful for overcoming phobias as well. Building a slow, steady track record of small successes makes everything seem possible-- and practically guarantees long-term success. I love this book, and would gladly pay full retail for a copy. It's worth much more than that.
0062502182|4.0|Almost everyone wonders what their true destiny will be, and this book gives the example of a shepherd boy who finds his. It is not the route that he imagines, but on his journey he learns that fate puts you in the path of those who have something to teach you - and it almost always is not the person you expect. The catch is that you have to be open to that information and be willing to act on it to find which way to go. It is a quick read but will keep you thinking for much longer.

0446678430|1.0|Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book.  <br /> <br />Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books.  <br /> <br />There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. <br />I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way. <br /> <br />The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members.  <br /> <br />I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't. <br /> <br />I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review.  <br /> <br />I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH!
B00009RGBS|5.0|I recently saw the Broadway play Chicago & loved it that I had to see the movie.  The movie was excellent & both the play & movie were as good as each other. Renee Zellweger did a terrific job as Roxie Hart and has a wonderful voice! Every song & dance number are excellent and tell an entertaining story of murder & life in prison. This was one of the best musical movies I've seen!!
B0009PVZWI|4.0|Never owned any previous albums by the Foo Fighters but the single \\"Best of you\\" got me interested. I bought the CD and listened to it continuously whilst on holiday. I'm not a big fan of loud rock but I love it and will now be checking out some of the older stuff. \\"In your Honour\\" is another belting track to have turned up loud. No so keen on disc 2 I guess the Foo Fighters are better the louder they are!!
B000000OAC|5.0|As a HUGE Queen fan, I must say this is one of their best! There's a mix of all different styles, and \\"Meloncholy Blues\\" is one of the best songs I EVER heard! \\"Who Needs You\\" has a fantastic sound and is very uplifting.  <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is one of the harder to find albums, and not recognized for it's merits. Any Queen fan should have a copy, and any music fan should too!!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The OC 2nd Season DVD collection is even better than the first season.  With every single episode and even a bonus features DVD you can watch THE OC all day long
B00005LMBK|4.0|I've never been a hip-hop fan, but upon discovering Gorillaz, I'm willing to change my ways. Though this album (to me) isn't nearly as good as Demon Days, it has some excellent songs and a sound that's a refreshing break from today's bubblegum pop. It's great to dance to, too! <br /> <br /> I believe \\"Clint Eastwood\\" to be one of the best songs ever written or performed, and \\"19-2000\\" isn't bad either!  <br /> Other fantastic songs on this album include \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" (which has some good harmonica sounds to it) and \\"Double Bass\\" which has no lyrics at all. And let's not forget \\"Rock the House\\"!  <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a CD that anyone who is serious about music should try. <br />
0143034901|5.0|It could be said that The Shadow of the Wind is about a mysterious book by a mysterious writer, Julian Carax. But its much more than that.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere, a bookseller's son is brought to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books to choose one book and to make a solemn vow that he will keep it \\"alive.\\" It turns out that this book is almost literally extinct because a man who calls himself, Iain Courbet (a character in THE SHADOW OF THE WIND) is searching for all the books of Julian Carax in order to destroy them.<br /><br />The book is also the means by which we are introduced to the unforgettable cast of characters whose lives Julian Carax affect to an ill-fated end: Antoni Fortuny, Julian's joyless father; the ruthless Don Ricardo Aldaya; the beautiful Penelope Aldaya--Julian's only Love; her faithful governess, Jacinta; the flawed & cruel Inspector Fumero; the noble & tragic Miguel Moliner; the unrequited lover of Julian --- Nuria Monfort.<br /><br />There is a subplot which thankfully-- only subtly parallels Julian's story . . . Daniel Sempere is \\"unsuitably\\" in love with Bea. And Daniel has his own faithful friend in the person of the part bookseller, part spy, part monk, part raconteur and wit, Fermin Romero de Torres. There is also a Montblanc fountain pen owned by Victor Hugo . . . but I will leave you to discover the rest of this love story, thriller, mystery, history lesson, poetry . . . all rolled into one. The language is beautiful, tasty . . . smooth, like butter on cream cheese. The plot, original & compelling & convoluted but in a good way!!! I couldn't put this down.<br /><br />It was with me in every room of my house. I was even reading this while I was cooking . . . so there's a couple of soy sauce stains on it. I will put this copy out on the Book Crossing web site and see how far it goes in this world. It has to be shared with everyone. This book will not go into any CEMETERY! A dozen Stars for the SHADOW OF THE WIND and a couple of galaxies on the side.axies on the side. <br />
B000002J2D|1.0|I heard this after all the glowing reviews above, but it turned out to be super crap. There is no melody, no tune. Just Phil Collins chugging along with his weather beaten voice, just a monotone. I cant understand what Genesis were up to with this album. Compared to We Can't Dance, this album sucks big time. All the songs sound alike and I liked the silence between the songs more than the songs!
B00064AM6C|4.0|I being fairly new to the White Stripes scene, saw them play for the first time on  one of the awards shows which I believe was the MTV music awards 2004. I became interested and intrigued by the two person raw energy rock blast. I found this DVD to be an untamed electric charge of raw  pure white hot plasma, just like the duo who is the White Stripes. For two people they sure make a lot of music. Completely ingrossing and utterly enjoyable. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The only thing I did not like was the fuzzy style camera filter{which personally I do not enjoy}, I would think that having a clear and many angled focus, would have been much better. I'm not saying this fuzzy filter did  not fit the Stripes style, but as a director its a move I would not have made. Minus one star for the cam work.Great music, great show. I like the White Hot Stripes.
6305128952|5.0|Wouldn't have ordered if I didn't like it.  It was a very moving movie with a good strong ending.Acting was top notch.
1932100385|5.0|I found this book to be very enlightening.  The documented research is excellant.  How could we not follow the results if we want to do our best to avoid the dreaded diseases covered?
B00005JNTX|4.0|I thought the movie was terrific on the big screen. Visually, unlike anything I've seen at the movies. On DVD on a TV screen, it loses a bit, but it's still a stunning picture to watch. Very impressive.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I just recieved my dvd set and watched the entire thing. I guess I'm more of a vintage Clapton fan, ironically there is a picture of \\"Blackie\\" on the back cover, and I absolutely LOVED the tone he got from that guitar as opposed to his (new) tone. As far as his line-up I would have liked to have seen other greats such as Van Halen, Walter Trout, and so many others. Joe Walsh always blows me away and he was great on this dvd, and funny too. I have to admit one of the best and tasty performances was by Vince Gill, yeah, the \\"country\\" dude, he tore the neck off that thing and made it look \\"EASY\\" as in no effort. I'm not a big fan of Steve Vai,  I just dont understand notes being played at a million miles per hour with no taste or style or feeling, I saw him live and he was a first class \\"A-hole\\"  very very arrogant. <br />But all in all I think the dvd set was worth the money and I'm glad I bought it. By the way, just found out Clapton has another new album out soon and he IS going back on the road once again.
B00028XE12|5.0|Bobby Hutcherson is one of my alltime favorites, though he's generally relegated to second chair vibist when compared to the likes of 'Hamp and 'Bags.---Never the less, HAPPENINGS stands as one of the master pieces of the Blue Note offerings from the 1960's. <br />    Hutcherson shines both as musician and composer on this disc (he wrote all the tunes with the exception of Maiden Voyage,penned by Herbie Hancock).The range of moods evoked by the compositions is subtley astounding.The uptempo tunes (Aquarian Moon,Rojo and Head Start)swing gracefully and showcase the empathy between the musicians. Hancock's the perfect foil for 'Hutch with Cranshaw and Chambers rounding out a very tasteful rhythm section. <br />   The two ballads(Boquet and When You Are Near) highlight the outing for me.They're both beautifully somber and seemingly very personal in their nature,both for the musicians and the listener. <br />   The disc ends with The Omen,which is an interesting dash into avant gard waters. <br />   All in all, an extremely gratifying album.
1400034779|4.0|What a fun and fabulous book!  I enjoyed this book- light reading, entertaining and fresh.  The main character is a hoot and I loved that she just is what she is and some of her lines are fabulous.  This would be a great BOOK CLUB choice for women who are not too serious and enjoy reading!
B00007G207|5.0|cook some pasta and open a bottle of good wine (Italian)and invite a loved one to watch this truly magical, truly memorable film and they will never forget who it was they saw it with for you will both be moved deeply and it will bind you together.  I love this film.  I think it is perfect.  It is a truly magical movie.
6305278016|4.0|WARNING!! BOGUS WIDESCREEN. First off, yes another vile, evil DVD that claims to be \\"WIDESCREEN\\" but in reality is a lying evil fake. This DVD is another one of many that simply takes the FULLSCREEN version and just slaps black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. YES! Ladies and gentelmen, in this \\"widescreen\\" version you get even LESS picture than the FULLSCREEN version.     Now once you get past that fact, \\"Black Rain\\" is a flawed action/cop flick but with great cinematography. Huge loopholes, flimsy plot points, cop movie cliche after cop movie cliche. But why I love it is because it's the only movie I've seen American, or Japanese that captures the feeling of your first night in Tokyo after flying in (or Osaka as in the case of Black Rain). And Black Rain captures it perfectly. Other more \\"important\\" movies have tried to capture that essence and failed. Tarantino couldn't get it in KILL BILL. LOST IN TRANSLATION...no, I don't think so. And yes the DVD version transfer sucks, c'mon do it right and give us a real DVD.
0143034901|5.0|deeply impressive for a first novel I eagerly await the second. A hymn to the love of books. If a book is a a portal into another world then what is a laberinthyne secret library of forgotten books to a wide eyed child?  I was hooked from page one and ruthessly entertained to exhaustion - I just couldn't put it down. Enjoy!
B00009V8Z9|3.0|Good singer, but the melody is all the same! Change it up a little bit please. If it werent for they lyrics, it would be like listening to the same song over and over again. I love you Gavin, but please dont make your songs sound all the same.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Great action film!  I especially enjoyed seeing Robert Partick as T1000 after getting to know him in The X-Files. DVD extras are really good too. <br />
0893860220|5.0|I Am That is a beautiful book of discussions with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj that prompts one to open their mind and see all things from a different perspective. His philosophy is that the mind and the body are illusory and can be easily disregarded freeing a person from their preoccupations and ultimately freeing yourself of your \\"self.\\" This book should be required reading for the entire human race...
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is a book for all ages, an intelligent book with a protagonist that you cant help but cheering for. The story can get really honest and really desperate for Pi, but in end he comes through. <br />The story also has a twist in the end, which wraps everything together. Read this one before Hollywood butchers it. <br />Classic, a masterpiece
0385504209|3.0|I do believe I am nearly the last person in the reading world to raise this book to my eyes.  I have heard the raves and seen the amazing sales figures. - the hardcover that I was lent is a seventy-something printing.  Enjoying a wild reading ride, I thought for sure I was in for one.  The ride was fun and had some good moments, but for me, anyway, it didn't live up to the hype.  Brown has either very solid sources for the inside scoops of the Christian and Catholic worlds or a very, very vivid imagination, one that works to tie elements together in compelling ways.  I suspect that, in reality, the book is a good combination of the two.  The main characters are enjoyable, the cryptology/symbolism play easy to go along with, and the book-long chase keeps the tension going.  I am sure I am not alone at feeling good about having solved a couple of the `puzzles' before the characters did.  A strong point was the interplay of the characters, the paired relationships and those of the secondary characters, too.  I ended up feeling like I'd had fun in an Indiana Jones sort of way, but didn't feel any great need to read another of Brown's books.  I think I will stick with my usual wild rides, Ludlum and Thomas Perry.
B000066C1N|1.0|The recording of these songs are horrible, especially the end of the song, \\"Here I Am\\" both versrions!
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is a fantastic little movie about a woman and a man in love with each other after one night together nine years ago. It is about the magic of love, about the meaning of life, about the apparent randomness of our lifes. <br />Everything occurs over the 80 minutes they spend together before he has to catch a plane back home. There are no special effects, just the magic of both remembering that night, and testing the water about how getting back together would be. In my opinion, unless you are a hardcore cynic, the ending is completely unambiguous. <br />Absolutely fantastic.
6305537321|3.0|I was very impressed by Audrey Hepburn's Oscar winning performance in Roman Holiday so I was really looking forward to this movie Breakfast at Tiffany's.  <br /> <br />What do I have to report after seeing it? I have to say that it is a mixed bag. Let me explain. <br /> <br />First the positives: Firstly, I have not yet seen a movie in which Audrey was so stylish. If you are into fashion and style that alone is good enough for seeing this movie. Audrey loses some of the innocence and freshness from her Roman Holiday days but gains in sex appeal and glamour. Her wardrobe in this movie is quite stunning. Even the dcor of her apartment looks good. <br /> <br />Secondly, she has a fairly good chemistry with Peppard and the fact that the two are in the same age bracket helps in that regard. <br /> <br />Thirdly, Audrey Hepburn's acting in this movie is superb, she got an Oscar nomination for it. <br /> <br />Fourthly, Moon River the song that Holly (Audrey) sings is great and the tune itself is haunting. <br /> <br />The negatives: The story gets off to a fine start, Audrey plays the part of an escort (a call girl but it the early 60's so that is not what she is called in the movie), Peppard plays the role of a struggling writer who is kept by a rich older woman as her companion. <br /> <br />Now in this movie Holly (Audrey) is the kind of woman who is terrified of relationships, so much so that she does not even name her cat. Her only aim in life is to snare some rich man so when she starts falling in love with Peppard's character she does not know how to react. <br /> <br />What a great start, one would expect the story to race ahead but it exactly here that things come to a grinding stop. It is obvious in the first twenty minutes of the movie that they would fall in love but the next hour or so of the movie does nothing to build on that. It is only in the last ten minutes of the movie that things come to a head. <br /> <br />I think one of the reasons why her first movie Roman Holiday held the viewer's interest throughout it's length despite it's rather flimsy storyline was the character development that her and Gregory Peck's character go through. <br /> <br />In that movie Audrey character (Princess Ann) goes from an immature princess, to a drunk, to a wide-eyed ingnue to woman in love to regal stateswoman. In Breakfast at Tiffany's however Audrey's character is basically the same the entire length of the movie and there is nothing else happening with Peppard's character also to get the movie into fast track. The story chugs along slowly till the end comes. The ending I must say is pretty romantic, but the overall impression that the movie leaves is that Breakfast at Tiffany is average fare nowhere in the same class as Roman Holiday or My Fair Lady. <br /> <br />I would also like to say that Mickey Rooney's depiction of a Japanese man is extremely insensitive. It was the early 60's so maybe society was not so understanding then, but what leaves me sad is that even now there are some people who think that the depiction is funny. I am reminded of the Bruce Lee movie, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story in which the martial arts legend spends a romantic night out with his American wife and they end up seeing Breakfast at Tiffany's. At the end of the movie Bruce Lee is hurt and angry that Hollywood still did not treat Asian people with respect. Poor Bruce Lee, he should have known that some things never change. In this world bigotry is never out of fashion. <br /> <br />It would be fair to point out that Mickey Rooney's role is pretty minor so if you can shut your eyes to it this movie still has a lot to offer. <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is by far the best singer I've heard in a while! Anyone who hasn't heard this guy MUST listen. It is so surprising for a man of such a young age to be singing this type of music, it's refreshing! What a talent!! I just wish he would publish the English translation to the songs he sings with such passion.
0393312836|5.0|This is a great book, except for the raping, that could have been left out.  But all other parts of the book I loved!!!!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|There is a certain ignorance that takes up much of the output on amazon's review, mainly due no doubt to humouress satires that place these people in true ironic Alan Partridge stylings, but there is also a prominent dose of true ignorance, which is incredibly frustrating. This is a beautiful album which melds todays vibrant energy with The Flaming Lips ability to write truly great pop songs. Anybody who claims some type of musical prowess purely because they own a guitar and can play three chords are obviously so short of the intellect that they parade around that it makes such statements on the nature of pro tools or todays recording practices to be the height of absurdity.<br /><br />The entire album is a grower, no doubt, but soon it will take up place alongside The Soft Bulletin or any number of modern ambient pop classics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, 'reality' tv goes on cranking out new eps, and a production capable of consistently reminding us all that there's actually an art to storytelling has become so foreign a notion that it goes unrecognized by the money-obsessed parasites who have charged themselves, by virtue of their command of large sums of money, with the task of selecting what gets made and what does not.  The merits of skill and craft fall on the deeply stupid, they concern themselves only with whether or not it'll make money.  And sometimes, even when characters and their stories capture the attention of millions, when there is no doubt left to any person who is not deeply stupid that this sort of thing is garanteed to find a large audience, it still gets cast aside, like a chimp tossing the world's first Happy Remote away cuz it had too many shiny buttons... <br /> <br />Hope the film gets this series back on the air - I'm still holding out some hope for at least a solid 100-hour story arc...  Thanks Joss and friends.
074322454X|5.0|I love the books of Stephen Ambrose.  To me, nobody has written better books about the lives of the combat/civilian soldier in World War II.  I've read D-Day and Citizen Soldiers.  But, the focus of attention to the men of E company in the 101st Airborne may well be Ambrose's crowning achievement.<br /><br />Ambrose through interviews of the veterans of E Company provides a look of a group of men who were trained to be America's best.  And they were, argueably, America's best.  From the \\"chicken sh*t\\" tyranny of Captain Herbert Sobel during their training to their taking of Hitler's Eagle's Nest, Ambrose proves why they were the best combat soldiers in World War II.<br /><br />Sobel was a little man who enjoyed persecuting his recruits.  But, ironically, Richard Winters states, \\"Herbert Sobel made E Company!\\"  These men fought against impossible odds, using every trick (and some made up) that they could think of to fight against the world's best army.  Whenever they were ordered to take a town, dig in and hold off a superior German force at Bastogne, or capture German soldiers for the purpose of extracting information, the men of E Company succeeded at every turn.<br /><br />But despite the rigorous training and difficult missions, Ambrose points out the one thing that kept this company of men together without giving up, without giving in to the pain and freezing nights in the middle of the forest, without going AWOL, was each other.  These men shared an unconditional love for each other.  It wasn't about themselves.  It was about the men they served with.  They refused to leave their small \\"band of brothers.\\"  Even those that were wounded and had every reason to go home, chose instead, to return to E company to fight alongside their brothers.<br /><br />Ambrose wraps up this book nicely by letting the reader know where these men are today and what they have been doing.<br /><br />Ambrose once wrote that there is no stronger bond in the world than that of men serving in combat together.  This book more than proves his statement.t of men serving in combat together.  This book more than proves his statement.
B00000JXAK|5.0|I totally agree with the reviewer from PA, that the guitar playing on this is exceptionally good, but even the other musicians are incredible too. The drummer plays some drum parts that are amazing, it has great piano, and I also agree that they do indeed sound like Fairport with Sandy Denny, but not all of the songs. They're quite different because of the sound of the lead guitarist's playing, which can be pretty heavy and  even \\"psychedelic\\" on several songs, and last but not least, Celia Humphris has a beautiful voice, and if anybody even comes close to sounding like Sandy Denny, it's Celia, she just has a great and wonderful voice. Every song on this CD is excellent, but there's some that stand out from the others. Any fan of British folk rock should hear this and add it to your collection, you can't go wrong, and you certainly won't be disappointed, this was a great group, with great musicians, and a fantastic female singer. Glenn Signal Hill,CA USA
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Deserves seven or eight stars! <br /> <br />Peyroux has an old-style voice but the music isn't altogether old-style itself.  That is what makes this CD so incredibly lovely.  It is mellow, it is soulful, it is full-flavored, it is anything you might want from a really good, unique and well-rounded CD.  If you aren't familiar with French Jazz, this is a great CD to get started with.  You will not grow tired of it.  Try it.  You really cannot go wrong with this one.
B000002U82|5.0|I love this album. Pink floyd is one of the greatest bands ever. This album wasone of there best besides wish you were here. But if you don't like this album and you see a bunch of reviews that give this album 5 stars then don't give your opinion. No one's gonna listen. Look if your looking for some good classic rock albums, start out with this one. It's just one of there best. thats all i haved to say.
0307276902|1.0|What is this fascination Americans have with these idiots who do drugs for a decade, go into rehab and then write about it. Human weakness is a given, I guess, but I'm tired of these books in many ways. First, no ones seems to learn a damn lesson. If he had courage, if he was SMART, he would've never fallen into the trap of drugs and alcohol. Life is a string of causes and effects, and EVERYONE knows what happens with drugs. Sure, there are \\"social\\" drug users, but like \\"social\\" drinkers, they do it to fit in. They UNDERSTAND what can happen if you let it swallow you up. While the rehabilitated memior -from rock stars to actors to uber rich kids of the Hamptons socialites - is a college industry, I'm finally had my fill of these people who should know better. There is nothing to read here. Move along.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" was one of those rare TV shows that made people think as well as care. Its heroes are outlaws, living on the outskirts of an oppressive interstellar society. Joss Whedon's \\"gut\\" devotion to liberty shines through in this show, and its messsage is clear: freedom matters, it's worth fighting for, and when you can't fight, you escape the oppressor if you can. Some episodes are better than others - the ones scripted by Whedon tend to be the best - but the series overall is better than almost everything on TV today. Maybe if the movie (Serenity, opening next week as I write this) is a hit, the show will be given a new lease on life.  I hope so!

0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has posed an interesting question, \\"How do you know what you know you know?\\"  And if that sounds confusing, then buy the book.  Why do we trust brand labels?  How deep do our stereotypes go?  Why do we change our mind on what characteristics our ideal mate has once we meet someone we like?  This book won't tell you how to think, it will make you examine your snap judgements and challenge HOW you know things.   <br />Highly recommended!
B0006L16N8|3.0|Thanks to amazon you cant find decent reviews. Does anyone honestly believe that 99% of the albums made this year deserve 5 stars? Give me a freakin break. All the fanbois and fangurl make crap 5 star reviews pointlessly ignoring the point of a real review. Amazon just laughs happily at their 5 stars everywhere to the bank. Theres no objectivity in this crap whatsoever. This album deserves a 3 star at best, its downhill from their previous albums. I was dissapointed with the forced studio sound and lack of creativity and emotion. Coldplay themselves said on a radio interview the pressure of corporate label stock profits, expected sales, and (real music critics) had effected their album. Quit being fanbois and give real reviews.
B000001EKX|4.0|1974 saw the release of what became KISS' sophomore album,\\"Hotter Than Hell\\". By this point in time,KISS were an obsecure rock band off of the streets of New York City,and while people knew who they were,not too many people listened to them. No one knew for sure what KISS would do next after the release of their first album--and then this album answered the question. <br /> <br />Yes,this album did answer the question to what the band who would later establish the reputation as \\"The Hottest Band In The World\\" would do next. All of the songs on here are well written,the performances and singing are very good,and this whole album has a little bit of both a 60's and 70's feel to it-and that is what helps make it such a good album. The opening track here,\\"Got To Choose\\",is what goes on in the mind of most young guys and it sings about being frustrated in a relationship--to be honest with you,this track sounds like it was written by a fiteen year old boy,but it still is a really good song. \\"Parasite\\",a song written by Ace Frehley and sung by Gene Simmons,is sung about a really bad girl who brought in \\"trouble\\" during her relationship with a guy(who this song is sung from the point of view of;the guy)and now,the guy is \\"back\\"--a really funny,good,and cool song that has some really good lyrics and singing,as well as some of Ace Frehley's best guitar work and some of Gene Simmons' best vocals. \\"Goin' Blind\\",a song from the days of Wicked Lester that Gene Simmons wrote with his childhood friend Steven Coronel,is one of the top five songs off of this album,and is one of KISS' most underrated tunes--it is about an old guy with a lot of problems who dated a girl much younger than him(listen closely to the lyrics of this song),and now,the problems between them and the idea of their whole relationship which actually happened is coming back to them-this song is really smart,and I love the way it was put together.Following that is \\"Hotter Than Hell\\",about a guy who meets a girl whoturns out to be married,is a flat out hillarious and cool song,and then there is \\"Let Me Go Rock 'n Roll\\",which is pretty much the same thing as the other song I just mentioned. And then,after \\"All The Way\\"(a very funny \\"dating\\" song),\\"Watchin' You\\"(a funny black comedy tune that sounds great live),\\"Mainline\\"(hormonal young guys anyone???),and \\"Comin' Home\\"(the weakest song on the whole album,but still a pretty good love song that shows the results of Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley writing a love song together),this CD comes to an end with \\"Strange Ways\\". The idea of what this song is about--a guy dating a girl and then sees really strange things happening during their relationship--is hillarious,and Peter Criss' vocals help keep this song sort of suspenseful. Good work between all of the songs,which helps keep this a really good album. <br /> <br />Check this album out. This CD may not be above \\"Alive!\\",\\"Detroyer\\",or \\"Rock and Roll Over\\",but it is a shame that it came out at such a critical point in KISS' career-because if it would have come out when KISS was more succesful than they were when they released this album,it(this CD)could have done quite well. As mentioned below by the previous reviewer who reviewed this CD,this album may not be the place to start if you happen to be a new KISS fan,but all in all,it is a fine album that any die hard KISS fan or a regular(but not a die hard KISS fan)should like.
0273617109|5.0|After an exhaustive search, I ordered this book directly from the author. Make sure to get the more recent 1996 edition, not the 1987 edition.  <br /> <br />The book is awesome in that it applies concepts in a way that I haven't seen anywhere else!  <br /> <br />I haven't finished the book yet, it is painful to read, partly because Minto doesn't always apply her own principles! However, there are many great diagrams, and the examples cited are entertaining. For example, she provides examples of \\"intellectually blank assertions\\". <br /> <br />I force myself to read a chapter in the book each month. It is painfully intellectual, and sometimes puts me to sleep. But many great books are that way.  <br /> <br />I bought the book to help me with my business proposal writing. This book is well worth it, especially  for all consultants and business people.

B000002J1S|5.0|This CD, when I bought it ten or so years ago, was so incredible-it totally captivated me ... that I could not stop playing it for about two months straight. I still find myself dragging it out and listening to it in big stretches and then putting away for a while then back at it again... powerful.<br /><br />I think it is mystical enough not to be totally understood, the music is very tight, and very adventurous.. and some of it can annoy as much as it can please, which is what makes great thing great, and not predictable.<br /><br />Simply put, Peter Gabriel really had a vision of looking at a vision darkly. It is put together well, and as I understand, on tour it was really difficult to pull off, which made the fans really apt to see the show... .even today Genesis Cover bands try to pull this off with some success.<br /><br />The music is sometimes atmospheric, but some passages are just so grabbing, like the song IN THE CAGE and the mesmerizing THE SUPERNATURAL Anaesthetist ... great stuff, for any era, any band.<br /><br />Sadly this was the last Peter Gabriel recording with Genesis, as I understand it, he wanted to spend more time with his family, and well... he couldn't if he was touring all the time supporting a band.... Genesis was NEVER the same, never as arty or risk taking band that it was when PG was driving the ship.<br /><br />Simply put, this CD is being recognized in Progressive Rock circles as a major influence... in as much or more of an influence as YES' release of Close To The Edge. I know of some groups in Prog Rock that cite this recording as a major milestone in their life.. (flower kings, Spocks Beard, Neil Morse-to name a few).. and it is beautifully done and well worth masterpiece laud.<br /><br />BUY THIS NOW. Stop reading this and buy this recording.<br /><br />This is just one of those types of CD's that crosses over into the 'INFLUENCE' style of recording... those kinds of recordings don't always cross over into mass appeal.. types of recordings in the past that compare in this style would be Frank Zappa's 'Weasles Ripped My Flesh' and perhaps YES 'Close To The Edge' and even any of the early King Crimson recordings.... these recordings come into the public underground and find a devoted following... it may be true that Genesis went on to bigger selling CD's with PC at the lead singer role, but the fanatical following was already there and keeping money in the banks for the band..  This recording falls into the really wonderful progressive influencial masterpieces.<br /><br />Have funrecordings in the past that compare in this style would be Frank Zappa's 'Weasles Ripped My Flesh' and perhaps YES 'Close To The Edge' and even any of the early King Crimson recordings.... these recordings come into the public underground and find a devoted following... it may be true that Genesis went on to bigger selling CD's with PC at the lead singer role, but the fanatical following was already there and keeping money in the banks for the band..

B00000JZI9|1.0|They tried, honestly tried to give this film the release it deserves. The problem is they managed to mess up the aspect ratio on the initial release. That's probably why this edition of the DVD has since been discontinued in favor of the extra special 2-disc edition. Amazon # B0007MAO0M <br /> <br />On a normal television the image appears squashed. On a widescreen TV it appears in 4:3 mode and still appears squashed. You have to manually expand it with the aspect setting on either your TV or DVD player. Either way it's unwatchable. Get the 2 disc version instead.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This has to be on one of the greatest movies ever made.This a great film for many reasons.A great epic by a master of cinema in his own genre of Spagetti Westerns Sergio Leone.    The four big reasons that this film is memorable are One:Great director that is Sergio Leone.He uses beautful ways of placing the camera,telling the story and working so closley with the composor & cast & writers with great results.Two:Great team of writers Sergio Leone,Dario Argento & Bernado Bertolucci.Three legends together making a masterpiece with homages to other westerns,making intresting characters & smart dialogue.Three:Strong cast of Henry Fonda that is spectacular as the Frank in the movie great potrayal for a bad guy.Charles Bronson the cool and stronguy you do not want to mess with as Harmonica.Charles Robards as Cheyanne he's funny and is perfect for the part.And of course Claudia Cardinale as Jill Mcbaine she potrays the woman that really is the soul of the film.Four:Great Composer Enrico Morricone the music is beautiful and makes you really feel the West in the film.    This is every long and slow film.I enjoyed every second because thats Leones style.Of just letting the camera stand instead of crazy camera movement.His trademark is beautiful wide shots and extreme close ups.Another trademark is he takes his time with setting up the action & when the action comes to its time it ends quicky.Thats his style.Like Sam Peckinpah style is to make the action even longer with slow motion.This is a three hour movie.When this was first released in 1973 in U.S. it was butchered by the editors taking out around a hour in a half.Same thing happend to his later film in the 80's to Once Upon A Time In America.Both films got bad reviews in the start mostly Once Upon A Time In America.Both later when they were recut both got outstanding reactions calling these two movies two of the best movies ever.    This is by far the best Western you wil ever see not in action but in drama thats what itcaptures so beautifly.Go pick this up and give it a try you will love it.Trust me.Not only that this dvd is packed with great special feauters.With a commentary  with guests like directors John Carpenter,Alex Cox & others.
1573300403|5.0|I went to Hollywood Video & rented this on VHS & let me tell you when I saw it, it completely renewed my interest in Michael Jackson. I went out & bought the DVD right away. No matter what the press says, he is truly amazing & one of a kind! The 1995 MTV performance is just show stopping & the proof is in the standing ovation he gets when he finishes. I also loved the Blood on the dance floor video because for the first time, it shows Michael partner dancing with another girl which looks hot. I like the teaser at the beginning & it has a better version of the Smooth Criminal video than the Number Ones DVD. It even includes the legendary Motown 25 performance where he performs Billie Jean & for the first time, does his iconic moonwalk. This DVD is a must have for all fans & those who want to see some of Michael's best work!
020530902X|5.0|Excellent book with no clutter.  This book is for people who already know the basics of grammar.  Unfortunatley, many people don't know a verb from a noun, and for these people, this book won't benefit them.  If you paid attention in grade school, and already know how to write, then this book will help you get much better.  As an aside, I read some of the one star reviews and enjoyed a few laughs.  Some of these people can't string two sentences together (one claiming he is a writer) and bash this book.  Some claim that this book is about writing flowery language.  This is nonsense.  This book teaches you how to write simply and clearly; that being verbose destroys your message.<br /><br />As for those who say that the rules are too rigid?  Just ask yourself if you believe that the non-standard English (ebonics) used in ghettos is an effective way to speak and write. It might be, for people who plan on staying in the ghetto, but not for those who want to succeed in the mainstream, productive society.  We have rules of language for a reason; so people can understand each other.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Seriously!  Danny Elfman is my all time favorite composer, and his take on Corpse Bride does not dissapoint.  Elfman knows how to touch your senses with his songs and scores, and his music just makes you want to stand up and applaud.

1565847032|5.0|\\"A barbarian is a man who believes the customs of his tribe are the laws of nature.\\"<br />George Bernard Shaw<br /><br />Having spoken to Dr. Chomsky on many occasions before and after reading several of his most popular books--including MANUFACTURING CONSENT, THE CHOMSKY READER, ROGUE STATES and the bestselling HEGEMONY OR SURVIVAL--I find only one thing equally as fascinating as his analysis of the modern structure of the world: the Freudian projection of the ruling ideology's primitive contradictions revealing itself in the unconscious of those who disagree with him.<br /><br />\\"While his facts maybe [sic] impeccably marshalled, many of the conclusions at which Chomsky arrives...are obviously baloney...\\"<br /><br />If two people are standing in the middle of a street and a Semi truck is barreling down after them at eighty miles an hour--and accelerating--they can stand there and debate the motivation for the driver's actions if they want to...or the existence of free will...and so on.  But if the ideas \\"people\\" and \\"street\\" and \\"Semi\\" and a mathematical formula partially derived from an English measurement system known as \\"eighty miles an hour\\" are accepted on face value as self-evident (instead of, say, calling it all an illusory, holographic manifestation of a single, static energy field), no one can argue the fact that unless those two people move out the way and fast, they are probably going to die.  The rules of Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology do not accompany or even color the philosophical discourse regarding the relationship of the things mentioned; they ENGENDER it.  Including, again, the idea that there are separate things (some alive, some not; some moving, some not, in an unalterable field of linear time) that are even being discussed.  This means that there are other \\"rules\\" to this \\"game\\" that are being called Nature.  A more or less hidden but unyielding, simple structure of rules; dictating the function of the obvious rules but misunderstood by the players as being ignorable aspects of reality.  And, as such, the players may believe they have no alternative but to play as the rules dictate--meaning, there are no other games to play.  Like chaos theory reveals, the seemingly infinite possibilities of any world are still based on a small set of premises regarding its place within an Ultimate reality.  One that not only makes the permutations within it superficial (if not illusory), but is itself, in its entirety, subject via paradigm shift to both re-interpretation and outright dismissal.<br /><br />The hidden rules of the games of modern society are no different.  And the behaviors they produce in our daily life, given the understanding of a set of otherwise hidden/unexplained set of rules, are also no different.  As such, the socio-political games as a whole can also be equally dismissed as non-representative of human potential.<br /><br />\\"...Chomsky's retort is 'but that wasn't really socialism...That was actually disguised capitalism'... The opposition begins to think, `stuff this for a joke - what's the fun of playing this game?'...\\"<br /><br />\\"...There are no conceivable facts you could present to Chomsky that would lead him to say, 'You know what? You're right! I've got this all completely wrong!'\\"<br /><br />What exactly does the reviewer I'm quoting mean by \\"facts\\" and the word \\"polemic\\"?  What is the source material for the political/economic/human nature beliefs he personally espouses?  Is it the historical literature of the dominant class, written for his schools; community; social class; nation; culture; in his language?  Is it the morning newspaper and newsmagazines, and television?  Is it the opinion of friends and educated professionals who formulated their opinions from the same or similar source material, without ever questioning neither its context, overall purpose or actual veracity?<br /><br />\\"Before reading Understanding Power, I knew of Noam Chomsky only by his (formidable) reputation as a linguist and author of Manufacturing Consent, which I had not (and still have not) read.\\"<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />\\"It is one thing to criticise, quite another to propose a constructive alternative - and... consensual, non coercive, state-free social planning ...just ain't it.\\"<br /><br />\\"...when the stooges in his audience...meekly suggest that his proposal for how to really manage an economy...has been tried in a few places, AND IT FELL APART PRETTY QUICKLY [emphasis mine]...\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't the military history of America since World War II, not to mention the no longer completely secret history of the CIA (see the work of William Blum, KILLING HOPE for just one encyclopedic example) say something different about socialism, communism, and the anarchism of \\"consensual, non coercive, state-free social planning\\" \\"falling apart pretty quickly\\" on the basis of its own structural/moral failures (see also Gore Vidal, PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE)?

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is a rather good book.  It was an interesting read due to the perspective that it took.  The story follows Okonkwo, a man known for his fierceness, and tells what happens when \\"things fall apart\\" in their culture.  The Europeans arrive, and they are a bit pesky at first, but then they turn into a larger problem than anyone could've ever thought possible.  This was a good story, but the ending was a bit of a disapointment.
0743454537|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a *Long* Time.  After 4 years in college- there wasnt much time to read anything but required books and this book has restored my faith in reading for pleasure again! <br />I highly recommend this book, and others by this author. Enjoy!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan. I remember seeing the original Star Wars, now called Episode IV: A New Hope, back when it was first released back in 1977. I have collected the toys, read the books, have the posters, etc, etc. Like I said a huge Star Wars fan. So, when I heard that George Lucas was making a prequel trilogy I was very excited and I looked forward to the moment that I could once again see a Star Wars film on the big screen. Well when that day came in May of 1999 I was at the first showing and could not get the grin off my face when the 20th Century Fox logo and theme came on the screen. And when that classic line popped up on the screen \\"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...\\" I knew that this was for real. Star Wars was back, but it was different.  <br /> <br />I didn't expect the new film to be as good as the original Trilogy, but I still had hopes. While The Phantom Menace was entertaining and full of the great lightsaber fights and space battles we have come to love, it was missing something. I have never expected Oscar caliber acting from these films, but I have to say that some of the performances were just awful. But most of that can be attributed to the script these actors were working from. I have heard a lot of people claim that these films were not meant for everyone and that they were intended for kids. You are fooling yourselves. These films are supposed to be for everyone, for families. And the PG-13 rating for Episode III has shown us that Lucas has not meant for these to be just for children. Don't let the marketing of toys and cereal fool you into thinking these are kids movies.  <br /> <br />My main problem with the Phantom Menace is the introduction of Jar Jar Binks. I know a lot of people feel this is a racist character that pokes fun at black people. Well I am black and I don't find the character offensive I just think it is stupid and annoying. I also think Jar Jar takes away from the film and I think Lucas realized that which would explain his dwindling screen time over the next two films. Also Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker was a poor casting choice. As we have seen with such child stars as Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning, children can act and Lucas could have picked a better young boy to play this role. In fact on this DVD there is a bonus feature that shows the casting for Anakin and there were obviously better actors that did not get this role. But as any fan of Star Wars has eventually realized, we will never know what goes on in Lucas' head.  <br /> <br />But in spite of all of that, Episode I is still an entertaining film and I really loved the newest villian Darth Maul and the introduction of the double bladed lightsaber. I almost had an accident in my pants when I first saw him ignite the second blade on his lightsaber. He is a great addition to the Star Wars universe and the fights scenes in this film are incredible. Also let me add that yet again John Williams proves that he is the master of movie soundtracks. Star Wars films wouldn't be the same if not for John Williams' music. Duel of the Fates is one of the best pieces of music from all of the films and a music video is included on one of the discs.  <br /> <br />Despite this being the worst film of all six films, this two DVD set is still a must have for every collection and adds much to the story and gives us insight into why Darth Vader turned to the dark side. Lucas really put a lot into this DVD set and it shows. From the menus to all of the bonus materials this is a loaded DVD. This film looks and sounds great and as both a Star Wars fan and a movie buff I am proud to have it in my collection.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm so proud of Mariah everybody. Isn't her voice just beautiful on The Emancipation of Mimi. I'm sooooo happy that she has prevailed over her trials and tribulations. Lets take a look at what those unfortunate events have entailed. She divorced Tommy just before 1999 and then he tried to skrew her Rainbow promotion by letting J-Lo steal one of the beats of a song she intended to release on Rainbow. Her Glitter Movie and sountrak flopped (although I thought both were quit good, and her Dad died of cancer in 2001. Well all these things lead to the infamous breakdown. Everyone, even some of her fans thought she was finally washed up. Thank God it happened because now her craft as an artist is simply genius. Her lyrics have great insight which can only be written from an individual with alot of experience in life. It's so funny how some people who have no lives, hate and hate and hate on Mariah for nothing, as if they really know her well enough on a daily bases to make assumptions about her personality, especially the MC hater Jonathon Taylor who loves Darklore Manore. Does anyone know who they are? I want the haters to know how well this album is selling. TEOM guys is selling crazy domestically and internationally. As confirmed by reliable sources as nielsen soundscan and wikipedia, a very good online encyclopedia, TEOM has sold exactly 3,345,415 units/cds in 23 weeks. These are stellar numbers for a super star. TEOM stayed in the top five 22 weeks out of 23 on the Billboard 100 chart. In the World Top 50 Chart Trajectory, TEOM has sold approximately 6.1 million units/cds outside of the United States, bringing the complete total to almost 9.5 million in only 5 months. On this chart, TEOM has stayed in the top 10 for 22 weeks out of 24. The numbers speak for themselves haters. Keep doing your thang Ms. Carey and sell more then Daydream and Music Box combined.
B00002Z88D|4.0|It's a great Music Cd , the combination The Metallica Music Group with the San Francisco Symphony create a goods sounds for the ears
B00008G9JM|5.0|this is an exemplary case of a work of art choosing its audience. this and the preceeding work 'thick as a brick' are where jethro tull reached their creative zenith plunging headlong into the task of producing some of the most challenging and difficult music in rock and roll. like TAAB, the album is one piece with even greater density and less accessable melodies. their is a greater range of instruments than before using sax, flute and synth as well as the traditional bass, guitar, drum and various keys yet the challenge is the song itself. the basic theme is taken through the greatest range of dynamics, time changes, counter melodies, and all manner of instrumental changes and combinations. ian anderson's voice are his expressive best and his lyrics are a beautiful oblique and obsiddian voyage into the afterlife. jethro tull's music is drawn in the tradition of basic folk melodies and is a key to understanding their song structure. while not everybody is going to understand it, the structuure is astounding, the ambition is unyeilding, and the result is one of the most amazing pieces of progressive music ever made. this is not avant garde or experimental, challenging the structure of sound and melody in any type of atonality. it is simply one of the finest pieces of progressive music ever made!
0805047905|5.0|Just what I wanted.  Book is in great condition and was a great price.
0767836324|5.0|When i first saw this movie i was blown away. This is the best movie every and no one/thing can change my opinion of that. All you adults out there who thinks that this movie is bad, grew up to fast and needs serious theropy
B0001HAISG|3.0|This the classic story of Peter Pan. Very entertaining and not really anything offensive. There is some minor violence...and a scene showing a bullet hole in the chest of a pirate (who then drops dead). Overall it's a good boy's movie.<br /><br />The special features are actually better than the movie itself. Just be forewarned...there is a scene showing the painted-over breasts of the mermaids, in the feature about the mermaids. You might want to use parental guidance when your young boys get to that part of the speacial features. It is a very well made and enjoyable film though.<br /><br />*** Three and half stars
0393035158|5.0|Like most politically/religiously explosive books, many reviews of this book oversimplify and take sides, accusing the author of various offenses or heaping disproportional praise.  It's better, I think, to give readers the benefit of the doubt and assume that they will think critically while making an effort to understand the author's point.  In that spirit, I recommend this book to anyone interested in religion, and anyone who has not been exposed to a solid, well-grounded presentation of non-theism. <br />Sam Harris speaks with stunning clarity and precision; he ably speaks the point of view of those who simply cannot understand the underpinnings of the faith of most of the world's population.  Although many readers will disagree with his positions, his passion for the subject coupled with excellent reasoning are impressive. <br />Check out Harris' website, and in particular the Book TV recording of one of his speeches, if you want to hear the ideas of this book condensed into about an hour of talking. <br />Overall:  Calm and direct, Harris crafts a powerful argument--this book deserves a wide readership.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This 2-disc set has been remastered very well and has never sounded better and certainly calling it jazz/rock does not quite do it justice.  It's been hailed as a leading representative of the Jazz Fusion genre and I guess that'll have to do for want of a better description.<br /><br />The music here is meant to shock and to force a rethink on what music and improvisation specifically is all about.  In that sense, it closely resembles avant garde and modern art.  Just like modern art, this album is designed to force a response either positive or negative from its audience and in that sense, it succeeds very well.<br /><br />The material in Disc 2 is a little more assessable and more closely resembling jazz as one thinks of it in the main while disc 1 for some reason reminds me of the soundtrack of the first \\"Dirty Harry\\" movie whenever the villain gets centrestage.<br /><br />An album that grows on you and seems to get better each time you listen to it, it has inspired and influenced countless other jazz fusion artists and so is very important in the overall history of music let alone the jazz genre in itself.<br /><br />Essential listening and a worthy addition to any music-lover's collection.  Recommended but expect to be shocked, surprised and to move out of your musical comfort zone for about 90 minutes.
0321344758|5.0|The size of the book, the clarity of the writing and the humor made this a special read. This book is so useful and so much fun - a definite recommended read for any web designer or developer at any level. I enjoyed it - thank you Mr. Krug! :-)
B00004UQRF|3.0|This was my favourite DM album for many years.  I had it on cassette which was quickly worn out from my constant playing of it to my having lent it out to a couple of my friends and by the time it finally came back very reluctantly from them, most of the carbon had already fallen off the tape.  I then proceeded to get this cd but was disappointed by the sound quality and now revisiting the cd after all these years, I've realised that the tracks don't age very well.<br /><br />Next year will be the 25th anniversary of \\"Speak and Spell\\".  Hopefully the powers that be will consider it an opportune time to remaster/repackage and rerelease the entire DM catalog (hopefully in cardboard mini-lp replica sleeves as well) in commemoration of this momentous event.<br /><br />Maybe a good remastering job would do this and all the albums some good and give them all a new lease of life.  For now, the sound quality is quite poor and the volume levels are very low.  \\"Question of Lust\\" sounds softer compared to the tracks before and after it for some reason.<br /><br />Still, the track that's still the best on this cd is \\"Dressed in Black\\" which although is the second shortest at 2:32, is the one that speaks to me the most and has still managed to sound good after all this time.<br /><br />Good album but nowhere near as good as \\"Some Great Reward\\" and \\"Violater\\".  My advice is to wait for the properly remastered versions to come out and give this disc a miss for now.

B000001FKY|5.0|This is Def Leppard's best album by far and no mean feat considering the drummer only had one arm by this time!  Every track is brilliant and every pain-staking detail was taken in the recording which means the sound quality is also very, very good for a 1987 disc.  It's frightening how much better it'll sound once they get around to remastering this thing.  Maybe in 2 years' time we'll get a 20th anniversary remastering/repackaging of this classic/masterpiece.  This album represents Def Leppard at their prime and as far as the Commerock genre (for definition, see my Whitesnake \\"1987\\" review)goes, this is way, way on top of the list.  Among my top 10 favourite albums of all time.  Highly recommended!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|In the nine days since I bought \\"Takk...\\" by Sigur R&oacute;s, I think it has safely found itself amongst my favourite albums of all time. This isn't something I consider very often, and only a handful of albums released since 2000 are in my Top 25 albums of all time, but this album has crashed in there with impeccable ease. Takk is the first album by Sigur R&oacute;s that I have ever bought, but I'm very keen to buy their other albums as soon as possible although I'm not sure how they will stack up in comparison to this masterpiece. The band produce post-rock music that incorporates elements of shoegazing and minimalism, which is evident in their earlier albums, and made slightly more accessible on Takk.<br /><br />The music on this album often reaches heights of awe-inspiring altitude, before gradually withdrawing to a softer, more sleepy state and then firing up again with beautiful crescendos and vast, expansive soundscapes. There are 11 tracks on this album, all clocking in at just over 1 hour. I say 'tracks' because there isn't really individual songs here that are divided. The best way to view this album is as a complete unit of music, because most of the songs blend seamlessly into one another, carrying very much the same sounds throughout. The band sing entirely in Icelandic (not Hopelandic anymore), the vocals being few and far between, often mumbled or gargled, and very abstract upon the first few listens. It's taken me literally dozens of listens to truly appreciate this album for what it is, which is a gorgeous set or lush, orchestral craftsmanship that sounds like nothing before it.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Takk...\\" which is a short intro before the bulk of the album. On this, guitars gently hum in unison to form a distant wall of sound that seems light years across, gently shimmering in a dark corner of deep space. This soon gives way to the album's first epic, \\"Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li.\\" This song opens with plodding, squelching noises as music boxes gently twinkle in the background. The vocals are hushed and understated, representing the wake from a deep sleep. The song ever so gradually builds pace, until about 3:30 when the beat gets faster until a pounding crescendo takes over at around 4:30. There's so much sound filling your head, but you wonder how everything is kept so minimalist. Space is created inbetween the music, but how? It's a mystery! \\"Hopp&iacute;polla\\" is one of the more accessible songs, opening with a gorgeous piano riff that rivals anything else to come out of 2005. The vocals here are more direct and recognisable. The song gradually builds up, dies down, before coming to an explosive finish with a beautiful string section that Coldplay would be jealous of.<br /><br />The next song, \\"Með Bl&oacute;ðnasir,\\" blends in perfectly. This is another shorter song that serves as an introduction to the next three masterpieces of the album. It's only a couple of minutes long, but it makes a big impression with looped vocals and an impressive drum section that signals the start of the next song. \\"S&eacute; Lest\\" clocks in at almost nine minutes, and can seem a little daunting at first, yet it manages to hold your attention for its entire length. It opens softly like something from Bj&ouml;rk's celestial wonderland \\"Vespertine\\" album from 2001 with a gentle fuzz and twinkling noises. The vocals are indecipherable, of course, but this doesn't (in any way) detract from the genius at work. The voices sound almost angelic and very light as they tread the soft piano below. The song builds, before closing down in the middle for a few minutes. This is probably the most interesting part of the song because it holds so much rhythm and melody tucked away in the corners that only repeated listens will reveal. The song closes in the last two minutes with a marching band section and a waltz-like outro. The soft shimmers that are also added sound like frost gently falling from leaves in a winter woodland. Howbeautiful.<br /><br />It might be a minute shorter than its predecessor, but \\"Sægl&oacute;pur\\" dwarfs it for sheer size. This is the central masterpiece of the album that opens after the croaking outro of the previous song with a stark piano melody that acts as a wake-up call from the nine minute lullaby. The vocals are almost identical in tone and pitch to the previous song, but it explodes into an array of vast instrumentalism when the guitars crash through the door and burn the place to the ground. The vocals are caught in the crossfire, and the drum beat builds to a point where it bounces across the sky like a glowing vapour trail before closing with a drawn-out aeroplane heartbeat. \\"M&iacute;lan&oacute;\\" clocks in at more than 10 minutes. I didn't think I could like this song due to its length, because I thought it would just be too overblown. This is totally not the case though. The band have mastered the art of how to draw a song out to such a length and still keep you hanging on. It's all in the build up and let down that occurs three times, all swirling around a central piano riff that pierces the atmosphere of everything before it. Everything sounds so big and dramatic, yet at the same time quite subdued and calm; the contrast is perplexing as it is stunning.<br /><br />\\"Gong\\" is a faster, more upbeat song that has a darker edge to it than the songs that came before it. The drumming is pretty impressive here and the guitar work is very memorable. The atmospheric tension builds to a point of suffocation until it almost crushes you under its weight. The vocals are very strong and almost distressed. A standout in terms of vocal emotion. \\"Andvari\\" is another one of my favourite songs on the album, mainly because of the final two minutes. The song opens with soft percussion which forms a soft, fragile base amongst the haunting, lullaby style vocal delivery. Everything is very peaceful and tranquil, like water gently babbling over a brook. The final two minutes take this and multiply it by 10. I can't describe the beauty that emits from the violins and the string section that weaves gently in and out.<br /><br />\\"Svo Hlj&oacute;tt\\" is a great song but not really one of my favourites, although I do expect it to grow on me with time. I can appreciate a lot of things about it already, such as the incredibly delicate opening. You half expect the song to just die off because it seems to have such little life in it at this point, like a new-born plant or animal. A piano riff then introduces itself, very melancholy and sombre, gradually building to a point of raw beauty. It's almost like the anticipation to meet someone, who then turns out to be just a mirage on the horizon of a plane. The album closes with \\"Heys&aacute;tan.\\" This song is probably my least favourite on the album but it's not really a song as such when you consider the vast expansive of sound that has come before it. Instead, it's better to view the whole album as one giant song piece, and the final one (track 11) is merely a weak spot, which is quite disappointing because it's the end of the album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album is so special to me and I've only had it for little over a week. It reminds me a lot of Bj&ouml;rk's \\"Vespertine\\" in places, and sometimes Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" on the softer songs such as the title track and \\"Treefingers.\\" I don't think I've ever bought such a delicate and fragile yet powerhouse of an album in my life. The music that the band have made is incredibly atmospheric and reminds me of any number of images in nature. For instance, you could close your eyes and see a winter tundra landscape when you listen to the music, yet with the sun glistening high in a cold blue sky. The parts where the music reaches its apex could be images of sky-scraping genius as you picture skimming the sky past the sun, whereas softer, more delicate parts such as the sounds of music boxes (to me) bring about images of trundling through snow and parting the snow-covered branches of trees in a forest. You could just call me an idiot and say my imagination is too vivid, but I can't help it. Visualising the music makes me appreciate it so much more, which is why this album is so superb for me.weaves gently in and out.    \\"Svo Hljtt\\" is a great song but not really one of my favourites, although I do expect it to grow on me with time.

0679720200|5.0|Maybe I'm odd, but I've never found this book depressing as many say it is.  It is beautiful and sad, as existentialism is suppose to be.  I find this book to be rather like a fairy tale, where the normal world is ever so slightly off what is normal.  I would highly recommend reading this book, its good for your soul, I'm sure of it.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell is a name that I have known for years, since my early teens, yet never bothered to educate myself on. That all changed a few weeks ago when I bought \\"Blue.\\" I had been recommended this album on a number of occasions and gradually became curious as to just what all the fuss was about. When I first listened to this album all the way through, I wasn't quite sure what to think but repeated listens have been extremely rewarding. The small flickers of genius that can be traced after a few listens expand into wide, gaping holes of blinding beauty once you become to know this album.<br /><br />Blue was the fourth album from Joni Mitchell released in the summer of 1971. It was an almost-instant success and charted inside the Billboard Top 20, spending some 28 weeks on the chart. This album may not have sold millions of copies in America, but it is an album so raw and honest that no one can deny its importance. In the 34 years since its release, Blue is one of - if not the - most important female singer/songwriter albums in the history of music. Important in terms of how it broke new ground, important in terms of how it united a nation, and important most definitely in terms of pure vocal delivery, lyrical genius and complex yet seemingly subtle compositions. Ten songs form this album. Which is the best? Well, which is your favourite finger? The answer is impossible because each and every song on this album is unique and gorgeous in its own way.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"All I Want.\\" This song is a gorgeous, stunning opener as the guitar lightly dances around Joni's moonlight vocals with the dulcimer. The desperation in her voice is heartbreaking, yet optimistic. \\"My Old Man\\" is one of my favourites on the album. This is one of those songs that seems so simple yet it actually has a very complex structure. The melody is absolutely gorgeous and the vocal pitch that Joni uses in the line, \\"We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\" is perfectly executed. The lyrics are very reflective of simple life, gently passing by with Joni's vocals rising to points of almost excruciating love. \\"Little Green\\" is a very sad and melancholy song about a child put up for adoption. This song took quite a while to grow on me, but it's the little things such as the way Joni sings \\"He went to California\\" and \\"Weary of lies you are sending home\\" that creep up on you from behind and make you think how beautiful arranged they are. Joni has an absolutely amazing way with words, and the couplets she uses are evidence of some of the best poetry I've ever read in my life. She's not just a singer, she's an incredible poet.<br /><br />\\"Carey\\" is a firm fan-favourite and is critically-lauded as one of Joni's best ever songs. This song is a bit more upbeat than the previous three and seems more complex because of the additional instruments, such as the drums, bass and guitar. Joni's vocals are adorable as always, and the way this song evokes images of Seventies America is achieved superbly. I love it when she sings, \\"Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe and I will buy you a bottle of wine!\\" The album title track, \\"Blue,\\" is up next and is just awe-inspiring. This has to be one of the finest songs I've ever heard in my young life! There is such a bluesy quality to this song that fits in with the title, and also the cover art of Joni's bleak, half-exposed face. The piano is stunning and very evocative. I love the opening line and the way Joni sings about tattoos, perhaps one of the greatest analogies I've ever heard. The lyrical matter is very peace-ridden and hippie-like, with talk of needles, guns and grass. There's a stifled beauty as the piano gets back on its feet after Joni mumbles, \\"Lots of laughs\\" for the second time, for pure emphasis. \\"California\\" is a superb song that sees Joni hailing California because it's such an amazing place, at least in her eyes. There's a lot of cultural references here, especially to Rolling Stone and Vogue magazine. The pedal steel is used here superbly and creates a wonderfully tranquil atmosphere.<br /><br />\\"This Flight Tonight\\" is a more rocking song, with a rougher edge to it. The lyrics speak about an aeroplane, and Joni singing about how she shouldn't have got on the flight. Of course the subject matter is simply a metaphor for a troubled relationship being torn at the seams. The way the vocals are arranged is beautiful, especially as Joni wails, \\"Oh starbright, starbright, you've got the loving that I like, all right.\\" Superb song. The next song is the stunning masterpiece \\"River.\\" This is easily my favourite song on the whole album. The piano intro reminded me instantly of Jingle Bells the first time I heard it! This evokes a Christmas atmosphere, and the fact that Joni wishes she could skate away on a river; rivers can only be skated on when they are ice on top, usually in winter, around Christmas time. These themes all link together to create an absolute masterpiece that can melt the hearts of any. The vocal delivery is flat out stunning, especially as Joni wails \\"I would teach my feet to fly!\\" as the piano takes melancholy stabs at your soul over and over. \\"A Case Of You\\" is one of Joni's most beloved songs and one of her best metaphoric songs ever. There's a lot to admire in this song, with beautiful piano work and gorgeous vocals filled with love. The album closes with \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard.\\" This is another great piano-led song that has a minute-long intro before Joni begins singing. Joni sings about her time with this Richard back in Detroit in 1968, and the way she recites many of the conversations is almost intimidating in its honesty - so revealing and intimate.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album has been in my collection for a couple of months, but I'd definitely consider it one of the best albums I'll ever buy. Joni Mitchell is an absolute songwriting legend. Her status is unparalleled by any other female musician in history, and the only other person who can be mentioned in the same sentence as her is Bob Dylan. Who knows, maybe I'll get into his music after being so taken with Joni. I definitely plan on buying more albums by Joni Mitchell, though it may take me a few years due to the sheer size of her back catalogue. I pity the previous reviewer because the lack of ignorance over such gorgeous music as this is unbelievable.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|I am a huge Pink Floyd fan.  I consider this to be their best album.  While the Gilmour songs tend to be easier to digest the first time they are played, the Waters pieces tend to hold up better over time.  Compare this to \\"Learning to Fly.\\"  There is no comparison. This is the ultimate Waters Pink Floyd album.  The songs have a deep sadness to them. Although originally intended to be part of \\"The Wall,\\"  the band apparently revolted and insisted these songs be part of a seperate album.  Tensions ran so high that each member of the band recorded their part independently.  The band folded shortly after this disc was released. It truly was the Final Cut.  Nonetheless, the lyrics are magnificent--perhaps among the 10 best ever recorded in the prog. rock arena.  I tend to think that the songs would appeal to an even larger audience had Gilmour been allowed to contribute more.  I think this album, along with the Wall, will hold up over time better than any other Pink Floyd Album.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Although I didn't care for the metaphysical uber-interpretation of this movie, I think that it provides more than enough for you to come up with something on your own.  \\"Donnie Darko\\" reflects profoundly on the state of our mainstream suburban culture in America. I might even go so far as to say that it is a companion piece to \\"American Beauty\\" as well as \\"Fight Club\\".  <br /> <br />This movie is definitely a candidate for multiple viewings, as there is much to be discovered after the first view. The website also tells a lot about the underlying metaphysics of the story created by Richard Kelly, but I would argue that you ought to form your own interpretation and talk to others about theirs rather than accept some silly SF BS.

B0007YMUZW|4.0|With everything else that is out there that I can't relate too<br /><br />it was nice to hear a collection of songs that reminded me of time that died with the passing of Jerry Garcia. I can't offer a critique about how this stands up to Dylan , or what the \\"real\\" intentions are to all the Dead references that flower the album; all I know is I bought it because it sounded like something I just might be able to relate to and I am glad I did. Cold Roses has become my favorite CD and it gets a lot of air play around my house.My advice: If you are a Dead Head thirsty for something new , you just might like this album.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Following a rock classic is a difficult undertaking for any band but the Stones did something even more unlikely, they made a better record. 'Let It Bleed' is the 2nd on the Stones' great winning streak and upon its release in November 1969, was hailed as a milestone. Thirty six years have done nothing to dull its impact as this album brought an end to the sixties once and for all. A transitional record, mostly written and recorded by the band as a four piece with Keith playing 90% of the guitars due to the departure (then sudden death) of founder Brian Jones and the introduction of Jones' replacement Mick Taylor who plays very briefly on the record. Keith handles the extra work flawlessly as he starts to cement his postion as the band's musical director, with Mick Jagger as musical and corporate frontman (as is today). Recorded in bits in pieces from the spring of 1968 to the summer of 1969, 'Let It Bleed' is nine songs of perfection. \\"Gimme Shelter\\" became an anthem for Sixties decadence and the catastrophies of both the Vietmam War and later Altamont. Loud ringing guitars and harmonica blister from the speakers and Merry Clayton's duet with Mick is chilling in its \\"rape, murder\\" intensity and power. \\"Midnight Rambler\\", written about Albert DeSalvo could also be in reference to the Manson family as their heinous crimes were becoming news as this album was near its final stages. Robert Johnson is paid tribute in \\"Love in Vain\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\" celebrates the decadence of the Stones in ways that \\"Gimme Shelter\\" abhorred. On a album of anthems, what can one say about \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", Mick's impassioned plea to Marianne Faithful to quit the junk, now almost a song of hope and pleading. Personal favorites \\"Monkey Man\\" and \\"Live with Me\\" proved that when it came to straight forward hard rock, the Stones had few equals. The former features one of Keith's greatest riffs decorating more lyrics about dope and sex while the latter features the debut ofsidekick Bobby Keyes on blistering sax. Death, jail, Hell's Angels, Satan, the end of the Sixties....nothing was going to stop the Rolling Stones machine but boredom and that would have to wait for another half decade.
0307276902|2.0|well, when you read a book about drugs, you at least expect some decent articulation on the substances.  This book is a pure waste of time, I kept reading it because it was about addiction, I thought eventually their would be some talk about drug culture or the like...  The reason I bought it was because I thought he would teach me something, about the human mind existing on the fringes of sanity!  Drugs are known for such things, i guess.  I learned nothing, except this...<br /><br />If this book, is truly #1 in sales rank on amazon.com, it says to me that people aren't reading deeply.  HHAH.  They aren't finishing them probably, perpetuating oprah's idiotic book club.  This book is a horrible excuse for a novel, and as long as drivel like this is considered even decent, let alone the best on amazon.com, the future of literacy is looking very bleak indeed.  If you consider this book 5 stars, you have GOT to be illiterate.<br /><br />I wrote this review because I'm tired of untalented works being praised.  The standard must not fall this low.  I know most that read this are probably living a life of sobriety...  This book was for you.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|What a ride!  \\"Oldboy,\\" has been labeled a revenge flick - which it certainly is.  It also has all the classic trappings of Noir, which may elevate things a bit, since such careful attention to noir elements reflects a careful construction behind the carnage.  Of course, you couldn't tell that from watching the first twenty minutes or so - which is humorous and completely different in tone when contrasted with what follows.  Still, if you watch carefully, the seeds of the story, and the fate of Oh Dae-Su (the movie's anti-hero), are all there.  The movie's \\"secret\\" or mystery really isn't that big of a secret, and if you've watched noir flicks at all or have read your Jim Thompson, the characters' fates are not such a surprise. Shocking -- always, no matter how many times you've seen or read it, but not a surprise.  But I'm not revealing anything more here.  <br /> <br />The movie has loads of style (which is probably what attracted Tarantino's interest), and the story unfolds nicely - in a very pulpish way, while Oh Dae-Su, the whole time offers up pithy existential nuggets of hard won wisdom.  The movie starts out almost as a comedy, turns surreal (Salvador Dali weird) as Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously imprisoned for fifteen years.  Then it shifts gears into grindhouse action, and closes with a Sergio Leone like flourish - operatic, over the top and totally cool.   Probably the only movie I've seen that believably shows a man fighting 15 others - with a hammer.  It was like the Thriller from Manilla - kung fu version. Grueling. Brutal. A must see flick. <br />
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I haven't seen this movie but I can tell just from the trailers it sucks.  Look at this list of Tim Burton films: Batman, Batman Returns, Edward Scisorhands, Beetlejuice, Planet Of The Apes - just to name a few.  All bad! <br /> <br />I find Johnny Depp to be an unlikeable actor.  Just because you are willing to dress up as a bunch of weird characters (Edward Scissorhands, Captain Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka) or talk with a weird voice doesn't make you a unique or good actor. <br /> <br />Tim and Johnny why don't you both quit whilst you are behind!

B00006FM77|4.0|I love Chicago, at least the Chicago from 1969-to 1977. I am not sure what to think of the band since that time. I wish Chicago would have released the Live in Japan album in the states in 1972 to have something to compare this too. I used to hate listening to this as my brother put on this long, long LP replete with scratches, coughing and sounds of the band tuning up. Rhino has done wonders with the sound and for some reason  it  goes by, or at least seems to, much quicker and smoother. The best thing is the additional unreleased music from Chicago III and the unused versions of songs from the original LP-Cetera's Sing a Mean Tune on the new disc is a highlight, as well as Listen. The addition of all the original posters and book are a nice touch, but save your money and buy it used-Gee, my brother got it for $5.75 back in 1971!!!!!!!!

B000056Q81|5.0|This double  CD collection covers Francoise Hardy's recording period with Vogue Records 1962-1967. Hardy was only 18 years old when she recorded the songs for her first album in 1962; so it was very unusual that she was allowed to record so much of her own material; great thing she was, because she was ( still is ) a very accomplished songwriter. In fact most of her biggest were written or co-written by Hardy herself.<br /><br />The song selections concentrate on her first 5 albums ( 1962-66 ) and contemporary singles and EP tracks. Her 6th much-acclaimed Vogue album  \\"Ma Jeunesse Fout le Camp\\" is only represented by \\"Qui Peut Dire\\" and \\"Voila\\". Most surprisingly that her last Vogue original album ( in Frech language ) \\"Comment te Dire Adieu\\" is not represented at all.<br /><br />Never the less, this is a great compilation featuring the vast majority of her best songs of the period - obviously some great songs had to be left out; simply because lack of space. I can't help mentioning just a few songs that are missing ( seek them out elsewhere!) . The 1964 EP-track \\"Jaloux\\" is one of my favourites, which I have not yet been able to find on a CD. The album tracks \\"Avant de t&eacute;n Aller\\" and \\"Je Pensais\\"  would have been great additions as well.<br /><br />These early recordings from Hardy which founded her reputation as the greatest French international pop-star of the 1960's have stood the test of time, and sound remarkably appealing after all these years; where the output by many of her contemporary colleagues like Cilla Black, Petula Clark, Connie Francis or even Marianne Faithful ( her sixties recordings!) often sound pretty dated.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the early years of Francoise Hardy's career this collection would be the ideal place to start getting to know her. Outstanding songs like \\"Le Premier Bonheur du Jour\\", \\"Le Maison Ou Ja&iacute; Grandi\\", \\"Ce Petit Coeur\\" or \\"Rendezvous Automne\\" are more than likely to hit you - actually most of these songs are!<br /><br />The 16 pages booklet features some nice pictures and a short biography, but only sparse information about the songs themselves; where they were first released etc. Personally I would have loved to have a little more information about the recordings, circumstances around them etc.<br /><br />Still, until the 4 CD box featuring her complete Vogue recordings is available again, this CD is indispensable!res some nice pictures and a short biography, but only sparse information about the songs themselves; where they were first released etc. Personally I would have loved to have a little more information about the recordings, circumstances around them etc.    Still, until the 4 CD box featuring her complete Vogue recordings is available again, this CD is indispensable!
B00000IBVC|5.0|Puccini would be thrilled with this vast film production of his durable and spectacular opera Turandot.  Top notch voices filled the enormous Imperial Palace staging.  Costumes were authentic and brilliant in detail. Most of the extras were Chinese nationality.  Enjoy this and then ask for the DVD film on The Making of Turandot which tells the lengthy tale of the first concept for bringing the Italian production to China for filming and then the unending modifications in order to present an authentic setting.  It is a total experience and brilliant throughout.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|the ultimate achievement of sigur ros.  tracks 'gong' and 'glosoli' are outstanding. <br /> <br /> <br />definitely worth your dough.
0380778556|4.0|I have read many of the other online reviews for this book, so I won't be redundant repeating the outstanding aspects of this book - its visual sense of place, rich symbolism, wonderful character development of the narrator, surprising plot twists, and excellent craftsmanship throughout. There are a few aspects about Maxim, though, that bothered me. I am supposed to somehow be 'on his side' in this book, but I found this increasingly more difficult, as he erodes his character's intelligence by falling into one foolish decision after another. His first and most colossal blunder takes place on a high hill in Monte Carlo, when he deliberately sacrifices his personal happiness by making a conscious choice in favor of his socialite standing. And so he sets himself up from the beginning for a one-way trip to hell. After he arrives at that destination, he allows Mrs. Danvers to continue haunting the west wing of Manderley, which remains a morbid museum to his first dead wife, and somehow he doesn't think that's creepy. Even worse, he leaves undisturbed that cottage on the beach, complete with its cobweb-covered furnishings and horrifying memories, when any sane person would have had that sinister shack bulldozed immediately. This is the framework for his worst decision yet: He decides to take the new Mrs. deWinter back to Manderley, the very place where all his nightmares lie in wait, Why? He believes that his love for the place will somehow conquer all its demons. Sentimental childhood home or not, a more sensible person would have sold the place immediately and moved on. Then to somehow expect his second wife, a shy, waif-like doe of a girl, to try to fit in there and not get creeped out herself, seems incredibly shortsighted and dense for a man of 40+ years. I think his most brilliant line in the whole book is when he laments, \\"Oh why did we ever come back here?\\" Why indeed. Personally, I think Du Maurier did those two a favor by what happens to Manderley at the end ofthe book. One can only hope that Maxim's decisions will now be more sensible, and that perhaps the second Mrs. DeWinter will finally get to experience some well-deserved happiness. All this being said, I do realize, of course, that if Maxim had had more brains in the first place, this haunting novel couldn't have been written.
0226264211|2.0|<br />Milton Friedman's book entitled 'Capitalism and Freedom' presents the ideological foundations of the prevailing greed-driven ethos of Corporate Globalization.  According to Friedman, and his disciples, 'capitalism' complements democracy.  As Capitalism is Not Democracy critically presents, 'capitalism' in fact, undermines democracy.  Capitalism promotes the development of 'capitalistocracy', rather than democracy. <br /> <br />I would respectfully recommend 'Capitalism is Not Democracy' for readers who are seeking progressive alternatives to the prevailing context of so-called \\"economic progress\\", which creates mass poverty on a global scale, and ensuing social malaise, crime, and conditions for political extremism which promotes terrorism.   <br /> <br />According to the author of 'Capitalism is Not Democracy', we need to re-think and reconstruct the economic system in order to serve the quality-of-living of all human beings, with prejudice, rather than the mercenary commercial profit interests of elite 'owners of capitalism', in Friedman's corporate capitalist dystopia. <br /> <br />The 'Capitalism is Not Democracy' book, ISBN: 1894934636, presents a comprehensive critique of capitalistocracy that is associated with Corporate Globalization.  Indeed, the Big Business-oriented \\"Globalization\\" context is systematically undermining vital human rights, social justice, and environmental protection.  This book also presents a progressive alternative economic system to the current context of Corporate Globalization, which is destroying the quality of human survival internationally
B0002OERI0|5.0|this album rocks. period.<br /><br />I understand how people can complain about it being more 'pop' than their older albums, with songs like Boulevard, and Wake me up when september ends, but come on, its still full of stuff that rocks! st. jimmy, give me novachaine, american idiot, jesus of suburbia! can you see the lieks of good charlotte doing these songs?<br /><br />The album itself its amazing. Of course, I don't expect some people to be able to appreciate it for what it is. A story. A political statement. A damned good album.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|Excellent CD if you want to listen to opera in short. However, if you are really interested, it's better to buy a 2-disc edition or a DVD to enjoy this wonderful music in full.
B0009RCPY8|1.0|This version is a rip off.  It is supposed to be widescreen on both movies but only one of them is.  The other is full screen.  When informing Amazon of the possibility of a problem prior to purchase their only respose was to look at the Internet Movie Database for further information on these movies.<br /><br />Don't buy this if you are a real movie collector because it isn't what is advertised!!!
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Miles Davis had quite an illustrious career that took him through numerous phases and alot of different exploratory modes. all those experiments were not entirely successful, but he was always in control and knew exactly what he wanted from himself, his bandmates, and his albums. his landmark album Kind Of Blue was a very subdued affair, utilizing sketches of music, rather than the full pieces written out for all the instruments; and the results were stellar. that landmark album catapaulted Miles into a whole new realm of composition and changed the way alot of people listened to music...especially jazz.<br /><br />ten years later, In A Silent Way is released and it could easily be seen as a companion album to Kind Of Blue. this recording seems to effortlessly soak in the spirit of the night time air; it's audio contents are gentle breezes that drift and float and carry you along for the ride with it's gentle melody and mesmerising rhythm. some people call it the beginning of fusion. others call it ambient. whatever it may be, it's an understated album of sheer beauty and control.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|WOW! how do i start off, this cd is so much better than i expected. I am one of your typical rock kids, i love rock, doesn't matter if its light rock, heavy rock, emo rock, screamo rock, you name it with rock on it and i like it.... this medal cd defines rock how it should be, heavy and full of great guitar solos. The drums on Seize the Day is awesome. Bat Country is obviously the hit on the cd. i heard it and instantly fell in love. This has much less screaming from their other cds. Ironically i popped this cd in my car with my dad, and he (54) likes them now too. very catchy lyrics, great guitars, heavy drums... even at points sound kinda like guns and roses. definitly should be bought by anyone who likes any type of rock.
B00000J7SS|5.0|alot of people have an opinion of Bitches Brew and i won't spend too much time telling you what this album means to me. i can only tell you that it's an epic mystery of a recording. there's something about it that pulls you in and won't let you go. it's a multi mood album that is both beautiful and frightening. it's like being caught inside a storm. but no matter how many times you listen to this record, you can never quite fully wrap your head around it. it's what makes it so appealing. essential for those who like their jazz to be pushed beyond the boundary and into the unknown.
B000002B2T|5.0|Mad Season didn't become big, and they only released one album, but their worth a lot of attention still. The band consisting of AIC' tragic but charismatic and brilliant singer Layne Staley, Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready, drummer Barret Martin from Screaming Trees and bassist Michaels from the same band. 'Wake Up' starts off the album, a calm song, maybe about awakening and realising the reality, instead of staying in your fantasy world, a good start. 'Long Gone Day', featuring amazing vocals by Mark Lanegan, is a more experimental track, but it's truly great. A bass driven calm song, that actually speaks about how grunge seems to be dying, lines include '...the music that we made...it's a long gone day...and it's sadly the funeral album for grunge in a way..'X-Ray Mind' and 'Lifeless Dead' are more lyric-driven, Layne-spotlighted, creepy vocals and somewhat melodic and loud guitar licks make them great. 'River of Deceit', a song you must love..a very touching calm song, which makes me cry now and then when I listen to it...not a traditionally sad song, the chords are pretty happy, but it's just a timeless country-ish song, but Layne's soft voice and tragic lyrics make it a beautiful masterpiece. 'Above', is a more of a classic rock song, with a little punk in it too, maybe it talks about certain pride, definitely a highlight...'All Alone' closes the album greatly, not a peculiar song, but it's one of those dreamy songs that always work! DON'T MISS THIS ALBUM!
B00004VWAF|5.0|this album is undoubtedly one of the most controversial albums ever released by Miles. many people were pissed off because it was not jazz. but with music this good, who really cares what label it's given? this is truly astonishing album that sets the standard high for improvisational funk. Miles and band set the meter to 'hot' and never really let up for the entire duration of it's playing time. there are lots of weird little percussive jams going while the keyboardist splashes a bit of colour here and there and the bass keeps it steady while Davis just commands the ship and chimes in with his 2 cents now and then. On The Corner is such a freaky album and i think it just went over most people's heads back when it was released. it probably still goes above most people's head 30 years later. this album (like alot of Miles's electric period) requires deep listening and an appreciation for music that stretches beyond what is safe. this is dirty and gritty music that feels like the humid stench of fresh asphalt burning on the sticky summer streets. you cannot ignore the genius of this record. listen with an open mind and it will own you.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|I cant say anything bad about Elizabeth Fraser. Her voice makes me melt and she takes me where I want to go.The guitarists Will and Robin work in perfect harmony with liz providing a perfect sureal soundscape. Pure bliss.
B000002AH1|5.0|for people who have a spark of curiosity about the legendary music of Miles Davis, knowing where to begin the search can be a frustrating issue. with a back catalogue as vast as a small continent, figuring out where to start and where to go can be tricky. especially considering the many phases of Miles' long and adventerous career. he spawned many followers and imitators and made many enemies along the way. a larger than life figure who would dominate the jazz scene for decades and whose music still holds power and brilliance even to this day. Personally, i have been such a big John Coltrane fan for so many years, that i somehow blindly overlooked Miles Davis' recorded output for a long time. it's just been in the past 4 years or so that i have gotten the opportunity to dig into Miles' absolutely stunning and quite frankly, overwhelming music. whereas Coltrane was the master of melody, Miles is the master of the mood. a true genius whose musical impact and influence is felt even stronger today than it was when he was alive.<br /><br />if Bitches Brew was a series of faint sketches, then Live-Evil is the fully realized painting. this is a solid and electrifying set of music recorded live and in the studio. it's pieced together from different dates and different venues and times, but surprisingly, it gels quite well as a whole. the shockingly strong \\"What I Say\\" is probably my favoite cut on this record. it just moves with the blunt force of a runaway locomotive and doesn't stop. and wow, what a drum solo from Tony Williams. one of the best and most creative drummers the music world has ever known. he smokes through these songs with a heat that is matched by Miles' passionate playing and intense band direction. the kinetic energy between bandmates here forms to create such a supernova that rips through the atmosphere and shoots straight upward into the stratosphere. the mellow songs on here like \\"Selim\\" are very moving and contain such weird faint little melodies that they seem like little whisps of opaque clouds smattered against the audio soundscape. Live-Evil burns with heat and light and undisputed attitude.<br /><br />the dark genius, Miles Davis strikes again.at they seem like little whisps of opaque clouds smattered against the audio soundscape.

B000002TQV|5.0|The song High and Dry by Radiohead has been obsessing me for months and months.  I play it on a loop on my ipod; it's the current soundtrack to my life.  It makes me ache.  Sometimes it makes me smile.  It always inspires me.  But mostly it makes me ache.   <br /> <br />There are a lot of good songs, and catchy songs, and well-sung songs, and make-you-feel-something songs, but this song - this song is a true piece of art.  The lyrics and the music and the vocals all perfectly set a mood, coming together and plucking at my heart with each note from the guitar.  I ache.  I ache when I hear it.   <br /> <br />I've read peoples' interpretations of the lyrics.  Some are literal, it's about Evil Knievel or something.  I think it's more about drug use - clever title, no?  Either way, it's about a daredevil of sorts forsaking his old friend as well as himself.  The friend can see it coming, see what's going to happen, sees it while the daredevil is still in the air.  And he aches.  Aches for his friend, aches for himself.  And while I'm not experiencing a situation like that, the feeling is universal, and for me it's about the thoughtful, plaintive moan, and the loss, and the guitar that comes three minutes and fifty-five seconds in.  Yeah.  That.
B0000C23DO|5.0|I've always wanted to have a Grateful Dead cd in my collection, but I could never find a collection that had all the songs that I wanted. Until today, when I found \\"The Very Best Of The Grateful Dead\\". And since it was compiled by Rhino, I knew it had to be good. I got home and popped it into my cd player and I was blown away by what I had been missing out on. The Grateful Dead are one of the greatest bands I have ever heard. Their songs are absolutely fantastic. I only knew two songs prior to purchasing this album, \\"Casey Jones\\" and \\"Touch Of Grey\\". I realized that they have many more great songs. Some of my favorites include \\"Box Of Rain\\", \\"Truckin'\\", \\"U.S. Blues\\" and \\"Uncle John's Band\\".<br /><br />The liner notes are fantastic, and the songs sound great. If you're just getting into The Grateful Dead, then I highly recommend this collection. It's a must have.
6304698526|4.0|The movie was pretty slow paced at first, kinda like a puzzle waiting to be put together, but once you gather clues the movie really starts to come together, & it gets even better every minute, but you gotta see it without a blink of an eye, if you miss something the movie will suck.My favorite part of the movie was the car chase, which is without a doubt the best car thriller Ive ever experienced, a fast paced scene that I truly enjoyed.the colors & sound were good & I would have expected more car chases but overall the movie was a four star hit this movie is pretty good, check it out!!!
B0000VD04M|4.0|It is hard to describe a movie that has so much humor yet you feel great empathy for its characters. Ed Wood, played by Johnny Depp is living in a world of disillusion and he thinks his films are classics in the making, although nothing could be further from the truth. Its kind of like laughing at someone without them being in on the joke. The same holds true with the Bela Lugosi character played flawlessly by Martin Landau. He gets caught up in this world of B movies and thinks he is part of creating great art, not realizing Ed Wood is a hacker director. His morphine addiction is portrayed very harrowingly and shows a great conflict in the perfect movie world in Ed Wood's mind. They feed off each other. Ed Wood being a great admirer and Lugosi needing to be recognized as an actor again..It really becomes a \\"tragic\\" comedy of sorts for both characters. In actuality, Ed Wood became a porno movie director before his death, epitomizing the worst in people. I don't think the character that Johnny Depp was portraying would approve, being a lover of real movies. The two main characters disillusionment is very very sad. Despite all that the movie is very good and a great homage to the B movies of the 50's and 60's.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|Tom Hanks, playing the role of a FEDEX executive, finds himself stranded on a desert island.  Finding himself confronted with the Robinson Crusoe type challenges of making do with the sparse resources at his disposal, Hanks does a very nice job of working his way from the transition from the modern world to one where he has to depend solely on his own initiative.<br /><br />I found the cinemetography of the movie quite striking with some really nice pictures of the ocean and island.  The film gives you a good sense of the smallness of the island and how great the size of the surrounding ocean.<br /><br />The one area I didn't get into this movie was the romance between Hank's character and that of Helen Hunt.  This part of the movie could have been handled better and that is why I only gave the movie 4 stars.
B000002L68|5.0|I just bought another copy at Border's bookstore during a break from work. My old copy was on tape and badly damaged.<br /><br />I bought the tape after seeing the movie in france in spring 1985. I cannot believe that for me, all the music that has come in the last 20 years still cannot touch the quality, profound message, and energy of this album.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this album. The message is unique and the delivery flawless. You'll be transported, as I am each time I listen to it.
0894803123|3.0|There are lots of rave reviews on this book, and that's why I bought it.  I also bought a Cuisinart ice cream maker at the same time, and immediately made my 2nd, 3rd & 5th batches from this book.  The other batches were from the ice cream maker documentation.  Of the three recipes we tried, only one turned out well.  The other recipes from the Cuisinart book turned out much better, really.  This surprised and disappointed me, as I had such high hopes for homemade B&J ice cream.  I will keep trying, but I would *not* call this a fail safe home ice cream making guide.
006441034X|2.0|In the town of Market Chipping in the land of Ingary, Sophie Hatter seems condemned to a boring and uneventful life, being the oldest of 3 sisters. Even her name seems to imprison her into running the family hat shop after her father dies, and her stepmother takes over the destinies of her and her two sisters, Lettie and Martha. While the other two move on to other lives, Sophie sits, working diligently with little reward and probably the future of being an unmarried spinster before her. That is, until the Witch of the Waste comes into her shop, and believing that Sophie has been rude to her, changes the young and pretty Sophie into an 90-something old crone. Not wishing to reveal what has happened to her to Lettie and Martha, she leaves the town and runs smack into the Moving Castle of Howl, a fearsome and supposedly woman-eating wizard! Along with his apprentice Michael, and the fire demon Calcifer, Sophie must learn how to break the spell on herself and also learn how to survive a close encounter with Howl himself.  <br /> <br />I came to this book after seeing and enjoying the anime version of this novel by the great Japanese director Miyazaki. I have to say that the novel suffered in comparison. Frankly, this novel was a little dull and lacked any suspense. The Witch of the Waste especially suffered from a lack of characterization. The motivations of the characters also seemed to lack any sense of urgency. \\"Oh well, I'm an old lady. No rush to change me back\\". \\"I'm enslaved by Howl, no rush to free me.\\" Sophie and Howl also acted like 5 year olds most of the time, being spiteful, hateful, and crude most of the time. I didn't like them. Flat out. Romance was completely dead here and the whole thing just puttered along with mediocre writing until it ended.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|This is a great battery pack that gets great life, but the non-Canon brand BP511's are just as good and a fraction of the cost. You won't be disappointed in the performance of the battery, but you'll be paying extra for the Canon brand.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|In response to the review by Mr. A.J. Dill - what happened to the the gang in the past two years was covered in the anime short FF VII AC: Last Order that came with the deluxe package of Advent Children. Didn't see it? Well I guess you should do some research before delivering a poor review for something you downloaded on the internet. <br /> <br />When the two films are taken together, you have a very satisfying conclusion to the game, even though I am of the mind that its ok to end something without a happy ending. Heck, the Japanese of masters of it! But even when taken by itself, FF VII Advent Children is a wonderful film. It was not made to win Acadamy Awards or to make an in depth character - the game did the second one all by itself. It was made for a target audience, that being the players of the FF series. It delivers on all counts for geeks like me that want to see the game updated from its lego graphics and midi sound files to modern technology. Who knows, maybe if this thing is popular, the FF VII could be updated for the PS3. But I digress. The CGI is awesome, as is the sound. The battles are great, the Japanese Dialog is wonderful (hope this stays for the American release), and if the movie is taken for what it is, its an awesome movie. High recommendation for this movie on all counts, with or without the Last Order prequel.
B000007VLL|4.0|Not sure if this is the definitive \\"greatest hits\\" but it certainly includes most of them.  \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", \\"Best\\" (even better than Tina Turner's version), \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\", \\"Lost in France\\", and the BeeGee's \\"To Love Somebody\\" are all great songs, with great hooks and superb wordplay.  The highlight for me, though, is \\"It's a Heartache\\" -- really shows off one of the greatest voices ever in rock and roll -- Tyler really delivers the pain and anquish and hopelessness of a jilted lover in a way few vocalists could.  Sadly, I understand that Bonnie Tyler retired some years ago and has not recorded any music in years.  Too bad, although that's probably a good reason to have this record.

B00005BL2A|4.0|Exciter is probably the weakest album since Construction Time Again, but it does have alot of great songs on it, it just doesn't match up to previous Depeche Mode efforts.  <br /> <br />Dream On- Good opening song, acoustic guitar(definitely not Depeche) but still good enough for me. Good beat, sounds like the interlude at the end of enjoy the silence. 4/5 <br /> <br />Shine- Very good production on this song, great vocals by Gahan, the arrangements are very produced, good soul song. 5/5 <br /> <br />Sweetest Perfection- Probably the best lyrics on any song off Exciter, decent beat, but not my favorite. 3/5 <br /> <br />When the Body Speaks- Beautiful song, great lyrics, very soft, good vocals by Gahan, by now you get the feeling this album is more relaxed than their others. 4/5 <br /> <br />The Dead of Night- Either you love it or you hate it, i just like it, haha, it's a faster paced, raunchy guitar, decent production. Sounds like something from Ultra 3/5 <br /> <br />Lovetheme- Instrumental, it's ok, nice change of pace after TDON. 3/5 <br /> <br />Freelove- This could have been a great song if it had some percussion arrangement on it, the flood remix is really good. Still one of the strongest songs on this album. 4/5 <br /> <br />Comatose- I think this is the worst song off Exciter, and probably since Music for the Masses. 1/5 <br /> <br />I Feel Loved- Dance song, very techno-based pop. I like this one, has the classic depeche sound. 4/5 <br /> <br />Breathe- Blues-oriented done very well, not my favorite but written cleverly. 3/5 <br /> <br />Easy Tiger- Great instrumental, I like this one a lot. 4/5 <br /> <br />I am You- Best song off exciter, overlooked by most, great vocals, great production(string production near the end) 5/5 <br /> <br />Goodnight Lovers- Most hate this, I think it's better than most people give it credit for. 4/5  <br /> <br />Best songs: Shine, I am You, When the Body Speaks <br />Worst: Comatose <br /> <br />Worth the buy in my opinion.
B0009P42S2|4.0|After directing \\"Akira\\" in 1988, Katsuhiro Ôtomo avoided making another feature length anime for years.  In 1991 he did a live action film, the horror-comedy \\"Warudo apaatoment hora\\" and then in 1995 he did the \\"Cannon Fodder\\" segment for \\"Memories.\\"  He wrote the scripts for Hiroyuki Kitakubo's \\"Rôjin Z\\" in 1991 and adopted Osamu Tezuka's manga for Rintaro's \\"Metoroporisu\\" in 2001.  But it was not until 2004 that Ôtomo helmed  \\"Steamboy\\" and left himself open to the inevitable comparisons of this two-hour anime with the classics in the field in which he had a major hand.<br /><br />On the one hand \\"Steamboy\\" is as visually stunning as you would expect, albeit in a decidedly different way from \\"Akira\\" and \\"Metroporisu.\\"  This time around Ôtomo is not telling a futuristic story, but one set in 1866 in the London of Victorian England, which mandates sepia toned colors rather than working with a palate of bright neon colors.  That alone justifies a different look to \\"Steamboy,\\" and the chief attraction for this anime are the hand-drawn animation, enhanced by computers, of the massive machines of gears and pistons.  But there is another interesting consequences to the setting of \\"Steamboy,\\" which is that for the first time with a Japanese anime I am recommending that you listen to the English audio track rather than the Japanese.  Since the characters are actually English, then for once it makes sense to go this route.  Besides, we are talking Patrick Stewart as grandfather Dr. Lloyd Steam, Alfred Molina as his son Dr. Eddie Steam, and Anna Panquin as James Ray Steam, who is the film's title figure.<br /><br />The key idea behind \\"Steamboy\\" is to recast the Industrial Revolution of the 19th-century with steam now holding a power and promise akin to atomic energy after World War II, although I guess scientifically the power is more like a jet engine (but the implications for transforming the world strike me as being more in the realm of the idealized future represented by atomic power).  Ray Steam is a boy inventor who comes into possession of \\"steam ball,\\" and then finds himself in a struggle between his father, who has become part-machine and power mad, and his grandfather, who turns into a wild-eyed Cassandra of gloom and doom.  The evil Dr. Steam is building an army with steam-powered tanks, mechanical  armor suits, and even steam jet packs for aerial assaults.  If Ôtomo did not read Jules Verne at some point in his life I would be really surprised, because \\"Steamboy\\" owes as much to Verne's writing as it does to James Bond spy films and Tom Swfit adventures.<br /><br />However, the story is just not up to the grandeur of the animation, which involves not only the captivating combination of hand-drawn animation and computers, but also some great camera movement.  If this were a live-action film we would be talking about the impressive cinematography, especially since Ôtomo seems to make a point of going for angles you are unlikely to get in the real world.  So there is more than just the retro look of \\"Steamboy\\" to recommend when it comes to the visuals of this 2004 film.  But Ôtomo does not explore the steam technology as much as I would have liked, so that a promising idea becomes rather conventional and the substance behind the style ends up being disappointing.  Even the big debate behind the power play is childishly simplistic, so we are not dealing with a potent allegory either.  Besides, I was waiting for there to be more of a payoff to the character of Scarlett O'Hara (Kari Wahlgren).  Then again, it is entirely possible that Ôtomo is never going to top \\"Akira\\" (what has James Cameron really done since \\"Titanic\\"?) and even with its faults \\"Steamboy\\" is certainly worth watching.ented by atomic power).

B000AA4JMK|5.0|Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist received a musical adaptation in 1968 by Sir Carol Reed, and who would not be better than Reed to shoot this film.  A man with films such as Fallen Idol (1948), The Third Man (1949) and Our Man in Havana (1959) on his repertoire could generate the essential gloominess of Oliver Twist.  After all, visually he displayed his cinematic eye in The Third Man where he captured the dark and ominous atmosphere of Vienna's black market and underworld.  However, musicals tend to be perky and upbeat and this would be a sacrilegious illustration of Oliver Twist, as the story highlights the unjust social system under which many children were crushed under the advancement of the Industrial Revolution.  Thus, Reed faced a predicament, as he set out to make a musical based on one of the darker pieces of classic British literature.<br /><br />Oliver!, as Reed's cinematic version was titled, keeps close to the original tale of the orphan Oliver Twist who grew up under the abusive circumstances at a workhouse.  Workhouses were created to handle people with minor law violations, but also destitute and orphaned children.  Within these workhouses the conditions were often harsh and brutal while the inhabitants were forced into labor, as the managers ran the workhouses as they saw fit without consideration of humanity and compassion.  The film opens with a sketch that fades into motion where a small group of young orphans tread a crude machine into movement.  The first thought that strikes the audience is slavery, which is shortly followed by the dangers of the work environment.  Oliver is one of the kids that works on the wooden grinder that processes corn by striding the machine into movement.  To fully understand the situation of Oliver Twist, one must contemplate the historical, political and religious climate of the time, as the story presents a strong social criticism concealed under the fictitious tale of Oliver.<br /><br />Born in the workhouse as an illegitimate child, Oliver was placed on the fringe of society due to Christian values imposed by the leaders of the Church. In the workhouse, as we already know, he was forced into labor as a youngster while the common uneducated notion was that Oliver and kids alike were a bunch of freeloaders. In addition, some decades before Oliver Twist was written, more precisely 1815, the Corn Laws were introduced into the British Commonwealth. The Corn Laws implied that until the cost of corn reached a specific amount, no foreign corn could be imported onto British soil. Consequently, the price of food went up and the people were forced to spend most of their money on food while other merchandise became unessential, as food is a requirement for survival. Thus, in the light of this information, the audience can get a more accurate view of the opening and the desperation in which many characters lived.<br /><br />It is a rather grim historical and political perspective that Dickens presented to the public, and in the light of the governmental abuses of children, it might be rather distressing to hear that a musical was to be made of this tragic story.  Nonetheless, Reed approached the material with tactfulness while remaining true to the darker elements of the story.  For example, shortly after the scene of the kids treading on the machine, a group of wealthy and obese gentle men inspect the Workhouse.  However, instead of joining the orphans in their meal of gruel (made by the rest of the products that they cannot sell after having ground the corn) they enter a secluded area where a feast of meat, poultry, and other delicacies awaits.  This simple presentation of the socioeconomic levels offers a direct and transparent view of how the old British society oppressed most innocents - the children - for financial gain.<br /><br />The story continues with Oliver meeting the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild), Fagin (Ron Moody), Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed), and many others when he escapeshis socially accepted bully and owner.  Through these characters, Reed captures Dickens socioeconomic status of the environment where the children act like miniature adults, as they smoke, steal, and dress like adults.  In addition, Reed displays the darkness of the environment in an authentic manner, as everything seems to be covered by soot generated by an overpopulated London and the Industrial Revolution's wonders.  The soot also presents a symbolic analogy to the political and economical situation, as the future seems oppressively bleak due to restrictive societal rights and an increasing poverty that no one can escape.  Thus, an emerging understanding for the desperation of many surfaces, as theft, exploitation of youth, and other illegal acts are committed.  Despite an increasing understanding for the desperate, both Dickens and Reed agree in their illustrations of Oliver Twist that certain behaviors are undesirable, which come to life through the character Bill Sikes.<br /><br />The knighted film director Sir Carol Reed took on Charles Dickens' majestic literary piece Oliver Twist and created a musical to which many might initially have had raised their objections.  However, Reed presents a tasteful adaptation that portrays the hopelessness, desperation, and a time of need for social change through the innocent child Oliver Twist. Song and music become an additional tool for Reed to display the miserable conditions of the people of the time.  Songs like \\"You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two\\" and \\"Food, Glorious Food\\" help enhance the visual experience, as the songs provide a new perspective on the socioeconomic setting.  Ultimately, the film offers an innovative viewpoint of a serious tale that will help others to open their minds and begin to contemplate the unjust world and its many transgressions against children and others less fortunate.<br /><br />Oliver! was a hit when it arrived to the Oscars in 1969, as it was nominated for 11 Oscars and brought home six of them such as Best Picture and Best Director.  These Oscars by themselves should tell the audience that this film is worth seeing, but if the viewers still are hesitant about this film, I must say that Oliver! offers a terrific cinematic experience.  Ron Moody's performance as Fagin is brilliant, he did not win the Oscar for this art, as it went to Cliff Robertson in Charly (1968), but it is a performance worth experiencing.  Personally, I thought Oliver Twist (1948) by David Lean was a straw better, but then again I am not partial to musicals.

068987474X|5.0|Great book! I loved it! Good and easy reading to help you through a time of questionning the validity and quality of what you're doing in your relationship, or who you're in the relationship with. The authors answer your questions with ease, humor and sarcasm! They don't keep you guessing AT ALL on how they feel. I liked the male and female perspective in each chapter. I liked the way they empowered the reader and made you feel like they were speaking specifically to you, the reader. It's good to read once, and then reference certain chapters a few more times to drill what they're saying in your head! I'd definetly recommend it.

B00006JDS4|4.0|I saw this when I was at a college reunion and it was graphic then, now even more so.  It is a tale of rightful revenge and basic human instincts.  The right of a person to be free to do what is fair and honest and the right to defend when those rights are violated.  A woman writer is in the backwoods for solitude and writing.  Her peace is shattered by four overly base and vile males hicks who decide she is a plaything.  The graphic rape scenes and sodomy makes you want to kill every male around you.  She survives and plots her revenge in four unique ways which are worthy of emulation in our court rooms.  I won't ruin the climax scene for the final revenge, but the film is worthy of a look, even if for it's lessons learned...that's my take anyway...Q
B000A0GP4K|5.0|His Bobness speaks! A well concieved and executed film that should delight any Bob Dylan fan, and should give those who previoiusly just didn't get it a perspective that puts what all the fuss is about in focus.  A nearly perfect film, with comments from Joan Baez, Dave Von Ronk, Allen Ginsberg, Al Kooper, and many others to help explain the many facets of Dylan.   <br /> <br />The film gives an illusion of being so near comprehensive that it begs the question: why no mention of Ramblin' Jack Elliot? And, considering the long professional and personal relationship between Marty and Robbie, why no interview with Robbie Roberston? <br /> <br />These are minor complaints, however. The overall effect of the insightful interviews, fantastic rare archival footage, and dynamic editing make for a compelling documentary about America's greatest song and dance man of the 20th Century.  I watched the entire DVD in one shot.  I will wait with great anticipation for the next installment of this important documentary.
B00004CWO8|5.0|I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since \\"The Nutcracker\\" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet.

B000059QY3|5.0|Angela Gheorghiu singing is incredibly beautiful, and that she can act and looks every inch Violetta- that's just the icing on the cake. This production's Alfredo and Germont may not be the best, and orchestra playing, while good throughout the whole opera, does not stand out but that only puts Gheorghiu to the front and righfully so. A star was indeed born that night. She is so young and almost fragile here but it is very clear that she has the makings of a diva of the highest order. What a performance- and what luck that we have a record of it!
B0000508U6|5.0|Yeah, everyone (except the Coldplay haters) loves \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\", but what makes Parachutes special are the lesser-known songs that give the album its original, indie-rock identity. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Panic\\" packs a pithy punch of melancholy optimism, while the mind-blowing conclusion of \\"Shiver\\" commands your full attention. \\"Sparks\\" is the one that causes shivers, though. <br /> <br />\\"High Speed\\" exudes a nonchalant confidence that embraces uncertainty, while \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" encourages a glass-half-full introspection. This moody, provocative--yet understated--collection is the must-have rainy-day album.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is one of those beautiful movies that lets you see a reflection of your own humanity.  Whether you are the slave trader, the priest, the politician, or the innocent, you will truly see a reflection of who you are in the story of this movie.  That is not to say that you are going to find the meaning of life just by watching this film, but you may get a better understanding of how the many different types of people in this world interact with eachother.  Please watch this movie with an open mind and an open heart.  I know that I wanted to be a better human being after seeing this story.  <br /> <br />If you don't have a wide screen TV, please find a friend who does, because this is one of those rare movies where the beauty of the scenery makes all the difference in the world.  If I had a better TV, I would watch this film at least once a week, just to remind myself of who I want to be, and what I want to accomplish in this world.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|It is a must see movie for any academic oriented person. The kind of hardship John Nash faced and the way he overcame it, is a good lesson for any young scientist. The organization of facts is so beautiful that it provoked thought process. Once again it is proved that a person can do anything in life if he has the willpower. <br />I loved this movie and probably will see a number of times.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Just like his debut effort, Josh Groban's 2003 sophomoric Closer is a sterling reminder of how some classical-sounding adult contemporary can be like a breath of fresh air in today's hyped-up mishmash of an industry.  Being myself a classically trained performer currently studying at the most prestigious contemporary music school in the world (with past industry offers), the only male singer these days I can admire is Josh Groban, mainly because he and I sound almost the same.  His crystal clear tone fits perfectly in the classical mold laid by his coach David Foster's productions featured prominently on Closer.  But like his first disc, Closer features a handful of sterling surefire-hit tunes between decent but somewhat tepid filler.  \\"When You Say You Love Me,\\" \\"Remember When It Rained\\" and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" are all beautiful, but tracks like \\"Per Te\\" and \\"Caruso,\\" though nicely performed, are hardly as likeable (non-classical fanatics may find themselves skipping these kind of songs).  Still, Closer's few hit tracks make a lasting impression in the classical music world and make this album worth purchasing...and yet, somehow it feels as though Josh Groban could've gotten much closer. <br />**** <br />For more information on the singer Chris Eberlein, please go to his About You profile section on Amazon.
038533348X|1.0|Do you believe in anything?  Do you think there is any importance to life (at all)?  Well, the whole point of this book is that life means zilch.  Religion is a crutch, politics is a crutch.  Everything means nothing.  I wonder why some people like to be this pessimisstic.  Why people want to believe that life means nothing.  If life means nothing, then why don't we go on murder rampages?  Why don't we steal, rape, and loot?  What's the point of trying to teach a lesson if life means nothing?  There is no point.  One of the previous reviews mentioned Catcher in the Rye.  Awesome Book.  Actually has a postive message.  This book just encourages you to leave all your beliefs behind you and think that the whole world is an accident.  I dread reading this next semester in my lit. class.  I already did in my sophmore year, and it just about killed me.
0385338686|3.0|I have LOVED all of Sophie Kinsella's books, however this one did not live up to my expectations.  It began great and had a cute ending, but it lost my interest in the middle.  It was a quick read but not my favorite.
B000002549|5.0|I can't say that Ms. Streisand is \\"the minx\\" when it comes to classical training but she has a natural and hardworking gift. She possesses a  faultless dedication to her craft that I can truly appreciate. This CD is not a new release, (I have it on wax) but this fantasy-like music lulled my three-year old to afternoon naps for two years and I am classically grateful. <br /> <br />In this CD, it is her amazing vocal control and most especially, her need not to BOMBAST the listener with musical ploys that is to be commended. She has selected classic pieces and a variety of composers to lull us to another place. Some of her selections work better than others, but her musical choices are always amazing. well done and musically subtle.  <br /> <br />If you have a little child that needs soothing or if you need quiet, calming music sung from a very carefully studied songbook, you will enjoy this timeless musical massage.  <br /> <br />As someone who was trained as a classical singer, I was familiar with all of Ms. Striesand's choices. Although no Price or Sills, she still pulls it off with style through thoughtful phrasing and vocal reserve. My favorites are Aprs un rve, Op. 7/1 by Faure and In Trutina, from Carmina Burana by Carl Orff. Finally, whatever she lacked in classical training, she more than made up for in interpretation and complete understanding of the text. So lovely. Brava! <br /> <br />I must Ms. Streisand credit...she took on something she had no experience doing and made it work in her special way. She is no small egoist and a perfectionist, and publicly not endearing or warm to many of us.  However, she has that true storyteller's talent and understands, even in Latin, how to tell her story. <br /> <br />P.S. Not for impervious classicists, dotty tradionalists, or peevish intractables! <br />

B00006FM77|4.0|This set ain't cheap, but it's a must for the Chicago fan. Of the four new songs, three (Loneliness Is Just A Word, Listen, and Hour In The Shower) are treats, while one (Free Form Intro (Nasaltones) is typical early Robert Lamm noodling that sounds like it was written during soundcheck (which it was). The four alternate versions (Introduction, South California Purples, Sing A Mean Tune Kid, and 25 Or 6 To 4) compare nicely to the versions used on the original four album Carnegie Hall set. Plus it's always nice to hear more Terry Kath, one of the great underrated guitar stylists in an era filled with them. The real plus of this collection is the vast improvement in the sound, where Jimmy Pankow relinquishes his title as head kazooist to become a trombone player again. The reproduced posters from the album are nice too, though not a deal-maker. The keys here are four new songs and enhanced sound quality. Hats off to Rhino, who probably won't make a whole lot of money off of this collection, but has earned the everlasting appreciation of this fan for finally releasing this and all the other Chicago remasters.

This takes nothing from the fact tha Jesus was truly a great man and prophet - but only a man.<br /><br />just a real thriller - which also leaves you many thing sto ponder.<br /><br />Rich - Singapore
B00005K3OT|5.0|I loved the overall themes in this movie.  In fact, a guest speaker at my church once did an entire sermon on the spiritual messages of Chocolat.  I have been afflicted with wanderlust ever since I was a child, and so Vianne's constant moving spoke to me.  I also enjoyed the themes of acceptance and redemption and people's ability to change, even when you think they couldn't possibly.  Entertaining in and of itself, this film has some wonderful messages not so carefully hidden.  Great performances across the board.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Hi I'm not a big Dire Straits fan but this SACD has great sound, it sounds great through a surround system, but if you crank Money for Nothing up through a decent HI-FI it sounds amazing because apart from being SACD it is also a HDCD.
B000001FN3|5.0|I was talking with friends about this album when I decided to check if it had ever been released on CD (I originally had it on tape).  I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  It was just as good as I remembered, even though I hadn't heard it in nearly a decade.  There are some songs which sound a bit dated, but I love the overblown nature of it ... perfectly fitting its grand intention of setting such classic literature to music.  Surprisingly, my 10-year-old son really loves it as well.
1400032717|1.0|I do not understand what the big hype is over this book. I bought it after reading good reviews and finding it to be on the best seller's list for a while. As soon as I started reading it...I was redicuously confused as to what this kid was alll about. I understood he had a problem and it is narrated by him...but Mark Haddon could have made this more clear somehow even if in speaches of the father.  The character had NO CLUE about life outside of suburbia...which he couldn't even handle that.  I feel bad...but I did not even find it moving...maybe if I could relate more. In addition I had to give na oral book report about it...which was probally the hardest oral report I have given. So, in conclusion, unless you can REALY RELATE to this...don't WASTE YOUR MONEY. I ended up giving it to my neighbor, who works with autistic kids. She said it was interesting to say the least but she find some things funny cause she could relate it to her kids and she loves working with them. In addition...if you need to choose a book for a report...DON' GET IT.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I was so paranoid that the producers of Atlantis were going to make a huge mistake, and that the series would be canceled after only a few episodes. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />The SG-1 team discovered the city of the Ancients, Atlantis, and sent an exploratory team. They ended up getting trapped there, with no way home...at first. <br /> <br />The series has its nemesis, the Wraith, a race of beings that were accidentally created by the Ancients experimenting on a large insect that drained life energy from its host. Thus, they created a humanoid race that preyed upon them, eventually driving them out of the galaxy. <br /> <br />This is a great start to the series. Character development has been slow in places, but even the great SG-1 had some slow spots, although season 1 for SG-1 was filled with it. In Atlantis, they have spent lots of time fleshing out the enemy, so that we don't keep thinking that the Goa'uld are going to show up at some point as the evil forces bent on their destruction. <br /> <br />I hope this is the first of many seasons, and if you're a fan of SG-1, it won't take much to cross you over to Atlantis.

It has helped my writing become more precise and clearer, and has helped to be mindful of many important things I had never even thought of.  A good writer will take the time to learn the rules of his trade, if for no other reason that to see which ones he needs, and this is a great place to start learning those rules.<br /><br />This book is by no means a complete resource, but it is the perfect starting place for anyone wishing to sharpen his or her prose, and you will find yourself going back to it again and again, even after you've read countless other manuals and built for years on this little book's foundation.<br /><br />This book will teach you, shape you, and guide you, and it may turn you into an obnoxious person that no one will like.

B00079HZUM|5.0|The historical accuracy is marvelous. This film should have swept the Oscars, but no one I know had evern heard of it. I think it is much better than Shakespeare in love. Bully Crudup is sensational. The directing is fantastic. The screen play is one of the best I've seen. I am proud to have it in my collection.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Lowbrow and pretty stupid horror movie that lacks screenplay to not only explains what is going on but a lead actor who can act. Keanu Reeves is the gapping hole that sinks this ship and his performance will be remembered as one of the worse performances ever in a major motion picture. It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking. <br /> <br />If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess. If you want to save your dignity and your eyes, skip this film.  <br />

I get everything; movies, TV shows, 50's serials.. anything. Which means I have a fair amount of crap, and that's fine. I can usually tell if they're going to be awful, but I really didn't think Marvel's Man Without Fear would join the cream of the crap.<br /><br />For the record, I really do enjoy reading Daredevil comics.

OK, Daredevil certainly LOOKS the part. His costume and the effects are great, if nowhere near as jaw-dropping as (the earlier) Spider-Man. Bullseye, sans costume (a big shame) is the best thing in the movie, in that he's, what's the word? Ah yes - interesting. He's not anything like the Bullseye from the comics, but he's still the most watchable.<br /><br />Elektra's in here too, and is about as interesting as watching bathwater pour down the plughole. As is Daredevil. In the comics he's brooding, but still funny. In this he's not even brooding - he's just boring. Ben Affleck really can't add \\"depth\\" to his actor's CV, because other than, well, doing what Ben Affleck does (do let me know what that is), he doesn't do much else.<br /><br />The Kingpin is black, which is a bit of a weird turn but fair enough. And guess what he is, too? Yup - you guessed it - BORRRRRRING. He smokes a big cigar and throws a rose on his victim's chests (wrong villain, dumbasses) and that's about it. The Kingpin is a huge powerhouse of a man, very literate and, done right, could have been a brilliant villain (even the cartoon series has more depth than this version). Michael Clarke Duncan is a superb actor, but he's given nothing to work with here. It's a waste of an actor and a character.<br /><br />So, we've got boring hero, boring love interest and boring villains. Uh-oh. What else?  Oh yeah - the boring story makes NO SENSE. Matt Murdoch is blind but has a secret radar-sense that gives him abilities above that of a normal man. You get that word there, Matt? SECRET? Isn't it a bit of a giveaway to your powers and stuff to be staging a mock fight in a park with Elektra (that'll be an attempt at trying to build up some chemistry and interest in their romance - that failed), with backflips and running up ramps and God knows what else - in front of about 100 people watching?  And not ONE person thinks \\"that guy isn't really blind\\", let alone, \\"oh, well - that'll be Daredevil, then\\".<br /><br />Just one in a series of howlers that makes for one depressing mess of a film. I haven't seen the Directors Cut of this yet (it'll be bought one day). Unless the Director \\"Cut\\" the entire film I really don't know what improvements could be made. Come back Howard The Duck, all is forgiven.<br /><br />[...]the cartoon series has more depth than this version). Michael Clarke Duncan is a superb actor, but he's given nothing to work with here.

B00026WU4G|5.0|I don't get why people don't like this more. Maybe it's because, even though he ditched the born-again attitude, there's still a very Old Testament vibe running through it. There is a lot of finger-pointing on this album, but unlike his early 60's work the finger is pointed the wrong way.  \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" and \\"Sundown on the Union\\" are CONSERVATIVE songs, and Dylan fans can't handle that. Now mind you, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool liberal.  But this album transcends politics. Those songs aren't great because they espouse a reactionary viewpoint - they're great because they ROCK. This is one of the rockinest of all Dylan records, and it sounds great, thanks to Mark Knopfler, Sly and Robbie, etc. <br /> <br />I also don't get those people who say that this album should be criticized for what it's NOT.  Yeah, sure, it would have sounded better with Blind Willie McTell, Foot of Pride, etc., but what album wouldn't? I have no earthly idea why Dylan chose to leave those great songs off (maybe he just wanted to stir up controversy, or secure his reputation as the most bootlegged artist in the world).  But that has nothing to do with what Infidels IS: another in a string of masterpieces.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|While a bit formulaic, MONA LISA SMILE manages to escape the chains of the \\"inspiring teacher\\" format, if only for short periods of time.  During these moments, we feel as if we are glimpsing something real, a teacher who is not invincible, who does not know everything, etc.  Like many films about teaching these days, the plot suffers from a dual burden: how do we both explore the life of the teacher AND the lives of her students.  In the end, it is a losing battle, and very few films manage to pull it off.  The ones that do succeed (for example, DEAD POETS SOCIETY), do so because they ultimately choose one over the other.<br /><br />I brought up the movie, so I might as well complete the comment that has been made over and over again: MONA LISA SMILE feels very much like a female-version of DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  The difference here is that the \\"tradition\\" that threatens to break the wills of the students is not merely a New England prep-school mentality--it is the bonds of patriarchy.  This lends extra \\"bite\\" to the themes in the film and provide for a compelling storyline.<br /><br />Overall, Roberts does a fantastic job owning the screen and we root for her all the way.  MONA LISA SMILE is not the best \\"teaching\\" film I've seen recently, but it certainly is not the worst either.  If you have any love of the genre, you have to check it out.
B00008G9JM|5.0|The critics savaged this record when it first came out. Why I'm not sure, since they seemed to like Thick As A Brick - so it wasn't the length of it that bothered them. In fact, an advance of it was released to radio stations that \\"cut up\\" the song into ten \\"edits.\\" Fact is, those edits play very well as individual songs.  I don't think you have to know about the philosphical underpinnings and Danteesque plot to like APP. Just listen to the sound. It's eerie, as perfectly befits a trip to the nether world, but it's also beautiful and uplifting. I agree with those who say the fairy tale in the middle spoils the mood.  The first half of Side Two (of the original LP) contains simply some of the best rock music ever created.

B000001ED1|5.0|Joan Osborne has never come close to reaching the level of her first major-label record. But few people have.  She can rock, she can blooz, she can even go folkie. This album sizzles from start to finish. \\"St. Theresa\\" starts it off strongly--every time I hear the opening of this song I think of the Doors' \\"L.A. Woman\\", but this is actually a superior song. After that most of the tunes are more of the gutbucket, early-Bonnie-Raitt variety.  \\"Let's Get Naked\\" is as hot as the title implies; \\"Right Hand Man\\" is an irresistable scorcher; \\"Crazy Baby\\" closes it out (other than the throwaway \\"Lumina\\") in grand fashion.<br /><br />And yes, I agree with those people who say that \\"One of Us\\" is one of the weaker cuts on the album. Although I will say this: to all you folks who said the song was irreverent and irreligious, go read the New Testament. The subject of this song is basically the central message of the gospel.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is the album that defines what punk is. Few albums before or after come close to the raw power and anger that are in the tracks on this album. It may have not been the first punk album, but it is as good a starting point as any if you want to start a primo punk rock collection. Also try the Dead Kennedy's, Black Flag, Fear, The Stranglers, and Iggy Pop.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Many people think Mel Gibson is a good actor and a good director, when he just makes people waste their time.

B0007M22TI|5.0|The performance and quality of the video was excellent. The variety and quality of the performance by these five women was excellent. The final number \\"I will Raise You Up\\" was outstanding. The intensity of the performance was greatly enhanced by the background choral and instrumentation skills of the orchestra. I would higly recommend this high quality performance to those who enjoy Celtic music.
074322454X|4.0|Steven Ambrose is the historian for the masses. He writes in a concise manner that anyone can breeze thru but uses a fair amount of imagry to create a novel instead of a history book. Obviously, watching the mini-series is much more enjoyable after reading this book. The greatest reason this is true is the knowledge of all the names/identies so when the directors accent certain events, you aren't trying to understand what, who or when. If you're a history buff, WWII dork, or like me (little bit of both) you'll want to read this book.

Why do so many of you expect them to stay the same?  That's boring. I applaud them for stepping outside and trying different things. They did a superb job with American Idiot, a CD which I've most likely listened to 1000 times and still haven't gotten sick of.      Also, stop calling it \\"teeny pop.\\"  It's not POP. Just because certain pop radio stations choose to play Boulevard of Broken dreams and Wake me Up When Sept Ends, doesn't mean GD is a POP group, marketing to \\"teenies.\\"   The TRUE Green Day fans understand and know that they have produced an AWESOME album.

0440418569|5.0|_The Amber Spyglass_ is the final volume in the His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman.  There are a lot of loose ends to be tied up from the Subtle Knife, and I was worried that Pullman wouldn't be able to do it properly - even in the 500+ pages that he  had. Not only are all of the questions posed in the first two books answered - Pullman is able to introduce new characters just as complex as those in the first two novels, (How AWESOME are the Gallavespians? And how SCARY was Father Gomez?), and yet finish off the trilogy with all of the characters fully realized, and every question answered. My heart was racing with anticipation of the next event in the novel until the very end - liek the other books in the trilogy, I couldn't put this one down.<br /><br />  Some reviews have mentioned dissappointment with the ending, and this, to some extent, is understandable. However, I think that it is important to remember that in every fantasy novel, in every fantastical universe, no matter how fantastical a universe it may be, there are rules. I loved the universe that Pullman was able to create with these novels, and he was consistant with the rules of his imaginary universe to the very end - a very difficult but important task for a writer of fantasy, and a sign of true genius in a writer who can pull it off.<br /><br />  I hear that Tom Stoppard is writing the screenplay, and I can't wait.
B00005JMJG|2.0|The only positive thing I can say about this movie was, that it was different than most.  I thought the movie was okay, but nothing to write home about.  It's worth seeing once.
B00003CXC7|4.0|-- but it aged.<br /><br />Too many anachronistic bits got in the way for me, I just couldn't connect. The movie's coloring was so brash as to suggest colorization in many places, even though I withold that charge. The whole premise, of in-home care paid for by the insurance company (!) and of six weeks' incapacitation for a broken leg - well, that was all long before the 'walking cast'. Even Ms. (sorry, Miss) Torso in the window across the street, she was built like a futbolista, like a powerful woman in command of her body. She was - she was a dancer, but that was back when dancers were superb athletes first, not a DSM IV category.<br /><br />Grace Kelly did a lot to illustrate the vision of 'glamor' of the 1950s. She may also have done a fair bit to demonstrate how a proper lady may express her serious intent to a gentleman, inviting herself for an overnight visit, showing her preparatations, and dang the nosy visitors. Maybe back then it was risque (or worse). Today it would scarcely raise an eyebrow, more likely a smile wishing the best to both. If the lesson is still needed anywhere, this is the very best of how a girl may present her interests to a boy without pretense and with allure.<br /><br />All the McGuffins got to me, though. The newlyweds, the composer-for-hire, the dancer, even \\"Miss Lonelyheart.\\" I guess I've gotten used to a denser style of story-telling in the half-a-hundred years since this movie came out. It's good, but there are other Hitchcocks that I like lots better.<br /><br />//wiredweird

In the year 1300 AD, the Book disappeared.\\" <br /> <br />Well, Anchor Bay has done it again.   <br /> <br />I don't subscribe to that philosophy that there can be too much of a good thing.  Don't get me wrong, endless double dipping video releases are quite commonplace nowadays, and I have been guilty of indulging in re-buying for added disks and new features.  Sometimes I wait for extended editions (Lord of the Rings, anybody?)   <br /> <br />But, I don't even remotely consider the release of Evil Dead II, Book of the Dead edition as double dipping.  This is an entirely different proposition.   <br /> <br />Everyone that is lucky enough to own a copy of the deluxe edition of Evil Dead knows what I mean.  It's not just a DVD, it's a packaging delight (and makes for one HELL of a Halloween decoration.)  And now, Anchor Bay gives us another Halloween gift...The Book of the Dead- Evil Dead 2 style.  Amazingly rendered, incredibly well sculpted.  <br /> <br />Features?  Widescreen Edition.  Unrated. The insanely funny commentary from Raimi, Campbell, Spiegel and Nicotero.  The FANTASTIC \\"The Gore The Merrier\\" featurette.  Theatrical trailer.  Talent bios.  AND.....a new feature; Evil Dead 2: Behind the Screams.  Gone is the horrible advert for \\"Hail to the King\\"....I mean, who wants to see a video game promo?  This is Evil Dead 2 CANON.  Only thing missing that I can tell is a full screen edition (bleah) and Still Galleries (whatever.) <br /> <br />This is what you call ULTIMATE Edition. If you haven't bought Evil Dead 2 before, this is the one.  If you have, it's still the one.  I'm planning to give my old copy to a friend of mine, to get them hooked on it.

B000000WFF|5.0|I bought the Spice Girls' second album, Spiceworld, at one of my local music stores several months ago.  The reason why I bought it is because I absolutely loved Spice, their debut album, and I thought this album would be good too.  Here are my reviews for Spiceworld: <br /> <br />1) Spice Up Your Life- Awesome song to dance to! 10/10 <br />2) Stop- A great song that has a Motown-like feel to it, although I hate Motown. I love this one anyway! 10/10 <br />3) Too Much- Slow and upbeat. 9/10 <br />4) Saturday Night Divas- Pretty cool. 9/10 <br />5) Never Give Up On The Good Times- Excellent tune that sounds a bit disco-ish. 10/10 <br />6) Move Over- A rock-tinged song that definitely rocks my world! 9/10 <br />7) Do It- Love it! 9/10 <br />8) Denying- A little slow, but equally awesome. 8/10 <br />9) Viva Forever- Has a Spanish guitar sound to it, but sappy. 8/10 <br />10) The Lady Is A Vamp- A good song that has a fun swingy-like beat to it. 9/10 <br /> <br />I would recommend this CD to everybody!  I will keep it in my music collection for a long time.
B0002DB52M|2.0|I just finished watching Dogville. The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story. Dogville had so much potential.
0345451325|5.0|I read this novel because my son has read all three Halo novels and he practically begged me to read them also. We also have both Halo XBOX games so I kind of already knew what it was all about, and figured this would be third-rate science fiction, I mean, how could a novel connected to an XBOX game be serious? Boy, was I wrong! This is serious, hard-core science fiction, these kinds of novels are what made me fall in love with science fiction decades ago. Eric Nylund is a superb writer, and his prose is in an easy to read, flowing style, and I can say that this novel is a page-turner. It covers events prior to the first XBOX game, first encounters with the Covenant, detailing the training Master Chief had to undergo, and the exploits of Captain Keyes, it really explains the matters behind the game. Action-packed would be a sure way to describe this novel. About a month or more ago my son and I agreed that Halo would make a great movie, or movies, and about two weeks later, on the net, an article said that Microsoft plans a movie, and is making sure that the studio selected follows the books and games closely, hooray for Microsoft, too many movies have been made using 'artistic license', vaguely following the book and creating a poor/incomprehensible product. The movie should include all of this book, definitely.  <br /> <br />To critic this novel is somewhat difficult to do, but it does seem strange to me that 500 years from now there are no life-extending therapies, as people continue to grow old, and where is the nanotechnology and nano-weapons, there are none! The novel does include such things as cloning, copying brain scans onto A.I. substrates, cyogenic storage, etc.. I await in anticipation the upcoming movie, and additional novels. Now, on to the second novel, THE FLOOD.

B00005JLKB|4.0|In Smallville, the *possible* life of high school aged Clark Kent is explored.  Perfectly cast in Tom Welling, we see a naive Clark, raised with down-home virtue by Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole).  The Kents live on a farm in Smallville, Kansas, which is also new home to rich, spoiled 20-something Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum).  Through the pilot, we see how the lives of these iconic characters overlap.  Much of this season is spent dealing with \\"freak of the week\\" villains, but there are several worthwhile moments.  Season two picks up steam, especially with the introduction of the late Christopher Reeve as Virgil Swann.  Definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a Superman/Sci-fi fan.

The music really is a critical part of the quality of the show, and this CD accents that fact. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I'm unlikely to listen to this for the music alone.

B000007OTH|4.0|It's only a slight reticence in the recorded tone that prevents me from giving the full 5 stars to this 2-disc set. In every other way it has a great deal going for it. Bruch is sadly and most unjustly neglected except for the first violin concerto, the Scottish Fantasia and Kol Nidrei in my own experience. His music is outstandingly beautiful and individual, not in my own opinion showing any undue influence from Mendelssohn much less from Schumann. To my ears these masters are no doubt part of the general romantic background that the next generation absorbed, but Bruch has a thoroughly personal style and sound of his own. If your German or French is up to it read the liner note in one of these languages rather than the English one, which is a very inferior effort from another hand. If you're stuck with English, forget Mr Fifield's gratuitous and unenlightening fixation with Mendelssohn and Schumann. Bruch's range of expression is not particularly wide, but his melodic line is stronger than Mendelssohn's, the construction of his works is more fluent than Schumann's, not to say a lot better orchestrated, and he does not sound in the least like either of them.<br /><br />Bruch's three symphonies are not far behind his concertos in attractiveness, the third being perhaps the best. However one should `rate' him in some pantheon of 19th century composers, it seems to me only fair to say that they are more even in quality than those of his nearer contemporaries Tchaikovsky and Dvorak. The performances strike me as being in general excellent, with speeds well judged and the rich late-romantic idiom put over with understanding and affection. The Leipzig orchestra is not one to let us down in any way, and the solo spots must have been most gratifying to the section principals, particularly, I'd guess, to the clarinettist. The recordings of all the works comprising this set were done over the period 1977-88, except perhaps that of the A minor Romanze which for some reason we are not told. The recorded quality is not bad by any means, but I couldn't shake off the sense that the orchestral effect needs more `presence' and general lustre to it. Bruch's sound, not just in his orchestral compositions but in some chamber works that I also know and own in recordings, is highly and outstandingly beautiful and mellifluous, rich without being over-ripe. I would have liked it more `in my face', so to speak, and I found that this sense coloured my reaction to the pieces with solo violin. On another day I might have thought the solo instrument too close, but here I was glad of the impact of Accardo's intense and strong-toned playing, full of soul and heart, by way of contrast. These four shortish numbers are Bruch at his very best, and it was high time I got to know them and to have the opportunity to recommend them to anyone with ears to hear.<br /><br />This is a lovely pair of discs, minor reservations notwithstanding. How music of this quality has managed to stay as unfamiliar as it seems to have done is not something I can offer a good explanation for. If you don't wish it to stay unfamiliar to you, the remedy is here to hand.told.

B000AARKO4|3.0|I recently saw the 2005 film THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, a sword and shield epic centered upon the 1187 recapture of Jerusalem from the Christians by \\"Saladin\\". The hero of the film was not Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), but rather Balian (Orlando Bloom), who, as the film opens, is sweating over a hot forge as a sword maker in some dump of a rural French town in the early 1180s. Then, along comes Godfrey (Liam Neeson), a knight and minor noble back from Palestine, who reveals himself as Balian's previously unknown father. Godfrey persuades Balian to take up a sword in defense of the Holy Land. On the return trip, Godfrey dies, but not before knighting his son. Balian subsequently inherits his father's castle of Ibelin within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, becomes chummy with King Baldwin IV and his sister Sibylla (Eva Green), finds himself defending the Holy City almost single-handed against Saladin's horde after the Christian army's disastrous defeat at Hitton, and ultimately returns to France, where he ostensibly lives happily ever after with Sibylla, who now holds the title Queen of Jerusalem.  <br /> <br />Now that is how Hollywood put it together, but if you really want to understand history better, then you need to pick up \\"SALADIN AND THE FALL OF JERUSALEM\\" book by Stanley Lane-Poole, David Nicolle, to find out the real story.  <br /> <br />And what of Balian? While he was one of only three knights left after the Battle of Hitton to defend Jerusalem, and who indeed played the key role in the defense of the city and subsequent surrender negotiations with Saladin, Balian had only a relatively small part in the rest of the story - so small that I had to resort to a Web encyclopedia to get more info about the man. What I learned there was that his saga in THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN was rampant fiction evidently hallucinated by a Hollywood screenwriter in the throes of an illegal substance. Especially that bit about running off with Sybilla. wow, why doesn't that surprise me? <br />
B00006690G|5.0|Oh please! <br />I think Eminem is the rap equivalent of Elvis Presley. I first heard of Eminem when I heard a kid in year four whining about how his mum won't let him buy it. I decided to check him out. I love him and so does my cousin. I'm 13 and quite jealous of my cousin cos he gets to listen to Eminem when he was 12 and my Mum still won't let me listen to him! At the rate I'm going, I'll be lucky to see 8 Mile, she's sooo conservative and she thinks 16 is old enough! Sh*t! I should burn it off my friend, I want it that much! And as for all you conservative parents/people going ahhh - my little Dorothy learnt to swear by listening to Eminem! - give me a break! Same to all you religious people. If God really plans everything and planned for Eminem to become what he is, then I really don't think he would have done it if he didn't think it was very nice. So stop giving him a hard time! Geeze, he's had to put up with his Dad walking out, witnessing his mum's boyfriends beating her up, being barred from seeing his own daughter when he'd done nothing to deserve it and being poor! He deserves to be where he's at now! He's talented and my singing teacher thinks he's really clever! What's more, he  uses his talent! He's a good person inside, he just had a terrible childhood! So don't hate him, pity him! He's had a hard life, no wonder he has no respect for the authorities! He's a good father to Hayley! So f**kin' get off his back! His music has to be among the bestest I've ever listened to, and my only regret is that I can't get it cos I'm not allowed to!
B000005Z0G|5.0|This album is an answer to 2pacalypse now. after making that album vice president at the time said that this album has no place in our society. 2pac embraces this in the track \\"Pac's Theme\\". Here is where he makes less music on political issues compared 2 his first album. But nonetheless he does make great songs. My favorites are Keep Ya Head up, and Last Wordz feat Ice cube and Ice t. I reccomend buying this if your into old school, funky beat rap.
0679879269|5.0|I had a wonderful time reading the trilogy (The Golden Compass,The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) with my 18-year-old son.  The story sparked good conversation about religion, adventure, physics, love, and the nature of mankind. <br /> <br />Although I'm well beyond childhood, I enjoyed being lost in the books' imagery, which is rich and highly imaginative.  The character development is very, very good. <br /> <br />I would like to read more of Pullman's books for children.  He enchants.
B000005Z0E|5.0|this is 2pac's first album and my favorite album. In this album you see how 2pac thought. If you listen to the lyrics you'll see the injustice he saw. like in the song \\"Violent\\" it say's he was beaten by crooked cops. my favorite tracks on here are \\"Violent, Words of Wisdom and Brenda's got a baby.\\" I reccomend this album 2 those who  like the music for their words not for the beat it has.

B000AL730Y|5.0|Well I'm 18 and bought this on a whim. I have long been a Harrison/Lennon fan and been somewhat turned off by Paul's pop repetiton. 'What The Man Said' and 'Jet' along with too many to count seemed to see Paul in a direction I personally didn't care for. However I love 'Maybe I'm Amazed' and the fantastic 'Mull of Kintyre. Paul's craft never left it was just in a different place I didn't particularly care for as a fan.  <br />I did not become a solo Paul fan until 2001 after I heard of George dying and discovered my love for his music. I quickly heard 'From A Lover To A Friend' from Driving Rain and thought 'that's great!'. I felt the same for 'Your Loving Flame' when I heard it. I also heard some negative press and just enjoyed the singles. I also delved into Flaming Pie and liked it aswell. I was determined to but the next McCartney album when it came out. <br />I bought this combo at Best Buy for the bonus track and was overjoyed by what I found. Here was Paul writing some fantastic music. Better music then I can find anywhere on radio. All are new songs done by a rejuvenated genius. 'Friends To Go' is my favorite song by far. 'Anyway', 'How Kind Of You' are masterpieces and I found them all fantastic! These are great songs and the lead single 'Fine Line' is wonderfully catchy. <br />The dvd is a good watch and you see how Paul makes songs and how much he enjoys it. All of his playing is great. <br />Not one bad song. <br />I'm 18 and this is now one of my favorite cds ever done. <br />You won't regret purchasing it.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie is a great heart warming tale of the way love can be found in all different forms.  Johnny Depp plays a warm hearted soul, who you just can't help falling in love with!

B0009S2T0M|5.0|A, great film by Chan-wook Park Oldboy opens on a rooftop where the main character Oh-Dae Su is holding a man over the edge by his tie.  It then flashes back to reveal the back story, in which Oh-Dae Su is kidnapped and held without any reason being given to him for 15 years.  He is then set free and given 5 days to find his kidnapper.  Oldboy is filled with great imagery and exciting fight sequences, however it goes much deeper than that.  It is a story about revenge, but also about attonement.  The main character goes through a great deal of personal hardships trying to find his kidnappers, however when he finally does, the answer to why he is kidnapped is more surprising then anything I could have expected.  This movie is all around very good, and I would reccomend it to anyone who likes action/suspense films, and the ending will blow your mind.  So see Oldboy and do yourself a favor.

B000002H70|5.0|The Cure are never an easy band to pin down, Robert Smith masters so many styles so well its nothing short of genius. However with 'Disintergration' the Cure created what is perhaps their defining moment. The post punk reverb of their early albums is present only this time the pop song hooks of the post 'Pornograhpy' albums is added to the mix. Only now everthing is panoramic, like a Sergio Leone movie, theres an epic depth and atmosphere throughout. Its a summing up for nearly all that Cure had done up to that point, only better.  <br /> <br />The guitars are sweeping, or choral like rain falling. Drums echoe like its all being right there and then in an empty house as Robert Smith mulls of love lost and won, a creeping sense of dread, and alienation from a strange world. Subdued psychadilc organs pipe somewhere in the distance adding a sense of the surreal to the whole proceedings. The album draws you in the stretches you out to breaking point, and its hard not to fall in love with the music and the depression, everythings done just so beautifully.  <br /> <br />If you didn't thinking you'd never stop listening you would want this album to go on forever. At the end you're sad that its all over, though also because the whole affair is depressing and melancholy, but at the same time glad that you can now listen too it all over again.
B000007T1M|5.0|this is not systems greatest work i can say that honestly but the album is really cool and brutal it packs a punch more than anything so if your a softy i wouldnt recomend this album but system didnt get into politcal stuff alot in this album like they do in there later albums but if you liked toxicity check this one out has some good songs the best is spiders by far
B000002OX5|5.0|'The Who Sell Out' is my personal favourite of their studio albums. Sure it doesn't contain any of their stone cold hits like 'My Generation' or 'Baba O'Riley' but its their most solid and consistent from start to finish. Though the idea of mirroring a London pirate radio station might be lost on those who weren't around in the era or the area its still fairly entertaining (though some of those adds do get annoying if you listen to them too often), and its probably the most creative and least self important of the bands 'rock operas'.  <br /> <br />Of the music, well its firmly in the camp of the 60's beat group Who, as oppossed to the hard rock Who of the 70's and later, though with psychadelic flourishes. Opening with the brilliant psych materpiece, and probably the most underrated Who song, 'Armenia City In The Sky' is definately the right way to in grabbing the listeners attention. The advert concept really kicks in with 'Heinz Baked Beans' which is kind of funny. 'Mary Anne With Shaky Hands' is the probably the sweetest song about a girl who gives hand jobs you're ever likely to hear. The album holds is a good standard for the next three songs until it comes to the masterpiece 'I Can See For Miles' which should rightly feature among anyones list of top Who songs. 'I Can't Reach You' is another underrated songs as its 'Relax'. Entwistles 'Silas Stingy' is probably the worst of the original 13 tracks here, too silly and jokey for a normal track, not going far enough to be counted as a true joke like the advert songs, but things end on an up note with 'Sunrise' and 'Rael 1'.  <br /> <br />Of the bonus tracks added on this issue, there are some real gems here. 'Glittering Girl, 'Melancholia', 'Someone's Coming', 'Jaguar', 'Early Morning Cold Taxi', 'Hall Of The Mountain King', 'Girls Eyes' and 'Glow Girl' form nearly an albums worth (at least a large EP if not) of great material that any fan should want to hear. Indeed the quality is so good its amazing they left some of these tracks off, especially as they included something as substandard as 'Silas Stingy'. These additions really push 'The Who Sell Out' into the top of the must have Who album heap. 'Tommy' might get a lot of praise, and 'Who's Next' might have those explosive drum blasts and wild guitar work, but this is the real masterpiece by Townsend, Daltrey, Entwistle and Moon.
1400049628|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim (a buy two, get one free sale and I needed a third book), and have since decided that it's the best of the bunch.  If you have ever watched a horrror movie and wondered what you would do when the zombies come to eat your brains, this is the book for you.  Even if you haven't, there is more than enough silliness to keep you thoroughly entertained. <br /> <br />And yes, I laughed so hard that the cats went running for cover at the noise, which is one of the best recommendations I can offer.
B00005LAGO|5.0|I'll never forget the day I first bought and heard 'Sufer Rosa (& Come On Pilgrim)', it was one of those moments in life when the music really does provided a soundtrack to life. It was a Friday afternoon, I was at college, it was a cool autum day with clear blue skies, I'd just broken up with my girlfriend of almost a year that week because she'd cheated on me, and right that moment I was waiting for my computer skills class to open in about half an hour. With a big break in between morning classes and afternoon ones I'd popped into to buy some albums that day kind of to cheer me up. As I sat outside the room on the second floor over looking a court yard I popped 'Surfer Rosa' into my portable cd player and from the opening strains of 'Bone Machine' things in life started to look up. It was my first pixies album and I'd only really picked it up because one it had previously been recommended to me, and two it was cheap. I was lucky that day (the other albums I'd bought were Mogwai's 'Happy Music For Happy People' and Black Flag's 'First Four Years' comp, both great as well might I add). <br /> <br />Everything about the album was right to me. It was catchy without being typical pop. The guitars buzzed but weren't heavy, they were light and spidery but still packed a punch. The whole album was and still is weird and wonderful, manic and crazy, but most importantly it was fun, how can you not feel good listening to this its postively bursting with life and engery. By the end of 'River Euphrates' I was out of my blues and feeling pretty damn good. As much as I love some other albums I don't think any other band or ever album could swing my mood around from so depressed to on to of the world in just seven songs. That was the magic of the Pixies on thise album to me. Sure its an important album in the scheme of indie music and all, big influence on Nirvana ectera, but for me 'Surfer Rosa' will always be a personal album. By the time my class opened I didn't want to takemy head phones off an go in. So as soon as I could I put the cd in one of the computers and played it out loud for everyone to hear, which annoyed the girl the who sat next to me who was into hip hop and the teacher who eventually told me to put my headphones back on or turn it off.  <br /> <br />So I'll recommend this album to everyone, its brilliant and possibly life altering, if you're at the right spot in your life when you hear it I guess. But I'll also say get the version with this version with the 'Come On Pilgrim' EP add on because I can't imagine listening to this without hearing 'The Holiday Song' or 'I've Been Tired' and ending with 'Levitate Me' and heck all the rest either. It might cost you a little more, but you'll probably find its worth every cent of it.

B000058983|5.0|'Forever Changes' is one those albums I couldn't bear to be without. Perhaps the most brilliant psychadelic album of all time, its a seamless set of songs that burns its self into your consciousness. Authur Lee's voice compels you to listen to everything he has to say from the political to the personal he keeps you gripped no matter what. More bitter and cynical than so many other albums of the time it doesn't get bogged down in tiresome hippy sloganeering, and in some ways its nearest musical kin would be Frank Zappa & the Mothers Of Invention's 'We're Only In It For The Money' in that it mocks rather than embraces hippy idealism (though Zappa's is a far more viscious and ruthless attack).  <br /> <br />However in many ways 'Forever Changes' is a unique album for its time. Embracing horns and orchestral flourishes to back the pschadelic rock nothing else sounds the some. Guitars vary from delicately plucked folkish numbers as on 'The Red Telephone' to scorching fretwork (see 'A House Is Not A Motel'), and encompasses everything inbetween. It occassionaly embraces South American flavours such as on 'Maybe The People Would Be The Times Or Between Clark And Hilldale' (surely one of the most clumsy names to be placed on a rock song) or veers towards sounding slightly like a Burt Bacarach number 'The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This' (another awkward title, oh well not big deal). This is part of magic of 'Forever Changes' it takes in some many different styles and influences and yet retains such a strong sense of identity that its never forced in baring that title of compromise in being described as \\"eclectic\\". Every second of the eleven tracks sounds like it belongs there, only a handful of albums ever made can boast such a claim, and even Love only ever managed it this one time. I'm loathe to say it because there are so many albums from that decade that are so so aboslutely brilliant and its such a contensious claim, but this is probably the best album of the 60's, and definately in the top 10 of all time.  <br /> <br />As for the bonus tracks. Well they're enjoyable but hardly add anything to the album, most valuable is the outtake 'Wonder People (I Do Wonder)', but the other additions apart from the slightly annoying tracking sessions highlights of 'Your Mind And We Belong Together' are certaintly worthy of repeated listens. And as they're simply placed on the end of the orginal album flow don't ruin anything and give you nice extra if you wish to indulge more after listening the first 11 tracks, which if you're tastes are anything like mine you certaintly will.
020161622X|5.0|The preface says \\"this booked is aimed at people who want to become more effective and more productive programmers\\", but after reading this book, I think the book should be required reading for all junior programmers. In around 300 page, this book isn't heavy reading like code complete 2, but it gives a brief overview of almost every philosophy which every programmer should embrace, ideas such as DRY, lower coupling, MVC paradigm. I strongly recommend this book to every junior programmer (if you're an experienced one you should already know everything this book talks about)
B000003TAB|3.0|This is a hotch potch collection of songs that suffers from the usual afflictions of b-sides/outtakes/rarities albums in that its inconsistent, jumbled, random and lacks flow and structure. The highlights here are of course 'Sliver' and the covers of the Vaselines songs 'Molly's Lips' and 'Son Of A Gun'. For the most part this is far more in keeping with the Bleach era sound than Nevermind or even In Utero. Mostly because the songs originate in the pre nevermind era, which would make sense.  <br /> <br />The rest ranges from bad to good. The bad being 'Beeswax' the best of the good being 'Aneurysm'. Its mostly harsh punkish and sludgey, far more worthy of the description of being grunge that the relatively clean cut Nevermind. If you're a fan you'll get this, if you just like Nevermind and Unplugged In New York, then you'd probably be better off skipping it.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|All right, 'Return of the Living Dead 2' is, without question, the worst zombie movie I've ever seen.  Admittedly, I haven't really gotten around to seeing the stuff that is generally considered to be truly bottome of the barrel, when it comes to independent and trash horror.  Hell, I haven't seen a single Jesse Franco movie, as of yet.  So, this doubtless isn't the worst zombie movie ever, in an absolute sense, but it's still really damn terrible.  'RothLd' wasn't great or anything, but it definitely had its moments, and was pretty good, overall.  This has nothing to recommend: Horribly grating acting, lousy effects, incredibly stupid, sophomoric humor.  Plus they decided it would be hilarious to have a loud, obnoxious kid be the hero, but that just proved to be loud and obnoxious.  That was the final straw.<br /><br />Perhaps this was all intentional.  They figured they had a franchise on their hands, so they decided to make number 2 absolutely horrendous so that everyone would go see it without knowing better.  Then they could make another one, and everyone could at least say, 'Well, it was better than #2, anyway'  Probably not though.  They just suck.<br /><br />This is the danger of making an intentionally campy movie.  Simply making a crappy movie doesn't work unless you do so by accident.  Than it can be funny.  But, if you're doing it on purpose you need to have some concept of humor.  They haven't got that here.<br /><br />Grade: F
B000003TAW|5.0|On their debut album Weezer did what few other bands of the time did, they rocked and had fun doing so. Even as Rivers Cumo sings of the dark side of life like heart break, jealousy, alcoholism and more Weezer sounds like they're having the best time of their lives doing so. Part of what makes this so enjoyable is the straight forwardness of the music. Fuzzy guitars buzz throughout, solid bass lines surge, its not quite punk but it has that same 'anyone can play' ethic to it. Perhaps not totally unique in a work that was gripped by grunge, but seem to be doing for enjoyment not to express their frustration and alienation to the rest of the world.  <br /> <br />The so called 'Blue Album' is also one of those rare albums where each track is essential, theres not one song here that you wouldn't miss. While not everyone reaches the pop heights of ' Buddy Holly', each is a perfectly craft catchy tune, and Weezer demonstrate real brilliance throughout especially when they stretch the boundaries with the epic 'Only In Dreams'. It may not be the most innovative album ever, or demonstrate great musicianship or even raw passion, but is undeniably a joy to listen to over and over again. Weezer might never reach these heights again but it doesn't matter as long as you own this one.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Writing Opeth reviews is pretty much a complete waste of time.  No metal band is more divisive, and few have fans as.... um... fanatical.  It's hard to imagine anyone who owned the previous 7 Opeth albums not wanting to pick this one up.  But, I'll write one up anyway, I guess.  And I suppose I have a somewhat different perspective, as I'm a much more moderate Opeth fan, at least compared to most of the people I read on the internet.  Frankly, `Ghost Reveries' doesn't mark much progression for the band, but I think it marks a solid culmination of their craft.  Simply put, this is Opeth's best album.<br /><br />Stylistically, `Ghost Reveries' is most reminiscent of `Still Life'.  There is a particular emphasis on the clean vox, more so here than anywhere else in their catalogue.(well, other than `Damnation' obviously)  Specifically, there's a whole lot more singing in the actual metal sections.  For the longest time Mikael hardly sang at all, and when he did it was inevitably in the soft parts.  This gave the first 2 Opeth albums a rather fragmented feel, as they typically seemed kinda pieced together.  They've progressed a long way, and this album flows naturally, more so than any of their previous albums, and more than you would imagine would be possible due to the extreme changes in the music.  They've also added a full-time keyboard player, which I actually think is a good thing.  He just adds another layer to the sound, and prevents the occasional textural monotony that would sometimes plague their earlier albums.  And, they utterly avoid any of the cheesier sounds, and fully understand that the `boards are NOT a lead instrument.<br /><br />The album opens with two fairly traditional Opeth epics, but expertly executed, both filled with sharp guitar melodies.  `Ghost of Perdition' is the better of them, and is simply one of the finest tracks of this sort that they've ever recorded.  `Beneath the Mire' marks a change for the band, integrating some more prominent synths and a lot of sparse, stop-start guitars.  Not the best thing here, but a very solid track.  `Atonement' is the first mellow track, and it's a strong one.  The song mainly stands apart due to the soaring, vaguely eastern sounding guitar line which occurs from time to time, though the whole track is compellingly atmospheric, but not so excessively minimalistic that it fails to make an impression, as occasionally happened on Opeth's earlier soft tracks.  `Reverie/Harlequin Forest' is another epic, though it's one of the accessible ones they've written, with nice melodic vocal lines and some atypically groovy riffs, before moving off into more atmospheric territories, and closing with a `Deliverance' style jerky, stomping riff.  `Hours of Wealth' is one of the best soft tracks they've ever done.  It's got a nice slow-building intro, but the real key to the track is the ethereial vocal section,which has Akerfeldt finest clean vox performance ever.  It also closes with an excellent, bluesy and jazzy solo.  `The Grand Conjuration' is a controversial track, but quite good.  It's the darkest, most oppressive thing here, with ultra slow burning mellow sections to go with some bruising, wall of sound riffs and mechanistic, staccato sections.  It lacks the melody you'll get from the rest of the album, but it's got the atmosphere to make up for it.  `Isolation Years' is one of the most unexpected tracks here.  It's another soft one, but it has a sorta layered, lush feel during the chorus which is very un-Opeth.  It may be a bit to syrupy for some folks, but I like it.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.

It was a little predictable in places but a tear-jerker nonetheless. Would you expect anthing else from Nicholas Sparks?!! A recommended read but if you've not read The Notebook then read that first.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I will not bore you with a long review. This is the best video of the year. The early Dylan story in his words, the words of his contemporaries with songs, everything! I am so excited by it.<br /><br />There are even 7 or 8 full length videos of his songs.<br /><br />I am too busy today to write a full review since I must practice Gates of Eden and It's All Right Ma, I'm Only Bleeding before the open mic on Wednesday.<br /><br />OK, so last year was Chronicles. This year - No Direction Home.<br /><br />Now will they start issuing DVD's for all those Dylan live performances and promo videos locked away in vaults, like \\"Series of Dream\\" and the \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\"?

0789723107|5.0|I have to say that I was less than excited to sit down with a mug of coffee & a book on web usability on a weekend afternoon. But within the first few pages, I found myself grinning and laughing at Krugs thoughts, especially his footnotes. I kept interrupting my family to read bits and pieces, and we all laughed along to Krugs anecdotes and stories. Along with the laughs, I learned a great deal about web usability and site optimization. This book comes HIGHLY recommended to all!
B00005JNZP|4.0|There are two ways to look at Liev Schrieber's directorial debut.  First, how does it compare to the source material?  And second, is it any good? <br /> <br />What's best known about the Schreiber movie thus far is that the director omitted a significant portion of author Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.  The magical realism flashbacks to the Ukrainian shtetl of Trachimbrod -- a major chunk of the book -- have been completely excised (except for a couple of mentions of the name Sofiowka, a name on the map and also an important character in the novel).  Additionally, the book is mostly structured as a series of letters written to author Foer by his Ukrainian translator Alex.  Most of that structure is jettisoned, although the movie does retain chapter titles.  Thus, Alex is the movie's sole narrator. <br /> <br />That's a good thing.  Eugene Hutz, reminiscent of John Turturro (of \\"The Big Lebowski\\" vintage, not \\"Barton Fink\\" or \\"Quiz Show\\"), commands the movie.  Elijah Wood channels Tobey Maguire's socially awkward Peter Parker more than his own reluctant hero Frodo Baggins.  But the movie is not so much about Foer as it is about Alex and his grandfather, and what they learn from escorting Foer around the remains of the shtetl. <br /> <br />Significant changes have been made to the book's ending, mostly in the interest of clarity and time.  The book's late revelations about both Alexes, grandfather and grandson, are condensed or omitted.  These changes in the script do not destroy the book's integrity.  Roy Hobbs does not suddenly knock the ball off the light towers, or play catch with his son over the credits.  The ending is still moving, downbeat but serene. <br /> <br />Finally, is it good?  Absolutely.  The Ukrainian landscape, and what appears to be regular use of steadicam, makes for a visually striking directorial debut.  The cast is small and uniformly excellent.  The soundtrack mirrors the movie's varied tones.  It takes a sure director to navigate the novel'sblend of slapstick comedy and emotional devestation.  Schreiber, after condensing the novel, follows a steady progression from slapstick to devestation, and never sells either the book or its characters short. <br /> <br />In the end, a compelling work, and hopefully one that will not be entirely ignored by the Motion Picture Academy.

0451163486|5.0|This review contains spoilers for those who have not yet read the book.  <br /> <br />\\"Eye of the Needle\\" is an excellent spy thriller, one of the best ever written, but it is more - it has a moral quality, and a sense of personal tragedy.  <br /> <br />It begins with Henry Faber ruthlessly killing a woman who wanted to have an affair with him, since that might have revealed his being a German spy. The only thing he feels after killing her is annoyance at the inconvenience it would cause him. We hear that in fact one of the reasons why he chose to be a spy in the first place is that that was the only profession where he could feel justified in killing out of hand anyone he considered as being a threat to him (including a fellow German spy).   <br /> <br />He goes on and on, driving himself beyond human endurance and killing everybody who stands in his way.  (In fact, not everybody:  he spares the two old women in Scotland which he obviously could have easily killed and which evidently aroused his symapthy. In this case he can afford to give way to his hidden humanity, it is a small calculated risk which he can afford to take since he knows that his face is already known to the British amd the women can't reveal anything which would endanger him. But is in fact is a small preview or hint to the very unreasonable and ultimately fatal risks which he would take later).   <br /> <br />Fighting the storm at sea takes the last reserves out of him, he drives himself to the point of total exhaustion and a heart attack and total collapse where he needs to be taken care of like a child - with the result that he falls very deeply in love with Lucy who appears on the scene to take care of him and in effect mother him. That is the key moment, without which all that happens aftewards could not have happened, and it is handled very believably.    <br /> <br />Even when recovering his physical strenght he is still very much in love with Lucy and sees her a something precious which he can't bear the thought of destroying. He can't bring himself to kill her even when she discovers who and what he is and proves to be a very direct threat to him, much more of a threat than Mrs. Garden ever was (or others of those which he ruthlessly killed in the course of the book). He does not formulate it to himself with the word \\"love\\" and is just surprised and annoyed at what has happened to him, but the reader can very well understand it.  <br /> <br />Obviously, however courageous and resourceful Lucy proves to be, Faber could have killed her ten times over - and would have, at any earlier point in his career. That would have been the only sensible thing to do for him as a professional spy in an enemy country whose identity has been discovered - but he is just too deeply in love to do the sensible and ruthless thing. In effect, he is sacrificing his own life - AND the chance of Germany to win the war - for the sake of his love for Lucy.  <br /> <br />And at the same time that Faber is becoming soft and romantic and incompetent as a spy, Lucy is becoming more and more tough and ruthless, to the point where in the end she is able to kill him.  <br /> <br />This private interplay of forces between the two of them and the opposite changes in their two personalities is what produces the result. The orgainsed spy-cathing apparatus of the British Empire comes on the scene too late to effect the result and can only endorse a fait accompli. If Faber had not fallen in love with Lucy, or if she had not become tough enough to kill him, then he would have gotten to the U-boat with the photos and the whole Second World War would have ended differntly.   <br /> <br />The book begins with Faber killing a woman because he was tough and ruthless, and it ends with a woman killing him because he had become  soft and romantic and she has become tough. (A kind of poetic justice and belated revenge for Mrs. Garden).  <br /> <br />This change of character of both of them is givenin a very credible and believable way.  For me, this makes \\"The Eye of the Needle\\" not only an excellent spy thriller, but also a worthwhile work of literature, and in fact a very tragic romantic novel (which you don't really expect of a spy thriller). Faber is the definitely the main character of the  book, whether or not the term \\"hero\\" is applicable to him - <br />and in my view, the end does enttitle him to be called a hero, and tragic hero at that. <br /> <br />In a Nineteenth-Century book Faber's undying love for Lucy  would probably have been stated explicitly in a way that we nowadays would find pompous and pathetic. Follet has managed to convey the age-old theme of \\"love conquers all\\" in a way which is very accessible and believable to people of our jaded and cynical age, which I think is a major achievement in itself. I think that though many readers don't realize all this, they do sense it and it is one of the main reasons why this book is so widely considered Follet's best.  <br /> <br />I missed this quality in other Follet books. For example in \\"The Key to Rebecca\\" where in effect Faber comes again in the form of Wolff. There, he is just as clever and capable and ruthless and proficient with a knife, and goes through just as much of a tight thrilling plot - but does not have any  humanizing transformation in the end but on the contrary just becomes more and more monstrous and is finally and predictably defeated through nothing but the courage and perseverance of the hero opposing him. A pity, but then I suppose the trick could not work more than once.   <br /> <br />One wonders on reading the postscript to \\"The Eye of Needle\\" if Lucy ever told Fred Bloggs the truth. Probably not, Bloggs has such a deep prejudice against Germans and would be very shocked and not understand - and then he could not have innocently boasted of her heroism it to their grandchild.  <br />So even though Lucy has a long and happy marriage with Bloggs, in a certain way she keepsloyal to the secret experience she shared with Faber - which Faber would undoubtedly have been happy to know. <br /> <br />  <br />

1567184855|5.0|Newton's research through regression hypnosis into the \\"life between lives\\" is compelling, based on hundreds of case studies, and provides a window into the maturation of the soul through many lives. Readers with a \\"blind eye\\" to possibilities, thoroughly enthrenched in traditional religious dogmas are not likely to be persuaded. However, those who wish to expand their consciousness and explore all that the human life promises, and the connections to other lives will find this book at once startling, and at once reassuring. I did, and I highly recommend the book. It is unfortunate that Newton has retired from his professional life. I would grab at more of his insight and research. It is very sympathetic to other material that I have read on this subject, and does not smack in the least of the John Edwards kind of hype.
B00004R7PB|5.0|I think these pieces are a kind of portrait of how good is a chamber orchestra, specially on period instruments. Why? because if it is going to be played as the pieces deserve,it should be with passion, complete understanding od baroque musical codes (eg ornamentation, phrasing) and the utmost virtuosism. I don't play music but I feel ther horn parts must be extraordinarily difficult played without valves. So how does this recording stand against competition (Gardiner, Harnoncourt, Orpheus Chamber orch, boston baroque, tafelmusik, marriner 71'and 93', mackerras, pinnock, leppard, etc)?<br /><br />Well, I have heard samples of Pinnock. Good, of course, but always typically \\"Brithish\\" that is to say, refined, trying to rescue the kindness instead of vital pulse. My first experience of these pieces was Leppard. Great recording. still many numbers are very good: vital, warm, with \\"period\\" ornamentations. A pity some numbers (eg \\"Air\\" of 1st suite) sound very old fashioned. So not a definitive recording. Orpheus chamber orchestra. I have reviewed. Modern intruments, but with \\"period\\" conventions. The problem is that they seem at times so unmusical... fast tempi when there should have been more pomp, some \\"flat\\", insensitive passages ... as I have said, \\"plastic Handel\\". Gardiner is very good but uneven, I think Fireworks deserves more majesty. Tafelmusic's watermusic have the same deffects of their \\"Brandenburgs\\": an american version of Pinnock, sorry listen to the trumpets and see how flat they are ... not a first choice. Boston Baroque I don't know.<br /><br />So I keep with ... Savall and marriner. I don't know Marrienr 71' (Decca) but I love Marriner 93' (hanssler). Yes, modern instruments and some \\"period\\" conventions like Orpheus flawed recording, but here we have a great musician who has made an \\"uptade\\" in period practice but keeping that approach under the control of a extraordinary understanding of what music is about, no matter instruments. His reading is faster than Savall, I think because he takes fewer repeats. His string body is far larger, but warm and sounds \\"comfortable\\", gives a sense of \\"orchestral\\" music instead of \\"chamber\\" but at the same time flexible and transparent. Great ornamentations, and surprising instrumentations (remember there is not an autograph score, so conductors not allways agree on how to score a piece), eg in Fiirewok's Overture in the beggining of the fast section some wind passages usually played also with strings but here absent, so it achieves more variety. Overall, his strong musicianship makes a very pleasant tour of these peaces, and is a perfect example of how to be HIP without falling in the trap of \\"you have to imitate Kuijken and use his instruments in order to properly play Baroque\\".<br /><br />But here I speak of savall and although I love Marriner 93' well, period instruments have great advantages in term of sonority. Period brass are simply wonderfull and no player of ASMIF can imitate the rustic sound of an ancient horn. And savall takes advantage of his excellent orchestra eg in Fireworks where period brass are pulled to their limits. Or listen to the horns of \\"lentement\\" in water music and see in terms of sound he has no competitiion of such quality. Tempi are fluid, moderate to very fast (eg the \\"serious\\" minuet of the traditional flute suite of water music), but allways musical, nothing seems unduly fast. So he achieves variety in the character of the pieces as no British conductor can.<br /><br />The order of the pieces is different, he combines trumpet suite and flute suite unto 1, and leaves the horn suite as another entity. As I said there is no \\"Holy Score\\" (autograph) so it is valid and works well, but does not give an advantage of traditional editions. So here virtues, enough perhaps to make your reference choice: period instruments superbly played, a mixture of passion and elegance, control and \\"joy-de-vivre\\" (well said?). But there are some minuses: the recordingis very long, because savall takes as many repeats as possible. How otherwise can justify he needs 74 min when marriner needs 63, gardiner 68 (with extra movs) and Norrington 68 (please don't !!)? in some places I think music is very repetitive but depends on your taste. And I think he is inconsistent on ornamentation. Yes, of course adds ornaments to the oboe solo of 1st or the trumpet and horn in the reprise of the hornpipe of 3rd but there are places where marriner surprises you and savall is litteral to the score. Perhaps I was expecting a bit more of imagination. That's why none of both recordings I highlited are reference per se, but must be enjoyed together. Don't miss any of them!! Both are od consistent high quality.cause savall takes as many repeats as possible.

If you haven't, just imagine a huge human washing machine with bodies thrown about everywhere. All of these songs flow with ease being quick and to the point. To finish it up we have Raining Blood. With the bone chilling thump of Lombardo's drums, we all know whats next...The rinse cycle. Buy this album if you have just crawled from under a rock and dont already have this rhythmically organized sequence of pain.

B0000640VO|5.0|The term \\"magic\\" -- as relating to movies and not just the word for a witch's spell or a magician conjuring a rabbit -- was long ago co-opted by the likes of Disney and Spielberg. The Disney and Spielberg corporate machines turned \\"magic\\" into just another gear in the works, with shots of awed actors gazing at something amazing followed by some jaw-dropping special effects shot. <br /> <br />It's been a long time that something truly magical, not phony or manufactured, has graced the silver screen. So Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie (a.k.a. Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain) comes as a most welcome new gem. It deserves to be cherished, hugged and celebrated. <br /> <br />Audrey Tautou (Venus Beauty Institute) stars in the title role, an adorable, waifish little darling who reminded me, by turns, of Charlie Chaplin, Giulietta Masina and Audrey Hepburn. On the day of Princess Diana's death, Amelie finds a little box hidden in the bathroom of her little Montmarte apartment: a little boy's treasure chest from years gone by. She decides to return it to its now grown-up owner without revealing herself to him. When she sees the man's reaction -- shock, joy and tears -- she vows to perform more good deeds. <br /> <br />Most of these deeds involve a great deal of clever preparation, and these play out like the \\"Mousetrap\\" game, where one seemingly unconnected move leads to another one and they all logically connect only at the end. <br /> <br />For example, an incredibly sour man sits around in the cafe where Amelie works pining after his ex-girlfriend who also works there. Using several small, nearly untraceable steps, Amelie plants the seeds for new love between the man and a dowdy, hypochondriac woman who works the cigarette counter. <br /> <br />This and the many wonderful other episodes never run back to back. They're cleverly intertwined with one another, keeping the mysteries moving along at the right speed. <br /> <br />Of course, Amelie's greatest challenge is to findlove herself, which is not easy for such a shy girl who can't even show up to take credit for her own good deeds. In one scene, after she lets her potential soulmate Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) walk away from her door, she literally melts (thanks to some brilliantly-utilized CGI effects). <br /> <br />The movie begins daringly, with a narrated flashback to Amelie's childhood explaining her quirky personality and running some 20-odd minutes before the actual story even begins. This talky, cartoony sequence had the potential to alienate viewers quickly. But instead it easily and quickly sets up the film's warmth, humor and charm that it sustains perfectly throughout. <br /> <br />It's difficult to describe the look of the film, which is painstakingly precise, but colorful, airy and alive at the same time. It's like a Chuck Jones cartoon, but slower, and like an MGM musical, but faster. In order to get the precise vision of sunniness and goodness he wanted, director Jeunet digitally altered Montmarte's look, taking out the garbage and graffiti, and even changing the clouds above into more decorative shapes. It's a utopian vision of how great the world could really be if generosity were traded regularly and not hoarded like gold. <br /> <br />Amelie shows a completely unusual side of Jeunet, who created the dark, bizarre underworlds of Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children (both co-directed by his former collaborator Marc Caro) and Alien Resurrection. Jeunet has now expunged all traces of weirdness and darkness to make this lovely new confection. <br /> <br />Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon proved that American mass audiences can and will sit through a movie with subtitles, and I suspect that the subtitles on the French-language Amelie will likewise not deter them. This is a movie that audiences all over the world have treasured, and America shouldn't be any different. <br /> <br />I also foresee Oscar nominations for Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet, and one big one for Best Picture (that is if distributor Miramax can let go of its quasi-talented \\"prestige\\" director Lasse Hallstrom and his new film The Shipping News and put its muscle behind this one instead). Like Amelie herself, I'm moved to do a good deed and share this movie with everyone <br />
B00026WU64|5.0|The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is one of those albums that I think I could listen to and enjoy anytime, regardless of mood. It's just a wonderful classic album. Dylan's second album, Freewheelin' is a great improvement over his debut (which is also a very good record). After composing only two songs for his debut, Freewheelin' finds Dylan significantly more confident in his songwriting abilities. As well he should be, because his original songs here are amazing.    1. Blowin' in the Wind - One of the greatest folk songs of all time, and has been covered by numerous artists. Still one of Dylan's most well-known songs today.    2. Girl from the North Country - A lovely folk ballad, and one of my favorite romantic Dylan songs. In 1969, Dylan would resurrect this song as a duet with his Johnny Cash on his Nashville Skyline album.    3. Masters of War - Dylan's most scathing anti-war song and one of his most vicious protest songs ever. You can feel the venom in his voice as he talks of politicians who use war for financial gain. This song is still powerful now in 2005, in fact it may be more relevant than ever now.    4. Down the Highway - Country-blues tune with Dylan doing sort of an imitation of Hank Williams. A good song, but not the most memorable.    5. Bob Dylan's Blues - A short, lightweight country-folk tune. One of the album's lesser tracks.    6. A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall - One of Dylan's all-time classics. It resembles a protest song, but it's not quite direct enough lyrically to qualify. But it is one of the finest songs of Dylan's early years.    7. Don't Think Twice, It's All Right - Another classic and one of my personal favorites. This is a lovely ballad directed to Dylan's girlfriend Suze Rotolo. Heartfelt lyrics, a wonderful vocal from Dylan and excellent fingerpicked guitar too. One of his best songs.    8. Bob Dylan's Dream - A lovely folk song in which Dylan reminisces about the past. A great lesser-known Dylan song.    9. Oxford Town - Potent protestsong about a racial incident, but I'm not sure exactly what incident is referred to.    10. Talking World War III Blues - A humorous narrative-song with lots of great lines including \\"'I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours,' I said that.\\" However, I prefer the version of the song on Bootleg Series, volume 6 - Live 1964.    11. Corrina, Corrina - A lovely interpretation of an old folk song, and the only song on the album to feature accompaniment. It features a drummer and possibly a second guitar player. It was to be the B-side of an early single, \\"Mixed-Up Confusion\\", which would have been Dylan's first electric song.    12. Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance - Another folk tune arranged by Dylan. Dylan's energetic vocal style on this song is quite similar to that of his debut.    13. I Shall Be Free - The album closes with this humorous story song which starts a style that Dylan would revisit several times in the future. This song reveals Dylan's sense of humor better than nearly anything else he would record. \\"I make love to Elizabeth Taylor... catch hell from Richard Burton\\".    The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is an excellent album that any serious fan of music should own and relish. If you're new to Dylan, this should be one of your first purchases, after Blonde On Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited and Blood On The Tracks. But don't stop here! If you like Freewheelin' be sure to check out Dylan's third album, The Times They Are A-Changin' which is almost as good.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Initially, I was one of the skeptical people who wondered why remake such as classic film? I love Johnny Depp and the book so I saw the film. It was wonderful. Not to take anything from the Gene Wilder version, which is also wonderful. This film is much more like the book. The songs are straight from the book. I particularly liked the Veruca Salt scene with the squirrels, which was not possible with the technology in the original. You really can't compare the two films. They are each beautiful in their own way. I loved the original, but I also loved this version. It was well acted and the scenery, everything, was incredible. I loved seening Willy Wonka in Oompa Loompa land making the deal with the chief. My students love this book and this version goes along with the book much more accurately. I feel that Roald Dahl would have loved this version. Johnny took a another character and made it his own. Wonderful job.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|First and foremost, INCREDIBLE! Really, Socrcese has outdone himself. This is without a doubt one of the best music biographies ever, it even rivals The Beatles Anthology.  I am a big fan of Dylan, and have read a lot, but this really pulled the veil off the mystery and showed another side of Dylan.  Pun intended! The quality is great. The content great. And the music is sublime! My only gripe is the extras on disc one the Dylan Performances are not the entire performance, just a replica from that section of the film. On disc two, however, are entire performances, and they are great!  If you are a Dylan fan you will love this disc! I hope and pray he will continue with Dylan's history! I would love to see the films and interviews about The Rolling Thunder tour.  And a current day Bob looked great and was ernest and honest...
B0009XT8YW|3.0|I can't dispute this being one of Barbra Streisand's best albums. But this 25th anniversary reissue is not the treatment deserved by this great recording. Barbra certainly deserves better than what was done here. The CD side of this dual disc sounds excellent, presenting the album as we remember it. But Sony missed the boat on the DVD side, as it pertains to the 9 tracks that are also on the CD side. The DVD, by its very nature, is able to store a lot more information than a CD. As was stated by another reviewer, there is the ability to support a much higher bit rate and sampling rate on the DVD side. The sound on the DVD side is NO BETTER than the CD side. Also, the DVD side can support 5.1 surround sound as well, including Dolby Digital and DVD-Audio. While I don't expect Sony to use the latter, they have used Dolby Digital 5.1 on many of their dual discs. They used neither high resolution stereo (24-bit, 88 or 96 kHz), nor Dolby Digital surround (24-bit, 48kHz)for this release. It sounds to me like they used the same 16-bit, 44.1 kHz master that was used for the CD side. I did the comparison on a home theater system that is more than capable of revealing the differences between standard CD resolution and highresolution stereo or surround. Videos notwithstanding, there was no reason to release this album on dual disc if its full potential was not to be realized. I'm unable to rate this album with the 5 stars the music deserves due to this poorly handled DVD side. I'm sorry, folks, but Barbra deserves better than this.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I grew up on the Star Wars films, and was really looking forward to these DVDs. Of course, I still enjoyed the unchanged stuff, and some of the changes as well - but I'm very, very unhappy about not even having the option of seeing the original theatrical releases.    When it comes to the changes from the original theatrical release, here are my opinions:    The Good:  - The updated SFX for the fight and space scenes were nice.    - Some of the new CGI creatures were a nice touch - added a new sense of the alien to the movie.    - I liked the added celebration scenes at the end of RotJ. Nice tie-in to the prequels, and adds an extra sense of how widely the fall of the Empire is celebrated.    The Indifferent:  - Regarding the infamous Han/Greedo scene - I probably wouldn't even have noticed if it hadn't been pointed out to be beforehand. The original does add a nice bit of character development and set Han up as a cold mercenary... but it's not the only scene to do so. If children see only this version of the movie, they can probably still figure out that Han is a cold mercenary from other scenes.    Really, the only bad thing about this scene, in and of itself, is that Greedo shooting Han first doesn't make any sense from the dialogue leading up to it. There's no lead in to it. Greedo apparently chooses a completely random moment in the conversation to shoot Han.    - I wasn't sure about the thriving metropolis with the shiny new droids that was suddenly Mos Eisley. I suppose I could get used to it with time, but it's a bit jarring.    The Bad:  - The music changes in RotJ. No. Just no. When it got to the end and they'd changed the Ewok celebration song, I just sat there with my mouth hanging open in disbelief - WHY? I loved that song! It was so fitting for the Ewoks, and so happy, and when I was a kid, I would rewind the VCR just to listen to that song again and again. Why would anybody change it?    Also, the song at the beginning of RotJ was just too incrediblywrong for words. Most of the allure of Star Wars is the alien nature of everything in the show - if you stick in a rock song with words from American pop culture, this completely destroys the effect.    - The added Jabba scene in ANH. It adds nothing to the story, and it's incredibly jarring because, if you grew up with RotJ, you can't help but notice that Jabba has apparently somehow wound up inside one of the gadgets from \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\". Seriously, in both height and girth, he is less than half the size he's supposed to be. Did Lucas think that the thousands of viewers who grew up with the films would just fail to notice these things?    That's about it for the changes that made any kind of impact on me. The story itself is thankfully largely unchanged, and so the films remain as entertaining, exciting, and inspirational as they always were.    I just really, really wish they'd gone the LotR route. I have all of the theatrical release LotR DVD's, as well as the Extended editions, and while I mostly watch the Extended editions, it's still nice to know that I can watch the original theatrical release of LotR when I want to. Likewise, I would still have gotten the special editions of Star Wars, but I would have been a LOT happier if I'd known that I could still watch the old Star Wars movies that I know and love if I wanted to.
B000A6CLL0|3.0|This was the season where I lost interest. I loved the first two seasons, but don't want to have to keep up with everything because each episode is really just a continuation of the last episode. Weren't the first two seasons a hit? Almost completely stand alone episodes. They ruined the show because after each episode I felt like it's not over. How do you watch one of these episodes when you know you are left hanging.  After season two ended with the attack on Earth, I figured next season would be two or three episodes to deal with the enemy and move on to regular stories. That's what they should have done. There was nothing wrong with the show but then season four is comprised of mostly two, three or four part episodes. The original Star Trek and the Next Generation were mostly stand alone shows, but I never really liked Next Generation, too politically correct for me.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is one of those albums that I think I could listen to and enjoy anytime, regardless of mood. It's  just a wonderful classic album. Dylan's second album, Freewheelin' is a great improvement over his debut (which is also a very good record). After composing only two songs for his debut, Freewheelin' finds Dylan significantly more confident in his songwriting abilities. As well he should be, because his original songs here are amazing.     1. Blowin' in the Wind - One of the greatest folk songs of all time, and has been covered by numerous artists. Still one of Dylan's most well-known songs today.     2. Girl from the North Country - A lovely folk ballad, and one of my favorite romantic Dylan songs. In 1969, Dylan would resurrect this song as a duet with his Johnny Cash on his Nashville Skyline album.     3. Masters of War - Dylan's most scathing anti-war song and one of his most vicious protest songs ever. You can feel the venom in his voice as he talks of politicians who use war for financial gain. This song is still powerful now in 2005, in fact it may be more relevant than ever now.     4. Down the Highway - Country-blues tune with Dylan doing sort of an imitation of Hank Williams. A good song, but not the most memorable.    5. Bob Dylan's Blues - A short, lightweight country-folk tune. One of the album's lesser tracks.      6. A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall - One of Dylan's all-time classics.   It resembles a protest song, but it's not quite direct enough lyrically to qualify. But it is one of the finest songs of Dylan's early years.    7. Don't Think Twice, It's All Right - Another classic and one of my personal favorites. This is a lovely ballad directed to Dylan's girlfriend Suze Rotolo. Heartfelt lyrics, a wonderful vocal from Dylan and excellent fingerpicked guitar too. One of his best songs.    8. Bob Dylan's Dream - A lovely folk song in which Dylan reminisces about the past. A great lesser-known Dylan song.    9. Oxford Town - Potentprotest song about a racial incident, but I'm not sure exactly what incident is referred to.     10. Talking World War III Blues - A humorous narrative-song with lots of great lines including \\"'I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours,' I said that.\\" However, I prefer the version of the song on Bootleg Series, volume 6 - Live 1964.     11. Corrina, Corrina - A lovely interpretation of an old folk song, and the only song on the album to feature accompaniment. It features a drummer and possibly a second guitar player. It was to be the B-side of an early single, \\"Mixed-Up Confusion\\", which would have been Dylan's first electric song.    12. Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance - Another folk tune arranged by Dylan. Dylan's energetic vocal style on this song is quite similar to that of his debut.     13. I Shall Be Free - The album closes with this humorous story song which starts a style that Dylan would revisit several times in the future. This song reveals Dylan's sense of humor better than nearly anything else he would record. \\"I make love to Elizabeth Taylor... catch hell from Richard Burton\\".    The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is an excellent album that any serious fan of music should own and relish. If you're new to Dylan, this should be one of your first purchases, after Blonde On Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited and Blood On The Tracks. But don't stop here! If you like Freewheelin' be sure to check out Dylan's third album, The Times They Are A-Changin' which is almost as good.
0553573403|5.0|This book (and entire series) get my wholehearted endorsement.  It is, by far, the best modern fantasy on the market.  Martin is a true master of his craft.  A few points that really sold me:<br /><br />Overall tone + characters: While technically a fantasy, this book actually has very little in it that is \\"fantastic\\", or magical.  That doesn't mean NO magic or supernatural beings (especially in the later books), but rather it means Martin prefers to rely on his characters and plot to captivate his audience, not cheap magic tricks you find in lesser works.  It is very Arthurian in tone, just MUCH more realistic and believable.  It has knights and tournaments, kings and ladies, and all the high chivalry you'd expect in an Arthurian tale, but it's just so much more real.  Very few characters are truly chivalrous.  And very few are truly evil.  The vast majority are somewhere in between; some self-serving low-lifes (but not really evil), some brave knights (but certainly no paragons of virtue).  They act more like real life people placed in a medieval setting.  Which I find quite refreshing compared to the cut and dry \\"good guys and bad guys\\" that populate so much bad fantasy.  Just a warning however: don't get too attached to any particular characters, because they may be snuffed out unexpectedly by Martin.  I know I was certainly dismayed (but in a good way) over some characters in this book / series.<br /><br />Plot:  The plot is probably the tightest, most intriguing, and overall best written I've seen since LOTR.  It is absolutely captivating.  This is a book you will fly through despite the length (800 or so) simply because you can't put it down.<br /><br />I guess that'll do it for now.  My advice is clear: read this book!  The language of imagery are sometimes vulgar, but don't let this dissuade you from reading one of the best fantasies ever written.

0064400557|5.0|I'm 31 and still can't get over this book. I read it in my twenties (although I saw the movie as a kid) and still pick it up every year to read. Why? Because it's one of the best books--ever.<br /><br />E.B. White knows how to tell a story. Wilbur and Charlotte are two of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Put them in the same boat as Dorthy and Toto, Ma and Tom Joad, and Holden and Phoebe. Mr. White has written a beautiful book about friendship and redemption, and I found the Christian imagery to be facinating.<br /><br />There are lots of books out there, and if one had to choose the top 50 books in the history of the world, this would be one of them. I've read quite a few novels, but nothing in recent memory was as simple or profound as this little book. It's not just for kids, it's for all people.<br /><br />Also recommended: How to Lose Your Faith in Divinity School
B00026WU4G|5.0|Fantastic album complete with some of the more rhythmic Dylan songs. I must disagree with the reviewer that considers \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" and \\"Union Sundown\\" to be conservative songs. Those are perhaps two of Dylan's most vehemently anti-conservative songs, lambasting American imperialism and overexpansion. How one believes that Dylan takes a conservative view in these tunes is confusing.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|One of the top ten movies of all time. I saw this film in Florida on vacation when it was originally released. I was sixteen years old and that was the end of going into the ocean. Just the day before my brother and I went out about a hundred yards off Miami Beach on rubber rafts. There is alot of suspense in this classic monster movie. Yes it really is a sea monster movie, and there are none better. I recommend you buy it now before George Lucas talks Spielberg into f_____g this movie up with unnecessary cgi effects and \\"extra scenes\\".

B00006EXL5|5.0|I love this album! It is very different from 'Three Cheers' in its sound. It is harder rock and the lyrics are more dark, as opposed to 'Three Cheers' which was more about loss and had a more pop rock-ish sound. I didn't like it right away, but it grew on me. I absolutly love Gerard Way's voice...especially in this album. Those who say that this is 'emo' are completely false. They are a rock group, and their new album could be considered pop-rock. Yes, Gerard DOES put emotion into his singing as should EVERY singer in any band that matters.. if you don't put emotion into your music, what do you have? Bands who have \\"Get and stay number one on TRL for longer than a month\\" as a goal for their band. My Chemical Romance is good music, despite what anyone says about 'emo crap'. Its not the bands fault that they got onto MTV and they got millions of fans and people say that they are 'THE EMOEST BAND EVA!!!!11' They certianly don't claim they're emo. They didn't get famous for being not talented. They just make music. If you don't like, don't listen to it.
0192853619|5.0|An introduction to mathematics could be just that; elementary arithmetic and geometry, or it could be an outline history, or finally, it could introduce the philosophical aspects of the subject.  Gowers does none of those, although he does touch on the history and philosophy of mathematics.  This is really an introduction to higher mathematics, for readers who have reached what in Britain is GCSE standard, roughly eleventh grade in the US.<br /><br />Philosophically, Gowers is a pragmatist.  To him, problematic concepts like infinity and irrational numbers have meaning in as much as they are useful, and are true in as much as they give true results.  As a European, Gowers credits Wittgenstein with these ideas.  An American author would have credited William James.  Gowers sidesteps rather than resolves philosophical problems, thus giving reassurance to mathematicians and irritation to philosophers.<br /><br />The book is a random selection of topics rather than a continuous narrative, but succeeds because each topic is fascinating and the writing is clear throughout.<br /><br />Under \\"Further Reading\\", Gowers includes his own website address, where you can find sections that did not make it into the book.  What a good idea!  The site is as full of good stuff as the book, and gives links to further sites that will give you as much mathematics as you will ever want.

B000096I9G|5.0|This is probably my second favourite DVD beside Roger Water's In The Flesh. <br />Very entertaining, well done show with great setlist, picture quality and sounding. If you are a real Cure fan, you just simply cannot go wrong with this purchase. <br />The biggest suprise was for me the Bloodflowers set. While I consider Disintegration a better album overall, I enjoyed the Bloodflowers set the most. And the Pornography set the least. <br />All the musicians give an outstanding performance, may be except Perry. His guitar playing just seems to be average. Simon is great on the bass as always, Roger is confidently playing and true to the album versions, Jason \\"drums like a dream\\" (RS). And of course, Robert's voice and guitars are excellent. <br />It would be good to see The Head On The Door, Kiss Me and Wish albums on another trilogy tour - but it's just a wish, I know. <br />Still, here is this concert that will please every Cure fan out there. This show is better alone than previous Cure concerts all together.

B000A5044C|5.0|Casual human indifference to the plight of others is one of the horror stories in modern urban life. Witness the now nearly mythic knife stabbing murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City, the multiple stories of parental neglect and social services failures in every major city, and most recently, the left behind victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. In NOBODY KNOWS, Hirokazu Kore-Eda presents a brilliantly understated but chilling tale of a society's indifference to its children.  <br /> <br />After an opening scene whose significance can only be understood at the movie's end, NOBODY KNOWS begins with the happy scene of a 12-year-old boy (Akiro) and his mother presenting a thank you gift to their new landlord, his wife, and their doe-eyed little dog. The landlord rather untactfully asks for Akiro's age and then comments that he doesn't rent to families with smaller children because they are too noisy. By the next scene, we are watching two small children, Shigeru and Yuki, tumble out of the suitcases in which their mother has smuggled them into the apartment. Still another daughter appears momentarily, and mom is soon surrounded by four children, all of whom we learn have different fathers, all absent. Mother appears to have both the voice and mental capacity of a ten-year-old, and after her first, one-month disappearance, she leaves a second time and never returns.  <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, the movie's central drama concerns the four children's ability to survive sans parents. They live first on money left for them by their mother, then from small offerings from two of their fathers, and then by Akira's wits. Oldest daughter Kyoko dreams of going to school and buying herself a piano, younger son Shigeru longs to play outdoors, and the youngest, Yuki, draws pictures until her crayons are mere nubs. At first, the children keep the apartment and themselves clean, but as time passes, everything deteriorates, including their health and their clothing. Thefour children's slow but steady decline into a state of near wildness is reminiscent of LORD OF THE FLIES, but without the internecine conflicts and war gaming. Even when an older girl, Saki, befriends Akira and his siblings, nothing seems to prevent their inevitable slide into a sort of urban savagery. Kore-Eda evokes palpable feelings of revulsion mixed with pity for the children and anger at every adult with whom they come into contact. We can only watch, horrified, as the children regress into mere shadows of their former selves, penniless, malnourished, and barely able to lift themselves from their mats on the floor until, finally, tragedy strikes. <br /> <br />It is impossible not to see NOBODY KNOWS as an indictment of Japanese society as cold, self-centered, and uncaring. Kore-Eda's responsible adults take no notice of the children, even when they are brushing their teeth and washing their clothes in the faucet of a local public park. The only substantive assistance the kids receive comes from Saki and two young workers at a local food store, as if the older generations (the mother, the fathers, the landlord's wife, and even the electric company) are complete bereft of care or human decency. Curiously, somewhat the same critique of Japanese society emerges out of Haruki Murakami's documentary novel UNDERGROUND, which describes the serin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system. <br /> <br />Fans of Kore-Eda's wonderful earlier movie, AFTER LIFE, will find NOBODY KNOWS to be a bleak but powerful tale of modern urban life. This is a gritty and edgy movie that slowly gets inside your skin and lodges under your fingernails until you feel as dirtied and desperate as those four children. For those viewing Kore-Eda for the first time with NOBODY KNOWS, follow this movie up with AFTER LIFE and be introduced to a master cinematic storyteller whose movies will leave you thinking. In today's movie world, that is an exception, and a real treat.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|Wah wah. Look at me. I'm sad and sensitive. I have a lisp and low self esteem and occasionally regress into baby talk.  If you like to watch Jay Gylenthall play the pathetic self loathing egotistical adolescent you should also check out \\"The Good Girl\\" with Jennifer Anniston    It is very easy to see why this movie is popular among 15-25 year old white middle class suburban males who feel they are mentally unsuitable to live in this world yet believe they are intellectually gifted and \\"special\\".  This is an embarrassingly pretentious and corny film written by an egotistic and socially awkward adolescent that feels that he didn't \\"fit in\\" in highschool and probably scored high on the AP English exam.   On the plus side it is weird and original.  The best part about the new release of this DVD is the audio commentary track with Richard Kelley (director/writer) and Kevin Smith.  It is amusing to listen to Smith mockingly patronize the \\"genius\\" of Kelley and at the same time probably wondering how such a crappy film became so much more popular than all of his own films.
B0009X7664|5.0|WOW! What more can be said about [[ASIN:B000071K5L To Kill A Mockingbird]] that has not been said before. It is such an awesome film, thanks to author Harper Lee's remarkably ingenious novel. It is no small wonder she won the Pulitzer Prize for it and Gregory Peck held her in such high esteem. It was undoubtedly the piece de resistance in his long and chequered career.<br /><br />The plot in the film is true to Harper Lee's novel. An adult Scout (played by Mary Badham) narrates and reflects on the events which took place over two summers when she was young girl, growing up in the Deep South, during the Depression-era 1930's. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is her father, an attorney who has been appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus confronts the racist father Bob Ewell (James Anderson) who has -- though we are not made immediately aware it -- beaten his daughter for befriending Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man falsely charged of beating and raping her. In a parallel development, Scout, brother Jem (Phillip Alford) and friend Dell (John Megna) must learn to deal with their own fear and prejudice towards Boo Radley (Robert Duvall), the shy, gentle and mentally-challenged man who lives a few doors down from them in a derelict house. As the trial unfolds, Atticus reasons Tom Robinson is guilty only of pity and friendship towards a white woman, Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox). The Ewell's, who collectively represent a bigoted society that cannot tolerate racial integration, have merely claimed trial to cover their own social guilt or shame for associating with a black man, thus the jury falsely condemns Tom Robinson. Shortly thereafter, he dies under suspicious circumstances while being  transferred to a 'safe haven' in a neighbouring town. To avenge his humiliation in court, Bob Ewell attacks the Finch children. An unlikely guardian, Boo Radley, comes to their aid, killing Bob Ewell.<br /><br />So, where's the dead mockingbird? Well, Harper Lee's more subtle than that. To kill a mockingbird is actually a metaphor. The children, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are mockingbirds. They live their lives as innocently as the mockingbird. They mean no harm to anyone or anything, just as the mockingbird merely warbles his birdsong, never disturbing corncribs and such things.  Ultimately though, each character  is either physically or symbolically killed: Tom Robinson is an innocent man falsely convicted and killed; the innocence of the children is lost to the ugliness of racial strife, which nearly leads to their death at the hands of Bob Ewell; and Boo Radley who kills Bob Ewell should be tried for murder, but will not be arrested and charged because of his innocent nature and selfless act of defending the children. After all, to use the words spoken by Atticus earlier in the film, it would be \\"a sin to kill a mockingbird\\".<br /><br />Director Robert Mulligan  does a splendid job of impressing this innocence upon the viewer. At the beginning of the film, he zooms into Jem's cigar box of memorabilia which he collects over the course of the story, then pans the camera while Scout thumbs through the crayons, marbles, broken pocket watch and figurines. As she hums away like a hummingbird, Mulligan immediately creates a mood of innocence through the eyes of a child.  He carries on with the day-to-day simplicity of childhood in a sleepy Southern town, until half way through the film; then we begin to see this innocence slowly whittled away, much in the way Harper Lee does in her book.<br /><br />Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch gives a reserved and dignified performance of his character, certainly deserving of his Academy Award. The children were naturals. Brock Peters (who passed away a few months ago) as Tom Robinson offers a plaintive and stirring performance. A young Robert Duvall, in his film debut, as the mute, gentle Boo Radley delivers a tremendous performance just with his eyes, facial expressions andbody movement, saying more than some actors say in words, in a whole movie.<br /><br />I've also got to praise Universal Studios for getting this boxed DVD set right \\"To Kill a Mockingbird (Legacy Series Edition)\\". The 2005 release is a vast improvement over the 1998 version. On DVD 1, the film can be viewed with or without the director's comments. On DVD 1 and 2, there is a documentary on Gregory Peck, his family and friends, as well as archived clips dealing with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". All are appropriately interspersed, adding genuine warmth and depth to the man who portrayed Atticus. Quite surprisingly, we discover the actor and character were in many ways one and the same person. Wait, this boxed set also comes with several postcards depicting various versions of the film's theatrical posters, which illustrate if anything how immensely popular the film was and remains to audiences around the world.<br /><br />In closing, I must say \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is at once an amazingly simple, yet profoundly universal story. Strip away its period setting of the 1930's; its occurrence in America's Deep South; and we realise the events could just as easily happen today, anywhere in the world, to anyone. Above all, it is a story that teaches the importance of fairness, justice, respect and love, for it is in these noble acts man learns to transcend his horrible propensity for prejudice, intolerance, ignorance and hatred.than some actors say in words, in a whole movie.

Bujold tends to make her characters realistic, believable people, even the minor ones. The one part which I think goes over the top in silliness is the bug butter. <br /> <br />That said, this is not a good entry point to the Vorkosigan series, because if you're not familiar with the background, you'll be wondering why Bujold chose to write SF if she just wanted to write a romance novel with a minimum of spaceships and plasma arcs.

B000AAF1U4|1.0|No doubt \\"the emperor's new groove\\" is by far a great entertainer and one of the best animated films to come out of disney studios but do you actually need another edition of the dvd when two different editions are already available? One being a single disc and the other one being a 2disc collector's edition. Again another single disc release for the same film doesnt make any sense to me. Moreover they havent even cut down the price this time or improved on any bonus materials on the disc.    I just dont get disney and buena vista's strange ways. They'll keep classics like \\"beauty and the beast\\", \\"snow white\\" etc in vaults for years and keep on releasing stuff which is already in stores everywhere.    This is not a review of the film \\"the emperor's new groove\\" which definitely deserves 5 stars in any case!!

B000641ZA4|2.0|First of all I think Genesis is one of the greatest bands of all-time as well as the solos Phil, Peter, Mike, and Tony.<br /><br />I practically wore out the videocassettes of Genesis: Volumes 1 & 2 years ago when they were first released watching them over and over again.<br /><br />However... even though the DVD collection has excellent video quality and superb sound, some of the videos that require to hear background noise or speech during the video is completely gone. For example... the video \\"Land Of Confusion\\" has several background voices and sound effects such as the Bob Hope puppet saying \\"I...GOTTA...TELLYA\\"! and the crying & wimpering of puppet Nancy Reagan, or the combat boots making a splashing noise in the water, plus several other noise background features missing, unlike the videocassette version. There are several other Genesis videos in this DVD collection that do this... not good!<br /><br />Also, in the video \\"Man On The Corner\\", like reviewer Cesar \\"juliomontoya2000\\" mentioned, why is the studio version of this in the video instead of the live version? Phil's vocals are hardly in synch with the studio version.  There's no rhyme or reason why this happened. Again, the videocassette version is the correct version. I'm a bit disappointed in that!<br /><br />All these features I mentioned could have been easily mixed into the videos... someone got lazy!<br /><br />Overall, it's a great collection but I think I'll make my own homemade DVD Genesis collection putting in the videocassette versions of the ones I want into the disc as well as the unavailable videos (such as Paperlate, etc.) not on the videocassette into my DVD.<br /><br />Thank you Genesis for all the years of great entertainment, concerts, and collectables! Looking forward to your future concerts... I hope!
B000094HLA|5.0|I am astounded by the negative reviews below. I have listened to many versions of the Goldberg variations, but never any better than this. I don't think I ever will be bored by Schiff's performance here. This live-concert is even better than his 1983-interpretation and I don't think it is possible to improve this one. It is relaxing and stimulating at the same time, a feeling of completeness that never is boring.  <br />Moreover, I have never noticed anything wrong about the sound quality and think we use to blame the sound quality when we don't like the way of playing.  <br />By the modern piano, you will of course not get any historically informed baroque music, but I can easily forget this, by thinking of it as pure piano music, valid by the eternal & boundless reason of Bach's musical thinking. So if the listening doesn't bring me back to Bach's era, it gives me something else, not less valuable. I cannot put this on without imagining something very pure, something white, like clean, new snow, white, firm and soft at the same time.
0743267478|4.0|A very fun and easy read with a likeable lead character stuck in a series of adventures you wouldn't wish on anyone.  Nonetheless, all works out for the best in the end.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend is one of the best and most-promising male R&B/Soul artists to arrive on the scene in the last decade and more. His voice is notably distinct in music where most males have a highly nasal, squeaky vocal tone and where their music is relatively one-dimensional. John speaks about so many different things. Pair this with the fact that he writes and composes his own music and can play the piano and we have the male counterpart to Alicia Keys, who both herald from the school of Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and other music extraordianaires. <br /> <br />Let's Get Lifted-Produced by Kanye West and John Legend, this opening track is a mid-tempo that has a very uplifting theme of John lifting music, giving the listener something fresh, something different. When I listen to the song, I do not listen as much to the lyrics as I just get encapsulated in the instrumentation of the song and the vocal arrangements. Lyrically and musically, this is a great introduction to the talent that is John. A <br /> <br />Used to Love u-Produced by Kanye West and John Legend, John's first single which did minimally well as an introductory single, is a mid-tempo cut with a very strong drum/percussion  prescence as well as horns and trumpets. The background vocals add a haunting element to the song which simply talks about not loving someone anymore. The references to Puffy, Jay Z are kind of standard but in this non-standard song, they are refreshing. The song has many elements which makes it a very tight musical piece. A <br /> <br />Alright-Produced by Kanye and John, this song contains a trumpet, saxophone, trombone and tuba. How many modern-day songs contain such a diverse array of musical instruments? All I hear are electronic instruments and programmed drums. However, this dark-toned song which has a relatively haunting, sneaky mood to it, has John talking about a girl who already has a man that she is \\"alright\\" to him and he still wants to experience her. The lyrics reallycreate a story as does the music of the song. Not as good as some of the other songs, but still a very strong musical piece. A- <br /> <br />She Don't Have to Know-Produced by will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas I believe, this cut has drums, a sax, trombone, moog bass and clav, another testament to the musical diversity on the CD. John is singing about his girl not having to know about him dipping off with another girl, whose man does not have to know about John and his mistress' shenanigans. I do not like the theme of the song, but it is a reality and the arrangement of the vocals and of the instrument really fit the song. John sings the song in the right key and it just works. You can almost hear it in his voice that it is something that he is doing, but he knows that it is wrong and that he should not. The regret is there in his voice, which is a quality missing from so many singers who sing all the songs with the same voice, the same emotion or lack of emotion. A <br /> <br />Number One-Produced by Kanye West and John Legend, this old/new school soul mid-tempo with elements of Curtis Mayfield's \\"Let's Do it Again\\" is a mini-masterpiece with a theme of John telling his girl that even though he may go out there and cheat on her that she still is his number one. The sample works really well here and gives it a classic feel. Kanye's rap is very humorous and is worth listening to the song as he says some very \\"different\\" things. This was John's third single which unfortunately made no gains on radio. A+ <br /> <br />I Can Change-Produced by Dave Tozer and John Legend and featuring Snoop Dogg, this old school mid-tempo with John's scratchy vocals either sounds like an old song or a new song sung by an older, veteran artist. The song has many different musical instruments which seems to be a standard. The song speaks about John being able to change his unfaithful ways for his woman. Compared to its predecessors and even the ones that follow, this song is probably the weakest  on the CD as it really goes nowhere and is not different at all. B+ <br /> <br />Ordinary People-Produced by John Legend, this song is what put John on the map. For me, it is modern-day musical masterpiece that artists will be covering in decades to come because it is a song that tells a story and is complimented with simple piano chord progression. John interprets the lyrics of the song wonderfully and the lyrics are well-crafted. The song has a perfect climaxing effect as it builds slowly and by the end it returns to where it began...wonderful. This is one of the best songs of the 21st century thus far, and is part of the impetus in John being accepted and embraced as a serious talent. A+ <br /> <br />Stay with You-Produced by Dave Tozer, this mid-tempo with John's scratchy, longing vocals makes this song a great follow-up to Ordinary People as John confesses that he will stay with his woman through the \\"ups and the downs.\\" The background arrangements are on-point and the simple instrumentation fits the mood/theme of the song making for a very listenable/engaging melody/harmony. This song is wonderful and has classic written over it. It could even be serviced to Urban/Urban AC stations as a single. A+ <br /> <br />Let's Get Lifted Again-Produced by Dave Tozer, this quiet slow song which is short and is basically an interlude has John singing in falsetto as he invites the listener to stay with him and to continue getting lifted as he continues to offer something new....\\"come fly with me.\\" He hits some nice falsetto notes that are surprising because I did not think he could get that high. A <br /> <br />So High-Produced by Devon \\"Devo\\" Harris, next to Ordinary People, this song is the next best musical masterpiece on the CD. It is a very simply arranged song with just live drums, bass, piano and organ. But these instruments are used to help slowly build a climax to the song. Couple this with the fact that John interprets the song perfectly using his vocals as an instrument to paint the picture of his devotion to his girl. The song talks about a love that takes a couple so high and it works as you can picture someone flying on the wind of love. The melody of the song is awesome. The climax is killer as John takes it there like only an experienced, talented vocalist could do. Unfortunately, this is his fourth single and has not really been faring well on radio. But it is a masterpiece no doubt. I really feel this song. A+ <br /> <br />Refuge (When It's Cold Outside)-Produced by Devon \\"Devo\\" Harris and Paul Cho, just as Stay With You follows Ordinary People, this song that follows So High is one of the best songs on the CD with its swirling beat and its different arrangement as John vows that his woman will be his refuge always from war, from violence, from the cold. It is a different song and it too has classic written on it. It could easily be a single in the Urban format. One of my favorites. A+ <br /> <br />It Don't Have to Change-Produced by John Legend and featuring his family, this old-school, 70s sounding cut is a traditional soul groove that is missing on so much of today's music as John invites his family to vibe with him on this cut singing about things not having to change. A very different listen. A <br /> <br />Live it Up-Produced by Devon \\"Devo\\" Harris, Kanye West and John Legend and featuring Miri-Ben-Ari containing elements from \\"Love is Missing From Our Lives\\", this classic which sounds like the first song is one of the better as John tells his woman that they can now live it up after the sacrifices they have made for each other. A different love song in a different arrangement. A+ <br /> <br />Overall, John Legend is a talent who I hope will stay around and truly become a legend just like Stevie, like Marvin, like so many others. He understands the elements of music...vocal interpretation, vocal effects, melody, harmony, various instruments, telling a story with music, chord progression, all of that. What stands out the most is how he changes his vocals to fit the song. He does not use the same vocals even with the same kind of song...sometimes scratchy, sometimes determined, sometimes falsetto, sometimes belting it. John is a musical extraordinaire for this generation. His sales of 1.5 million are a testament to that.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I should have seen this movie sooner, but I didn't and now I'm kicking myself for not having voted for Kate Winslett come oscar season.  Kate deserved her oscar over Hilery, even though Hilery was moving none the less...and whats up with Jim Carreys oscar snub.  He reaked oscar in his role here as Joel, a man who falls in love with a spontanious yet charming Clementine (Winslet) only to have his happiness cut short when Clementine has Joel erased from her memory.  Now Joel, in an act of haste, decides to have her removed as well and so he does, but while undergoing the procedure he realizes he doesn't want the memories gone and so he fights to hide Clementine in other places of his mind so he can keep her forever.  It's a unique look on life and how we as humans, while striving to move on never should forget the past for it makes us who we are.
B000008LOV|4.0|Great CD. It is a shame that Roy Orbison and George Harrison are not here to make another volume. Some of the greatest talent in the US made this one.
B00097DX3U|2.0|When I was growing up in the late 80's and early 90's I liked Soundgarden and I liked Rage Against the Machine and I wonder where these guys have gone wrong. You think that these guys could put together one great album, but all you get are 2 or 3 songs and nothing else but filler.  <br /> <br />When I first heard a soundgarden song, Loud Love, I thought Chris was pretty cool, but now he is nothing but a sell out and the same goes for the rest of the guys in the band, What made Rage good was the way they played, now all it is to me is a amped up Coldplay (who SUCK and our just too stupid to give a bad reveiw too) and I wonder where the intense music went too.  <br /> <br />You want to hear a good album, try Love/Hates new album, Jizzy is not a sell out and knows what to give the fans. A good old rocking album
B00000612Q|4.0|This is an excellent album by the great Rod Stewart. It does not include any of his greatest hits, but I enjoy these songs just as much as \\"You Wear It Well\\" or \\"Reason To Believe.\\" The first two songs, \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Lost Paraguayos,\\" on Never a Dull Moment are pounding flames that brighten the day. Great choice for a novice Rod Stewart fan.
B0007GAERG|4.0|The return of the voice huh?  Well I would have to say the the voice is pretty much gone, but that doesn't mean the CD is a complete waste.  In any case its the complete opposite.  Mariah to me still has what it takes, and now that her high pitch is out she's left with a more smokey sultry voice that suits her musical preferences.  Club hits like 'It's Like That' or 'On the Floor with Nelly' or 'Get your number' are great rump shakers.  My personal favorite is 'stay the night' where Mariah hits them notes once more for her fans and of course the slowed down love songs like 'We belong together', 'mine again' and 'circles' and who wouldn't like ehr calabo's with Snoop on 'say somethin' and twista on 'one and only'...all and all this is a great comeback from a star who lost her shine after the mess that was 'Glitter'.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|man..after years of crappy batman films, excluding the first batman..it was a worthy effort, Nolan gets the character right..first off, he dosnt make gotham city look like a circus town, and dosnt have nipples on the batsuit..which is good..and while some people may complain that this movie lacks all the action, keep in mind that it is called Batman Begins, and goes into what the character went through to get awesome like he is.  in short, a great comic movie for any fan
B000ADWDF2|4.0|Intense & at times disturbing portrayal of 2 brothers and their troubled personal & family lives. The changes that these 2 brothers undergo show how circumstances can drastically change people's lives in unforeseeable ways. One of the only films to show so graphically how the traumas of war(in this case a grizzly incident that happens to one of the brothers as a prisoner of war) can transform someone into a deeply disturbed maniac. Good story, excellent acting.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|The O.C. is one of my favorite TV shows, but I think that the first season was better than this season.  The plot is still there but is less interesting. I hope that the new season brings back the good show the fans are waiting for.
068987474X|1.0|I am very very disapointed... i still have BOT even gotten my book... i bought it for a birthday gift for my sister and i still have NOT gotten it! i am very upset and would like to recieve it soon <br />Jessica Kelsey
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'm a Catholic, unfortunately not always a good one. Gibson's \\"Passion\\" made me see the torture and suffering Jesus the Man went through for all of us. Even for these pathetic, socially retarded people here making all these 1-star crank reviews.  <br />Is the film gory and ultra violent? Certainly. That's what crucifixion was...deliberately extreme and slow torture. <br /> <br />Watch this movie. Whether you are a beliver or not.
0425074811|4.0|It was suggestd by a friend that I read this book and I must say I enjoyed it. The author is very enthusiastic about his subject and his research is extensive.Only criticism is that he tends to repeat himself a little. This coud be partly because of his enthusiasm.
6304698690|4.0|I'm a 37 year old guy who will watch Hellraiser and listen to Front 242 and then curl up and get a little teary with The Secret Garden (I'm a Gemini of course). I love the kids in this movie, Maggie Smith (boy, does she look familiar!), and Lord Craven (John Lynch) is earnest and touching without being saccharine.    I found the landscape photography visually intriguing and beautiful. What interested me most was the rather sudden transition from mature forest and green lawn to purple and red moorland. I haven't read the book but I can surmise that the estate is in the middle of the moors and is an \\"oasis\\" of woodland and greenery-kind of like Hound of the Baskervilles, which I *have* read. The main house is incredibly intriguing, inside and outside, and is luxuriantly decorated [...].    My question is where was the movie filmed? In Hollywood (horribile dictu) or on a genuine estate in some windswept moorland? Lemme know.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The starwars Trilohy was the best 3 movies i have ever seen. I realy like the bonis disk that tells the making of the movies. I like how Lucas was able to remaster the Star Wars movies. I have seen boath the 1977 versions andthe 1997 versions of the movies. I think the up dated versions and added bonis material realy ad to the story line.  <br /> <br />
B0002O37RM|1.0|after the beauty of \\"nocturne\\", i expected this to be , at least comparable, since many of the same people are on this date...sorry...this is a sad, boring excuse for music, let alone jazz, and i'm at a loss how such gifted musicians could sound so lifeless...maybe its the material, which may sound great sung by a decent vocalist, but leave nothing much to an arranger but dull, boring melodies, void of emotion, and inspiring (?) the most insipid playing ...despite this, some solos get slightly off the ground, but over all, this is an awful , boring, deadly dull record, and all connected to this should go back to the wooodshed.
B000AM6OQ2|1.0|The other thing that hooks the Consumer (& Lover of Film) to buy these \\"So-Called\\" new S/E Disc's is that when you buy the \\"Supposed\\" new \\"The Fog S/E\\" DVD for Example you get a Free Movie ticket to the Re-make..Whoppie...why can't Hollywood be orginial and make a real film instead of trying to rip-off a cult-horror classic.  & I wish movie studios would stop re-relaeasing DVDs W./a free movie ticket to there re-makes and crappy sequels when you buy a Re-Packaged DVD W./nothing new added except nex \\"Box Art\\"! Wow? Not!
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is something you just have to see to believe. No words can really describe it. Each person who views Baraka will take their own meaning from it. Totally visual with the creators letting you come to your own conclusions. Awesome. Connie McAyeal
B000924MCQ|5.0|\\"The Spanish Apartment\\" (L'Auberge Espagnole) is what Xavier is in desperate need of when he arrives in Madrid to study Spanish and to immerse himself in the culture so as to follow his father's footstep and become a Bureaucrat in a Paris-based firm that deals primarily with the Spanish.<br /><br />And what he finds is more than a proficiency in the Spanish language of course, he finds Love, he finds what appears to be lifelong friendship with his six roommates who come from all over Europe and ultimately...he finds himself. \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" then is about finding out, after twelve years of schooling, after listening to the where/the why's/the who's from a host of teachers...who we are, who is our core self, what are our dreams, what will we make of our lives?<br /><br />Pretty basic stuff, n'est pas? But director Cedric Klapisch has fashioned this film in such a way and inhabited it with such interesting and winning actors/characters that we are fascinated and entertained. It is a sunny, compassionate film without one mean bone in its body.<br /><br />\\"The Spanish Apartment\\" deals with the serious issues of relationships and self-realization. Klapisch has just chosen to present them in a truthful, emotionally available, particularly French and slyly humorous manner.
B00005RDRO|4.0|The movie is an excellent spoof of all the mystery detectives that hold out vital bits of information until the final pages....I'm not a huge Neil Simon fan but this one is just plain fun.  It helps that I grew up reading Christie, watching the Thin Man movies, etc. <br /> <br />Potential purchasers should be aware, though, that the DVD release isn't remastered that well, and in fact scenes are cut that are present in the video!  Scenes that, in my opinion, are among the funniest in the movie. <br /> <br />Buy the DVD for an archival copy of a great movie if you like; but you may want to find a used VHS copy for the full movie experience.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already... This Movie is a Must Have! <br /> <br />Now if its worth upgrading your 25th Anniversary Edition for this, I dunno.. I mean all your really gonna get is an Extra hour on the Documentary, a snippet of a young Speilberg... and a tasty new DTS track. The Image Transfer is the Same... which considering the age of the film is Amazing (though there is some grain and dirt flaws that could probably have been Ironed out for this Edition). <br /> <br />All in all if you haven't already got the 25th Edition, this is the one to get... but if your Happy with what you have, don't feel the need to upgrade. Hang on in there for the 35th, 40th or even 50th Edition.. by which stage will probably be Virtual Reality or something.
B00005YUPO|5.0|My 8 month old son absolutely LOVES this dvd.  We don't allow our children to watch tv for the most part.  However, these videos are wonderful and really capture their attention.  I really want my children to be musically aware and to develop a love of all forms of music, especially classical.  This dvd is an excellent introduction of the baroque genre.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|This CD is a must-have for anyone from the Land of Lincoln, and also others open to hearing great music. I had not heard of Sufjan Stevens prior to hearing 'Jacksonville' on an internet radio station (...). You might expect to hear comedy when you see the CD casing, but you'll be pleasantly surprised to find this is serious music.
B00000I07P|5.0|There are other rock albums i adore, but none as much as this.  <br /> <br />Whether its the slow, slow \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" with passion that slowly, calmly enwraps your soul or the pulse raising fist pumping vitality of \\"Wild in the Streets\\" i can't help being entranced by this album every single time i play it. First note to last this album is in my blood and i enjoy it as much as i did when it was brand new. Without a doubt any music fan needs to own this album.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|No offence to anyone who liked this movie, but it has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I've got a copy of \\"50 Horror Classics\\" with such winners as \\"Attack of the Killer Shrews.\\"  The characters were barely human, purposeless blobs living in a universe beyond their ability (or desire) to understand, to which they reacted based solely upon their stunted and infantile emotions in a stumbling, slack-jawed, nearly drooling manner.  It was Beavis and Butthead without the innuendo, a Quentin Tarantino movie without the violence, Southpark without the violence or bad language. <br />  <br />This is the kind of movie that most directors think they need to add sex or violence to in order to make it interesting (which, of course, for any thinking person, doesn't ever work).  Indeed, the only two marginally funny parts in the movie are a reversion to this concept (though quite greatly toned down): the cow shooting/school bus childrens' reaction and the piata. <br /> <br />The popularity of this movie convinces me that I am, indeed, abnormal.
1400031354|4.0|Another spin on crime fiction, this time with our gumshoe being a middle-aged `comfortably sized' lady from Botswana. Smith hands us some quirky and charming company in an exotic location, although the place is hardly romanticised. I thought he may have pushed the feel-good thing a bit too far with the positively saintly Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni and the near perfect orphan/daughter, but somehow he got away with it - c'mon, why not let your readers enjoy a happy ending now and then. I haven't spent any time in Africa to know, but the settings and disarmingly (to Westerners) open dialogue felt authentic. Despite some ugly content in a continent that's suffered more than its share of poverty, disease and brutality, the book still manages to be gentle and affectionate. This is part of its apologetic purpose: if you think AIDS and corruption is all there is to Africa, think again.<br /><br />In terms of solving a crime, Mma Ramotswe leans more on her virtually supernatural empathetic skills rather than brilliant deduction or wild car chases: she can tell by glancing at a ten year old newspaper clipping who must be guilty by the look in his eyes, and just needs to talk to a suspect to instantly know whether or not he's lying. But the pace of the investigation, with enjoyable diversions along the way, is well measured, and strikes a nice balance with the greater strength of the character's personal lives and interactions.<br /><br />A nice way to spend an hour or two.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day has had some good, and some bad. Overall this CD's contents are good, and even addicting. Of course some songs, such as American Idiot are not that good and can become annoying to listen to agian and agian, songs like Holiday and Jesus of Suburbia make this CD worth it. They do differ a lot in their music, which in this case works for them. However I can never say that American Idiot's songs are better than the 'classic' Brain Stew, Minority, or Basket Case I say if you have the money and are see the CD in the stores, get it.
0859652777|5.0|He has always fascinated me, from his voice to the new shock image when he first began the AntiChrist Superstar album. <br />I wasn't a hard core fan of his, following his every album, but, there are a few I do like, quite frankly, because he has a unique voice, once that can grip you from deep within and cause you to try and sing along with him. Most of all, I love his marketing strategy with A.C. Superstar. Such genius! Even the people who hated him picked up his albums. <br />This book, it's a nice peek inside Manson's life, written in the timeframe I admire him most; from little Brian Warner to Marilyn Manson, Shock-Star! He details his childhood in this book and gives you bits and pieces of detail about his parents and grandparents, as well as school life. And then, the music. He takes you on a journey to the start up of his music career, and gives a little background on that. <br /> <br />It's an all around good read, whether you love him or hate him.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|what are you people thinking this is not funny stuff. now ill admit it is funny the way he talks but that is all.no doubt about it im a huge fan of movies that do not have a point but this is flat out stupid. do not think the movie is funny and buy it just cuz the preveiws look funny.
0743454537|2.0|This novel purports to explore an issue of reliance on sibling donation to rescue a sibling from medical danger. In this case, it's a daughter conceived to be a donor to her older sister, suffering from leukemia. However, since the cast of characters never seems to have a conversation that lasts more than three exchanges before blowing up, nothing ever really gets explored. What we have is 400 pages of endless  feelings - guilt, jealousy, anger, resentment, bitterness, anxiety, blah, blah, blah - capped by a prepostrously tacked-on twist at the end. If you want to read for empathy alone, this one's for you. If you're looking for a well-written, thoughtful, provocative novel, don't go here.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|No Direction Home is simply the best movie I'll ever watch, buy, or own. My thanks to Martin Scorsese for this wonderful gift. I recommend it to anyone who loves Dylan, who remembers the sixties or who doesn't, who loves music, poetry and yes - genius.
6305428352|5.0|Mr. Holland's words.  A true and moving tribute to all those who teach & who sometimes feel as if they are failures.  This is a film to watch & then write every teacher you had who made a difference.  They really could use the boost I'm sure.
B000002AP1|5.0|While this is not only some of Iggy's best work, this is (in my opinion) one of the greatest albums ever. Search and Destroy is a great album opener and the album either stays consistently good if not better as it goes on. Songs like Gimme Danger and Raw Power are songs that should be viewed as classics but are sadly over looked. While this album might be an acquired taste to some, it is a taste worth acquiring and this is a great album in every sense. A classic a five star album and above all a must listen.
6305212112|5.0|I love this movie.  Who hasn't had a true friend at any age.  This film is a testament to the power of love & laughter told in true Souther style!
B000005RSW|5.0|Very impressive rock album. <br />Manowar has developed a very well defined personality. I do not think I have ever heard someone who plays the bass guitar like this.
0800177177|5.0|Excellent rendition of Stoker's classic. Gary Oldman is great. Ryder is a true victorian Nina.   Not overly impressed with Keanna Reeves as Harker but Hopkins was a barrel of laughs as Von Helsink.  I highly recommend this film.  It will become a classic to future generations I'm sure.
0451191153|1.0|The most painful thing about Objectivism is how its most vocal defenders are, by Rand's own definition, the stupid members of the stupid masses. (If you are an Objectivist and you're a friggin' genius, raise your hand). This is particularly clear in The Fountainhead, where Rand hammers again and again \\"you're stupid, Roark is a genius\\" and that seems to please some people, perhaps with hidden SM tendences. Even worse, Rand made her fortune out of book sales in the six figures, and I wonder how many of the poor fools who read it fit Rand's definition of a worthy man. In case you're planning to buy it, the book is about an architect who blows a housing project for the poor because, er, he does not like the facade ornaments. (Yes, that's why, no matter how many Objectivist muck you pour into it). And guess what? The thesis of the darn book is that he has all the right to do that, because he's a darn genius. Oh well.
0812550757|5.0|I was surprised at how different from Ender's Game this sequel turned out to be. I had just finished Game last Friday and was so in love with Ender's character that I didn't bother reading the reviews before jumping right back into the story of his life...so I had no idea...that it's so different.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br /><br />three thousands years later... Ender himself had changed (well of course, duh). I must say that I didn't quite like how Ender was at the beginning of this novel. I didn't like him being the reclusive guilt-ridden spiritual truth-seeker he was for almost half the book. I had missed Ender the Soldier; full of tactics and calculations. Here he seemed too emotionally driven and ruthless. Then I realized that Ender was just as emotional and ruthless in the first novel, the difference here is that he was no longer a soldier, at least not one who is fighting for someone else, and calculating he still was. This is shown by his methods of breaking through the barriers set up by Novinha and the whole community, and of course, the soul-stirring climax of the Piggy-Human \\"Covenant.\\"<br /><br />I find some characters' existence too convenient i.e. Jane and thought that she helped Ender out more than I like. I don't think I felt that way about any characters in Game. Then I realized Jane's help showed that Ender was a mere human; a downplay on his otherwise seemingly godlike wisdom. I liked it that Orson Scott Card did that because it made Ender believable and therefore more deserving of our love, though some of us wish our heroes to be super.... The big difference between Game and Speaker is that while Game was about individual endurance (at least the way I see it) Speaker was about empathy...for all. Card managed to convey so much compassion and forgiveness and hope that I seldom have jerked up this much tears....um...reading. This book is about familiar and foreign morals and how they conflict. But if one can understand another's motive and intentionfor an act or custom, that which seem alien at first can become common ground...the starting point of friendship. It's not for everyone. It's not the scifi war adventure that Game was and much slower in pace and sure isn't for those who are looking for anything less than some pretty interesting philosophical and humanistic ideas. I definitely recommend it for fans of Ender Wiggin, though. Y'all will love him even more.<br /><br />Lastly, I want to mention that Ender has much semblense with a prophet. He also wrote books that were regarded as holy by other characters in the novel. And though in the beginning the Catholic bishop thought of Ender as heretic, his spoken approval of Ender as a Speaker in the end indicated tolerance, if not acceptance, of Speaker practices. I drew a parallel between this and the doctrine of Mormonism that states new prophets can still exist today, and that their writings are added to Scripture. It's as if the book is saying that new prophets can exist and they need to. Then I found out that Card had Mormon upbringing and I went: ah. I'm not making any inference nor implying anything other than that this is interesting. (ur like: rite) Anyways, this book has certain power to it, I'd be flabergasted (dat how it's spelled?) and think you're cold blooded if you read it and haven't thought about forgiving someone you hated. It's a moving novel.
0790729709|5.0|I am well pleased.  This has been the movie I have loved dearly.  For those that haven't seen it I recommend seeing it.  It has Whitney Houston in it and she plays a really good role.
B000002A3T|5.0|Great Album.  They never cease to amaze.  Haven't come across one I don't like yet.
B0000630BT|5.0|Okay, I've only been a fan of these guys for a few months now. I used to dis on Priest all the time just because they were not as metal as, say, Metallica. Problem was with me though, not them. For now, about 16 albums into the collection, including the boxed set, I have to say that I really do think there are subliminal messages in the albums. I used to think that was preposterous, but again the question is raised \\"why is this the best music my ears have ever heard? why have i listened to turbo twice today full knowing it's the worst album of all time just about?\\" I'm telling you, it's brainwashing. Totally. <br /> <br />But I have a review to write, so let me just explain something about my point of view. I listen to rock/rap/metal/jazz/fusion/classical/new wave/punk/country/experimental etc. etc. after doing nothing but spending money on cds and listening to them since I first got a job (along with playing a variety of instruments), it has become fairly easy to call b.s. when a good band makes a bad record and vice versa. <br /> <br />I would be willing to bet that Glenn and KK and Rob were sitting in some lavish room with a tape player talking smack about the horrible trial that was encompassing them at the time, and were proabably listening to the first Testament record, maybe ...And justice for all, and saying to each other \\"now wait a second, we put a face to the anger these guys are feeling and THIS is what WE'VE become?\\" We gotta do something about this to let people know we are SERIOUS.\\" <br /> <br />And then they made Painkiller and all was well again. <br /> <br />So there you have it. If you want lyrics about intellectually disturbing american stuff, you probably have everything I would suggest. But, if you like \\"fantasy metal\\" by MAJESTIC METALHEADS, you should probably go here. Because it does have everything everybody else says; scorching guitars (or more specifically, Glenn and KK sat in their bedrooms and practiced for hours a day before recordingto show each other up), arpeggios and fluid alternate picking and classical voicings etc. Ian plays the bass (you listen to metal for bass? weird), and Scott Travis doesnt care if you dont like double bass or not, so he manages to impressively not stop for almost an hour. <br /> <br />But let us not forget the leather rebel himself. He does not want you to introspectively find yourself in his voice, or the lyrics. The songs rhyme and he can hit every note in every octave flawlessly. Im trying to say that real metal dudes know how to sing, and there is an integrity to the human voice that only Rob has in the Metall genre. I'm also REALLY hoping you don't listen to heavy metal for genius wordsmanship, because if you do, the problem is NOT the lyrics on this album, it's probably you. <br /> <br />Yeah. What do I know though? I think \\"what burns never returns\\" by Don Caballero is the best metal album of all time, and it has no vocals and is not metal. Whatever, just make sure you know what you like before you buy \\"Point of entry\\" or the previously mentioned out-of-closet confessional that is \\"Turbo.\\"
0790733900|5.0|One of the most poignant performances Paul Newman ever gave was in this brilliant film, \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" from 1967. Newman plays a Southern convict and loner who specializes in putting up a front with his fellow inmates and prison guards. His strong will, humor, and smile make him such a likable character. Even though the time period is set in the 1940s, one may feel that he/she is viewing a 1960s presentation due to its camera transition scenes, music, and themes of the time period (post-World War II {Vietnam for the 1960s} and lack of communication between people).  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a very enjoyable film. The color, quality of sound, direction, and plot were fashioned together quite well. The viewer also has the opportunity to see fine performances from actors, Jim Jeter (Little House on the Prairie), Ralph Waite, Robert Donner (The Waltons), and Morgan Woodward (Dallas). This masterpiece is one not to be missed by those who are interested in the criminal justice system as well as the conflicts of the mid-20th century.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Powerful is the only word I can find to describe the power Micheal Buble has over listeners. Singing so softly, or raising his voice to the heavens in a thunderous show of power, Micheal Buble maintains his grasp on your senses. All of them. Solidly. <br /> <br />If you are buying only one artist's music this year Micheal Buble and It's Time gives you powerful reasons for this choice.
0790737345|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  Full of all that makes a great chick flick.  It is caring and emotional, and never fails to make me cry.  I especially love the fact that it does not have a typical chick-flick ending.
B000002L7R|5.0|Considered a curveball to those Prince fans that were expecting Purple Rain 2 in 1985. But here, on Around the World In a Day, Prince shows off a good bit of his Beatles influences, along with bringing together alot more of The Revolution's collectively talents. Once again, Prince broadens your horizons as you listen to some of his most challenging and adventurous pop songs ever released.    The opening Indian-Beatles flute playing of the title track, along with psychadelia of \\"Paisley Park,\\" the opera \\"Condition of the Heart,\\" the pop-catchiness of \\"Raspberry Beret,\\" the stripped-down bit of funk in \\"Tamborine,\\" the Hendrix-inspired \\"America,\\" the genius questioning of \\"Pop Life,\\" the personal \\"Ladder,\\" and the climax of \\"Temptation\\" will definitely change your outlook on Prince if you haven't heard it enough of his stuff.    Prince's most creative journey begins here, as \\"Parade\\" doubles up on it, along with the masterpiece \\"Sign 'O' the Times\\" in tow...    Get ready for an adventure!
B00007GZR5|5.0|The imagery of this movie is spectacular.  The story line is such that it is easy to really believe the love that they share.  Robin Williams' dramatic performance is just excellent.  And I highly recommend this movie to anyone who questions the life after death issue.  This movie gives a new twist to that regard.
B000002LE6|5.0|Probably the most joyous time to be a Prince fan, considering how incredibly positive the album is, along with the accompanying tour that's been deemed Prince's best to date. Songs such as \\"Eye No,\\" \\"Glam Slam,\\" \\"Lovesexy,\\" \\"Dance On,\\" and \\"Alphabet St.\\" demonstrate as the albums most energetic tracks, while \\"When 2 R In Love,\\" \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" and \\"Positivity\\" show off his creative writing abilities.    Lovesexy is a gem for any Prince fan. Don't let the album cover fool you.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is one of the 90's best albums.  I am a grunge-lover, and a huge fan of Nirvana, AIC, and STP, but none of them quite live up to Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />One of the other reviewers commented that Nirvana offered that glam and hype, but Pearl Jam offered that music -- I completely agree with that.  Pearl Jam is one of the revolutionary bands of the 90's, and Ten, their debut album, is also their best album.  Every song is good, though classics like Alive, Even Flow, and Jeremy (my personal favorite) stick out.  If you are new to Pearl Jam, you should definitely start with this album. <br /> <br />An earlier reviewer (\\"A Kid's review\\"), obviously a complete idiot, put this album down, saying something about it being the \\"80's rock of the 90's\\".  Obviously this person know's NOTHING about 80's rock or grunge rock.  The grunge movement (Nirvana, AIC, Pearl Jam) brought the END to the horrible 80's glam rock (THANK GOD!).  He also made a comment about Eddie's lyrics being \\"un-meaningful,\\" comparing them to \\"better\\" groupds, Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin.  No offense, kid, but there's something called musical talent, and Chavele & B.B. don't got it.  Don't listen to the \\"kid's review.\\" <br /> <br />Get this album!  It parrallel's with Nirvana's Nevermind, and AIC's Dirt.  It is definitely one of the greatest albums of our time.
B000002L9B|5.0|Parade touches so many different stylings and music boundaries that it's considered by most fans as the pre-cursor to his creative masterpiece, Sign 'O' the Times. If anything, this album told everybody that he and The Revolution could do alot more than the average  band, especially with Prince at the helm. <br /> <br />Being the final Revolution album, there's definitely plenty of \\"bang\\" throughout. A funky, quirky, European-bound valentino in Prince leads the listener on a musical joyride. Jumping from style to style within the first 6 minutes of the album! From \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\" to \\"Under the Cherry Moon,\\" you will be hooked. <br /> <br />Tracks like the dancible \\"Girls & Boys,\\" the definitive Revolution song in \\"Mountains,\\" the #1 single \\"Kiss,\\" the funky \\"Anotherloverholenyohead,\\" and the tear-filled \\"Sometimes It Snows In April\\" will have you spinning this album countless times. Especially for the Prince fan in all of us.
B000065V3H|5.0|While this was far from the greatest movie ever made, I give this 5 stars because it speaks to a part of us that wants so badly to be accepted and another revelation that people are nothing but followers if you know the right buttons to push.  Ronald, a dork, has been mooning over the most popular girl in school whose lawn he's been mowing for years.  He also wishes to be invited to all the A list parties, be liked by others than his fellow nerds, and just be liked.  When the most popular girl in school, Cindy, is in a moment of peril, he offers her a large wad of cash to buy himself popularity.  The two pose as a couple at their school, with her at his side he is able to walk down the Popular Kids' hallway, eat at their lunch tables, and become included in their social activities.  Eventually, according to plan, he and Cindy split and his popular status is secured.  Ron, however, gets a swelled head as he feels he has accomplished something when others haven't, and leaves all his former nerd friends in the dust.  When Cindy, in a moment of tipsy anger, reveals that the whole thing was a plot and that he bribed her affection, he gets a sudden cold shoulder from his true friends that he spurned and the cool kids who he thought were true.  Now Ron is really alone.  People are followers, no doubt about that.  Ron finds out that the people whose admiration and friendship he sought so hard for are actually shallow, arrogant and insecure.  He himself became shallow and arrogant, and forgot who his real friends were.  The sweetly awkward nerds were more genuine friends than he ever hoped for.  Even the sluttiest girl in the school (who gave more rides than Greyhound) was ashamed she's done the deed with him!  As this was still a fantasy type movie, things work out in the end that Cindy discovers she really does care for him because he's not shallow like her other friends he just wanted to be liked.  Even his nerd friends accept him back, and everyone in school learns a valuable lesson about acceptance.  This is also, as so many of us learn over time, another part of our growing pains.  Many of us can and will achieve a certain status in life where we feel that we are better than others and we let it get away from us until we encounter someone even smaller than we are who takes facts or even some trivial piece of information and rips you to shreds with it.  It hurts, to be sure, but it's part of the maturing process.  And remember, life after high school does not change all that much.  All you can do is cope a bit better.  And you know what?  As an adult, you can be way cooler than you were in high school, the rest of them stay there.  And RIP to Amanda Peterson who played Cindy.  Ironically it seems that while she played so clean cut and fresh in this movie, she was hiding a much darker side of herself and died in 2015 at age 44 of a drug overdose.  Just like all the other child stars, she didn't make it.
B000AY74OG|5.0|i am a 19 year old girl and my boyfriend and i went to go see this movie. we laughed through the whole thing! it was hysterical. this movie was so entertaining. i cannot wait until it comes out on dvd! im totally going to get it!!!
B00005JN0T|4.0|I found *I, Robot* to bear thematic similarities to Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, which I am currently teaching to high school students.  It addresses in the medium of the early twenty-first century the same concerns that Shelley foresaw in the early nineteenth century and helps students to see that science and technology continue to raise the same ethical and moral issues they have from the time of the Industrial Revolution.  It makes great food for thought.
B000AL730O|5.0|\\"Chaos and Creation\\" is a comeback to greatness for Paul McCartney. While he never exited the spotlight with records that failed to chart, this album is as solid or better than any of his previous solo efforts. \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"English Tea,\\" and \\"Too Much Rain\\" sound as if they were taken from the Beatles' REVOLVER or SGT. PEPPER album. The songs walk with a bounce in their step, and the first single, \\"A Fine Line\\" is proving to be a radio hit. If you're a fan of Paul's solo work or the later Beatles catalog, you'll be pleased with this collection. There's still DRIVING RAIN-type mediocrity found in \\"How Kind of You,\\" but CHAOS AND CREATION is certainly better than anything he released since 1989's FLOWERS IN THE DIRT, and maybe for his entire solo career. This album is Paul at his best. It's a return to the 60's, a time when Paul was king of the music world.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|At first, \\"Funeral\\" isn't one of those albums you think you'll like.  But then you get listening to it, really listen to what they're saying, and realize that it's worth your time. <br /> <br />By far one of the best CDs I've bought this year - definitely worth checking out.
B0001BS4Q0|2.0|Much as I tried to like this cd, there are really only about 2 or 3 songs that are worthy in my opinion. I was turned on to this one because I heard \\"Breathe Me\\" on the finale of \\"Six Feet Under\\". Coupled with the exiting montage it was an excellent choice and I do like the song by itself, but the rest of this album just isn't as interesting. The repetitive lyrics make it downright irritating to listen to, and if you're gonna repeat the same line 16 times you really better be able to sing the heck out of it. Sia just doesn't pull of the gospelly thing; she exudes a forced soulfulness. The album is just a little too drowsy for my tastes as well. I expected more of a sonic treat, with cooler samples and more ambience than brood, but it instead fell a little flat. At this import price too, it's hard to justify.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I bought the Japanese version and it ROCKS!  The story is rich and deep, the action is intense, the music is incredible.  I will not give any spoilers away, but it is worth buying.  A true FF7 fan's pulse will skyrocket throughout this movie.  Anyone who appreciates hardcore action will be thrilled to see CG movies have finally reached this capacity.  Actually, I am going to by two of the American release in fear of wearing the first out (along with the Japanese disc).    To those of you who do not like this movie, I think Cloud said it best:  ꂾȁB񂽂͉킩ĂȂ

0792833201|5.0|Ok Warner Bros., where is that Special Anniversary Edition DVD that was supposed to come out in 2003??? This movie is a classic and deserves a better dvd treatment with tons of extras that almost every other DVD has out there. I guess we can all thank Mr.Steven Speilberg for this. It's been rumoured that that the release was suspended until indefinately because of the stupi controversy about who really directed Poltergeist, Tobe Hooper or Speilburg. Come on people, it's over 20 years now, who cares by now. Speilburg and the people at Amblin aren't doing this film the great treatment it deserves. Put that Special Edition out there! The fans want it!
B0007Y08IS|2.0|I'm a big fan of South Park, but Matt Stone and Trey Parker's films are really running out of gas. The puppetry and sets in Team America are pretty spectacular, but Stone and Parker's usual themes of bashing celebrities, raunchy sex and huge volumes of bodily function humor are wearing very, very thin.    A lot of reviewers are getting just a bit too hysterical about the actor bashing in Team America. They're overreacting. Stone and Parker are hardly the shiniest pennies in the pile when it comes to satire. The Simpsons' writers, for example, satirize their subjects with much more wit and intelligence and that show is now in its 16th season. Parker even all but admits in one of the DVD's extras that he has a blanket hatred of all actors. It's pretty telling that none of the actors bashed in Team America got into much of a snit over their portrayals. Parker and Stone, while having some talent, are pretty nasty and unpleasant people and I'm sure that the actors satirized in Team America recognize that and take their criticism for what it is.    The only reason why I'm criticizing the actor bashing at all is that Stone and Parker keep using this and other themes in every single film they make. They're always bashing Hollywood (especially Alec Baldwin). They always have graphic sexual content. There's always enough foul language to make George Carlin blush. And there is always an abundance of toilet humor, including urination, defication, vomiting, farting, etc. Now I certainly don't mind these things if they're done with some originality -- Bigger, Longer and Uncut's first half hour was hysterically funny. But there's no originality in Team America's vulgarity. The flatulence scene in Blazing Saddles was inspired. The zipper scene in There's Something About Mary was hysterical. However, the humor in Team America is just tired rehashing.    Maybe, in a strange way, Parker and Stone are funnier on South Park because on television -- even cable television -- there are some limits on content. In that medium, the two have to use more imagination and more true wit to get around the censorship to make their point. In Team America, however, Parker/Stone aren't subject to these restrictions. As a result, they think that flat-out vulgarity with no originality or wit alone will make the audience laugh. This time, it just doesn't work.
B0000942HV|2.0|This remake will only sound \\"better\\" to you if your definition of \\"better\\" is nothing more than replacing real instruments with hi-tech synthesizers. If you care about the technological aspects of music more than the music itself, you'll probably like this one more. But if you care about emotional resonance, PLEASE, do a favour to mankind and forget this one. Tubular Bells will remain timeless and awe-inspiring, while this remake will date very, very quickly. If you already have the original and want something more, go get \\"Incantations\\" or \\"Amarok\\", and only get this one if you worship soul-less exercises in technology like \\"The Songs Of Distant Earth\\".
0440234743|5.0|To say this is one of Grisham's best efforts would be significant praise in and of itself.  However, there is much more to this book than just a good story.  As usual, Grisham can take characters with serious personal flaws and portray their shortcomings without being profane or excessively graphic, a welcome relief from those who head for the moral basement whenever given the opportunity.  Also as usual, the story moves forward at a comfortable pace neither dragging nor rushing development of the story. <br /> <br />This is an especially great airplane book for those 2 hour + trips. <br /> <br />My copy of The Testament was not shelved upon completion or shared with another reader.  I suspect there are others who are using this book for more than just idle reading enjoyment. <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|5.0|By Phillip Cenere     Documentary   Directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky     A fly-on-the-wall insight into the world's most successful and notorious heavy metal band, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster is a documentary more about relationships than music.     Three years in the making, when the film begins Metallica haven't had a tour in several years and have just spilt with their long-time bassist Jason Newsted, leaving many fans and music journalists questioning the group's future. Relationships between vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield, percussionist Lars Ulrich and guitarist Kirk Hammett are volatile, and any remaining morale is quickly disintegrating.     Under pressure to record their first album in five years ( St. Anger) while faced with the seemingly impossible task of finding a replacement bass player, the band's management hire therapist and 'performance enhancement coach,' Phil Towle, in a desperate last-minute ploy to stop the band from calling it quits.     Tucked a way in a makeshift studio in San Francisco 's Presidio what follows is a surprisingly intimate and revealing journey about three middle aged men who have dominated the heavy metal industry for over two decades. In group therapy sessions and through the lyric writing process the band members confront their personal 'monsters,' their relationships with one another, and the consequences of their lifestyles and multi-million dollar careers.     Monster avoids the superficial stereotypes about heavy metal musicians. Watching the film we forget that these men have won 6 Grammy Awards, sold over 90 million records worldwide, and in the last ten years have sold more albums than Madonna, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, Aerosmith, Janet Jackson, Celine Dione, or The Beatles. As Metallica goes through a transformation, we begin to realize that these aging rock stars are actually vulnerable human beings with real emotions and problems, and at heart decent guys. We learn that Hetfield is a father of three and we watch as he plays with his children and takes them to ballet practice; that Ulrich is a keen art collector; and that Hammett likes relaxing on his ranch and watching his horses. We see them sitting in a circle looking at one another's family holiday photos, eating lunch together, composing music, and joking around.     With the guidance of Towle, the band write a mission statement and objectives for the future and for a while things begin to look promising, so promising that the group decides that they've gotten all they can out of the therapy sessions and it's time for Towle to go. However, at US$40,000 per month Towle is not going to leave easily, and we get the feeling his using every psychology trick up his sleeve to make the band feel that firing him will mean devastation for the group's mental stability - \\"Lets get to the fear\\" he says.     All plans are halted though when Hetfield decides to check into a rehabilitation centre for his alcohol addiction, leaving the band in limbo. No one knows when or if the lead vocalist will return. After a year of doubts and speculation, a sober but gloomy Hetfield comes back to work with a strict condition: he can't work longer than four hours per day. Of course this arrangement is alien to an industry that requires long grueling hours and nothing short of total commitment, and causes the wedge between Hetfield and Ulrich to widen further. All this leaves us wondering if they'll ever complete the album and how much longer the band will stay together.     Filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky are old hands at capturing gut-retching real life drama on tape. Their Emmy award-winning television documentary Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (1996) followed the trial and conviction of three young men charged with the horrific murders of three children, and its sequel Paradise Lost 2: Revelations (2000) documented their appeals and featured extraordinary scenes with the father of oneof the victims believed to be the true killer.     In Monster they have delivered another powerful piece of nonfiction, splitting at the seams with human drama and emotion. While the film is slow and staggered in some parts and doesn't have the humor of This is Spinal Tap, it is still worth a look, and a must see for die-hard Metallica fans - but they don't need convincing.     [...]
B0007XH5OY|5.0|Having recently discovered that this classic album was available as a remastered import with bonus tracks, liner notes, etc., I jumped, nay, I LEAPED at once to purchase it. If only Epic had bothered to offer such an excellent product when that company remastered Beck's first solo lp, doubtless their sales would have been even better. Other reviewers have indicated they feel the import's sound is better than Epic's; I cannot exactly hear a great deal of difference, though I will admit I hear a bit more punch in the bass. <br /> <br />I can only finally offer this advice: For you who have not heard this since we all had turntables and lava lamps, buy it now! And those of you too young to know what the fuss is all about, buy it now! <br /> <br />Was my advice redundant? Ah well, there you are.

B00023BLXK|2.0|I have nothing against the film's premise itself.  Really.  Romola Galai and Diego Luna make a charming couple in 'Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights' and they are fun to watch.  The corny dialogues and forgettable supports from Sela Ward, Mika Boorem, Jonathan Jackson, John Slattery and January Jones can be forgiven.  Even unnecessary cameo of the star of the original is OK to me.  But, no, what is this?  86 minutes?   <br /> <br />Again I say, I like the beautiful look of the film, but really hates the content which is too thin to make a feature film.  In other words, we need more romance and dancing.  However, the filmmakers foolishly -- yes, a strong word, but I insist --  foolishly inserted \\"politics\\" into the film which should be simple, unalloyed fun. <br /> <br />Yes, politics, for the film is set in 1958.  Havana is going to see a revolution and Castro, but Americans are enjoying themselves in hotels, for whom the local Cubans are working hard.  As if to stress the historical fact and social background, rich father of our uptight American girl Katey (Galai who in fact is an English) is working for one of the biggest motor companies, and her friend January Jones literally despises a Cuban youth Javier (Luna who is in fact a Mexican). <br /> <br />Someone please tell the producers that this kind of film doesn't need this complicated, politically conscious story.  All you need is an American girl who meets a boy in Cuba.  Period.  All you have to add is good music.  (Thankfully, the Cuban music here is irresitible, and it is always so.) <br /> <br />But for all good soundtrack, the dancing scenes are less than satisfactory.  The dance sequences themselves are pretty good (though obviously the leads need more lesson), they are too short, and the final chapter that should be the rousing finale is interrupted by ... yes, politics, or the revolution.  Even the fans of Diego Luna, who must have given this film positive reviews, would agree with me.  Why should we be reminded of Castro reperatedly when we need more dancing? <br /> <br />There are lots of films about dancing, and my favorite is Buz Luhrmann's 'Strictly Ballroom.'  Please see it, and then you know ehat I mean.

Perhaps it was the contemporary \\"crusader\\" implications of the U.S. invasion of Iraq or the strong support of Israel by American evangelicals and the rise of radical Islamic terrorists that chilled the public's desire to see a film that explores and exploits the core conflicts between Christianity and Islam regarding Jerusalem.<br /><br />Criticized by both Arabs and Christians as taking the other's side, the film's an epic adventure that follows Balian (Orlando Bloom), a simple French blacksmith who discovers he's a nobleman and assumes his father's place in Richard the Lionheart's Third Crusade (1187-1192) to reclaim Jerusalem from a Saladin.  The main characters are based on real people with the exception of Balian's father.<br /><br />This convincing visual recreation of another era catches arguments for both sides and spotlights the self-serving agendas of those who influence the powers-that-be.<br /><br />The details of siege warfare in the climactic battle for Jerusalem, the huge scale of the confrontation and the fiery catapults are a wonder of modern filmmaking.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has actually seen this impressive film has enjoyed it.<br /><br />For more on this relevant theme, read James Reston's terrific book \\"Warrior's of God\\" and see the superb two-hour PBS documentary \\"Holy Warriors\\" now on DVD (Paramount).
1400031087|1.0|I know that James Frey may come and Beat Me Up because I am writing a Bad review of his Book, but this book was completely unbelievable and filled with so many ego-strokes for the author that I hated it.  James Frey is delivered into a Drug rehab center at the age of 23.  He is addicted to Crack,Alcohol,Glue, Etc.  During the course of his stay there, he expects us to believe that he was given two Root Canals without any painkillers.  He also is Sooooooo Scaaaary that hardened criminals and members of the Mafia are Frightened of Him.  He is also so incredibly Smart that He Knows how to recover without help from the Counselors who are trying to Help Him.  The most unbelievable part was when he decided that he knew best how to treat a Crack Addicted Girl who was thrown out of rehab because she was Obsessed With Him.  He marches out of rehab, finds her, and brings her back.  Right James, I am sure that your amazing intelligence and four remaining brain cells really enabled you to Find The Girl.  James Frey mistakes good writing with random capitalization.  I am not an A.A. Nazi by any means, but the idea that James can go from doing Any Drug He Can Find to Just Not Doing Drugs without any help is not believable.  If he is not using, he soon will be.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films ever made (in my opinion).  If Stanley Kubrick had to be remembered for one film then this is the one.  Beautifully filmed and directed, Kubrick also manages to get the best performance ever out of the highly underrated actor Ryan O'Neil.  Based upon the novel of the same title, this Barroque era saga follows the life of Redmond Berry who flees from his small hamlet in Ireland to seek fame and fortune.  I have never seen such a masterpiece of a film.  Don't let the era of this movie prevent you from watching this celluloid gem.  You wont regret it!<br /><br />Intellectual eye candy.  Witty banter and perfect framing and cinematography makes this film a must see.  You also get to see Ryan O'Neil act his for once in his life!!<br /><br />Great stuff from a master film maker!
0375805621|2.0|I loved the first book, There's a Monster at the End of This Book, but I wasn't impressed with the second (this) book. I remember as a child reading the original, and I had to get it for my 2-year-old son. I thought that he would love the one with Elmo (because he loves Elmo) but he wasn't that into it, and I wasn't thrilled with the story line.
B0002858YS|5.0|I heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio constantly when this album was released, and I quickly decided that it was a hell of an annoying song.  A few months ago I heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" on the radio, and set about trying to find the album which the song was from.  The album is, of course, \\"Hot Fuss\\", and it's easy to see why there's been so much hot fuss over the album.   <br /> <br />From the opening of the first track, \\"Jenny Was A Friend of Mine\\", you're hooked.  \\"Jenny\\" is one of the album's many fantastic songs.  My personal favorite is \\"Mr. Brightside\\".  \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" is another fine song.  \\"All These Things That I've Done It\\" is right up there with \\"Jenny\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" for the best track on the album; the part around mid-song where Brandon Flowers sings \\"I got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\" is one of the most popular lyrics from any song in the last few years.  There are plenty of other great songs on the album, but it's those songs mentioned above which I listen to the most. <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of 80's music, and one of the things which I love the most about The Killers is that they sound almost as much like an 80's band as they do a band from the new millenium.  There's some strong emotion in these songs, thanks to the combined effort of all the band members: Brandon Flowers' vocals, David Keunig's guitar, Mark Stoermer's bass, and Ronnie Vannucci's drums.  The lyrics are powerful and really draw you in to the stories which these songs tell.  I found my mind flooded with different images for each song.   <br /> <br />\\"Hot Fuss\\" is one of the most impressive debut albums of the new millenium.  As far as I'm concerned, it's definitely worth making a fuss over.
B00005LC1H|5.0|The selection was for a Birthday, his 22nd and he enjoyed the dvd.  Also the price was a good bargain.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I love Coldplay.  I don't know why, exactly.  They just have this cool, relaxed, refreshing sound.  Great guitar and easy drums, not to mention Chris Martin's vocals.  I guess they're just a cool band - which is something that there seems to be an absence of nowadays.  I liked \\"Parachutes\\" a lot, and I thought \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was even better.  But I've gotta say, I think \\"X&Y\\" is the band's best yet.<br /><br />The album is just one great song after the other.  It kicks off with \\"Square One\\", which starts out sounding a little mystic, as well as calm.  The percussion comes in and it starts moving a little faster, and then the guitar enters and it takes off.  \\"What If?\\" takes a little while to get started, but once it does it's great.  \\"White Shadows\\" is a terrific song, with heavy drums and a great guitar line; this is one of the band's best.  \\"Fix You\\" is a nice song that has a nice feeling of closure to it (maybe it should have been at the end of the album?).  Again, once the guitar comes in, \\"Fix You\\" really takes off.  This is another of the band's finest songs.  \\"Talk\\" is very fun, wasting no time in pulling you in.  And then comes what may be my favorite Coldplay song ever, and the song which I believe is the best to come out of this album: \\"X&Y\\".  It begins with Chris Martin sounding as though he's struggling through something, maybe barely surviving; and then the drums come in and the song gets a sudden burst of strength.<br /><br />The second half of the album begins with \\"Speed of Sound\\", which at first sounds like a \\"Clocks\\" rip-off; after a few more seconds of listening, it's clear that it isn't.  \\"A Message\\" is, for the first half anyway, a calm song which has Martin singing \\"And I'm not gonna take it back, and I'm not gonna say I don't mean that, you're the target that I'm aiming at, and I'm nothing on my own ... got to get that message home.\\"  The next song, \\"Low\\", is a fast-paced tune that's one of the more popular pieces on the album (and it's not incredibly hard to see why).  \\"The Hardest Part\\" is probably the weakest song on the album.  Not that it's a bad song - it just doesn't have anything to make it stand out.<br /><br />The final three songs on the album are all pretty calm.  \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" is a declaration of love from Chris Martin.  \\"Twisted Logic\\" is a bit of a tipsy song with some heavy drums, which closes off the album - or so it would seem.  There is a hidden thirteenth track titled \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" which was written by Johnny Cash, but he died before he was able to record the song.  It would have been a fine piece for Cash, but Martin handles it pretty well himself.<br /><br />I think \\"X&Y\\" is very underrated.  As with the band's previous albums, it takes a few listens for you to really appreciate it.  It's probably the most high-powered of Coldplay's three albums, and I'd say that it is - arguably - the band's best yet.  For fans of the band, it's (obviously) essential.  I'd highly recommend that anyone who's not familiar with the band give it a try.
B0000029GA|5.0|After listening to this album for the past 2 or 3 weeks, I cannot believe that I actually hesistated to buy it.  This is no doubt an absolute classic.  I won't even go song by song, because they are all 10s.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album has alot of twists and turns in it that keep you hanging on and never gets boring, from the first beat of \\"Prison Song\\" to the last wierd sound at the ensd of \\"Aerials\\", this album has a lot of interesting music. the fact that these guys are from Armenia is even better, because Daron (guitar) adds tons of textures with various world music-sounding licks. I would definitely reccomend this to any serious Nu-Metal fan that is looking for something new!
0553212621|2.0|I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the \\"female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part...\\" Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick.

B0009F2C34|2.0|I love the original release of Endtroducing and was super excited to hear about this two disc set. Man what a waste of money! There is nothing special at all about this version, unless you consider the exact same mix minus a couple talking samples here and there \\"special.\\" Seriously, that's about it.  <br /> <br />In the liner notes, Shadow even says that due to the way he recorded the original there aren't any versions that exist with the tracks separated. You desperately need these separated tracks in order to do anything new and interesting with the remix. By his own admission, these are just some old backups of the almost finished songs. There are also a few half assed remixes, including one of the worst drum and bass remixes I've ever heard. What a wasted opportunity.  <br /> <br />The guy's had 10 years to come up with something special and instead he decides to rip off his loyal fans. Trust me, stick to the original one disc version of Endtroducing.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|The Longest Yard is advertized as a comedy, but it's not that funny. You have to get half way through the movie to get the laughs (most come from a cameo) Hoping for more coming for great comedians like Rock and Sandler.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|I strongly advise fans of The Warriors to avoid this falsely advertised \\"Ultimate Director's Cut.\\"  What kind of supposed ultimate end-all cut fails to include a director's commentary, but also neglects to include WELL-KNOWN deleted scenes that have been circulating on the internet for years?  What kind of ultimate director's cut butchers the original film (here, we have horrid comic book panel intros to various scenes and it looks *bad*) without including the option of viewing the original theatrical release?  You know the answer. <br /> <br />Listen up boppers.  Paramount is RIPPING YOU OFF because they think you're too stupid to recognize when you're being ripped off.   <br /> <br />There are rumors that the region II release will include a director's commentary from Hill (somehow I doubt it though), and also seven deleted scenes.  Region II releases are often superior (\\"They Live\\" for example), so I urge genuine fans of this film to wait for that one and see if they get it right, because Paramount sure screwed up with this one.   <br /> <br />Don't do Paramount the favor of supporting this product, lest they release more like it in the future.  Vote with your wallets!

0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a truly wonderful story about the companionship between two friends. Lennie and George were friends since they were both very young and shortly into the story the reader can feel this dependant state that Lennie is in since he obviously has some form of mental retardation. George is the one that has been keeping Lennie in line his entire life. However as the book continues the reader begins to realize that George really does care for Lennie and it he takes care of him out of love. The pair get a job working on a farm with other tenants. The obvious leader of the group is Slim, who starts a friendship with George at the very start. The reader is then introduced to Curley, who's father owns the farm, one immediately recognizes that Curley and his flirtatious wife are trouble. George and Lennie have plans to save enough money to buy a farm and live off the land. Another worker on the farm overhears them talking and asks if he can trade his life savings for a chance to stay with them on the farm. This shows how everyone else is envious of their rare friendship. The lives of the workers then spiral out of control when Lennie accidentally kills Curleys wife. Lennie immediately runs away but Curley knows who has killed her and they chase after him. George goes to the spot they picked as a place they are to go if they get separated. George finds Lennie crying and George comforts him while he slowly raises a pistol to the back of Lennies head and shoots him out of mercy.

B000AL730O|3.0|I'm the type of McCartney fan that awaits each new release like other people wait for Christmas. That doesn't mean I like everything that comes out, but I'm usually happy with most of it. Chaos was pronounced a clear winner by the critics even before it was released, with some claiming it was like his days of \\"Rubber Soul\\", or even \\"Ram\\". Oddly enough it's clearly his first album that this recording has the most in common with, although it's nowhere near as good as \\"McCartney\\" is.  I love most of Paul's work, but I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this new one upon first, second and right through to nineth listen. A couple of songs I didn't care for the first few times have grown on me a little, but overall my opinion hasn't changed much. Still, there are some excellent songs on it. Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain, and Anyway are beautiful compositions. I also really like the instrumental track snuck in at the end, but would have prefered it to be a seperate track. The bonus track on the CD single, Comfort of Love, would have been a better choice than some of the songs that found there way on the disc ( I would have even prefered the song Growing Up Falling Down in some cases!)  <br />In the end I regret to say that Chaos is not his best in years like the critics have proclaimed. It's not even his best in general. How Kind of You is dull, At The Mercy and a Certain Softness are embarrassing and Promise to you Girl sounds more like Davy Jones than Paul McCartney, which I guess might be a good thing if you're into the Monkees. The other songs range from good to okay, but if you like Paul as I do you'll end up owning it anyway (A case in point as to how much of a McCartney fan I am is that I own both the regular and the special edition versions of this record as well as the import CD single). I don't lightly dismiss Paul's work because the truth is I want to like it. I put a lot of effort into liking it. And with time I'll probably grow to enjoy this recording moresomeday. But in all honesty I can not say that it's one of his better records. If you're new to his music try RAM, Band on the Run, or Flaming Pie instead.

B00006FM77|4.0|I was introduced to the first half of this landmark recording as \\"Volume I & II\\" on an 8-track tape cartridge (!)  Quite the nostalgia trip.  I must confess, I can't hear a significant difference between the remastered CDs and the original CD release of a few years ago...but of course the newly mixed, previously unreleased tracks are wonderful.  I'm a little surprised that they didn't do some tasteful crossfading between these songs--even a bit of canned applause between numbers would've created the sense of one typical night during this unprecedented week.  Fragmented as this bonus disc is, however, it's a real treat for Carnegie Hall fans.  I'm truly disappointed, however, that they didn't take full advantage of the eighty minutes a CD allows...given all of those performances, alternate takes of three or four more numbers could've easily fit on that disc!  I suppose a bit of marketing comes into play:  a few years fron now, it'll be released yet again as a five or six CD set, broken down into invividual performances from each night...the Late, Great Terry Kath is NOT the only person who shines throughout this effort:  Danny Seraphine's drumming has to be heard to be believed!  This entire set is a showcase for his phenomenal chops during this era...it's almost impossible to believe that this is the same guy whose drumming morphed into the generic tripe heard on Chicago 16 and 17. This album represents Chicago arguably at their peak...at least before David Foster got his hands on them and turned the boys into a hit factory.
B000002KAT|5.0|<br />Van Morrison was extremely musically talented and knowledgeable from the very beginning.  His first release, `Blowin' Your Mind' had amazing songs and, as it contemporaries, was full of electric guitars and psychedelic elements.  But when Van Morrison embarked on the `Astral Weeks' project he knew it was going to be a unique expedition. <br /> <br />The most remarkable characteristic of jazz music lays on its improvisation and this is what Morrison had in mind for `Astral Weeks': an improvised and jazzy rock album.  During the late sixties this was an enormous shift from the electrical characteristic of popular music.  But this didn't matter to him as he never intended for `Astral Weeks' to be popular.  His goal was to create something new, fresh, and musically unheard of. <br /> <br />`Astral Weeks' wasn't fully written or rehearsed.  Van Morrison showed up to the recording studios with a sketch to be improvised along with Jazz musicians during its recording.  But `Astral Weeks' is not \\"jamming\\" by any means; it has an enchanted backbone.  Its sketch was full of mystic and gothic qualities.  The lyrics exceptional and the song arrangement too.  And there had to be some sort of magic in that studio's air because the execution was perfect. Acoustic, profound, and extremely beautiful, `Astral Weeks' is a record out of time that can't be compared with anything done before or after.  Van Morrison smoothly created one of the best musical releases to date.   <br />

1573223026|5.0|Hornby is an excellent writer that writes honestly and direct.  He seems to combine comedy (and a bit of drama) with existential topics like self-obsession (Fever Pitch), the   difference between being light and being deep (About a Boy), and the implications of being good in life as a family and it's entirely (How to be good) - haven't read High Fidelity I'm there is some existentialism there too.  Hornby is serious and touches real topics, topics in which one can feel identified.  His topics make you reflect most times.    His latest novel (A Long Way Down) took me by surprise.  Now his central existential topic got more serious and he had to deal with life and death.  To be or not to be. Suicide.  I think he totally succeeds in this story with his same honest and direct narrative that makes you laugh and ponder while you're reading it.  In this latest novel the narrative structure is simple but extremely original.  He is witty as always now... even more than before; but compared to his previous novels \\"A Long Way Down\\" hits you harder sometimes:  harder, deeper, cruder that what you can be prepared for.  This hardier and the cruder side of the book took me by surprise. I'll never forget JJ's phrase (you'll know why he says this if you've read it): \\"And those two noises, the moan and the thud, I've heard every single day since, and I still don't know which is scarier\\". I didn't see it coming from Hornby. 5/5 and makes me wonder what comes next.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|<br />Bob Dylan's biography on his emergence into the musical (and political) world could not have been documented better than this.  The documental is a real treat. Scorsese really digs deep into the thoughts and actions behind every Bob Dylan move during his rise to fame as a folk singer, a political figure (or so called protest singer), and a true rock icon (to the discomfort of some of the old folk crowd).    <br /> <br />But the viewers don't only learn Bob Dylan's history.  This is an up-close-and-personal deal.  Old and private footage combined with current interviews to Dylan and the people who where there with him (and what friends does he make - Alan Ginsberg, Joan Baez, Al Kooper, just to name a few).  Dylan is praised as the voice of a generation and criticized at the same time.  People clap and go wild during the first half of his concerts and boo and call him Judas during the second half.  And Bob Dylan has a lot to say about all this revolt.   <br /> <br />Some takes are just extraordinary.  There's one in which he is outside of the store that \\"takes your bird, trades your dog, sells cigarettes, etc\\"... Dylan jumping outside of the store reciting all the probable uses of such weird type of shop.  Or him arriving in Paris with a camera and photographing back to the media.  These are just two though; there are so many more; so many anecdotes and the thoughts, actions, and reactions behind this amazingly creative mind and mysterious character. <br /> <br />Faced with a changing and sometimes discriminating society, Bob Dylan remains humble and sincere.  As he says in an interview: it's not his fault he became a famous musician, it just happened like things happen and fame or glory don't necessarily mean happiness and can be perceived at different levels.  Did he really like becoming such a representative figure?  Did he like his audience and cared about their thoughts and feelings? The documentary gives clues to answer these questions but Scorsese is sosincere and unbiased that really leaves room for the viewer's interpretation.  <br /> <br />Time changes, events unfold, and moods are altered. \\"Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes. You'd know what a drag it is to see you\\".  (Positively 4th Street). Positively an absolutely successful documentary.  Unprecedented in the history of music. <br />
B000001GY9|5.0|Robert Schumann was a German composer of the early nineteenth century.  He died young, but not before producing many interesting and stunning works.  In his short life, he produced piano works (that for which he is best known, perhaps), choral works, concertos, chamber music, and orchestral works.  It is of these latter pieces that these discs are composed:<br /><br />* Symphony No. 1 in B flat, \\"Spring\\", op. 38 (composed in 1841)<br /><br />* Symphony No. 2 in C, op. 61 (composed in 1846)<br /><br />* Symphony No. 3 in E flat, \\"Rhenish\\", op. 97 (composed in 1850)<br /><br />* Symphony No. 4 in D minor, op. 120 (first composed in 1841; revised in 1851)<br /><br />The first and the last symphonies bear some interesting similarities, as one would expect, but the later revisions were significant enough to warrant considering the ordering as above, with the second composed now considered the fourth symphony.  For a long time, Schumann seemed to compartmentalise his composition - in 1840, he seemed to concentrate exclusively on 'songs'; in 1841, he wrote two of the four symphonies.  Schumann seemed to need to master each type of music before working on another.<br /><br />The symphonies are each unique.  The first symphony, 'Spring', was born in a matter of days, and fully orchestrated within a month.  There are definite signs here that a man used to composing for piano is at work.  There is romance and humour mixed in for good measure.  The second symphony, composed during one of Schumann's troubled periods (he had mis-diagnosed syphillis that complicated his life, as did some of the treatments), was also a quickly inspired and completed piece, but there were gaps of time between his periods of work.  There is a slowness and melancholy about this symphony.<br /><br />The third symphony, 'Rhenish', is easy going and occasionally sweet, but the fourth movement has the majesty of Gothic architecture about it.  (Only the first and third symphonies have given subtitles.)  The fourth symphony, the one with the longest timeline of composition, is perhaps the most complex, despite being envisioned somewhat as a symphony-in-one-movement.<br /><br />Schumann was a leading light in the German Romantic movement, and this series of recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic under the conductor Leonard Bernstein is truly remarkable.  Bernstein's appreciation and connection with the passion in the music comes through with a keen sensitivity.  Schumann was a master of detail as a composer, just as Bernstein was a master of detail as a conductor, so here we have a near perfect pairing.<br /><br />Schumann's symphonies are underappreciated generally, though there are some who proclaim them as unparalleled in the post-Beethoven world.  Both ideas may be a bit wide of the mark, but certainly Schumann is closer to the later than the former.<br /><br />Brilliant!rth symphony, the one with the longest timeline of composition, is perhaps the most complex, despite being envisioned somewhat as a symphony-in-one-movement.   <br /> <br />Schumann was a leading light in the German Romantic movement, and this series of recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic under the conductor Leonard Bernstein is truly remarkable.

B000001ESF|5.0|This is Rush's 4th album (the third they did with drummer Neil Peart) and it is here that you see the changes the band went through to become who they are today. Neil Peart (serving as drummer and principle lyricist by this time, still letting both Geddy Lee & Alex Lifeson write lyrics from time to time at this point) as well as bassist/singer/keyboardist Geddy Lee and Guitarist Alex Lifeson wrote this 6 song epic that remains a rock esenntial to this day and is probably in the top 5 Rush albums. This album also shows a side to Rush I myself never saw again (this side presented in \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\"...Look at the lyrics). Here are the tracks; <br />1. 2112-5/5-20 minutes long and doesn't fail to entertain. The song is separated into 7 parts; Overture, The Temples of Syrinx, Discovery, Presentation, Oracle; The Dream, Soliloquy, and Grand Finale. Apparently there's a story that goes a long with it. Some of the song is instrumental, some of it's not. But, whatever, great song. <br />2. A Passage to Bangkok-5/5-These lyrics are very un-Neil Peart like, but they're great. It's sad they don't do this song live anymore. <br />3. The Twilight Zone-5/5-Another great song. A little slower than the former songs. <br />4. Lessons-5/5-Great chorus <br />5. Tears-5/5-Really slow song, I'm pretty sure (not entirely) that the lyrics were written by Geddy Lee, but they're strangely cool the way Lee sings them on this song. <br />6. Something for Nothing-5/5-Love this song. Awesome chorus, great lyrics. <br /> <br />A
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Since im a fan of Daft punk. I didnt find it hard to enjoy this movie. The art and direction of the movie was wonderful, and the story was charming. Expect the movie to not have any dialog. Its more of a silent film (besides the music) if anything. If you like Retro-Anime, Or just enjoy strange french Robots play Techno, then you'll love this movie.
B000002H92|5.0|DOORS IN CONCERT is the only Live Doors album you need cuz its all three old school live doors albums in one.<br /><br />Thats basically alls I should need to say, Jim Morrison died about 12 years before I was born, but I have felt some of his presence in these two discs. Of course it is debatable that I am the re-incarnated Morrison, but besides the point!<br /><br />You get lots and lots of killer blues covers, the entire Celebration of The Lizard, the equally as trippy Dead Cats Dead Rats, early performances from Absolutley live and later performances from Hollywood Bowl- a nice balance.<br /><br />A lot of crazy banter from Jim adds to the overall feel of this thing, especially his interaction with the audience which I can only imagine was intrical to DOORS shows back in the day.<br /><br />Forget trying to see the new tribute band RIDERS ON THE STORM for  a live experience. JIM MORRISON was a style of his own<br /><br />Invite this live album over for a party, but watch that crazy groupie shakin it in the living room and getting nuts, it's probably your mother!
0553573403|2.0|I did finish reading all three books but I never can stop reading even if I dislike a book. I'll try to be brief...<br /><br />Pros: Decent writing. Good characters. Interesting world. Most important - real life rules of the game. If a good guy scheduled to die there are not last second saves and arrow that cut the rope. No, he dies. If a character is likeable and nice he still chan betray. Noble kings are still kings and thus not all that noble. Very refreshing.<br /><br />Cons: Martin got a real kick out of killing good guys. I mean, yeah, they die but I don't think ONE bad guy died as of yet (well, Teon...) and good guys are slautered. Violence & sex. I mean I understand that this is life and what not but some rules are to be followed. I DON'T CARE WHERE HIS SEMEN IS! There are different book styles for that. Overall, it seems that at some point author himself lost track of his world and started killing just for the heck or it. And raping. And killing again.<br /><br />Unfortunetely, what started as very vivid and original book ended up as artificailly extended, messed up story about nothing :(
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This is what I like to call a very chill album. And Mark Knopfler kind of sings like Bob Dylan in his mid years.<br /><br />Everyonce in a while I get an album that I've never really listened to before based on the fact that I can already tell its going to be a classic.<br /><br />Sometimes I'm wrong, but this was one of the cases where I knew this album would be good and it was.<br /><br />I had BEST OF prior to this so I knew SULTANS OF SWING was a good tune, and I had recently heard SIX BLADE KNIFE at a bar, and knew that was an even better tune. I've always enjoyed DIRE STRAITS sound, even on their sugary eighties songs like \\"walk of life.\\"<br /><br />The songs on here sound great. This album is very chill. A good one to put on either at the beggining of the night or the end of the night.<br /><br />DOWN BY THE WATERLINE and SULTANS are the radio hits here.<br /><br />WATER OF LOVE and SETTIN ME UP are boogie songs, but rockin. Good Bar band stuff.<br /><br />SIX BLADE KNIFE is one of the coolest songs I know.<br /><br />The remainder are more great bar style rock songs but taken down a notch from the usual stuff that I play. Again VERY CHILL, no sap or sugar, these are real songs.<br /><br />The last song LIONS is a poetic one, kind of lengthy- Don't tell me these guys weren't influenced by Bob DYlan, I like very much.
0780622553|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This thought-provoking movie begins with the following narration by one of its major characters, a scientist named Dr. Daniel Poe Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland):<br /><br />\\"First there was darkness, then came The Strangers.  They were a race as time itself.  They had mastered the ultimate technology: the ability to alter physical reality by will alone.  They called this ability \\"tuning.\\"  But they were dying.  Their civilization was in decline and so they abandoned their world seeking a cure for their own mortality.  Their endless journey brought them to a small blue world in the farthest corner of the Galaxy-our world.  Here they thought they had finally found what they had been searching for...\\"<br /><br />The actual story then begins with John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakening in a strange hotel room where he finds that he's wanted for a series of murders.  But the problem is that he can't remember a thing.  Pursued by the police led by Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and haunted by The Strangers, he tries to discover the riddle of his identity.  But in a city where reality is the ultimate illusion, discovering the truth proves to be a major challenge.<br /><br />The viewer is kept guessing for the first two-thirds of this movie and its in the final one-third that all answers as to what exactly is going on is revealed.<br /><br />A highlight of this movie is the fantastic visuals brought about by mind-boggling special effects.  I thus really believed that The Strangers could alter physical reality (as mentioned in the above narration).<br /><br />Many people did not like Kiefer Sutherland's acting where he gave the scientist character a breathy, almost Peter Lorre type voice.  I, however, liked his performance.  Also look for the fine performance by William Hurt as the police inspector.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD is practically flawless in picture and sound quality.  It has a host of interesting extras, including an audio commentary by Roger Ebert.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a thought-provoking movie that truly \\"sets a bold new standard in science-fiction.\\"  Be sure to see it, and find out why Roger Ebert named this movie in 1998 as best movie of the year!!<br /><br />(1998;  95 min;  double-sided disc; widescreen/full screen;  16 scenes)<br /><br />+++++er Ebert.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a thought-provoking movie that truly \\"sets a bold new standard in science-fiction.\\"  Be sure to see it, and find out why Roger Ebert named this movie in 1998 as best movie of the year!!<br /><br />(1998;  95 min;  double-sided disc; widescreen/full screen;  16 scenes)<br /><br />+++++
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is one very daring movie. Nobody can capture Kim Jong Il the way Trey Parker does. This is definately a tribute to the classic 70's thunderbirds which used puppets but not like this! The puppet love scene is completely over the top. Sex Violence, Drama, and terrorists that have a one work dialogue througout the whole movie (with turbins on theur heads and guns!!!). Han Blix being fed to the sharks is something I would like to see in real life. If you like violence, comedy, and a satirical look at current world politics this is the movie for you unless you are a milktoast, mammby pammby little cry baby tree hugging liberal who would rather kiss ass than kick some. Grab a beer, your girlfriend and the bro's, toss this one in the DVD player and proceed to laugh your ass off. <br />Team America, F@@K Yeah!
B000002UB3|4.0|A great album but I think people tend to overrate it. The second side may sound exceptional but really Lennon's numbers are all half baked ideas. 'Polythene Pam' and 'Mean mr mustard' are really weak.  <br />McCartney is genius, his ideas in the medley ranking highest of his work here. He contributes the complex 'you never give me your money' which thematically appears again in the exceptional track 'The end', one of my favourite Beatles songs ever. 'Golden slumbers' also shows the talents of Mccartney at balladeering. <br />The first side features Harrison's best two songs ever. That I will agree with. I also like Macca's two contributions and 'Because' is very beautiful. <br />Can't say I am too fond of 'come together', just seems a bit tuneless and repetitive to me. 'Octopus's garden' is rubbish. It only receives such high status as it is the Beatles. It is an out of tune re-write of 'yellow submarine', which was rubbish also. <br />And I HATE 'I want you' a repetitive noisy number that goes nowhere and goes on and on. <br />Really overrated album, but I still really like it, so it gets 3.5 stars. I personally prefer 'revolver'.
B0002OERI0|5.0|If you judge an album by how many copies it sells or what the band looks like or whether it sounds like what some genre says it should sound like or whether it is on a major or indie label, then I think you are missing the point about music.  It should be how it connects with you - PERIOD.  I don't think you should like a certain band because it makes you look cool or helps you fit in with some sort of crowd.  It should be because the music is well-written. <br /> <br />That being said, American Idiot is an amazing album.  Do I like bands like Blink-182, Sum Whatever, Simple whatever and most of those other pop-punk bands?  No.  But Green Day is the real deal.  Just like I listen to Tool and not all the other Tool-clones, I listen to Green Day because they write the best songs by far while those clones get nowhere close.  American Idiot is a testament to what a great band Green Day really is.  They write great songs, period.    <br /> <br />Punks that call them sell-outs miss the point.  They can keep their crappy, one-dimensional bands - I'd rather listen to bands that progress and aren't afraid to sound unpunk.  I'd rather just listen to bands that write good music, period. <br /> <br />Every song on American Idiot is amazing.  It is a very well-written album and the energy and message Green Day seems to have wanted to portray comes out clearly.  Simply put, the whole album is solid.  It seems like they couldn't have written any of those songs better.   <br /> <br />I also love the message of this album and how it can connect with a new generation on how not to be brainwashed by the Republican agenda.  It pulls this off in a very powerful way and yet doesn't seem to be forced like some political bands can seem.  It all just flows. <br /> <br />American Idiot is a classic album by a classic band and I'm not afraid to say that.  Indie kids can continue limiting their judgement to indie bands so they can hang out in the \\"cool crowd\\" with their indie clones and punkscan do the same.  I'll just continue listening to great, original artists that write amazing music whether they have indie haircuts, punk haircuts, or not or sell millions of albums or just hundreds.   <br /> <br />Great music is great music and American Idiot is full of some of the best music I have heard in awhile.  Nice going Green Day.  This Bay Arean is proud of you.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|After hearing few titles of this album on the radio, I had to have it! And this was a great move! I love this album, I don't get bored of it. My favorites for now are \\"radio/video\\" and \\"question\\". I really like the style of System of a Down.

B00003CXSP|4.0|After huge critical success with \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" in 1990 it was really surprising that MGM didn't rush to throw a sequel together to cash in on this new archvillain that had been immortalized by Anthony Hopkins, in Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Thankfully, Hollywood showed restraint and instead of trying to write a sequel based on characters created by terrific psychological/suspense writer, Thomas Harris, and risking the destruction of a franchise, the sequel would not be put to film until writer Thomas Harris finished writing the sequel, \\"Hannibal\\".  By waiting Hollywood and MGM Studios were given a terrific starting point for their screenplay, this one taken directly from the creator's head instead of merely guessing what the author had in mind for the further crimes of Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter. <br /> <br />\\"Hannibal\\" is set approximately 10 years after the events of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is still on the FBI's most wanted list, but continues to flourish in Europe under an assumed name, while working as a musuem curator.  Sadly, FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore took the part after Jodie Foster chose not to return) has not had as successful of a career in the FBI as she had hoped.  In truth, after Lecter assisted Clarice in bringing the killer \\"Buffalo Bill\\" to justice in the last movie, she really hasn't had a really successful case, leaving many to wonder is Clarice Starling really FBI material or does she need the evil Dr. Lecter to assist her in solving crimes.  Lecter, it seems, is aware of Clarice's fall from FBI grace, and seeks to exploit this weakness by baiting Clarice to come after him in Europe.  Is Clarice only a few steps away from bringing one of the most notorious murderers of all time to justice, or merely a pawn in one of his twisted mind games? <br /> <br />\\"Hannibal\\" delivered a sequel to audiences that gave both thrills and chills.  Though a different tone and type of a movie than \\"TheSilence of the Lambs\\" which was more cerebral, \\"Hannibal\\" was made to be more of a chase movie, than a psychological game.  Many critics felt that this was where director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) messed up, he should have stuck to the cerebral side of the characters, or left the movie alone completely.  In my opinion this was a great way to end the story that was started in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" between Clarice and Hannibal.  This movie didn't need to be so intensely cerebral, because the previous film covered that angle, for this movie to succeed Clarice needed to take matters into her own hands and attempt to bring Hannibal to justice.  Where critics are wrong is in the fact that, though not as intensely psychological, Hannibal does play mind games throughout the movie in very intriguing and interesting ways, giving audiences enough story and drama to propel the chase onward, and keep them on the edge of their seats. <br /> <br />One thing critics and audiences can agree on is that the acting is terrific in this film, as it has been throughout the entire series of films.  Anthony Hopkins shined once again as the psychotic Hannibal Lecter, and Julianne Moore filled the role of Clarice Starling in a very believable way, where Jodie Foster portrayed Clarice as a more naive, impressionable young cadet, Julianne delivered a colder, more world-weary agent of the FBI.  Though I missed Jodie Foster, I respect her decision to opt out of returning to a character that propelled her even farther into superstardom, but since she didn't feel the character was the same person she knew from \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" she may not have done as good of a job interpreting Clarice for this movie, so it was probably a wise decision on her part after all. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Hannibal\\" is a great ending to what was started in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", though it's not as good as its predecessor, it still is an incredibly worthy sequel, and should not be missed. <br /> <br />\\"Hannibal\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies you will ever see.Its cool,hip,fast,slow when it needs to.Its a movie with style.Writer-Director Quentin Tarantino just knows how to make great movies.    The story is simple.Its a story of revenge.Th Bride is shot down on her wedding day by her former employer Bill and her old friends O-Ren,Vernita,Budd & Elle.She falls in coma.When she wakes up from her coma she goes on murderous rampage of revenge against them.This film of course is in Quentin Tarantinos style of non linear structure storyline.    The casting is great.Even though we dont get to see Bill until Volume 2 it leaves you know a bit anxious to see him in the next one.David Carradine everyone will remember from Kung Fu.One of Tarantinos qualitys is casting people that have been having a bad run in films.In Pulp Fiction John Travolta,in Jackie Brown Pam Grier & Robert Forester and this one David Carradine.Uma Thurman as the Bride is perfect choice.I wont have never expected her do all the things she did in the film but was i surprised.And the Viper Assanation Squad greatly casted with Vivica A. Fox,Lucy Lui,Michael Madsen & Darry Hannah.    The action is mesmorizing and incredible especially the scene of \\"The House Of Blue Leaves\\".The dialogue is not what you would expect from a Tarantino film but good inoff for this.Another thing that is Tarantino trademark of putting great music in his films the music helps move the film and get to feel the groove of the it.Also the acting is top notch.There is graphic violence in this film but not as much as people say i mean ive seen worse.Trust me this not the movie that will make you stop the film because you feel sick.This not Tarantino best film but it is his coolest to me.So stop whatever your doing my friend and go buy this film,you wont regret it.    The film was originally going to be one film Kill Bill and not split into to two parts.But Quentin Tarantino was shooting some much footage that also so good.If i remember correctly it was one of the producers that mentioned the idea to split the films.It was not so much a bad idea.In my opinion both Volume 1 and 2 are perfect and diffrent in their own ways.This one more action and showing homages to Asian cinema that Quentin loves.Instead the second one is more dialogue and emotional driven.With more homages towards Spagetti Westerns.     The DVD doesnt have practily any extras.One nice little behind the scenes.But its to short.At least its informative to its small length.The DVD includes trailers from his other films and of Kill Bill.But i have to tell you there have been rumors of a new special edition of the dvd coming in the near future so wait if you dont want to waste your money on buying it two times.    Kill Bill Vol.1 is true film of filmakers love for the whole art of cinema.There is no other director that loves film like him.Quentin Tarantino tested himself to a new genre showing his talent being of the best directors of our generation.

0689865384|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and have begun recommending it to my junior high students.  The topic of the \\"perfect\\" person is definitely one of interest in society in recent times and Westerfeld does a wonderful job of describing and implementing how much people actually lose when they gain their beauty. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of ending.  I know that it was a cliff-hanger.  You need to read the next book to see what happens and there isn't very much closure on the first story.  It is as if Westerfeld is telling one story in two books.  Overall, the book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who thinks they aren't \\"pretty enough\\" for today's world.
0790731509|5.0|Paul Newman portrays Lucas Jackson, an iconic film anti-hero, in this classic film.<br /><br />Luke seems to have wandered aimlessly after winning several medals in WWII, and in the beginning of the film he's arrested for \\"maliciously destroying municipal property\\" - using a pipe cutter to cut the heads off of parking meters.<br /><br />The film has little exposition and in the next scene plunges our anti-hero in the middle of Division of Corrections, Road Prison 36, in the south.  Strother Martin plays the \\"Cap'n\\", the warden of this group, and Luke is instructed that all the other guards are to be called \\"Boss\\".  The bosses are frighteningly sadistic.

In a famous scene the prisoners are working just down the road from a beautiful blonde who stretches and teases and caresses the car she is washing with a soaped up sponge (this scene has been copied many times since in more juvenile films).  The other prisoners immediately attach themselves to the fantasy image of \\"Lucille\\".  She is just some innocent, beautiful girl who \\"didn't know what she was doin'\\" while she postured her curvy side for the men.  \\"Oh, she knew what she was doing, and she loved every minute of it\\", Luke states plainly, bursting the fantasy balloon of the other prisoners.  This leads to the famous boxing match with Dragline.<br /><br />Luke is insolent and rebellious and talks back to the Bosses in a way the other prisoners wouldn't dare. He gradually earns the respect of the other prisoners, and one of the best scenes of the film occurs at a poker game where Dragline finally comes to respect Luke and gives him his nickname.<br /><br />Luke doesn't want responsibility, even the responsibility of the admiration of the prisoners.

0316666343|5.0|Yes, I went to high school with Alice, and that's why I picked up \\"Lucky\\" when I first saw it.  But, I went after \\"The Lovely Bones\\" because I liked \\"Lucky\\" so much.  Alice again does a fantastic job at descibing the place where we grew into adults, and I can see the characters very clearly, although possibly because I went to high school with them.  And I must admit, I was particularly amused when the murderous Mr. Harvey (my last name) was introduced!!  This novel, even moreso than \\"Lucky,\\" shows the rest of the world what the true Alice is like.  The novel soars just like life itself does, especially when you've overcome everything that Alice has.  I'm looking forward to her next book!!!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|The directing and visual effects were superb! <br /> <br />As always, Leo was an ACE performer!  Was this just a romance drama or was there more to it? <br /> <br />I think this movie has a very real social economic factor that needs to be examined.  Out of 2200 passengers, over 1500 died of hypo-thermia when the Titanic sank.  The 700 saved were of high society.  The \\"average Joe's\\" were locked below deck if they weren't already on deck being held back at gun point by the ship security. <br /> <br />Not enough life boats for all because the Titanic wasn't supposed to sink?!  Was this a security over-sight?  Then, why any life boats? <br /> <br />If something like this happened today, would the outcome be any different?  Has America finally grown up in the 21st century or stayed the same with different players? <br /> <br />Two thumbs up if I may say so!!! Rock on Hollywood!
0316096199|4.0|Yes, I went to high school with Alice (I was even one of the \\"band geeks\\" and starting thumbing through the book simply because I recognized the author's name. (Thanks for not putting me in the book, Alice!) I'd lost contact with Alice after high school, but I always knew that Alice would surface again with all her flags flying.  This is a superb account of our high school days as well as our geographical area, and I read the rest of the book with great interest. Although it's not likely I would have even picked up the book had I not known the author, it's a great read, and tells a very unsettling tale from Alice's very unique point of view.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|From the first scene, I was glued to the screen, enthralled at the spectacular images with this great monumental music as a background compliment. Yes, this is a musical but it's a motion picture and a story first. Music without the backing of the intrigue and the ambiguity of the story plot is just beautiful and powerful music. But together - WOW. <br /> <br />Andrew Lloyd Webber waited many years to make this film. The stage musical had to play out first. But this version is worth it's \\"wait in gold.\\" They did change the plot however, instead of the story being that of a lecherous middle aged deformed man (The Phantom) this film version has become almost a mnage a trios with the girl, Christine (played by Emmy Rossum) torn between two lovers. The exciting phantom, (played by Gerard Butler) and the very bland Viscount played by Patrick Wilson. <br /> <br />The Phantom is a player in the hearts of women. He is tall, dark and hansom, until he takes his mask off that is. But still, if Christine hadn't found him out to be just a pathetique deformed man with human frailties, he may have won her over. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler is not a great singer but he can put a song across in a tantalizing and passionate way. The scene where he first takes Christine into his watery cave is mesmerizing.
B0000AOV85|4.0|If the mechanics of how \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" don't interest you then don't bother.  For those who are interested this is a terrific look at the method behind the magic.  It's amazing at how good that album sounds after all of these years given the, by today's standards, primitive recording technology. <br />The political commentary is a deadweight and can be skipped. <br />
B000078DOH|2.0|After a jarringly inconsistent debut album (no doubt because guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons quit the band shortly before its recording, leaving vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea to recruit guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez), the Red Hot Chili Peppers made some adjustments for their second record.  Rather than using clinical Gang of Four producer Andy Gill, they worked with the far more organic work of legend George Clinton.  And with the return of Hillel Slovak to the fold (and firing of guitarist Jack Sherman), the Chili Peppers were more focused, the problem was, Clinton's influence made them put together the wrong record. <br /> <br />Clinton's influence is glaringly obvious, with deep, slow funky grooves (\\"Jungleman\\", Sly and the Family Stone cover \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\", \\"Yertle the Turtle\\") and P-Funk styled arrangements (\\"American Ghost Dance\\", \\"Hollywood (Africa)\\") dominate the record.  The Peppers were at this point a band about energy, and this wasn't really the ground they were meant to tackle.  Combined with some unfocused songwriting (including a number of contributions from Jack Sherman), the album features a number of misfires. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the presence of Hillel Slovak is inspiring to the group-- Slovak at times can manage to be fierce as a guitarist (the otherwise irritating \\"Jungleman\\", noisy jam \\"Freaky Styley\\"), and he seems to push Flea to new heights (\\"Yertle the Turtle\\").  His presence also lends credibility to a couple of the earlier tracks that otherwise would have fallen flat (\\"Nevermind\\", \\"Sex Rap\\") and helps prevent a song as goofy as \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" from being awful. <br /> <br />On this reissue, the album has been nicely remastered to be loud and in your face and augmented with a pair of demos (originally released on \\"Out in L.A.\\"), the unedited mix of \\"Freaky Styley\\", and b-side \\"Millionaires Against Hunger\\".  An essay by Flea concerning the recording session andsurrounding time period is included. <br /> <br />All in all, the band still hadn't quite found the direction they needed, and being fairly young and impressionable, a voice as strong as Clinton's worked out to be a little too dominant, although there's enough good material on here to merit investigation, curious folks into the old Chili Peppers should start with \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\".  Those initiated will likely find enough to like here to make this worth the purchase.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|First off, I want to say that I am writing this review as a reaction to the fact that all the bands I browse these days on Amazon.com have this album in the \\"customers who bought this also bought\\" list.  Are you serious?  As if that's to suggest that if any X Y or Z band peaks my interest, I'll love this album by default.  I'm sorry, but this album isn't groundbreaking, nor is it transcendant enough to somehow mix perfectly amidst practically every other band I may (or may not) enjoy.  The editorial review says fans of Neutral Milk will like this?  I'd venture to disagree. <br /> <br />This album has about three, maybe four standout songs, but the rest is good enough for background listening, nothing more.  I won't go as far as to say trite, but it's borderline.  I think the lyrics are sophomoric and uninspired.  The vocal stylings can at times become annoying. <br /> <br />I guess all in all, it has effort, but lacks *heart*
B000078DOI|3.0|The late 198os were a time of great difficulty for the Red Hot Chili Peppers-- guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose just as the band was on the cusp of a breakthrough and drummer Jack Irons decided this was no longer the path for him.  But vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea found a way to move forward as they did when Slovak and Irons quit the band years beforehand.  At a jam session with Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro (then planned to be the drummer for the Peppers), Flea met guitarist John Frusciante-- a man who would step in admirably to the shoes of Hillel Slovak.  After a long series of auditions, the band stumbled upon drummer Chad Smith to round out the quartet.  The resulting album, \\"Mother's Milk\\", finds the band filled with a focus and a youthful energy that they had seemed to lack on previous releases, and while the album is far from perfect, it represents probably the pinnacle of the Chili Peppers' acheivement to this point. <br /> <br />The album really covers the breadth of experience of the Chili Peppers' previous work, running through the usual funk/punk stuff (\\"Good Time Boys\\") and the sounds they honed on \\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" (the superb \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\").  But the strength in the album lies in its diversity, whether successful or not-- instrumental \\"Pretty Little Ditty\\" (clean tone guitar, bass, drums, and Flea doubling on trumpet) shows off both the guitar work and (I suspect) the songwriting of John Frusciante, whose influence on the band would be clear, funk-drenched cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\" features one of the most propulsive basslines in rock history (and thusly one of the most imitated in it's own way), and Slovak-tribute \\"Knock Me Down\\" finds the band experimenting with the directions they'd pursue on the next record.  The sound's not there yet, but it's clear where this is going.  And while much of hte record feels like the band is a bit unsure how to proceed (\\"Subway to Venus\\", the seemingly endles \\"Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky\\"), all in all, it's quite a brave effort given where the band's been. <br /> <br />The reissue includes several bonus tracks-- a couple demos, some unedited mixes, and a couple live tracks in addition to cleaning up the recording's sound.  Flea contributed an essay to the liner notes. <br /> <br />The Chili Peppers would go on to bigger and better things, but by and large this was a new beginning for them.  It's not as good as the records that followed, but it's definitely worth looking into.

1401206905|1.0|Before I bought this graphic novel, I had heard this was one of the best batman comic books ever written. IGN's website chose this one as the best batman comic of all times. Tons of 5 star reviews here at amazon, with this one I can't go wrong I thought. WRONG!! <br /> <br />I'm not saying the book is crap, maybe I failed to see the greatness in it, I don't know, but I didn't like it at all and I don't get how anybody could like this kind of comic book. First of all I would advice you to take a peek inside and check the artwork. It's just a little better than \\"A death in the family\\" (which is a great comic, but the artwork sucks). Second, the plot is so linear: John Doe goes here, Jane Doe does that... if you get what I mean. No psychological monologues, such as those in \\"The Killing Joke\\", a great, great graphic novel. No alternative views on reality, nothing of the sort. There are some interesting aspects to it though, such as the portrayal of Gordon as a common man, with a family, and who risks his life daily on the job. Overall, I found the plot really boring, nothing new really. I would STRONGLY advice you to check this comic out before buying it, because in my opinion, it not suitable for all tastes.
0307276902|4.0|What disturbs me about this book is the possibility that some will interpret it as an option for addicts of all kinds to go it by themselves.  To make up their minds they can lick this \\"disease\\" by just making the decision never to use again.  Just in the outcomes of Frey's friends from rehab....the long term prognosis for maintaining sobriety is wickedly small.  And all the repeated advice from counselors implied that he would never make it without AA and the Twelve Steps.  It is important to know that AA and the Twelve Steps really are helping to keep a lot of folks clean and sober.  I think it is also important to note that there are a lot of \\"dry drunks\\" out there who have made this decision to never use again but they still suffer from \\"stinkin thinkin.\\"  Can it be so horrible a thing to humbly admit that you don't have all the answers.  That you might need, once in a while, to defer (surrender) to something greater than yourself....a collective source of wisdom, be it Tao or whatever?  Is is so impossible to enter into the kind of humility to be able to advance to those steps where we go back and attempt to make a real amends to whoever we can for the brutal things we have done in the past?  I have to wonder if Mr. Frey is going to wake up one day and realize that he has more \\"recovering\\" to do besides just getting sober enough to write a bestselling book.  Addendum....Having just reread the Tao Te Ching I am better able to understand why Frey rejects \\"God\\" in the traditional western sense.  In the Tao we read that \\"the unnamable is the eternally real\\".....and that \\"the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\\"  Much of what Frey apparently rejects about God and the Higher Power thing must be this business of \\"naming it.\\"  I can understand that.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|This album is pretty damn good.  It may not be up to Clapton's standards...but it's near impossible to overcome his stuff when he was in his prime.  This album would be good and rated highly if it was released by any other artists today, but the artist is the factor that changes the grade.  Please judge my music, not by the artist's past...Click Yes if you agree with me, No if you don't....Please Be Honest....
B000BB1MIC|5.0|After the somewhat downer 4th season, the original Gilmore charm returned with this season.  Rory found her place at Yale, Paris was MUCH less of an annoying roommate than she could have been, and everything in Stars Hollow seemed to be clicking.  This season was just 22 episodes of fun mixed with some excellently written drama.  I don't really believe there is much else to say about this season.  The romance between Lorelai and Luke has been so long in the making that it is finally a huge breath of fresh air to see it come to fruition.  After their little falling out 1/2 through the season, seeing Luke at her door and the two of them kiss made all my roommates and I jump off our couches and scream, \\"YYEEESSSS!\\"  Which may not be that weird to some people, but we are all heterosexual heavy metal loving males.  Why do I mention this?  Because the Gilmore girls works on a level that is attractive to everyone.  Whether you're a middle aged woman, a college aged girl, or a pierced up 20 something male, the Gilmore girls is a fabulously well written and very entertaining show.   <br /> <br />The thing I loved most about season 5 is the speed with which the characters quip back and forth to each other.  The dialogue has always been a trademark of what makes the Gilmore girls so special, but after what I viewed as a lackluster season 4, the dialogue really seems to get back on track with season 5.  Between Rory and Logan, the Gilmore grandparents separating and getting back together, Luke and Lorelai, and everything else that goes on, this season had all the right elements to guarantee excellent and witty sentences from everybody!   <br /> <br />The Gilmore girls rocks.  If you're not watching or buying this show you are missing out on one of the coolest and most enjoyable things to ever grace television.
B0000C8AVI|5.0|A Very Insightful Listen. Got my first cassette in the early 1980's from my Uncle. Left an impression on me. Recently aquired CD, and had a positive feeling when I listened again. Very smooth and heartfelt music and words. Dylan played \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" \\" I Believe In YOu\\" \\"When You Gonna Wake Up\\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios, New York City on Saturday Night Live in late 1979. Also toured with the album in early 1980 in Toronto, Ontario. I think there is a DVD out there somewhere. It is very clear that the lyrical content is based from a Biblical standpoint. It's all Good!!!   \\"Saved\\" is a Great Production also.

A movie that shows, that a man and a woman's differences can never change their love, only that their apart. It's a fun and delightful romance, that classic movies should definintley see. Even if it's # 4, it's a winner and an oscar winner performance by Audrey, Greg should have been nominated and won, but hes still fantastic. rent or see on TCM William Wyler's immortal romantic classic starring Gregory Peck & Audrey Hepburn as they enjoy a \\"Roman Holiday\\"

0670033375|4.0|Collapse, How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed by Jared Diamond is a real eye opener. Diamond is not a rabid conservationist or ecologist. Instead he presents a well researched book showing how some societies have succeeded and how others have failed. You can draw your own conclusions from that. I must admit that the book had a profound effect on me. I have always been an amateur conservationist in that I prefer a clean environment to a dirty one but, after reading Collapse, I now realize that it is not solely a question of beautiful vs. ugly but one of survival for all of us.

B000683VI4|5.0|This is easily the best romantic film that has come out in many years.  I'm a guy and, like most guys, I was sucked into seeing this by a girl.  I had read a couple professional reviews of this film and they were quick to dismiss it as nothing more than a cliched, run-of-the-mill romance.  My skepticism, however, faded quickly as the story progressed and I found myself engrossed by the chemistry portrayed by the characters on-screen as well as the breathtaking cinematography.  McAdams(Allie) and Gossling(Noah) do a wonderful job in this film in convincing the audience that they are truly in love, their acting is what makes this film what it is.  I won't get into storyline details as it's really not necessary, but this movie portrays a type of romance from a bygone era that has become all too rare in today's society.  The love Allie and Noah have for each other is type that so many aspire find, but few ever do.  This movie isn't perfect, it certainly has its flaws, but they are easily overshadowed by the wonderful acting and directing.  Don't be surprised if this film moves you to tears, guys included, its story is that well-told.  As for the all the critics who gave this flim negative reviews, ignore them, they're missing the point of the story, the 4.5 avg on this website from over 400 reviews speaks for itself.  Overall, highly recommended.
0141301155|5.0|After seeing both film versions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I felt it was time to read the book that started it all. <br />Roald Dahls book is an imaginative romp through a make believe world of chocolate palaces, chocolate rivers, chocolate waterfalls and a myriad of other confectionary delights.  It's also a cautionary and sometimes dark tale in which naughty children are served up their 'just desserts' in the most inventive ways!  Quentin Blakes illustrations add a whimsical flavor to an already delicious book, one that my six year old son and I devoured in two sittings!  It's a wicked, witty and yummy fantasy for chocolate lovers of any age!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album, Sufjan Stevens' 5th and the second in a seemingly impossible 50 States project, is, simply put, ingenius.  Beautiful, haunting, incredible complexities are executed in such an expert way that they seem simple and right.  From the very first this album is beautiful, quiet, detailed - the research that must have gone into this album is staggering.  The opening song is a piano-and-flute based ode to a UFO sighting, the second a tribute to the Black Hawk War, the third a 5/4-4/4 masterpiece dedicated to the World's Columbian Exposition (known as the Great White City), the fourth a soft, tragic piece about serial killer John Wayne Gacy, Jr.  Track 5, Jacksonville, has a nice little banjo-based groove that actually gets your toe tapping.  I'll skip a few but wanted to mention track 16, \\"They are night zombies...\\" the driving quarter notes in this piece give it a great creepy feel, and the violin riff is great.  Mr. Stevens plays so many instruments it's staggering. <br /> <br />In short, of 22 tracks the only criticism I have is that some of the rhymes for \\"Decatur\\" are sort of forced.  That's ONE criticism of ONE line on ONE song of TWENTY TWO.  Buy this album.  In fact, buy it from Sufjan's personal site so he makes some money and continues to make incredible records like this one. <br />

0767802470|5.0|Almost 30 years after its theatrical release, Das Boot stands up as a thoroughly engrossing classic, perhaps the standard by which all other naval war movies should be judged!  Director Wolfgang Petersen's masterwork tells the story of a U-boat crew that strives to perform their duty and stay alive under the multiple threat of enemy combatants, a capricious command structure, and the harrowing realities of life in a submarine.<br /><br />It's all there in this Director's Cut edition.  The omnipresent sense of claustrophobia, the unpleasant trivialities of a submariner's day to day existence and a realistic portrayal of men at war.  Yes, the men are Germans, looking to sink British shipping.  But they could easily be American, British, Chinese or Japanese.  The emotions, the frustrations, anxieties and triumphs are universal.  It's not about politics, it's about staying alive and waging war, simultaneously hating and respecting your adversary.<br /><br />The story follows the U-boat and it's crew on patrol, with the initial days at sea occupied by training and preparation; followed by the tension and boredom of the hunt.  Then there is the point of combat, accentuated by the moment at which the hunter becomes the hunted, culminating in a harrowing sequence when the boat and its crew are trapped at the bottom of the sea, dependent upon some simple wire for any hope of survival.<br /><br />The only cast member that might be recognizable by Americans is Jurgen Prochnow (the captain), but the work by the entire cast is fantastic.  In particular, Klaus Wennemann as the Chief Engineer almost assumes the personality of the boat; while<br /><br />Herbert Gr&ouml;nemeyer as Lt. Werner serves as the observer seeing action underwater for the very first time.<br /><br />The DVD format is particularly good for this film.  First off, you'll probably want to watch it more than once, just to catch all of the nuances.  Best of all, you can elect to watch it with either the original German soundtrack or in the dubbed English.  I might recommend that you watch it in English first, and then the German, you might appreciate it more that way.  Also the \\"making of\\" and the interviews available with the DVD are engrossing as well.<br /><br />I've read that Das Boot is historically accurate, and I have no reason to question that.  After reading the book \\"Shadow Divers\\" about the discovery of a sunken U-boat off the coast of New Jersey, I just had to watch this.<br /><br />Das Boot was a classic when it hit the theaters, it's a classic today, it will likely be a classic 50 years from now... and deservedly so!German soundtrack or in the dubbed English.

B00014NE62|4.0|The scene opens on Maurice, at a young age, with a rather eccentric, yet wise, teacher on the beach. The teacher, in an attempt to be operate in place of a Father, stresses that important \\"sacred\\" love between and man and woman. The movie pushes forward to years later- where Maurice is learning to identify with a growing passion for his room mate, which he find is reciprocated in beautifully dramatic manner. The movie then twists from hidden love to classes of men where one must face the fall of what he has become for the love he feels. The movies are long- but make no mistake- the time fly's by as you become enveloped in a tale of love between the two most unlikely people. I highly recommend this movie.

B000002I25|5.0|Ah The Doors self titled debut easily one of the most important of 67's many mind-blowing records. Sure you can argue this isn't the best Doors album(I know alot of people that prefer Strange Days or LA Woman) but there is no arguing this was their most groundbreaking record.    And the best part about this album is that its just really accessable, especially considering the lyrical content which was much deeper than anything else coming out at the time.     Of course though there is some filler(Twentieth Century Fox comes to mind) but weak spots are instantly forgotten as you here absolutely amazing songs such as \\"Break On Through\\" or   \\"The Crystal Ship\\".    Oh and of course there is the unbelievable epic \\"The End\\" which along with \\"Strange Days\\" stands as my favorite Doors song. Featuring great poetry and mind-blowing music that suits the song perfectly it creates a dark atmosphere, and is the main reason The Doors are infamously known as the darkside of the hippie movement.
B000AL730Y|1.0|Well, I watched the DVD over the weekend and I'm listening to \\"Chaos\\" for the 2nd time now.  This guy is on autopilot!  He needs to join a band - maybe the Wilbury's?  All the songs sound like demos, especially after watching the DVD.  This Nigel producer guy pretty much fiddled with a few knobs and let McCartney do what he wanted, including play all the instruments.  Where's the creative challenge in that?  This is the audio equivalent of masturbation.  In front of a picture window.  On a crowded city street. <br />  <br />Have you noticed the resemblance between the covers of \\"Bigger Bang\\" and \\"Back to the Egg\\"?

6305910340|2.0|When the movie first came out, I was about 7 or 8 years old. I thought <br />it would be about Bobby Fischer, that the little boy -was- Bobby. I <br />thought that the little boy would run away, & the movie was about <br />looking for him & not being able to find him. I didn't want to see a <br />movie with no conclusion, so I didn't see it. ____ In fact, Bobby <br />Fischer is the idol of the little boy, Josh. The movie was quaint, very <br />90s kid movie. You know the ones, like \\"Little Man Tate\\" & \\"Wildfire,\\" <br />or whatever the movie about the girl with the horse was called. Not <br />bad, not great. Not something I will ever watch again. Joe Mantegna's <br />character (yes, I know his name is probably misspelled) reminded me of <br />that sitcom actor, either Raymond or Mencia or some other generic <br />\\"guy.\\" I think it's Raymond. He was very boring in the movie. Ben <br />Kingsley was, if I remember correctly, the mean chess teacher who threw <br />Josh's pieces on the ground.

0688170528|2.0|I am amazed this book got such great reviews.  I had to push myself through it, and was bored the entire time.  For the first half of the book I was still confusing the characters (whose mom was Gus again?).  I attribute this to lack of character development.  The story was painfully predictable, but had the characters been a little bit more interesting I may not have cared so much.  A complete bore from first page to last.  Not one of the characters seemed \\"real\\", and I find it hard to believe that anyone (like in previous reviews) could have shed a tear reading this lifeless story.
0393035158|1.0|How fortunate we are in the USA to have strongholds of  scepticism and disbelief (like Stanford U.) that foster the production of bright-minded authors like Harris. <br />     How else could we get such a rational approach to the Bible <br />that explains its untrustworthiness, unhistoricity, and downright uselessness?  Not to mention its ideological dangers.  One wonders what those millions over the <br />past centuries ever saw in such trash?  Poor deluded people. <br />     Harris expertly throws doubt on several aspects of the New Testament.  It's too bad that characters like Peter, James, Thomas and so many others who spent about 3 years daily with Jesus did not have the insights of Harris; if such characters could have viewed Gospel history from the seats of academia, like Harris,--instead of having lived with Jesus-- they probably would never had held on to their mistaken beliefs until their martyrdoms. Peter and James and Paul (the latter rubbed shoulders with <br />Jesus's witnesses) and other disciples lived into the late 50's and early 60's and beyond and <br />never changed their story about The Man. What dopes-- especially as Jews for whom religion is supposed to be important. Not to mention their very families and lives. <br />     We must be grateful to Harris for also relentlessly attacking the Catholic Church.  What a farce he makes of the Eucharist (see, for example, pages 72-73).  Harris's mockery of the Eucharist does lack, however, the Jewish and Roman first-century misinterpretations that blamed these early Christians for <br />being cannibals (eating their lord's flesh);instead, Harris sees no rational, practical reason why Jesus should have said to His closest buddies, \\"This is My Body\\" and \\"This is My Blood.\\" Jesus <br />surely was foolish; was He drunk at the time?  Then He really went cosmic in John, chapter 6, when He defended the preposterous <br />statements of the Last Supper. <br />       Harris shows deft skill in summarizing Catholic history in passages like the following:  <br />       When we consider that so few generations had passed since <br />       the church left off disemboweling innocent men before the  <br />       eyes of their families, burning old women alive in public <br />      squares, and torturing scholars to the point of madness for <br />       merely speculating about the nature of the stars, it is <br />       perhaps little wonder that it failed to think anything had <br />      gone terribly amiss in Germany during the war years.(p.105) <br /> <br />     That's the Catholic Church: objectively and impartially <br />     summarized. Poor, misguided Mother Teresa; what a waste. <br /> <br />     For more of the same, be sure to acquire Harris's totally <br />     fair and balanced tome.
B0000033OZ|4.0|It never got any better than this from my point of view.  This is a much more piano-based than synthesizer-based album. They had not yet developed their trademark style - and that's a good thing! They were a bit more experimental here, delving into classical music more, showing off their chops (especially Emerson, but also Palmer on the instrumental Tank).  Side one (of the original LP) is wonderful.  \\"Take A Pebble\\" and \\"Knife-edge\\" are one of my favorite back-to-back sequences in rock. Side two fizzles a bit. There are two okay instrumentals, followed by the tedious, overplayed \\"Lucky Man.\\"  Still, add it to your collection and then go out and get Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery, and you've got almost all you need from ELP.
0062502182|5.0|This is an uplifting, easy read. It has inspirational content and a curiosity about it that escapes many books of this kind. This book is an excellent read for all ages. The Alchemist is the sort of story that answers questions within all of us. The important thing about this book is what you take away from it after you've read it. It is a book worth reading more than once, and a good pick-me-up when you are down. Anyone who has ever felt lost in life, could read this book and come away with a renewed sense of hope.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|If you're over 40, it's almost impossible to realize how good this album is. You can't hear \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" for the first time. The way that song changed music forever is something that is imprinted in our brains. (There's even a whole book about the song, by Greil Marcus.) But try to imagine not knowing anything about Bob Dylan and then flipping this into your Discman. You might be put off by the raspy, howling voice at first. You might, like the audiences in England ca. 1966, think the arrangements crude or outdated. But stick with it and you'll hear some of the best rock and roll there is. Dylan runs the gamut from anger (LARS, Ballad of a Thin Man) to humor (Tombstone Blues) to yearning (It Takes A Lot To Laugh) to satire (Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues) to Desolation Row, which is sort of a combination of all of the above wrapped in a delicate psychedelic haze. It may be a wee overstatement to say this, but if I were putting out 3 volumes of Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume One would come from the albums before this one, Volume Two would be this one, and Volume 3 would come from the albums after this. Okay, I wouldn't try to put out any Greatest Hits, but you get the picture.
6305807930|5.0|Great film, great director. Only the Italians (and specially Argento) could make horror scenarios so hallucinatory (like the scene when a girl enters a hole full of water, which in fact is a submerged - and competely surrealistic - living room).
B00000JCB2|3.0|\\"nookie\\" is just an old classic like those old grunge songs u never listen to anymore.  \\"Rearranged\\" has to be one of my favorite songs from them.  It has the most depth in terms of lyrics and message.  and \\"Break Stuff\\" is just fun to play every once in awhile to piss people off.  other than that, look elsewhere for musical genius

B0001ENY6M|5.0|Hey All! Wow is all I can say in regards to this Soundtrack. And the amazing thing is, majority of the reviews I have read agree that the most stirring pieces are the Crucifixion, and Raising The Cross.. I had my headphones on listening to this  these very songs that I just mentioned and didnt realize I was in tears...It gave me chills as I recreated those scenes in my head from the movie...Although I know some people will be negative about anything really in todays time,it sure was nice to see some who really appreciated this score. <br /> <br />Blessings to you all <br />angie in atlanta
B000063DI8|4.0|I'm a Maiden from from just about the beginning. Although 'No Prayer for the Dying' pales in comparison to classics like 'Number of the Beast' and 'Piece of Mind', this is not what I would call a ;bad' Iron Maiden album.<br /><br />This was Janick Ger's first appearance with Iron Maiden. Although a lot of fans do not like his sloppiness in live shows, he brings an energy to the band. Janick will jump around with Steve Harris while Adrian and Dave stay pretty much still and concentrate on their instruments more than the audience. This chemistry has worked very well for a metal band with three guitarists. But I'm getting off track, No Prayer did not have Adrian and it was Janick and Dave.<br /><br />I like the songs \\"Tailgunner', 'Holy Smoke', and 'Bring your Daughter'. These are agreed on by most fans. However I also like the last song 'Mother Russia'. Maiden was never a 'Sex, Drugs, and Rock n Roll Band'. They are a thinking man's metal, on a higher level of writing. I think Mother Russia fits in the Maiden song catalog well along with other songs relating to history, myth, and legends.<br /><br />Public Enema #1 may leave something to be desired, but an album where every song is good is rare, no matter who the band is. If you are into 80's Maiden, maybe this album from the early 90's can satisfy you. Steve is still galloping on bass, and I don't know about other reviewers, but Bruce's voice sounds fine to me.<br /><br />I have the original cover where Eddie is choking the guy with the lantern. I wonder why they changed it. A kinder and gentler Eddie? What gives?
076781326X|4.0|Do NOT buy this disc if you have the original release, unless you really want the soundtrack.  It's still a flipper disc. In fact, I doubt it's a new transfer or anything, if only because my DVD player in my PC immediately wanted to start playing the new disc from where I last left off when I was playing the previous release, so it must be pretty similar to the old disc.   <br /> <br />Luckily for me, my old copy is pretty beat up from all the handling its gotten over the years, so at least it isnt a total loss.
1572704462|3.0|I did not feel anything overwhelming nor inspirational while listening to these stories on the CD. Perhaps reading the book might have lead to a different experience since so many people do love the author. I did expect more, more heart-felt emotion, more drama, scintillating prose but no none of that. Stories that touch chaerters who seem to be going through great emotive periods but author just watches them from a distance describing their clothes instead of their motives. The stories seem to me to be written by a depressed English major who describes scenes but can not go below the skin of the character. Either from lack of understanding or fear, I cant tell.<br /><br />Previous to this, I had just finished reading David Sedaris. OK, he is known as a humorous writer but by Gosh, every sentence of his writing packs more punch than all stories in this book. He is not afraid to tell you ALL. I dont want to say that these stories are flat because I feel intimidated by all the accolades here but thats what they are. Uninspiring - to me.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This album is spins in my player almost non-stop. This CD harkens back to the dat of Metallica, Testament , and Exodus. No Hard-core/Metal-core/Emo-core/Whatever-core influences here.

B000AMPZF8|5.0|While British rock band Muse are big in the UK, the US is only just starting to get acquainted with these original, entrancing musicians. And their second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" they accomplish the almost impossible -- every song is epic and thrilling.<br /><br />The first two songs open with delicate rippling piano intros that suddenly blossom into rock riffs. Feedback kicks off into sizzling basslines and riffs in \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased,\\" while wind chimes and an acoustic melody are at the heart of \\"Screenager.\\" \\"Hyper Music\\" is the only dud. It's a discordant clatter that becomes a discordant rock song -- nuff zed.<br /><br />But as good as most of the album is, Muse save the best for absolute last. The penultimate song \\"Feeling Good\\" is perhaps the best -- fuzzy chopsticks start the song, followed by a stretch of epic rock and soaring vocals. The finale is no less entrancing, a slowly stately wave of sound that slowly transitions into an equally rich rock song.<br /><br />Americans really got to know Muse through their latest album, \\"Absolution.\\" But it's not the only album they have done, nor is it the best. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" may well take that honor, or at least tie with their debut \\"Showbiz.\\" Relatively few people know about these earlier albums, or about the rich apocalyptic quality of Muse at their best.<br /><br />Muse is definitely a band for Radiohead fans -- it has the same rich spaciness and art-rock quality, but it's more grounded and gritty. The most entrancing instrumentation is done on piano -- it can be delicate, dark, fuzzy, or outright epic. The piano is accompanied by smashing percussion, sinuous riffs and basslines, and sweeps of spellbinding electronics.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy puts his good vocals to use in every song, and he's as versatile as his piano. Much of the time he opts for the smooth, low sound. But he also gets to howl, and occasionally sounds like he's been huffing helium. And the songwriting is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Though it was a financial flop, Muse deftly dodged the ARTISTIC sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten. An outstanding piece of work.ffing helium.

B000AADYYO|4.0|This is an excellent CD if you are looking for Dream-Theater like prog metal with a hint of black metal. The first Opeth I had heard was a couple of tracks from Blackwater, and I really liked it so I decided to buy this. I was looking for something a little more like Bodom or Trivium. This is just too Dream Theater for me.
B00005JODA|2.0|I can't honestly tell you if the story is any good, because the cinematography was so awful.  80% or more of the scenes are shot by somebody stumbling around carrying the camera by hand; the picture was bouncy and wobbly and the result was intense motion sickness. The director also chose to \\"increase the suspense\\" by doing rapid cuts, many to off-angle shots, again with the camera held by the person who wobbles even when standing still.  Since I had to spend 2/3 of the movie staring at the floor so I didn't throw up, so it's hard to say if the story was any good.  I wish there was some way to have known this before I blew $9 on the movie, so that I could have seen something that I would have been able to watch.
6305428271|1.0|I enjoy this genre of film, but found this one dull. It carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief, but fall short of both aims.  I actually groaned in response to the predictability, and shuttered at the stereotypes, which were mentioned in another review.  At best, stereotypes of ignorant, aggressively dangerous, and perpetually struggling African and Hispanic American students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable, blue eyed, blonde-haired European American belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive.  At worst, these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring.  This movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both. Further, it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial, societal, and economic issues, which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for.

0060989157|5.0|This is worth the cover price just for Nikki Sixx's story alone, at least up until the band's decline in the early 90's.  I was in 4th grade when Theater of Pain came out and that and Shout at the Devil were my soundtracks of life.    Even if you don't respect their music (which bothers me because Mick's riffs and Nikki's writing -though yea, misogynst and shallow sometimes, and \\"hooky\\", were good, solid, punk/bluesy anthem rock and roll) this book is a full-on page turner.  My little brother is not a Crue fan and he finished it in 2 days.  Basically the Crue came at exactly the worst time for self annihilation, after bands like Led Zeppelin stopped just short of satanic and disease spraying debauchery (the shark thing notwithstanding) and right before Nirvana made all this [...] seem silly (although I GUARANTEE you that even Rage Against the Machine participated in their share of groupie fondling).    And Guns and Roses only really degenerated for a short period of time before trying to grow up.  So basically, the Crue lived and breathed the worst of sex, drugs, rock n roll that any band possibly could in America.  Plus their home base was Hollywood!  What the [...]!  It is absolutely amazing that they are all still alive.    P.S. Everyone in that band owes Mick Mars a serious apology for [...] with him so much - and they're the ones that admitted being such [...].  Without Mick this band would not have been more popular than Keel or maybe Dokken.   But this is one hell of a good read.

B00005JNSK|2.0|...but I still cling to the mists of carboard props, a little bit of paint, a yoghurt cup and a pipe cleaner, masterfully pared with the antiquated charm of good solid casting!   <br /> <br />It appears the lure of boundary-less CGI has occupied so much space in Burton's over active imagination that he has little room left for such trivialities as screenplay or vaguely plausible acting.  <br /> <br />The first to come under fire has to be Bonham Carter. \\"Why is she in this movie?\\" I hear thousands gasp as her plum tones fill the theatre and she gallops through the scrip playing exactly the same posh, RADA mannequin we have come to know and fear. Is she really that good in bed that Burton can afford to sabotage his gothic dynasty by casting someone who is blown off the screen by the performance of a cabbage?      <br /> <br />Arbitrary she may be, but her destructive impact becomes as inconsequential as an ant kickboxing a watermelon when we are introduced to 'Wonka' in the hands of boy wonder Johnny Depp. Critics have frantically worn their pencils into the ground deliberating over his possible inspiration for the role. Is it Michael Jackson? Is it Peter Pan? Or is it, as he claims \\"part glam rock and part 'demented Howard Hughes'?\\" <br />Well, allow me to put the subject to bed, so we can all go back to our normal lives, it is none of the above.   <br />It is, and the reasons for which are unfathomnable, a truly  repugnant marriage of Frances McDormand in Fargo (I suspect they may have even superimposed her actual mouth)and Andy Warhol. The overiding effect of this character cross breed is a Wonka, so unlikeable, and ultimately punchable that you have no patience remaining to endure the rest of the car crash as it unfolds.  <br /> <br />And finally, with a production team as large as a small country, is it too much to ask for someone to have noticed that Veruca Salt manifests the most mild and monotone depiction of a spoilt princess in cinema history? When you castyour mind back to the original Veruca and her glorious \\"I want it Nowwwwww\\" it damn near makes your heart splinter.          <br />           <br />
B0002DKCMG|3.0|This unrated version is much better than the rated one.  I think all the fun nudity added to the enjoyment of the movie.  Without it, I think I would've been bored to death.  It's naked breasts from start to finish! Diedrich Bader cameos as the Ero-theif which delays their trip. Lucy Lawless is a hot-masochist with the means to cause extreme Eurostyle Pain!  Matt Damon also does a cameo while singing \\"Scottie Doesn't Know,\\" which, amazingly stays with you throughout the day.  Eventually, you're lead to humming this song because it's played throughout the movie even \\"techno\\" style in Bratislava, Czech Republic.<br /><br />It's a typical teenager love/dump/crush/sex story with a lot of added spunk,nudity, and hormones.  The best parts are the human-robot, the perverted-Italian-man in the train, Vatican City, and the nude beach scenes are those to laugh out loud to and contemplate. The funniest part are the bloopers that play when the credits roll, so watch out for those.<br /><br />It's truly a \\"guys\\" movie not as kinky and raunchy as \\"American Pie\\" or \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" but it does fit along this genre.  A great movie to watch with a little popcorn and your prescription glasses.
0385510454|5.0|The main character in this book is a powerful lawyer named Joel Backman. He has been locked away for many crimes he didn't do, he said he was guilty to all of these crimes to be able to put in High Security Prison because he had over 3 countries assassins trying to kill him. This is his story.  <br /> 6 Years ago, Joel Backman was the most powerful Lawyer in Washington D.C. One of his clients was a group of 3 Pakistanis where amazing programmers and one day they found a group of 12 Satellites they named Neptune. They found that no one was controlling these satellites and decided they'll make a program to control this group of satellites. After they did they found out that this group of satellites belonged to Red China. China stole the information from the 2 defense contractors from the US. They were able to launch this group of satellites only because they set up a big forest fire and launched 3 missiles carrying 4 satellites each in the middle of the fire. But then Red China wasn't able to control Neptune after it was launched. These 3 Pakistanis tried to sell their program to the Saudis for 100 Million dollars but then suddenly took the program to the Israelis. After the Saudis heard this they changed their offer to 1 billion dollars. After the Saudis thought they got scammed and then sent assassins to kill Joel Backman and the 3 Pakistanis. Backman started running with the 3 Pakistanis by this time the Israelis thought they got scammed too so they sent their assassins to kill Backman and the Pakistanis. Red China heard that Backman and 3 Pakistanis were the ones that made the program and stole their satellites so they sent their top most assassin to kill Joel Backman, Sammy Tin. <br /> 6 years later, a president was about to resign because he had done such a bad job and he was broke. The CIA offers him 1 million dollars to pardon Joel Backman because they want to see who kills him and they'll know more about what happened. President Morgan accepted that offer andpardons Backman. Backman is hurried out of the country into Bologna, Italy. There he is given the name Marco and a fake passport. The CIA's plan was to hide Backman for a year then carefully give information to the countries that they suspect have to deal with this situation. They want to monitor him closely and know who will come to kill him.  <br /> Backman is given tutors and a guide to teach him how to speak Italian. He is especially fond of his guide, Francesca. After about 5 months in hiding the CIA gets impatient and goes ahead of schedule and starts to give out the info on the whereabouts of Joel Backman. About 3 days after that all of the assassins were in Bologna. Backman sees some of them one night and then he ran for it. He went to Francesca's apartment, he explains his situation and she helps him out by giving him some of her dieing husbands things. She helped him bleach his hair and change his look. He looked like a completely different person.  <br /> Backman was a free man, he ran to the train station and there he waits in the bathroom until the train was about to leave he hurriedly runs out and catches the train. But he was surprised when some CIA agents followed him on the train, he could tell because they were wearing very American Suits. After he sees them getting on he hurried runs off and hides. He bought a first class ticket to the closest city and got on. That night he got a motel and asked his cab driver if he would take him to the Switzerland the next morning. He driver said it would cost 200 Euros and he accepted. <br /> Next morning he was in front of the biggest bank in the city. He walks in and asks for the manager. He manager is surprised to see he and happy to help him out a little. He asks for one hundred thousand dollars to be wired from his account to a Maryland trust account. He then asks for a plane ticket to the US. He is using Francesca's husband's passport and the manager looked a little skeptic but agreed. Before he left helook the CD's in his vault that contained the program that can control Neptune out.  <br /> 12 hours later he was in Washington DC. He called a few connections and got a appointment with the CIA Head. He discussed what he wanted in return for the CD's and information. They agreed and then The Brokers Back! <br /> <br /> <br />thats basicly what the books about its a great book i really liked it i havent read anyother John Grisham books but i really enjoyed this one  <br />
B00003CXA4|5.0|Even after roughly six decades of his death, Gandhi continues to influence and minds and hearts of people from all around the world. This movie is a fantastic description of the life of an ordinary man who rose to become one of the world's most influential people. He was neither a scientist, nor an artist, nor a man who can boast of any other extraordinary skill. Yet Gandhi achieved something which no person could manage to. He defied the empire on which 'the sun never set.' How did he manage to do this? The answer lies in the movie. Just watch it.
B000AP04EW|5.0|From the opening scene with Pitt and Jolie and the unseen therapist, it was clear that this movie was going to be a cut above the unsual far. It did not dissapoint. Sharp, witty, smart writting, excellent performances. The movie is like an extended metaphor for the trails and tribulations of modern marriage. Fortunately it does not lay message on too thickly. This movie is not original, the original one was made in 1941. <br /> <br />P.S. What ever happen to the \\"steamy sex scene' with Brad Pitt and Jolie. Was it censored? The movie will do way better with that scene!
B0000027RL|5.0|Maybe or maybe not but they deserve to be on that list. A couple of months ago I saw a magazine article naming them the best American rock band and frankly I kind of agree because they wrote great songs, were a great instrumental group and never sold out like Nirvana, the only video ever played on MTV was Jeremy and video was mostly about the song and showed that a music video can be artistic and touching instead of a narcestistic exploit on yourself. I own albums by Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots and realize this the best grundge album ever simply because after 13 years of this album the novelty has not been lost and has retained a sound that was ahead of its time. Four songs here are American classics like Evenflow, Black, Jeremy and Alive but the rest of the album is not filler like other albums.My last word is you need this album in your collection because great music will last a lifetime not like novelty music today that is here today gone tomorrow. And to the one star review kid \\"You are an ignorent music lover because if I listen to your music Id rather go deaf but then I would be missing out on great artist to come\\"

B00008OWZC|4.0|When I first got this three CD set when it came out I was disappointed. I felt the over all mix was poor and was disappointed that Jimmy Page left off a few songs. I've owned the bootlegs to these 2 shows featured here on HTWWW. This definitly could've fit onto 2 CDs and there is certainly enough room for the 5 songs Page left off. He left off Tangerine from the acoustic set, Louie Louie/oragan solo/Thank You & Communication Breakdown from the final encore of the show. But over time as I listened to this 3 CD set more & more I began to really like it alot. I actually like how it was mixed, although JPJ's bass seems to get buried in the mix here & there. I will not compare this to The Song Remains The Same soundtrack because I love that album, always had. Its a different entity from HTWWW. Here we hear Zepelin at the end of their peak. Plants voice is in fine shape, aside from it cracking here & there but heavy touring will do that. John Bonham just beats up his drum kit. JPJ is JPJ, always at his best. And finally, Jimmy Page playing some of his best guitar. If your a beginner Zepp freak or a long time fan I suggest adding this 3 CD to your Zeppelin collection. Its a very powerful, raw, rock-n-roll live set and its right up there w/ TSRTS in my book. I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because it should've at least been 2 CDs and no booklet inside, but its all about the music!
B00003CWTI|5.0|\\"These strange things happen all the time.\\" <br /> <br />Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant film \\"Magnolia\\" interlaces several stories of people who aren't having much luck at solving their problems. As we watch the large and lovely magnolia blossom at the beginning announcing the film's title, we're immediately introduced to the character's problems: misogyny, incest, infidelity, abuse, disease, and loneliness. It's quite a contrast. <br /> <br />The acting from all performers is exceptional. Tom Cruise plays \\"inspirational\\" speaker Frank T.J. Mackey, a role that earned him a much-deserved Academy Award nomination. Frank's suffering has manifested itself into angry and humiliating speeches encouraging the conquest of women in a successful seminar called \\"Seduce and Destroy\\". His life intersects with his estranged father, played by Jason Robards, who is close to losing his battle with cancer as wife Julianne Moore watches and panics. John C. Reilly delivers a subtle performance as police officer Jim Kurring, a lonely heart who meets a troubled Claudia Gator (played by Melora Walters) and wants to help her escape her past. The fine ensemble cast also includes PT Anderson perennial favorites Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H Macy, Philip Baker Hall, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, Luis Guzman, and Alfred Molina. <br /> <br />The music in this film adds to the message. One scene shows each of the main characters singing along to \\"Wise Up\\" by Aimee Mann. The chorus \\"it's not going to stop until you wise up\\" is profound and we wonder: Will they wise up? Will it stop? Aimee Mann's sings again in \\"Save Me\\" (nominated for an Academy Award) to emphasize Jim's desire to help Claudia in the closing scene. We can't really hear what Jim is saying to Claudia over the music nor can we see his face, but as Claudia looks back at the camera with a little smile, it is like the magnolia blooming. Poignant and beautiful.   <br /> <br />Strange things do happen in \\"Magnolia\\", and it is not for everyone, especially for those who are looking for standard and manipulative Hollywood formulas. Instead, this film rivals Robert Altman's classic works for its complex storytelling and character development. \\"Magnolia\\" is a provocative, thought-provoking, and satisfying film that reflects on human emotion. It is simply excellent. <br /> <br />

I know movies are a facsimile of reality and reality is often compressed to fit the two hours of the story and simplified so that it does not add unneccesary complexity to the film. Hence, I would not quibble if the interpol in the movie also acts like a swat team and the FBI.   <br /> <br />This movie delivers in all three ways:  entertainment, spiritual value and education. Arms dealing is a repulsive business, but the world's largest trade. This is a much more clever way of increasing the peoples awareness of this tragic business than thousands of oped pieces and blogs.

B0006399FS|5.0|This album is fantastic. It is highly consistent from the start to the end. Absolutely no fillers like most albums out there today. My favourite song is Sometimes u Can't Make it on Your Own which I think is a brilliant piece which makes me almost cry no matter how many times I listened to it. Another favourite is All because of you which has an amazing guitar. The edge really shows his stuff in this song. Original of the Species is also another favourite. It is melodic and has a seemingly simple but effective lyrics. I am becoming a fan of U2 now after hearing this album and their previous album All that u can't leave behind!
B000002JPA|5.0|Though DT's debut was When Dream And Day Unite, they really started developing their overt-the-top virtuoso style on Images And Words. Musically, Images And Words is one of the most challenging albums ever. If your the one who doesn't have the attention span of more than 4 minutes then this is not for you but for listeners who want more from their music and want to unleash the \\"beast\\" of technicality within - this is the perfect album for it. Yes, packed completely with the operatic James LaBrie (who delivers his best performance here), expertise basslines by Myung, Intriuging solos and twisted riffs from the technical guitar wizard that is Petrucci and the all-too-enjoyable technical drumming from one of the greatest in the bussiness - Portnoy. The lyrics are well done as well particularly on \\"Another Day\\" which is John's tribute to his father. Though \\"Another Day\\" would woo the radio with its really well done sax solos - its an excellent track and the same \\"Pull Me Under\\" that people liked was cut 4 mins short by the record label, so there is a much longer version on the album that the mainstream wouldn't like. So dont be expecting - \\"Man I loved pull Me Under, So I'm bound to love the rest\\". Pull Me Under is in general more heavy and less progressive than the rest of the album. The rest is just as good as the first two tracks. They reduce the tempo and go into more progressive realms - yes, the entire disc is brilliant but some songs to keep yur ear up for are -  <br /> <br />Metropolis - An awesome song with very well done keyboards. This is the prequel to the excellent \\"Scenes of A Memory\\" so remember to hear it before you go on to that disc. <br /> <br />Take The TIme - Immedietly following Another Day, this is slow, melodic and emotional. <br /> <br />Learning To Live - The last song and the 2nd best on the disc, this is 11 mins long and has the most innovative use of keyboards in the entire album. The guitars are particularly well done by the wiz Petrucci. <br /> <br />I suggest you get this unless all you listen to is Mainstream Pop and Hip Hop for those people - stay the heck away from DT!! Your not fit to hear music of this type!
B000002H33|1.0|iF you want to go ahead and listen to these braindead stoners, who are telling you this is the greatest album. fine.. be my guest. But in fact it is the most dissapointing album i have ever purchased. All the songs are terribly written and arranged with every song sounding like d-grade production.. <br />Believe me you dont want this album, if you want decent thrash metal pick up Rust In Peace by Megadeth. Trust me this album definitely sucks,take my word instead of the rest of these meathead metal fans.

B00003BDXG|3.0|This movie is passably entertaining, but it really, really starts to drag, and it kinda pisses me off cuz you know that Stone thinks he's so goddamn clever for making this.  What, you say that the media is obsessed with violence? Is it really, Uncle Oliver?  Gee thanks, I, hadn't noticed.  Stone has come up  with a dangerous combination, entertainment wise:  The point of the film is tied up in the style, yet the style is utter affectation, with little artistry in it.  All of this form shifting, going from black and white to color to using weird lighting to changing the quality of the film to using animation, is kinda interesting at first, but that is totally all there is to it, and it grows tiresome.  In short, a film so obsessed with style is somewhat interesting, but the style itself proves to be not especially intriguing, so it gets old, especially since this is the least subtle film ever made.  And, throughout the ridiculously drawn out 2 hours, he doesn't come up with a single relevant point as to why the media's obsession with violence is a bad thing.  He seems to find this self-evident, which is fine for him, but it ain't gonna do sh*t for anyone else.  What can I say, I find the endless coverage of the Scott Peterson trial and all that Aruba crap INCREDIBLY tedious, but I don't really see any evidence that it's truly harmful.  And the fact of the matter is, 99% of the time, the media doesn't glorify killers and whatnot, at least not until decades later when it's more mythmaking than anything else.<br /><br />Anyone interested in media/violence satire ought to check out 'Man Bites Dog', a far more clever, far more entertaining film.  Hell, it works as a media satire about 10 times better than this movie, and it isn't even intentional.  I'm sounding to down on this movie, cuz it is alright.  And the first 30 minutes are pretty damn excellent, actually, particularly the twisted sitcom they use for Mallory's homelife.  But, Stone just runs out of ideas and drives his repetitive, often irritating style into the ground.<br /><br />Grade: C-epetitive, often irritating style into the ground.    Grade: C-
B00000428L|5.0|Furtwangler headed bot the Vienna and Berlin Phil. for life, and after him Karajan headed both orchestras as well, but his recorded legacy mainly rests in Berlin. It was with them that he made an acclaimed series of Strauss recordings for DG.<br /><br />But this one with Vienna is very special. All three tone poems are performed with utmost refinement and power, the unique combination displayed by  this legendary orchestra. Despite some tape hiss, the recording is excellent--warm and detailed.<br /><br />But really it's the incredible peformances one returns to. As the greatest Strauss conductor of a generation, Karajan sometimes excelled even himself, and this is one such occasion. I doubt we will hear its like in a long time.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|If there can be any discernable pattern of development in the early career of Bob Dylan, it is his moving from the idyllic world of simple folk music, to the dirty world of electrified blues.  \\"No Direction Home\\" demonstrates the direction that Dylan took using newly found archival footage, past and present interviews and incredible performances.  Dylan is often thought of as an American original, but the musical grounds that he has walked on for now over 40 years is well tread.  The originality of Dylan, however, lies in the fact that he took so many different paths as an artist and a musician.  As he said in this film: \\"You have to realize that as an artist, you need to be constantly moving.\\"  \\"No Direction Home\\" focuses on the first two iterations of Dylan.  The first Dylan in this movie is the folk artist embraced by the Greenwich Village liberals, while the next Dylan is the blues musician embraced by almost no one at first.<br /><br />The first Dylan songs speak to the future,  (A hard rain gonna fall...) while the next Dylan has his feet firmly planted in the present.  (How does it feel...)  Dylan's recent albums \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\" reach further back into American musical history.  Unfortunately, the artist (and Dylan is no exception to this) has an unfortunate tendency to wound the people that they leave behind as they move in a different direction.  For example, the bitterness of Joan Baez and Pete Seeger is still palpable in \\"No Direction Home.\\"  Overall, Scorsese's direction is great to watch, but, the last word appropriately should belong to Dylan, \\"I wish that I'd been a doctor, maybe I'd saved some lives that been lost, maybe I could have done some good in this world...'stead of burning every bridge I'd crossed.\\"  (From the album `Infidels')  What makes \\"No Direction Home\\" such a great documentary to watch is that we get to see Dylan burn that bridge with the reckless abandon that we would never expect from a popular musician today./>

B00005QCYC|5.0|This box set, is whats the word? Fascinating, it measures up for the excellent movies. <br /> <br />JURASSIC PARK - <br /> <br />Jurassic Park gets a easy 10/10 from me. I have been a huge fan, even have a site for the movies, fan of the series ever since I first saw Jurassic Park back in 1996 at five, almost six years old. The movie was just so magical, everything about it was so breathtaking and fascinating, it was oh so perfect. The dinosaurs in this movie have to be the most realisticly portrayed out of any dinosaur films from the past, that was absolutly no question. The charectors were great and added to the specialness of the film, all the actors chosen to star were perfect in there roles except for a minor few such as Martin Ferrero as Donal Gennaro, hes a good actor and all, but he didn't fit the role at all, but he wasn't horrible or bad either, he would have fit as a better Ed Regis if that charector was in the film which it wasn't. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards were the cast members who rounded out most of the cast, each giving there charector a sense of originality and freshness. The actors are so realistic that you never think once that they've memorized the lines from the script, but that there saying everything naturally. From the excellent start to the film to one of the most memorable movie endings in the history of cinema, this film delivers in every way. Steven Spielberg really delivered what he was determined to do, a realistic film where the dinosaurs were portrayed as real as possible and as animals, NOT theme-park monsters. The basic premise of the film: A wealthy Billionare, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a group of scientists/Paleontologists to the island, Isla Nublar (aka Jurassic Park) to endorse the park, in other words, tell the envestors and lawyers that the park is in fact, safe and ready to be opened to the public. But when a greedy worker for Hammond shuts the power off in the park letting loose the dinosaurs, everything goes downward and mayhem occurs everywhere. From over turned explorers to a kid getting shocked on an electrical fence to a Tyrannosaurs chasing a jeep and even Velociraptors stalking kids in a kitchen, you see everything you could possibly hope for. This movie gets an easy ten out of ten. You should be ashamed if you do not have this in your collection. Ashamed. <br /> <br />THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK - <br /> <br />10/10. I don't know, to this day, why some people say that the third flm is better than this one? I simply do not know why? Half the people who claim that the third is better is just because they prefer more action over a well thought out plot (unlike part ///'s disgraceful premise that a four year old could think up in a day) and realistically portrayed dinosaurs (unlike JP///'s incredibly INNACURATE Spinosaur, many do not know and think that the way the Spinosaurus in part 3 is how they were in real life, not true, the Spinosaurs were actually FISH eaters and would never go up against the Tyrannosaurus like it did, but this review is about TLW, not JP///). So basically, in this also Steven Spielberg directed film, a group of InGen workers including John Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) set out to Isla Sorna, Site B, an island that used to be the breeding ground for Jurassic Park's dinosaurs before a massive hurricane destroyed the island forcing many to flee and leaving the dinosaurs to inhabit the island. The group set out to capture as much dinosaurs as possible and bring them back to the mainland to create a new park, 'Jurassic Park: San Diego'. When John Hammond who was forced out of his possition of InGen CEO (President), his nephew taking his place, hears about this, he sets up a team including Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) and Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) who plays Dr. Ian Malcolms (Jeff Goldblum, from the first film) girlfriendto go and document the dinosaurs at the island to set up a fossil record and prove that the dinosaurs are not dangerous. But when Malcolm hears that his girlfriend has gone to the island, he immedietly sets out to the island to \\"rescue\\" her even though she chose to go. When the team members, including Malcolm, arrive, they all discover that Hammond sent them to the island to puroposely stop Ludlow and his team from taking the dinosaurs off the island. The movie turns into a team against team/team against dinosaurs and Sabatoge type film. To make matters worse, Malcolms daughter, Kelly Malcolm (Vannessa Lee Chester) has stowed away on a trailer to the island with them, so he is now forced to watch after her and protect himself and his girlfriend Sarah from the prehistoric animals. The ending is very climatic and makes the whole point of the Jurassic Park movies. Just when you thought that the dinosaurs couldnt' get any better than the first film, you were wrong, the dinosaurs in this film look even MORE realistic and fascinating than the first film. Particularly the Velociraptors and Tyrannosaurs stand out the most. The movie deserved what it gets, which is a ten out of ten. And if you think that part three is better, then you are crazy but hey, we all have our opinions and think different from each other so... <br /> <br />JURASSIC PARK /// - <br /> <br />My rating? 4.5/10 (4 and a half out of ten), this movie was so hyped up and was claiming to be as good as the first two, wrong. First off, the plot, the plot is a plot that you would probably see on a 'Jurassic Park: The TV Series' type show, a divorced couples teenage son gets in a parasailing accident near Isla Sorna and is forced to land there, eight weeks later (do you honestly think a thirteen year old would survive for eight weeks?), the couple (why on earth would the couple wait eight weeks to finally get help??) trick Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill from the first film, hes what makes the movie get a 4.5/10) into going to the island claiming that they are a happily married couple and are celebrating there anniversary by taking an aerial tour of the island by plane, but when the plane lands and invertedly crashes soon after by the islands new \\"monster\\", Grant finds out why the couple trully brought him here, to help find there son. Another person who came along with Grant is graduate student, Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola, his charector is the only new charector actually worthy of being in a JP film) who wanted to see the dinosaurs alive and well. After this, the movie basically turns into nothing but a corny running and screaming film where all the charectors destined to die, die half way through the film leaving the half with NO deaths. The dinosaurs, I don't know what to think, the Velociraptors have now lost there eeriness and make you want to laugh rather then shutter, they are portrayed TOO intelligently in the film that its almost laughable in some parts. The Spinosaurus is just...gosh, a big mistake, the film portrays it as a total movie monster which ruins the whole point of the first two films, which was to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than vicious monsters out to just kill and nothing else. You hardly get to see any herbivores in this film and only see carnivores (mostly the Raptors and Spinosaurus) out to get some fresh meat. The Spinosaurus is portrayed so wrong that its almost disgusting, first off, the Spinosaurs would NEVER have attacked the Tyrannosaurus Rex in real life like it did in the film, second off, the way it broke the Rex's neck, was totally wrong and unbelievable, now, if it would have broken the Rex's neck AND tooken off its own jaw in the process, then it would have been a little more believable, why do I say this? Well simple, the Spinosaurs jaws were made for eating and catching FISH, not breaking a Rex's neck which is almost impossible to do i'm sure.The Spinosaurus wouldn't even chase the humans around like it did unless theywere in its territory, instead it chases and stalks them around the whole island! The acting was sub par, Sam Neill and Alessandro did excellent jobs, and I appreciated the great cameo by Jurassic Park star, Laura Dern, who returns for a two part cameo that rounds out to 5 or 6 minutes of the film. Those were actually my favorite scenes, the two cameos with her present because it manages to capture the JP feeling, too bad the rest of the film couldn't do the same. Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, they did a bad job in my opinion, hey, there great actors, oscar worthy of course, but not in this movie, they weren't given anything good to work with and acted a bit over the top. One of the worst aspects, was that Joe Johnston who relys more on Special effects than on plot and story depth, took over the reighns of the directors chair leaving Steven Spielberg only as Executive Producer. The whole style of the film was just so...wrong. But hey, there were some good aspects of the film that I won't list because this film is really about opinion once it comes down to it. 4.5/10. Let's hope that JP IV does better and i'm hoping that I get the privalege of giving it at least a 8/10. <br /> <br />Now, the bonus disc is what saved the box set to get a 3.5/10 rating (due the third film getting a poor rating), the sad part is is that the bonus disc, BEYOND JURASSIC PARK (which gets a 8.5/10) is more entertaining and has more JP depth then the third movie, and the bonus disc just has special features for all three JP films that most, have never before been seen before. The extras are a REALLY GREAT treat for the JP fan and you're really missing out if you don't have this disc, the packaging for the trilogy is really beautiful and convenient. So if you don't have this set in your collection, either go out and buy it NOW or you'll be hitting yourself later on. <br /> <br />OVERALL - The set gets a 10/10. <br /> <br />JURASSIC PARK - 10/10 <br /> <br />THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK - 10/10 <br /> <br />JURASSIC PARK /// - 4.5/10 <br /> <br />BEYOND JURASSIC PARK - 8.5/10 <br /> <br />WHOLE SET - 10/10
6305971935|3.0|First of all, I enjoyed the movie.  It was entertaining and a good Sci-Fi story.  What made it bad was Nancy Allen.  When I see her on the screen I get an old \\"B\\" movie feeling about her acting.  Michael Par&eacute; is okay as an actor but can be dull, he always has that bad boy edge to him, which I enjoy watching.  He makes the movie bearable.<br /><br />I loved Final Countdown and thought this was a remake or possibly an old script someone found and decided to try it again.  What made this one different and more interesting was the military (bad guys) twist with the developement of yet another weapon and the results of that endeavor.  A comment on the early nuclear bomb tests that went on and left many military men dead or poisened.  Much of it hidden yet in secret documents.  In Final Countdown, the results of unethical teasting were very interesting.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun time with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday Night.  This could work.  Cheers....

I felt a part of the Nolan family throughout, longed to help them (thought they wouldn't have accepted it), and enjoyed their company. The many characters are quite well depicted as is life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. It's a glorious tale of family ties, neighborhoods, loyalty and strength. While long, it is a fairly fast read.

0385335482|4.0|I picked Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella after reading The Undomestic Goddess which I enjoyed a lot.  Halfway through the book I felt sick - Rebecca Bloomswood - the Shopaholic, is an air-headed obsessive- compulsive that can't do anything right, except - shop. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down - I actually enjoyed it because it is funny and in some way, educational - but I think Kinsella could have done a better job in the last pages - because I found the ending to be abrupt and lacking of details - leaves you wanting to get the next book in the series - Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, to see what Rebecca's next adventure is like. <br /> <br />This is an entertaining read and definately not food for the brain.

0679731725|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have ever read.  It is nearly perfect in plot, description, and characterization.  Kazuo Ishiguro is a quiet writer with a fantastic ability to infuse layer up layer of complexity into the simplest of stories. <br /> <br />In 1956, a very British butler is traveling to western England to visit the former housekeeper of Darlington Hall.  He is adjusting to his new American employer and the realities of a changed society after World War II.  The essence of this character is dignity and his drive to uphold his reserve in all things. <br /> <br />The butler's travels through the countryside leads him to reflect back on his previous employer, Lord Darlington, and the lords and ladies of English society who traveled to Darlington Hall.  I found myself days afterwards thinking back to various scenes and finding greater meaning.  The last few paragraphs of the book, when the butler visits with the housekeeper-perfect.  He is finally honest with himself and the effect is devastating. <br /> <br />Unlike many literary novels, the Remains of the Day is not a difficult read.  Upon finishing, I immediately began reading it again.  Beautiful, gorgeous story; I highly recommend it.
B00005ATQF|5.0|`Full Metal Jacket', coauthored, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick may very well be the great director's second best film, after `2001, A Space Odyssey'.<br /><br />The conventional wisdom at the time of the film's release in 1987 is that it was ½ of a great film and ½ of a good film. Until I recently viewed this DVD, I complacently thought the first half on the Marine training camp on Paris Island, South Carolina was the `great' half and the second half in Vietnam during the Tet offensive was the `good' half. Now, I am not so sure.<br /><br />Most of my new doubt arises from Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as the clueless recruit nicknamed `Gomer Pyle'. I may be seeing this performance in a new light as Mr. D'Onofrio is now a prominent face as an actor in one of the `Law & Order' incarnations where he ably plays a much different sort of role. When I pair this performance with that of Jack Nicholson in `The Shining', I see a common weakness arising from the two actors' giving away the game in their expressions several scenes before their climaxes. In the case of Nicholson, it is almost a full two acts before the story tips its hand. Up until now, I wrote this off as Jack being Jack rather than a result of Kubrick's direction. But now, when I match these two performances up with those of Stirling Hayden and George C. Scott in `Dr. Strangelove', I begin to see a definite pattern of overacting in Kubrick's lead actors, whether it be in comedy, horror, or drama.<br /><br />Another reason for lowering the stock of the Paris Island act is the fact that the central character here, the lead drill instructor, is played by Lee Ermey, who was actually a Marine drill instructor and who served as the technical consultant on the film. Ermey, in the part which would make his career from then on, could probably have played this part in his sleep. I would not be too surprised if I did not actually contribute to a lot of the dialogue, if not literally improvise it on the spot.<br /><br />A third reason for valuing the second half of the movie is the fact that the Vietnam action is so open-ended in comparison to the Paris Island story. There is just so much you can show about Marine trainees and their drill instructors, without going off the reservation. And, with Kubrick's penchant for realism in most things, he is definitely not going off the reservation in this situation.<br /><br />The second half of the movie is largely owned by Matthew Modine (Joker), one of the recruits graduated at the end of the first half, and Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother), he of the `thousand yard stare' who manages to fire a belt fed machine gun while standing and cradling the weapon in his arms. If the recoil doesn't make this improbable, then the overheating of the barrel surely does. But there is none of the overacting which tipped the director's hand in Act I.<br /><br />For the longest time, I felt a disconnect between Act I and Act II, but now the connection between the two halves has become much clearer for me. Act II depicts Marines in combat. Act I shows the kind of training which lead to that combat under fire. And, the most salient aspect of that training is the message that `...Marines are meant to kill, and even if they die, the Corp will live forever...'.<br /><br />It's noteworthy that one of the collaborators in the writing of this movie is Michael Herr, the author of `Dispatches', who also is listed as a co-author of that other great Vietnam era movie, `Apocalypse Now'. Herr's contribution of realism to two relatively surreal movies may be why these two films are well remembered to this day and Acadamy Award winner, `Platoon' has fallen to second string status, except for the cachet obtained by winning the Oscar for best picture.<br /><br />Kubrick's DVDs, like those of Woody Allen, have few extras. And, my favorite, a commentary soundtrack by the director is no longer possible, but, unlike `2001', this movie has relatively few obscure scenes. The only puzzle may be the several visual and auditory allusions to Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />Oddly enough, my take on Kubrick actors' overacting suddenly raises my opinion of `Eyes Wide Shut', where the principals are so low key, you hardly notice that they are acting at all.<br /><br />This is easily in my top 10 favorite war pictures and possibly my favorite Kubrick flick to watch on DVD.obscure scenes.

B00005JMAH|4.0|Finally, Harry Potter is brought to the screen as a movie...and not as a book-on-film!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the other films. But I think most of my enjoyment came from watching them with a large group of my children's freinds and family.<br /><br />I believe that the first two films suffered from a painfully loyal adaptation of the books. Of course, they couldn't get everything in there...but they sure tried. I love many of Chris columbus' movies, but it felt like he was somewhat imprisoned by the author's iron pen.<br /><br />And then comes this film. One that honors the book, for sure, but finally realizes that the movie must stand as a movie -- which means it must 'move.' It must have either strong plot movement, character arcs, or both.<br /><br />And it also gets the tone right, I think for the first time. This is not a happy story. It is a dark, edgy world that Harry inhabits. I understand that it must be appropriate for the kids who made it the biggest selling book since the Bible...but it also needs to be what it is. And it's a dark story full of death and madness and magic and evil! It's like Shakespeare for kids!<br /><br />I could say more, but I just wanted to acknowledge that they got it right this time...because I am getting excited to see if they get it right again in about a month...when the next installment reaches theatres.<br /><br />Thanks for indulging me.<br /><br />Derek Rydall
B000002GYR|5.0|\\"Grapefruit Moon\\" is the coolest song in the world.  I was in the shower one morning and I was thinking, \\"what the fudge is Tom talking about?  You never see just one star shining with the moon...if the sky is clear enough to see anything at all, you see a lot of stars at once.\\"  That very night, I was on a walk and I looked up and Lo and Behold, it was the grapefruit moon with one star shining!  That was probably the pinnacle of my life.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I originaly got Wicked for my mother's birthday but after listening to it i had to have my own copy. everyone who has heard it in my car has purchased a copy. Wicked is one of the best musicals America has produced in a long time.
6305428042|5.0|We love this movie...I had it on VHS but somehow it ended up missing and just had to get it on DVD for the holidays...This movie is a must see for halloween or anytime...my husband and I love Bette Midler and my daughter and I just love the songs, \\"I put a spell on you\\" and \\"Come little children\\"--I'm not sure if that is the title, but it is performed by Sarah J. Parker in the movie. Wonderful movie for all!
B000058983|5.0|I was introduced to Love, by my mother, who was a young, twenty-something during the band's peak.  This was the age of the Vietnam War, a time when the world was in a state of transition (politically, socially, economically, and every which way in between).  Sound familiar?  The timeless lyrics of Love (and lead singer Arthur Lee) could be as applicable to the trying times of today, as they were over thirty years ago.<br /><br />Among the reasons that Love was such an outstanding and cutting edge band, was its lyrics that interchanged with being, both, psychedelic imagery, haunting poetry and evocative of prophecy.  The apocalyptic depictions of the ravaging effects of war, and the expendable relationship between war and human beings as cannon fodder, were a true observation of the senseless effects of war on the innocent and the young.  What's more, Love's lead singer, Arthur Lee, was an African-American frontman for a predominantly Caucasian band, based out of 1960s Hade Ashbury, California (prior to the Watts race riots).<br /><br />Some of the best songs on this album include:<br /><br />Track #1 \\"Alone Again Or\\"<br /><br />This song talks about alienation, and juxtaposes two distinctly different personalities.  One lives an isolated life, removed from virtually all social contact.  The other takes a more jovial approach to the world (\\"I could be in love with almost everyone/I think that people are the greatest fun\\").<br /><br />Track #9  \\"The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This\\"<br /><br />This is a more optimistic, almost eerily sunny view of life in the world.  The music could be lifted from an Osmond Brothers album, or even from a Brady Bunch special.  But, don't let that fool you....this song sounds deceptively cheery, but underneath it lies a true rock soul to the core.<br /><br />The instrumentation on this album is truly brilliant.  Whether you are listening to their distinctly mariachi influences, coming from the horn section, an almost classical music flavor to the guitar riffs, or Arthur Lee's rapping (yes, I said rapping), before rapping even existed.  You have got to check this out!lavor to the guitar riffs, or Arthur Lee's rapping (yes, I said rapping), before rapping even existed.  You have got to check this out!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Great CD, music wise anyway.  I agree it is totally against our rights to protect against putting this music on my PC at home to enjoy.  I will NEVER buy another one with this \\"copy protection\\" on it....NEVER.  I don't care if Led Zeppelin is reincarnated and puts out a new CD, if it had this \\"crap\\" on it, I would not buy it.  Now that I have vented, the music on this CD is nothing short of awesome, the best yet from Foo Fighters.  I hear at least 6 radio singles on CD1 and a few possibilities on CD2.  Buy it only if you care about listening in your car and nothing else.  I love to re-create my own personal compilation CDs but cannot add this to the mix.  Protection?....for who?  This particular record company has just added fuel to the fire and has encouraged illegally downloading this music for free and using it however you wish.  Nice job :)
B000021YQV|4.0|Ok here's what you need to remember. These songs get old. Toxicity got old to me in about 4 months. Also there are a few songs that are not good. But in other words this is a good album to start off with if your gonna become a system of a down fan. Here's how I rate the songs, for those who are interested. If not just don't read on cause, I gave my review. <br /> <br /> <br />1. Prison Song: 7/10 Good song with a nice beat. It's about prisons and politics. For those new to System Of A Down, songs about politics is nothin new for System Of A Down. <br /> <br />2. Needles: 4/10 Ok but it just seems annoying to me is all <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance: 9/10 Very good song on politics... I love the name to it, plus it's loud. make sure to treasure this song cause the next two songs suck. <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot: 2/10 JUST SKIP THIS SONG! Way too noisy, way too horiable, no good beat, it's just the same through out the some and that's what made it bad. <br /> <br />5. X: 2/10 Similar to Jet Pilot just skip <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey: 10/10 Favorite song off the album. This song is very good. One of the few songs that have not gotten old to me yet. You'll love the \\" angels deserve to die\\" part. It just feels powerful. <br /> <br />7. Bounce : 10/10 I love this song cause it gets me hyper. This is the song you need if you feel the need to jump all over the house!!!! <br /> <br />8. Forest : 5/10 Average song. Good for a few listens I'll admit tho <br /> <br />9. ATWA: 8/10: Very good song. It's also good to listen to if you feel pissed off at someone. <br /> <br />10. Science: 8/10 Good song. Loved it first few times I listened to it and I mean it! Now it got old :(. Ahh if there was time travel. I'd listen to this song first if you can. <br />(also on a side note this song was placed on a video game before called Off Road Fury 3  for PS2) <br /> <br />11. Shimmy: 5/10 This song is just too short. All the critics were correct on it bein too short. It's a song about goin to school which I find somewhat funny so it gets a 5 cause of that. <br /> <br />12. Toxicity: 9/10 I love this song so much. It makes you feel like your in some sorta underground dirty city. Good song to heabang to since it's so loud. <br /> <br />13. Psycho: 10/10 My second favorite. Very great song about drugs I believe. Just listen to it.. it has a great beat. Also have you seen this live before? It's better live. <br /> <br />14. Aerials: 10/10 Third favorite song. A very very unique system of a down song. You'd think this came off of an album that System Of A Down didn't release yet. It's sorta like a ballad. The lyrics are really beautiful (look it up on a lyrics site if ya don't believe me). Very good way to close the album honestly. If ya haven't noticed System Of A Down always closes their album with good songs, which is nice.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I have always favored Neil Young's acoustic endeavors over his louder electric and often distorted Crazy Horse releases.  \\"Prarie Wind\\", ranks right up there with \\"Harvest, Harvest Moon, and Comes A Time\\".  Not only is this release listenable, but Young comes across as a master story-teller in a way that is very Dylan like.  The melodies are ear catching, and the instrumentation is crystal clear.  It makes you feel as though you are sitting on a porch sitting next to Neil for a an evening sing a long.  This is a fantastic effort on Neil Young's part, that is without question one of his best releases to date.  Don't miss out on this one.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|The biggest change in this album from past albums is the fact that the lead singer can't scream... seriously he burst a blood vessel in his throat. that explains why he actully sings on this album... he took voice lessons from the same guy who helped axl rose to sing, and i absolutely hate axl rose ( and GnR for that matter) but i love the vocals on this album... songs like \\"seize the day\\" seem to sound perfect... the music is great... compliments the new singing style quite well... over-all i think people will be very impressed by this album, A7X obviously has a lot of talent and i think it really shows on this album.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|As is the case with all films based on popular genre, the initial reaction is that a certain film is the best thing in the world.  This was said about Tomb Raider when it first came out, and seeing how quickly it went to video is testament to the phenomenon that a big license adaptation on film gets rave reviews in the first week from the fanboys who waited on their heels for 4 years to see it.  Then in the second week, the regular Joes see it as being nothing all too spectacular. <br /> <br />It's also a bit unfair in this regard.  The fanboys are going to see this film, and think it's stupendous just because it contains all their favorite characters.  Therefore, the movie rests on a cushion of egocentric praise constructed by such people who are obviously biased in favor towards the film.  Therefore, the genuine critics and movie fanatics will see it with the expectation of being blown away, and think it's the pits. <br /> <br />I guess I can't blame people for automatically gawking over the spectacular special effects that saturate this film, but as we have seen in recent years with big budget films such as \\"Fantastic Four\\", there is such thing as overkill.  The movie is unfortunately wraught with excessive technical effects, such as unnecessary camera movements through the 3d environment, flare effects, and facetious usage of the dreaded \\"bullet time\\". <br /> <br />The only thing this movie has going for it is the resurgence of the old characters, even though their dialogue and actions aren't really in the same consistent character as it was in the game.  Again, I can't blame people for overlooking the complete lack of character depth and development, because Advent Children at least fits the bill for fulfilling the demographic's strong desire to see their favorite FF7 heroes in full high resolution glory. <br /> <br />Animation is quirky at times, either an element of lackluster model rigging or obtuse timing between keyframes.  You know, the technical stuff that doesn't come together, resulting in an effect that frequently breaks the audiences' voluntary temporary dismissal of reality. <br /> <br />It's very good fanservice, and is probably going to be idolized by fans of the genre, as well as those who felt that the first Final Fantasy movie was good.  But it's fanservice nonetheless, and nothing more.  A brainless plot achieves its complete delivery halfway through, petering out during the second half leaving only a predictable turn of events that even the most novice anime efficienado can see coming from miles away.  The characters remain static throughout, undergoing no personal change or revelation on their own part, again leaving for an unfulfilling movie experience. <br /> <br />It's a chocolate easter bunny.  Looks delicious on the outside, but it's completely empty on the inside.  After applying some heated observation, it begins to melt.  I would give it 3 stars for being merely subpar, but seeing as this took four years to create, it's getting a very generous 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Pros: Spectacular visual effects in parts.  It's not as excrutiating as Spirits Within. <br /> <br />Cons: Story is lacking in many parts, and suffers from continuity in a few parts.  English voice acting is, as expected, attrocious.  Some very hokey lines.  Cliche.  Predictable.  Zero drive to watch it again.  Awful cinematography.  Quirky animation. <br /> <br />Watch this if: You're an avid FF7 fan who just has to see everything associated with the series, and doesn't in the least care about story.  Plus, if you have a Blockbuster card available, this is definitely rental material.
B00005JN5X|4.0|A couple of weeks ago, I went out to see The Brothers Grimm.  It's a Terry Gilliam film, the well-known director of films such as Brazil and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  With such an illustrious past, Gilliam has much to live up to.<br /><br />With this effort, he's gone a little more mainstream, and a little more linear.  This is not to say that the movie is bad--it's not.  It's just that it's a little more normal than Gilliam fans would have expected.<br /><br />The movie tells the tale of two brothers, last name Grimm, who roam the German countryside, scamming unsuspecting small towns who are \\"haunted\\" or \\"betwitched\\" or somesuch, with said calamities actually created by the Grimms and their compadres.  Unfortunately for the Grimms, they've been caught by the government, and set the task of un-cursing a small town which, the government believes, is ensnared by another group of scam artists.  Unfortunately for the brothers, things are all too supernaturally real.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Heath Ledger play the lead characters, and don't do a bad job with their material.  Monica Bellucci plays a queen, and she doesn't do so well with the material, but her character is supposed to be rather shallow, so there's little damage.<br /><br />Great special effects and sound on a reasonable budget.  CG effects must be getting pretty cheap!<br /><br />I would recommend it, but only pay the matinee prices.  It's OK for older kids.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|I have been a fan for 40 years, I use to see him in the Yardbirds under the Richmond athletic stadium and when Cream started at Windsor and at the Albert Hall many times. <br /> <br />He must get back to basics and record \\"live\\" with a real band and dump protools. <br /> <br />He may be happy, but I can tell you that many of his fans are disappointed. <br /> <br />He is with out a doubt a master craftsman who can do much better the lyrics are trite and the arrangements just don't cut it. <br /> <br />Waiting in hope for good stuff.

B000929AJQ|1.0|All of the people that originally made up Trent Reznor's backup band have been replaced, and the style of music has gone from heavy industrial rock to emo-alternative with some keyboards.  As nothing on this CD is similar enough to his previous work to call it the same band, why is it still Nine Inch Nails?  To say that this album was a disappointment would be a severe understatement.  In the months before it came out, everyone was saying it was their heaviest stuff ever.  Then I heard \\"The hand that feeds,\\" and I was disappointed by how happy it sounded, but I just figured it was the softest song on the album and they were just putting it out as a single to get some publicity.  But then it turns out it was the heaviest, and now I can't wear my Nine Inch Nails shirt anymore for fear that it's associated with this album.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is, by far, the best of the series, IMHO!  Being the nerd that I am, I like to have it accompany me whilst reading Harry Potter...
0688014291|1.0|I have a suspicion that many people have read this book for the same reason I have: they were forced to by their boss. All I can say is that if this truly represents the mindset of those who are managing today's business, heaven help us. This book is a time bomb. It encourages managers to be distant and not spend adequate time communicating with their employees. Is one minute really the proper amount of time to spend setting out goals and expectations for any reasonably complex project? Is one minute enough time to even give a basic description of a simple process? On top of this, the book encourages managers to be manipulative with the emotions of their employees, giving unthinkably ridiculous reprimands and praisings that will no doubt to serve as excellent opportunities for employees to mock the manager behind his back. That was my experience with the book, at any rate. In a modern, integrated workplace, the kind of thinking this book promulgates is likely to lead to widespread resentment and decreased productivity.  <br /> <br />Additionally, if the reader has any contact with even the most rote literature, the style of this book will come across remarkably facile and thunderingly dull. I truly cannot believe that this is directed toward anyone with a high school diploma. Another reviewer mentions that the book might be read as satire, an idea that I wish I had thought of when I slogged through it. If you see this one sitting on your manager's desk, be sure to toss it in the trash when he isn't looking. The workplace you save might just be your own.
0061020710|3.0|The Color of Magic is the first in the extremely long and growing Discworld series. In the first novel, the central character is Rincewind, a failed wizard with a craven nature. Rincewind meets up with the Discworld's first tourist, an insurance salesman named Twoflower from a far-off continent. They pair up because Rincewind seems to be the only person in the city who can speak a common language with Twoflower. Together, they maneuver themselves through various situations, manipulated by the gods who sit above and move them like game pieces in some contest only they understand. And Twoflower's luggage, made of sapient pearwood, loyally follows along with them wherever they go. <br /> <br />Through this premise, they encounter a series of adventures that parody the fantasy genre. They run afoul of a dragonrider enclave, a reference to Anne McCaffrey's Pern series, and a fairly amusing one. There were a few other obvious tributes for veterans of the genre. Bravd and the Weasel were clear references to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser. Hrun the Barbarian is a standard Conan type. We are introduced to various aspects of the Discworld itself. The physics of the seasons of a flat world with an orbiting sun, and the terminology resulting from its nature, detailed in an early footnote, were interesting. <br /> <br />The problem with the story is that it's just a little ... dull. I did like the book, but not as much as the other Discworld books I've read. I'd read this one years ago, and the disappointment I'd felt in it after hearing so much about Discworld put me off reading any other Discworld books for a long time. But constant raving by the loyal fan base caused me to abandon my misgivings and read more of the seires. And I'm glad I did. But even after rereading the first one with a little more of the series under my belt, I decided it wasn't just a first impression. This is just not as good as some others in the series. The series can't be judged by its beginning. <br /> <br />This story was a little too much of a revolving door of other stories and characters. I'm not that fond of Rincewind, the main character in this one. He's not very interesting, and after a while I found him a little annoying. The tourist character, Twoflower, wasn't really consistent. Throughout most of the book, he's a sort of blissfully ignorant, cheery rube, blundering on protected from harm by his own inability to understand the danger he's in. But at a couple points in the book he becomes uncharacteristically angry or wise. Also the first time he's described, the writer says he has four eyes, but it's not really clear that this is because the person viewing him has never seen eyeglasses before. And also somehow Twoflower at some point becomes able to converse with people besides Rincewind without having a common language. <br /> <br />There are a few good funny lines in the book, but not enough to really say the book was funny cover to cover. There were a couple parts where I did really laugh out loud, but not enough to call this pure comedy. Pratchett is often called the \\"Douglas Adams of Fantasy,\\" but I feel the comparison to Douglas Adams isn't really accurate. The sense of humor is vaguely similar, but The Hitchhiker series had something funny on almost every page, sometimes at the expense of the storytelling, which suffered a little bit with the side-conversations that went nowhere just for the sake of a laugh. For the most part, The Color of Magic was pure parody of the fantasy genre, and the humor is more subtle. Expecting a quotable \\"joke\\" as often as in the Hitchhiker series is bound to lead to a disappointment. <br /> <br />The other Discworld books I've read are better than this. Fortunately, one doesn't need to read all the books sequentially to get the most enjoyment out of the series. Although there are over 30 books already, there are several smaller subseries focusing on various characters. I'll probably skip all the ones thatfocus on Rincewind, but I plan to read several more in the series. If this is the first Discworld book you read, you may also be put off the series, but I assure you, it gets better.
1591840562|3.0|Guy Kawasaki provides a direct (almost in your face) style that gets to the point very quickly. From his top ten presentations to bottom up forecasting, he clearly articulates the critical success factors and then gets out of your way. From my personal reference of two startups, his advice holds true and I recommend buying it if you have not been through a startup process in a leadership position. However, for those that have been through it, this book may only provide some simple reminders of what's important.
B000002HRE|4.0|While releasing every song they recorded after the black album was a bit insane, Load and Reload make an interesting kind of \\"double album\\". Reload is very weird; not at all like old Metallica. Lots of weird draggy songs that sound like they suck, or at least are very boring. Some are; this was probably Metallica's weakest album. But most of this is great.
B000AL730O|4.0|Paul McCartney is one of the few rare rock musicians that one can use the label 'genius'.  His output in the Beatles, with their lovely melodies and counterpoints are more than enough to back this point up.  His solo output however, is not as consistent. Some of this is because he only had to produce half or so of the songs on the Beatles albums, John and the boys taking care of the rest.  Not to mention that he had 3 other of rocks best musicians to work off of. Having said that, some of his greatest work was on his solo albums (see Band on the Run, Ram, Flaming Pie...)  When you're as talanted as Paul it's easy to want to expand in one's style and context.  Problem is that so many musicians try to regain chart promence by writing in styles that THEY THINK WILL SELL ALBUMS, not wanting to just do what they do best.  It's a shame because when you're Paul, someone will always respect and purchase your work, espically when it's of a certin quality, not mearly pandering to the fickle tastes of the common pop music listener.  THE NEW ALBUM(sorry for being long winded)-  This is a Fine album.  Great playing, great songwrting, wonderful meodies, harmonies, etc.  It's retrospective, it's not trying to rock out to hard or emulate the current trend (remember Paul doing disco flavored tunes?)  This album shows why Paul is a genius and a rare songwriter/musician.  Thanks Paul, most new music is horrible, this is art.
B000002HMH|4.0|Hey this isn't bad. Sure it isn't non-stop rapid fire rhytmn guitar. But this stuff is really solid hard rock; some of the best of its year really. Yeah, the sucker is over long, but this has more to do with some songs being extended than bad songs. Nice to see Metallica changing a bit.
0786880708|5.0|This is a book you have to be ready to read in order to get the benefit out of it.  You will either think it is just scribbles of others' notes.  Or you will think that it is a masterpiece.  I bought this book sitting on my shelf a year ago.  Why?  Because at that point of my life I could not stop my racing thoughts (the need to do something all the time) enough to experience what the author - Jon Kabat-Zinn, tries to communicate.  Some how, life turned around a little (probably when I started reading Eckart Tolle's books).  My thought pattern starts slowing down and I start living in the present moment with consciousness of thoughts.  A year later, I pick up this book again and start reading.  Suddenly, it is truly a bundle of joy.  It is a book I would like to read when I am at the coffee shop or even just to enjoy a great Saturday afternoon.  I feel that this book is truly a rare jewel you find on Earth.  The author picks up the most delicate moment where human beings can meditate.  He gives me great inspiration/ways to slow down thoughts/thinking. <br /> <br />But again, meditations, staying in the present moment isn't something we need to read a lot about.  We can read on the world's greatest books and still not able to find peace and joy in life.  Just like what the author had said in one chapter.  One can jump from one teacher to another looking for salvation from the outside.  However, it is working on the inner self, focusing on the inner thoughts and patterns that rise one's mindful/peaceful thinking to the next level (yet rising just means further centering and grounding).    <br /> <br />From experience, it is about letting the human ego die every day and letting go of fear and judgement.  Letting go of the seemingly unbearable pain and attachment.  It is truly about having full awareness of thoughts and beliefs and process those things on a piece of paper/therapist.  Then, sooner or later, one will find a taste of what mindfulness truly mean.  You mightstill endure physical pain because of illness.  But the pain gets easier every day when we are aware of our mind and body. <br /> <br />This is a book to experience.  Speed-reading will not help you to taste what the author is trying to offer. <br />
0062502182|5.0|There's really not much more to say about this book other than I loved it and so far I still consider this the best book I've ever read!
B000AL730O|3.0|When I first listened to Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, I was immediately drawn in; I've long been a sucker for McCartney's work.  But over time, a funny thing happened.  The initial thrill of a new McCartney record receded, and I was left experiencing the thing as generally boring.  It is a quality work, but the songs are almost all morose down-tempo ballads, and the record lacks the variety and vitality of his best work (Ram, Band on the Run, Tug of War.)<br /><br />It is indeed a challenging work, as opposed to the immediately likable tones and textures of his best, most popular stuff.  Like Driving Rain this is somber, sad, and full of a sense of despair and mortality.  He's aged visably in the years since Linda's death, and his music has too.  Of course age, maturity, and a sense of mortality can often mark a triumphant album-- but this is Paul McCartney, the man who virtually invented musical whimsy.  It doesn't quite seem to suit him.  No one wants to see Peter Pan grow up and get bummed out.<br /><br />So initially, you are braced by the affect of the familiar colliding with the unfamiliar; it sounds like Paul McCartney, but it is different from most of his work.  I think that caused a lot of the initial strong positive reactions you read here.  After this effect wears off, though, you are left with the songs to reckon with.  And they are a solid but unspectacular lot.  No winning toss-off rockers (like Flaming Pie's \\"Used to Be Bad\\" or the quintessential \\"Jet\\" or \\"Getting Closer\\" or \\"Beware My Love\\"); none of that delicate spun-candy pop (say, \\"Calico Skies,\\" or more grandly, \\"With a Litle Luck.\\")  None of those instant hits that mark a season in time (\\"My Brave Face,\\" \\"Hope of Deliverance,\\" \\"Listen to What the Man Said.\\") No, basically you get morose ballad after morose ballad.  I wonder how many of these reviewers have changed their opinion of the album by now, because if I'd written my review after one or two listens, it too would have been a rave.<br /><br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" is the notable exception here; it is one of Paul's better acoustic tracks, and a worthwhile heir to \\"Blackbird\\" (both songs share a fingerpicking style and both reference a specific woman as a \\"bird.\\") I think its the classic song here.<br /><br />Other songs-- \\"At The Mercy,\\" \\"Friends to Go,\\" \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"A Certain Softness\\"-- any of these, maybe all of them, would be welcome interludes on another McCartney disc.  But here they aren't leavened with anything to break the mood, and one after another they leave you wanting something else, something different. There's a lot of somber mood, but no happy payoff.<br /><br />If you are a McCartney nut, then of course you need this.  If you just want a decent late period McCartney album, I'd have to direct you instead to Flaming Pie, surprisingly strong and the last one before Linda passed away.  If you're looking for the best post-Beatles McCartney, try Ram, Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, Tug of War, or Flowers in the Dirt.  Or the anthology Wingspan, which includes some great non-album stuff you need.br /><br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" is the notable exception here; it is one of Paul's better acoustic tracks, and a worthwhile heir to \\"Blackbird\\" (both songs share a fingerpicking style and both reference a specific woman as a \\"bird.\\") I think its the classic song here.<br /><br />Other songs-- \\"At The Mercy,\\" \\"Friends to Go,\\" \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"A Certain Softness\\"-- any of these, maybe all of them, would be welcome interludes on another McCartney disc.  But here they aren't leavened with anything to break the mood, and one after another they leave you wanting something else, something different. There's a lot of somber mood, but no happy payoff.<br /><br />If you are a McCartney nut, then of course you need this.

B00005JMK0|5.0|Upbeat, escapist 80's movie with a catchy soundtrack by ELO, Giorgio Moroder and others. The slightly geeky hero of the story buys a PC to help him organise his life. As a result of a misadventure, it develops a personality and comes 'alive'. Good clean fun, back when PC's were a enigma in many peoples eyes - anything was seen as being possible. Synthesizers feature largely in this movie, and this seemed a natural way for a computer to communicate to the world, particularly to the new girlfriend. Features a cute Virginia Madsen as the love interest back when she was just getting started in movies. One of the best scenes has Virginia practising on her cello, the computer joins in from the upstairs apartment, then follows a terrific duet, and mistaken identity. Hope it gets released on DVD real soon, including all the original music.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Sadly, I didn't know very much about Slipknot before I heard this album. My friend burnt it for me - I mean, I bought it (>.> Heh. Heh.), and to make a long story short, it's shoved me into the Hard Rock/Metal/Ish genre. So, I congradulate these guys on making on awesome album and making a fan. To review the individual songs: <br />1. Prelude (5/5) - Great song. Perhaps it lacks the pace of some of the other songs on this album, but it really grows on you. <br />2. Blister Exists (4.5/5) - I listened to this song repeatedly when I got this album and, after transferring it to my lovely Rio Carbon mp3 player, which I recommend to all, I would put it on repeat and listen it all day and all night. Yes, I slept to this song, I admit. Very fast-paced, and some freakin' awesome drum parts. The lyrics lack the depth of some of the other songs, however. <br />3. Three Nil (4/5) - Kinda like a guitar version of the awesome drum feature in Blister Exists. I didn't like this one as much as Blister Exists, but I still loved it. <br />4. Duality (3.5/5) - I heard this on the radio before I got the album and actually figured out the riffs on my keyboard. >.> Once I had the album, though, the song got old. <br />5. People (4/5) - Falls into the same catagory as Blister Exists and Three Nil and has an infallible tendancy to getting stuck in your head. <br />6. Circle (5/5) - Love this song, and it's as simple as that. I'm a sucker for acoustic Slipknot, and I know it, but this song is just cool and haunting. <br />7. Welcome (4/5) - I really like the drum part in this song. Wonderful drumming, a Slipknot asset, really stands out here. Fun song. <br />8. Vermillion (5.5/5) - I. Love. This. Song. It's haunting and fun and... everything else I love. <br />9. Pulse of the Maggots (3/5) I didn't like this song. I think it's the weakest song on the album. Yes, it's a tribute to Slipknot's fans, but I just don't like it. It seems weak or lacking something. <br />10. Before I Forget (4/5) -I don't see why Slipknot released this as their other single. I really think either Blister Exists or Circle was more eligible. So-so. <br />11. Vermillion, Part 2 (5/5) - I love the acoustic work and the vocals in this song. It's... actually pretty. And it's Slipknot. Amazing. It works out very well, though, and is quite beautiful and, again, haunting. <br />12. Nameless (3.5/5) - I don't like this song all that much until about 2 minutes into it, and it goes acoustic, and it's awesome. <br />13. Virus of Life (5.5/5) - I hadn't sat down and listened to this song in its entirity... well, ever, until about three weeks ago. I actually, by some weird perversion in me, fell in complete love with it. Something about the last two seconds makes me grin. >.> Overall, I love the weird muttering quality of the vocals and the weird guitar work. <br />To conclude, I love this album, and it made me fall into my love-at-first-audio with hard rock.
B00080ZG10|3.0|This was a good movie.  Well acted.  Stunning cinematography.  It would be a 4-star for a 2 hour standard length film.  But it wasn't special enough in content to justify the extra time.   <br /> <br />It is the life story of an interesting eccentric person.  But it's not exactly Lawrence of Arabia. <br /> <br />
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor was nothing short of spectacular. Don't listen to all the people who trash this movie just because about the romance it has in it. They have to ask themselves one question.  How the heck could this movie be made without some kind of plot??? The director couldn't just have the actual attack in the movie and then boom, it ends. That would only be like a 10 minute movie or something. So yes, a plot, story, and fictional characters have to be used in order to actually make a \\"movie.\\" Without them, there wouldn't be no movie. Just like the major disaster epic \\"Titanic,\\" of 1997, it had a romance story behind it. So what that a man and woman somehow fell in love in just the course of a few days or so on a gigantic cruise ship. Without the romance story, there wouldn't be the great movie Titanic that we came to see in 1997. Instead, there would just be another documentary like if you will recollection of the tragic demise of the ship. So after all that I have said, just truly enjoy this film for the romance, action, suspense, and breathtaking effects it has.  Alot of people just will never be able know a good darn movie when they see one, and isn't that a shame. All in all, Pearl Harbor is truly a war epic!
B0000A1RJI|3.0|I found this to be so powerful and so moving that it were as if I were actually on a pirate ship, sailing out to God knows where. The amazing crescendos are enough to blast you back to the 1600s where pirates ran amuck. The only quarrel I have with Klaus Badelt is there are miniscule references that made me believe Hans Zimmer snuck in through the back door to help write some of this music for him.
630460291X|3.0|This has got to be one of the worst DVDs (as DVD) in my collection.  (The movie itself is fine.)<br /><br />To begin with, there are no special features.  Or, rather, the \\"special features\\" listed consist essentially of \\"interactive menus.\\"  This is a special feature?<br /><br />Also, the makers of this DVD have seen fit -- God knows why since the movie isn't THAT long -- to put the movie on BOTH sides of the DVD, meaning that you have to get up and flip it over for part two.  Since there isn't any extra footage or anything that would take up a lot of space, I'm baffled as to why they did this.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|`Cold Mountain', a film based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name, tells a powerful tale set in the end game of the Civil War, as the Rebel armies fought on though all hope for a Southern victory was gone. A wounded rebel soldier, Inman (Jude Law), deserts the hopeless fighting to make a desperate, dangerous quest to his mountain home in North Carolina and to Ada (Nicole Kidman), the girl that he left behind. The story cuts back and forth between Inman's perilous trek walking home and Ada's struggle to maintain her farm in a world fallen apart around her. Interspersed in these two strands are flashbacks to Inman and Ada's pre-war courting. It's a sad story of the cost of war, not on the battlefields, but on the lives and fortunes of those left behind on the home front.<br /><br />`Cold Mountain' is beautifully and movingly filmed. It opens with a dramatic portrayal of the Battle of the Crater that is stunningly effective in showing the brutal violence and horror of the hopeless war Inman leaves to seek his far away home. Just as effectively captured is the natural beauty of the mountain home he left behind, as well as the changing and challenging landscapes through which he moves on his journey home.<br /><br />Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are adequate leads, though neither really distinguishes themselves in their roles, and their near perfect physical attractiveness seems inauthentic for a film set in 1860s Appalachia. The best performances in the movie belong to the excellent supporting cast - in particular Renee Zellweger's brilliant portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough, coarse, outspoken young woman who taught the frail Ada how to survive. Philip Seymour Hoffman also deserves mention for his brief but evocative performance as a decadent rogue preacher Inman meets on his journey home, as does Natalie Portman for her role as a desperate, war widow mother whom Inman encounters. Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Brendan Gleeson, and Ray Winstone round out a fine cast of character actors.<br /><br />`Cold Mountain' is not a perfect film, but when all of its virtues are considered together - its stunning visual storytelling, outstanding supporting cast, and its use of amazing old-time Appalachian music throughout, it emerges as one of the best Civil War movies yet made. It is an honest, tragic tale of war's cost, told well. It has my recommendation.<br /><br />Theo LogosRay Winstone round out a fine cast of character actors. <br /> <br />`Cold Mountain' is not a perfect film, but when all of its virtues are considered together - its stunning visual storytelling, outstanding supporting cast, and its use of amazing old-time Appalachian music throughout, it emerges as one of the best Civil War movies yet made.

0940985691|5.0|Light on Life by Defouw and Svoboda is by far the best book on Jyotish. No other single book covers so much.<br /><br />I've studied, not just read, the Brihat Parasara Hora, Saravali, Jataka Parijata, Prasna Marga...B.V Raman, Bepin Behari, and of course the western authors like Braha and Levacy...and even Braha's mentor Santhanam who translated Deva Keralam. They all have merit but none of them tackle the subject as comprehensibly and cohesively as Defouw and Svoboda. They've taken the cream from all the ancient texts and churned it into rich, sweet butter, making this the most nourishing read.<br /><br />The philosophical and historical background they offer along with calculations needed to draw the chart and translations of Sanskrit words is testimony to their vast knowledge of the subject. A mere glance at the index tells the story.<br /><br />This is not an introductory book as some reviewers have suggested. Maybe it's the ease with which Defouw writes that makes one think that but in fact it's quite an advanced text, a book that's to be read over and over again to grasp the intricate design that is Jyotish.

B000AL730O|1.0|Being a huge Beatles/McCartney fan, I was in Costco and decided what the heck it's Paul McCartney give it a shot. The first song \\"Fine line\\" was ok nothing to get excited about. The CD went downhill fast from their, couldn't even listen to each song, it was that bad. Nothing really uptempo on the CD, which would be ok if the slow stuff was good. McCartney's voice is strange to.  We will just have to forgive him for this dud. Pick up \\"Back in the U.S. Live 2002\\" it's awesome with Paul in good voice.
B000008LOV|4.0|If you are a Tom Petty fan, and if you like George Harrison or even just fondly respect him, and if you like witty lyrics and good music the Wilburys don't disappoint.  The CD has like, 18 tracks,so you can really get into it.  I cooked a whole dinner while listening, and just the fact that I cook probably shows that I remember all the guys in the Wilburys. If you remember this group then you should get this CD, it's a treasure. If you've never heard of them then you probably not even reading this review.  Too bad for you.

B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top has a very unique style which has distinguished them from other groups of the 70s and 80s.  Comprised of Billy Gibbons on lead guitar, Dusty Hill on bass, and Frank Beard on drums, ZZ Top relies on good old-fashioned guitars and drums rather than keyboards to get their sound across.  They have succeeded extremely well, and this Greatest Hits collection is a testament to their staying power. <br /> <br />This great cd is an anthology of hits that has made ZZ Top a successful band for almost thiry years.  Unforgettable songs such as \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"Tush\\", \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\", and \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" have become staples of ZZ Top.  Perhaps the best song on the disc is the extended version of \\"Legs\\".  Each song showcases ZZ Top's unique sound and Billy Gibbons' distinct vocal style.   <br /> <br />Each song on this disc is excellent.  I recommend this disc very highly.  Pick up ZZ Top's Greatest Hits and listen to some good Rrockin' blues music at its absolute best.

B00008WJBU|5.0|Have you ever tried to test your luck? Just to see how lucky you are or, better say, how crazy your luck could be? Some people find it out a hard way.. Some through Nazi's concentration camps, some in ill-fortunate air flight, the possibilities are endless and versatile like the life itself. But this movie is not just about luck. It also explores the power of coincidence, the power of attraction, what and who people are ready to sacrifice for their love and what and who to betray for their power, for the power of being Invincible. It is the superb mystic thriller which will keep you on the edge of your seat from the begining to end. But when it is over please don't try to check your luck like they do in the movie, after all you are given only one chance.

B00004BZ0N|4.0|I hadn't heard this album and I didn't know anything about this band, and I already had the image of this album cover burned into my head from it being in so many major publications that have incessantly sung its praises.  The title track alone really is a masterpiece and the album as a whole is really good, but it is not as great as many try to make it out to be.  One thing that I can really praise this album for are the consistently outstanding lyrics and songwriting, which is really why I give this album the extra half a star.  They have a lot to say, their world view is pretty clear, and their anti-establishment sentiments have a lot of substance behind them.  The lyrics are consistently thoughtful and clever, and the songs are well-written all throughout.  The only problem is that they are usually delivered with pouty marble-mouthed vocals.  It seems as though this may have been part of the general punk aesthetic, which seems to have grown largely out of what was essentially a backlash against what they saw as things that were neat, pretty and pro-establishment.  It seems as though they wanted to sound as anti-harmony as possible.  This also probably helps to explain the line in the outstanding title track about how \\"phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust\\".  The main problem with this CD is that it is loooonnnngggg.  I find the length of this album somewhat trying even though it only clocks in at around 65 minutes.  The band stretches themselves thin, taking on many different styles. Their ambition is admirable but ultimately works against them because they succeed at almost all of those styles without really excelling at any outside of the pure punk-ish (the title track, Hateful).  But still, even with that being said, there is just no denying the substantial nature of most of the material here (`Wrong `em Boyo', `Lover's Rock' and `Revolution Rock' not included :-).  Most of the pseudo-ska and reggae is pretty good but it still sounds like...pseudo-ska and reggae (save for maybe `Rudie can't fail' and `The guns of Brixton').  And, The Clash weren't the only British band, punk or otherwise to embrace reggae during this period. I do find it admirable that they connected with the music and the struggle of the Rasta's but, I think that we can mostly thank Bob Marley for that, which is why it so laughable that Rolling Stone would label this \\"the only political album that matters\\"-give me a break!  As far as British rock groups trying their hands at reggae, \\"The Police\\" did it more strongly before The Clash did and \\"XTC\\" did it better on \\"English Settlement\\", although I would have to say that \\"London Calling\\" is probably a better album overall, my personal preference aside.  On this album, The Clash try their hands at disco/euro-pop (Lost in the Supermarket), 50's rock (Brand New Cadillac), swing (Jimmy Jazz), almost-arena-rock :-) (Death or Glory), and even 60's hits-era Motown (Train in Vain) and they're all successful.  Overall, even with the few problems that I've mentioned, this is still a really good album that does actually stand as a truly important piece of work that you should add to your collection-even if it is a bit over-hyped :-)!ggae (save for maybe `Rudie can't fail' and `The guns of Brixton').

B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana shines like crazy in this album and it's musical genious are almost un rivaled. Howeverm this is Nirvana's only real good album, I mean, it's incredible, but haven;t I heard this before? oh ya, the Pixies, they have like all the same riffs, wait a second, the Pixies came first, oh, so Nirvana id ripping them off. I mean, I'm not saying that this album isn;t pure genious, I mean, it's considred one of the best albums of all time, it's just that, this band is a little overrated and I'm kind of tierd of it. In conclusion, this is a must have album, but if you love it, that's only natural, it's genious. However that doesn;t mean that this band is genious, they're not original, and almost all of their other albums suck. No fence Nirvana, but they do.<br /><br />I recomend this to anyone! But not the other Nirvana!<br /><br />PEACE
B0000025DV|4.0|This album has some great music, and no songs on it are bad, but Out of the Blue can't measure up to its tighter and more inspired predecessor, A New World Record.  Out of the Blue definitely has its share of filler and goofiness.  If you've listened to any of the many ELO's greatest hits compilations, you've already heard much of the strongest material from Out of the Blue, which is one of those double albums that should have been pared down to one album. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, if you like ELO's hits, you'll enjoy discovering some minor gems on Out of the Blue, but don't expect every song to be of the quality of, say, \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" (surely inspired by the Beatles \\"Good Day Sunshine\\") and \\"Sweet Talking Woman.\\"
B00003CXAW|5.0|Like so many fans of this film I am greatly anticipating the dvd release of \\"King Kong\\". Certainly all remakes of this classic have failed, but leave it to Peter Jackson to get it right. I know I'll be in the theater come December 14. <br /> <br />I'm not going to bore anyone with a review and retelling of the plot; we all know the film. Being in my 50's, I grew up watching this great motion picture since I was a kid, even sneaking out to the living room to see it one late night (I think the sitter knew, but let me watch it anyway). While at the University of Georgia I had the great fortune of seeing \\"King Kong\\" on the big screen. It was part of the 60 year anniversary of the film. [I still watch my anniversary TCM VHS copy whenever I get bored by what is on television (the micro-chip of Kong's roar still works--yeah, I'm easily amused!).] The UGA cinema was better equipped for picture & sound then any off-campus theater and I was able to see many classic films in their original 35mm format. When I watched Kong come to life on the big screen I could well imagine how the audiences of the 1930's must have reacted. The restored film was memorizing. If it is true that this classic of American cinema will be re-released to theaters, I urge everyone to see it. You will not regret the visual treat. <br /> <br />As for the dvd...it's about bloody time! I cannot wait to hear Harryhausen's commentary on the film that inspired the man who inspired so many others to enter the motion picture business. \\"King Kong\\"...dvd...Bring it on!

B00005LC3Y|4.0|The reviews I have seen so far say that the first part of the movie is the best. Guys! Come on! The first part of the movie is known primarily for being funny, and having some interesting quotes (overall, I'd say this is about the most quotable film ever). However, this misses the point of the first part. Yes, you are supposed to laugh a little, but at somepoint you SHOULD realize that the bullied character is not some cartoon cat, but a real human being, one who should not be treated as he is. The rest of this movie does not follow in exactly the way a normal movie's plot structure should. This does not mean it's bad. It may confuse you, it did me. Watch it again. It'll be worth it.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This album is great. I don't think that I've ever liked jazz so much before, seriously. Ray's genious really shows in this album as he plays some really good songs, none of them my favorite Ray Charles material, but still, really good stuff. This album changed my perspective on life, the music is timeless. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys good music.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|\\"Prairie Wind\\" is a collection of beautiful songs. \\"The Painter\\", in no uncertain terms, sets a wonderful tone to start the album... thoughts in shades of color to match the moods of a lifetime. There's really \\"No Wonder\\" how such an artist can distinguish the good imagery in one memorable song after another.    Into track 3, I really start to feel the affecting power of the music... you can feel Neil's heartfelt appreciation here. \\"Far From Home\\" he's not, as we're able to share his sense of good times with family in the land he loves, and it nearly becomes a little piece of the listener's home as well when you're awash in such imagery. \\"It's a Dream\\" now, but oh my goodness, the beautiful music and scenes to experience... I've never heard a song that sounds and feels at once so real yet imaginary. He and band take us to places that could seem familiar, but where we've never quite been through musical art like this.    When you listen to \\"Prairie Wind\\" you're in a way allowing yourself to be painted into the picture that Neil creates with lyrics, while the music lifts and soothes your spirit in tune. With the songs we're allowed to come along with Neil into his lyrical landscapes, and we're able to share in the wondrous mindscape that is \\"Prairie Wind\\".     'Mindscape' isn't a word actually, but shows how the album can affect you personally... the breathtaking imagery arouses memories of my own lifetime that are reflected in how I feel through the songs... portraying the concerns for family happiness, fun and the deep questions that we all feel (\\"When God Made Me\\"). Neil Young and the wonderful band, through their art, have given us the chance once again to enjoy a portrait of one of the greatest musical minds of our lifetime. Buy \\"Prairie Wind\\" and chances are you too will treasure the experience.

Everyone knows that it sucks, but they listen anyway, and soon, they don;t know what music is. So what happened to the music? Man, the clash would probably try to go and take a big crap on these rich posers heads. In conclusion, this is not a band, it's a group of rich losers who sing about their girlfriends dumping them, who know nothing of music, don;t know how to play music, and are a disgrrace to the name of Punk Rock, (which they consider themselves) these guys are anything but punk.<br /><br />PEACE!

B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Some people are complaining that the Remake of The Longest Yard is not funny enough.  But if you're familiar with the original, you know that while there was a lot of comedy, there was also an ample amount of drama as well.  In a refreshing change in a remake, Director Peter Segal who also directed Sandler in \\"50 First Dates\\" and \\"Anger Management\\" decided to stick to the spirit of the original film.  Too often directors of remakes try to put their own stamp on them and end up changing too much of the story, such as with the recent Dawn of the Dead remake.<br /><br />Segal basically runs the show scene for scene from the original with some cosmetic changing of characters.  Caretaker is now a black man (Chris Rock).  The role that Richard Kiel played as Sampson is now played by the behemoth black wrestler Bob Sapp as Switkoski.  The Role of the baddest cat in the joint which was Connie Shokner in the original, is now played by Giant Indian wrestler Dalip Singh as Turley.<br /><br />Other than these character changes, about the only other major change is that less time is devoted to Pau Crewes (Sandler) life in the joint and his interaction with the other prisoners.  The remake dispenses with that aspect and gets right into Crewe having to assemble a team of inmates to give the guards a tune-up game at the insistence of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell).<br /><br />Sandler probably isn't the athlete that Burt Reynolds was.  Reynolds did play college football afterall, but he pulled off his role as quarterback pretty well.  Rock is toned down a bit from his usual manic personality and Nick Turturro provides the comic relief and the butt of most of the jokes as Brucie.<br /><br />The film is loaded with personalities from wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, and Bill Goldberg, to former NFL stars Michael Irvin and Bill Romanowski.  Throw in sports personalities Jim Rome and Chris Berman and you really have an all-star event.<br /><br />The actual football action was pretty well choreographed.  It's easy to spot who were the real athletes and who were the actors, though.  All in all this is a worthy remake that holds up well to the original.all action was pretty well choreographed.  It's easy to spot who were the real athletes and who were the actors, though.  All in all this is a worthy remake that holds up well to the original.
B00005AQF7|4.0|This album is good. It is not great. It is not horrible. This album is good and that is it. The beats on this cd are absolutely amazing. Dr. Dre is and always has been one of the best producers in the game and he shows it here. The only thing that brings this album down is the lack of lyrical content. The whole cd is about drugs, sex, and violence. It easily earned the parental advisory label and I dont think that this is a cd you would play at a family reunion or a Birthday party. Overall, this cd earned the four stars, mainly for the beats and for the occasional great song that Snoop comes up with.  Examples of those songs would be Gin & Juice and Murder Was The Case. <br /> <br />Recommendations  <br />Tupac-All Eyez on Me  <br />Tupac-Me Against The World  <br />Jay-Z-Reasonable Doubt  <br />Mobb Deep-Infamous  <br />Kanye West-College Dropout <br />Kanye West- Late Registration
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is by far the best mix of informative entertainment.  By far not a documentary, but the best way of educating those who can't hack sitting through one.  I do wish some day, a program of equal quality will be released to cover the Soviet side, now that the information pertaining to that era is more obtainable. <br />I will say this series does spark my patriotic fire every time I see my beautiful flag flying up on a rocket, or escorting our brave Americans onto the moon.  If your one to \\"be offended\\" by American patriotism, remember this historical fact: the United States of America landed on the moon, the land of immigrants, making up the best of this world in one nation, in an undertaking of such a grand adventure that only us and the Soviets were willing to do, than I recommend you not see this movie.  Especially if your a canadian or from Portland, OR, left coast, USA.
0446677450|5.0|This book has changed my life dramatically. I am only just starting out on the road to wealth, but I know I am headed in the right direction now. <br /> <br />I know there will be bucketloads of reviews for this book, so all I can say is READ IT! And do not let your ego get in the way when learning new information. The most common response I get from people who I have lent the book to is \\"I already know this stuff\\". My reply is \\"yes, but how much of it are you actually applying in your life?\\". <br /> <br />Everyone should read this book. Young and old.
B000AL730O|3.0|Paul is following his muse here, and while I don't particularly care for all of the morose overtones, I do admire him for stretching out musically. <br /> <br />Yes, it's a bit dull at times, but you know what? If Sting had made this record instead of Paul McCartney, it would be hailed as a classic. Paul just doesn't make mood music, or hasn't until this one. <br /> <br />There is one very obvious thing that would have made this a better record. Paul played all of the intruments, and while he's  capable in most areas, he simply is not a good drummer. Despite the talk that Paul is or was a better drummer than Ringo, he simply wasn't and isn't. This record suffers from the dynamics of a good, syncopated beat, and Paul's monotonous 1-2-3-4, same pitch drumming leaves much to be desired. Some variation would have added a great deal to the songs. <br /> <br />Three stars for Paul. I'm happy he's still making music. At 63, and so much classic stuff, who could blame him if he wanted to hang up his Hofner bass?
B0009MDPYM|4.0|This movie is incredibile, mainly because of the special effects.  The special effects are insanely awesome.  The acting is decent, and Keanu Reeves is a little bit of a jerk to everybody, but he pulls everything off quite nicely.  I absolutely love how he goes to hell to see if Isabelle is down there.  It is incredibly awesome.  You should definetly see this movie, regardless of wether or not it follows the comic book well.
B00000IQBM|5.0|An already edgy alcoholic Jack Nicholson drags his complacent family to a secluded hotel for the entire winter.  Tension between Dad and Mom and Son gets blown out of sane proportion when extreme isolation takes a toll on the already unstable Dad.  The evil spirits of the hotel stir up the fear and anger between Mom and Dad and eventually devours Dad, leaving Mom and Son to escape to an uncertain future.  Boy's psychic powers had him doubt the relocation all together.  His imaginary friend let him know ahead of time the idea was no good.  Film uses supernatural powers as an explanation for childhood disorders like autism.
0307276902|5.0|This outstanding memoir by James Frey's articulating his struggles to put his pathetic , addicted, broken life back together is written with such realness that most addicts can relate to it. One gets awed from the beginning by the author's writing skills as well as the gripping nature of the story. Not only has it so many lessons in it, I also find it inspirational. Like The Oaf in USURPER AND OTHER STORIES, SMASHED, A MILLION LITTLE PIECES easily brings tears, sighs, laughter and phew in different turns.
B000001I0K|4.0|\\"Psychadelic Jungle\\" is slower than the band's first LP \\"Songs the Lord Taught Us\\", but is in many ways sleazier than that album. It projects more of a swampy, drugged-up image of the 50s. And thats what the Cramps are - you're favorite classic Rockabilly artist on too many hits of LSD. The slower tempo makes this album possibly the sleaziest and most intimidating work by the Cramps. There is certainly a high abundance of classic songs on this album, and it contains several of what are the Cramps' best covers (\\"Goo Goo Muck\\", \\"The Crusher\\", \\"The Way I Walk\\"). This and \\"Songs the Lord Taught Us\\" are probably the best places to start with if you're getting into the Cramps. The accompanying EP \\"Gravest Hits\\" is a great collection of cover tunes, each one better than the original. Rockabilly is the purest form of rock 'n' roll there is, and the Cramps are one of the purest rock 'n' roll bands ever.
B000AL730O|1.0|This is not even elevator music, and I don't mean that in a good way either. To think that Sir Paul actually is dragging the name of his former partner as a source of inspiration for this confused clutter  is truly an injustice to Mr. Lennon's memory.  Most of the melodies are disjointed and the lyrics are pedestrian. I could take the time to review each tune, but why bother when they blend together as one unforgettable and regrettable mess.
0060763280|1.0|I can't remember ever reading a book so full of contradiction and nonsense.  This author is so typical of what our society deifies today.  He is also a product of deception, taking advantage of those who are less fortunate, offering magical chants and thoughts that are supposed to turn things around financially for everyone.    I was aghast at how, through the pages, the author essentially calls his readers idiots unless they heed his advice, which is followed every few pages by an ad for his rather expensive seminars.  I was amused at the author's advice for his readers to start saving their loose change, telling them that if they do this, eventually they will become rich.  At one point, the author advises saving just a dollar a month, and tells his readers that they will have $2,048 in one year.  I read this section twice, trying to figure out what kind of math formulas the author was using to figure this out.    The author creates his own religion throughout the book, asking his readers every few pages to place their hands on their hearts and then their heads, and start chanting.    Misleading and deceptive throughout, the author tells his readers that by simply establishing a state of mind, they can become rich.  Later, he contradicts himself by telling his readers that they need to work toward this goal.  At one point, he simply says that if one wants to be rich, he or she should buy real estate.  He gives no plan for someone who has no money to do this, but suggests that everyone do it as much as they can.    The author tells his readers that in order to get rich, they need to invest their money, but doesn't seem to consider those who, as he labels them, are \\"broke.\\"  How does someone with no money invest money?  He insults poor people by writing that the only thing they are is \\"poor!\\"    In the later pages, the author invites his readers to come to a seminar for free along with a companion by bringing the invitation on the page and the proof of purchase for the book.  Again, the author doesn't take into consideration here his primary readership:  the poor, who might be buying the book at a discount on Amazon, eBay or Yahoo or from some other source second-hand.  With no proof-of-purchase at the full price, these readers will not be able to gain access to the seminar.  But here's the main point to observe:  If the author's primary objective is to help poor people get rich, why is he charging them the $19.95 for the book in the first place?  The answer to that is obvious:  To make himself richer by taking advantage of the very people he claims he wants to make rich.    Personally, I didn't pay a cent for this book, and never would!  The ironic thing is that the book was recommended to me in early 2005 by a security guard, who, in late 2005, is still a security guard.    I can go on and on about this author, but we have seen him recycled so many times over, it would be a waste of time.  If you want to be rich, work hard, save your money, and invest wisely.  Reading the words of some charlatan won't do a thing for you except amuse you slightly.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|So bad its funny adaptation of the Comic book Hellblazer is such a multi-car wreck that it's almost too bad to watch.  Keanu Reeves is so bad in the role that he should be a comedian instead of an actor because almost all of his scenes in this film are funny. His deliveries of his lines are so bad that you can come up with better lines before he's able to say the dialog. He demeanor borders on stupidly and he's even upstage by the special effects, which are not very good to begin with.  It also does not help when you have a script that is so unfocused and so badly written that you as a audience member can't suspend disbelief on what is going on right in front of you while you are watching it. It's tries to be a cool version of the Exorcist but ends up being more like John Water's Pink Flamingoes but with out the camp or the humor that movie had. There is a transsexual angel that causes the horrible climax of the movie to happen and a homosexual demon that has a grudge with our dumb hero but by the time we are introduce to him, almost everybody in the audience would have a personal grudge against Keanu character for how bad the movie has turn out.  <br /> <br />Surpassingly, there is some good to be found in this film and that's mainly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, who is so good in this film that you end up wondering on why the movie turn out so bad in the first place.  Weisz is such a strong and talented actor that she even kinds of makes you buy on what is going on with the story but that's a uphill battle even for her great talent to succeed giving the fact that her co-star can't act if his life depended on it and the fact that the screenplay does not do her performance any justice. She's the only rose in this big pile of crap that is worth watching and that's pretty sad considering the fact that if you had a screenplay and a leading man to compliment her performance, this movie would have been much better off that it is now.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My family and I loved this series. It is fun as well as funny. The actors are enjoyable to watch and seem to have great chemistry. We were sad to hear of the series cancellation since we will never get to see how Mr. Whedon would have had his story play out. There is a movie version in theaters on September 30th called \\"Serenity\\". We will definitely be there to enjoy it.
B000AL730O|5.0|I hesitated buying this CD after many other --not dissapointing CD's... but rather-- umimpressive and uninspired CD's. Based on many of the reviews I've read here, I went ahead and gave this new CD a shot, and I am very happy I did. I am not going to go into detail of every song, but my overwhelming feeling about Chaos & Creation is that it's simply not a CD by Paul McCartney, but rather a CD from 1/2 of the writing team of Lennon & McCartney. Make sense??
B000005JA8|5.0|Well... a record that gets negative reviews like \\"kind of like a song about a train wreck being played during an actual train wreck\\" is bound to be interesting in one way or another. This is far better than just interesting. Taking pure free jazz joie-de-vivre, the raw and gritty marrow of the delta blues, the angst and edge of modern art music and making rock out of it is simply a winning concept. Add to that the intelligent, moronic, humorous, evocative, disgusting, beautiful, confusing and positively bulbous lyrics and it might just be the best ever. 28 glorious songs, many of them filled with enough ideas to cover an entire album. (Highly recommended for fans of Tom Waits post 80's material.)
B00005J6UP|4.0|If you (like me) grew up in the 80's, you've probably already seen Goonies (many times!), and don't need to read a review about it. 5 stars for children of the 80's. For us this was a real coming-of-age story, about kids learning independence (and the value of friends and parents, too--what a great reunion scene at the end!), maturity, responsibility, acceptance of others, and doing \\"the right thing\\". Oh, and of course a great adventure too! <br /> <br />If you grew up in the 90's or are still in the process now, the movie of course still has all those things, but it's a little dated and not quite as \\"glamorous\\" and flashy as many movies made today. (But as another reviewer noted, I do believe it holds up pretty well, better than many 80's movies.) Still, it is partly with this in mind that I give it only 4 stars. <br /> <br />The other reason for \\"4\\" instead of \\"5\\" is the inappropriacy of the PG rating. Even as a pre-teen at the time I thought the scene with the nude statue on which a certain piece breaks off and the boys glue it on upside down was too much--I remember being pretty embarrassed sitting next to adult friends in the theater! For those moms and others who've just recently discovered Goonies and this odd rating, you might like to know that, at least if I recall correctly from back then, Goonies is the very movie which led to the creation of the PG-13 rating. It was clearly not an R movie, but was a bit too much for PG, and many unsuspecting moms were pretty upset when they took their 6-year-olds to this movie! So, for those undecided about the movie because of this issue, keep in mind that although the rating is officially PG, the content is absolutely PG-13, and would be rated as such if made today.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Its Opeth here.  What do you expect when you hear an Opeth album?  10 Minute songs? Check.  Great technical compositions? Check.  Insane drumming? Check.  The ability to chain mood and tempo at the drop of a dime? Check.<br /><br />So with that, Opeth delivers what you would expect, but this time it definetely differs in very subtle ways from their previous offerings.  First off, it seems like the tuning on some songs (particularly the Grand Conjuration) is lower than previous albums.  The sound is thicker.  Second, the vocals sound a lot cleaner on this album than ever before.  Whether it be a change in vocal method, or just the different production value, the vocals sound different than previous efforts.<br /><br />Fans fearing that Roadrunner made them produce a \\"mainstream\\" album do not need to fear.  While I'm sure Ghost Reveries will expose Opeth to many many new fans, this is still a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  They are musical geniuses, and they definetely show their skill on this album.
1593072937|1.0|This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. \\"Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless.\\" I say, \\"That is BULLL!!\\" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap!
B000001FTJ|5.0|I can't get over how awesome Tom Waits is. I think he is my generation's Neil Diamond. He writes songs about things I don't understand at all. I be listening to the opening track off this gem and understood the song to be about a war in Bolivia over collard greens. I'm not sure if that is what the song is really about, but his delivery is so silky smooth that you really don't care. He reminds a lot of Josh Groban with his voice. It's very smooth and pleasing. I was on a date with a supermodel from Iowa last week and put this disc on. She got a little mad because she thought she was going to get some love because I put on the mood music. I told her that her love was being delivered later, but to just be quiet and listen to the vocal stylings of the next Bryan Ferry. Weights is one of those artists that it is not cool to like, kind of like telling people you love Mtv now. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I like Tom Weights more than Chris Deburgh at this point. He's still not Josh Groban or Peter Cincinnati, but he certainly won't make you puke when you listen to him. Get this CD because Tom is neato.
B0006L16N8|5.0|After listening to and buying the new X&Y Coldplay Album, I must say that this is their strongest album yet. With soft, sincere lyrics, anyone is bound to enjoy this album in their alone time, or anytime. Coldplay has made me a huge fan.
6305205620|2.0|Sure this movie has a bunch of their songs, but they're all Live in Texas recorded on the same stage. The title completely doesn't go with the movie. I bought this movie because I thought it had live movies of them doing stunts for their movies, and/or some other things (which most of their other movies have) in different places, not a 140 minutes of a live concert on the same stage the whole time. So if you like their S&M movie, you'll probably like this one, too.
B000005Z0E|4.0|I bought 2Pacalypse Now 1 year ago. I think this is not best, but one of the best 2Pac albums (my fav is Makaveli and All Eyez on Me). The best songs in the album are 'I Don't Give a Fu*k', 'Brenda's Got a Baby', 'Rebel of the Underground', 'Trapped' and 'Violence'. 4/5!
B00011D1RC|4.0|What can one say? The acting is terrible, the script a bomb - yet it's one of the best of the old Hollywood \\"star\\" vehicles, and the predecessor of a thousand immitations. Garbo is the dancer who has \\"never been so tired\\" in her life; John Barrymore the good-hearted baron desperate for money who falls in love with her; Lionel Barrymore the dying man splurging on his last go-round; Joan Crawford the stenographer and worldly woman; and Wallace Beery the industrial magnate. Their lives intermingle for one day and night at the Grand Hotel in Berlin, with tragic results for Garbo, John Barrymore, and Beery, and reprieve for Lionel Barrymore and Crawford.<br /><br />The acting (especially Garbo) is so heavy-handed and stiff it's almost a parody of itself, although the lines the actors are forced to speak don't help much. Movie acting, now that sound had been added, hadn't gained the naturalness (unstageyness) yet that would come shortly, and in that regard it's extremely old-fashioned. Beery in his oily role is the most interesting to watch, with Lionel Barrymore a close second. Garbo, though she can be vibrant, even electrifying in her expressions of love and happiness for John Barrymore, would fare much better in later movies. Without a doubt it's a very influential picture, but it's a plush, old dinosaur.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is the CD that showed the greatness that is SoaD.  I wasn't a fan until hearing 'CHop Suey' one night on my way home from work and I was thinking to myself 'who is this awsome band' and then I heard the guy say \\"that's the latest from System of a Down\\" and I went 'what the hell?

0792165020|5.0|When I first saw this movie in late 1999 in the theatres, I was stunned by how beautifully-crafted it was--- and it got great reviews, too.<br /><br />I found it a wonderful period piece, very atmospheric, a real artistic feat.<br /><br />Yet, the industry seem to forget about the film by the time the Oscars rolled around (just 3 months later), the movie's never mentioned anywhere, and it just seemed to be wiped from collective memory almost instantly.<br /><br />Even stranger, it had (and has) an odd anti-fan base that HATE it with a passion.<br /><br />I hate to be snobbish, but was this just too good for mainstream audiences? And is this picture one of those that's going to have to be \\"rediscovered\\" in 20 years as an unsung, forgotten classic?
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Jake Gyllenhaal works masterfuly here as Donnie, a borderline scitsophrenic who sees a disturbing future and talks to some reptilian rabbit who gives him subconsious commands that Donnie in turn acts out.  The subplots are intoxicating and the overall feel of the film is that of paranoia, but it works wonderfully.  As you watch you never know what to expect, you never know whats going to happen, to whome it will happen and when it's going to take place.  The charactors are all played very well from the sister (real life sister Maggie) girlfriend (Malone) and even the [...] town hero (Swayze)...The story of time travel and predestination flow so well here that your almost lost as to what your really believing is real until the final moments of the film.  Everyone here does an amazing job, but the real star here is the script which is so involving and masterfully written that your drawn into the film after the first frame, involving Donnie lying in the middle of the road upon daybreak, and you won't lose interest until half way through the credits, and even then, the soundtrack is pretty good.  This movie is great and recomended to anyone who wants a good mind bending drama.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With over 1600 reviews, I'm not exactly going to be forging new territory here, except to add to the hum of \\"me too\\". If you're reading this then you already know that Firefly was a short lived Western-themed TV sci-fi series... and that this description hardly begins to describe it as a show. <br /> <br />The eternal debate among \\"fanboys\\" is over which show is best. Is it B5 with its story arc? Is it BSG with its relentless darkness? Is it Farscape? Doctor Who? Trek? Blake's 7?  In that debate, Firefly, with a mere 14 episodes, has to be seriously considered. Cut off before it really got going, we'll never really know what the series would have been... but we are left with an amazing mini-series that is eminently watchable. Each episode, in fact, is a nifty piece of television--I'm one of the few that found and watched Firefly in its original run, where the story arc made no sense because the episodes were shown out of order. <br /> <br />There is humor here and there is some poignancy. But what always strikes me is the sense of realism that was forged. The sets and effects are not what I'm talking about: it's the characters. For example, in the (intended) first episode (Serenity), the captain makes a series of decisions that result in the doctor remaining on board. But each of these decisions is utterly real: the captain really would have killed him if one of the other characters had died. And late in the episode he plays a practical joke on the doctor by telling her she's died which is pitch perfect. It is a mark of pure craftsmanship that good writing and characterization runs through every episode. <br /> <br />So I got tired of Tivoing the re-runs on the Sci Fi Channel and ordered up the DVDs. They're nicely packaged and you'll enjoy them many times over. Firefly is a small gem, but a brilliant one.
B000007T1M|5.0|Let it be said that a friend of mine said that this was the worst band to come along, ever, and I have to say that after hearing 'Sugar' the first time and seeing the bizaro of a music video I agreed.  Then I heard 'Toxicity' and was amazed.  I bought the CD and then, upon becomeing an avid SoaD fan I ran out and purchased their debut and I have to say that my friend is an idiot.  This is one of the most original debuts ever, it's brutal and fun and just plain brilliant.  This band is nothing like any other band out there and thats what makes them so freaking amazing.

0060594888|5.0|I love this book and I'm sure I'll be reading it over and over.  Jack Canfield is a wealth of information for personal growth and the steps to take to get you where you want to be.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|A very poppy CD with the girl singers back unfortunately.<br /><br />Sounds more like his early 80s stuff which I found back then to be his worst stuff.<br /><br />I guess Eric can't please everyone but this CD is a real downer.<br /><br />Very little guitar solo's however Erics voice is great.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Some fans of the Batman films will ask \\"Why did we have to wait so so long for these to get the Special Edtion treatment?\\"  Well, that question had been burned into my skull until Warner Bros. released Christopher Nolan's incredible vision of Batman Begins.<br /><br />When I heard that Batman Begins was finally being released, I finally knew that the Special Editions were coming sooner or later.  Being a big fan of Batman, I cannot wait for this set.<br /><br />As far as special features go, I am more excited for the first film than anything.  I remember back in 1989 my mom told me I have to pick one super-hero and that's it.  I'm guessing that she wanted to make it easy on herself when it came to getting me toys, bedsheets, etc.  LOL.  The point is I picked Batman because he's not a super-hero at all.  He's a hero, plain and simple.  No super-powers, just gadgets and an awesome car.  As with the Joker, nobody else could've done it better than Jack Nicholson.  Superb.  I fell in love with the first film and have never seen any kind of making-of documentaries or anything.<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\" is also a great film too.  Batman belongs on the gothic side of things.  I mean, it is set in GOTHam City.  That is what Tim Burton did so well with this one.  Made it darker, like it should be.  Catwoman is probably my favorite villain of all and Michelle Pfeiffer pulled it off fantastically.  I'm really looking forward for the special features of this film too.<br /><br />Then 1995 came along and \\"Batman Forever\\" flooded theater screens.  It's not my favorite of the Batman films but it was the one I was most excited for.  Jim Carrey IS The Riddler.  I would like anyone to prove me wrong.  I was somewhat dissapointed that Michael Keaton didn't come back but I don't blame him.  Val Kilmer was good anyway.<br /><br />So, Joel Schumacher is a fantastic director with great movies under his belt like \\"The Lost Boys\\", \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera\\".  1997 was the year where practically in the blink of an eye, \\"Batman & Robin came and went.  Because of the success of \\"Batman Forever\\", the hype was unbelieveable for this film.  However, Schumacher was able to take a franchise and give it corny lines, bad acting and bad....you know what?  Let's just leave it at that.  Thank god for Christopher Nolan reviving the series in a different light.<br /><br />Overall, this set looks amazing.  Even though Batman & Robin was somewhat horrible, I will check out every little special feature in this set till the batteries in my remote goes dry.  The commentaries will be great and the making-of featurettes look interesting.  I haven't even held the box and I'm getting chills just thinking about it.  I highly, highly recommend this set for anyone who is a fan of Batman.ctically in the blink of an eye, \\"Batman & Robin came and went.

B00005PJ8O|4.0|The version of the movie on VHS and on DVD differs from the theatre release in an important respect: the one complete battle scene shown (in north Africa).  The version of the battle in the original movie was designed to show Patton's skill as a field commander, and it illustrated perfectly the tactic which Patton called, \\"Hold him by the nose and kick him in the butt.\\"  This tactic was actually invented by Themistocles in the battle of Salamis in the second Greek war against the Persians.  It involves faking a frontal assault, then faking a rapid retreat to lure to enemy into a careless attack, then launching a surprise attack on the enemy from the side.  Each step of this tactic was illustrated in the movie: Patton's tanks attacked, then stopped and rapidly pulled back.  Seeing that, the Germans rushed forward full speed, not seeing Bradley laying behind a bank on the side.  Bradley then attacked.  Patton's tanks stopped and rushed forward again in attack.  The Germans were being hit from two sides, an untenable position.  They were severely damaged and those that remained retreated.   <br /> <br />Obviously, some later film editor was afraid the public would regard it as cowardice for the American tanks to stop and pull back as though running away.  This editor completely butchered the battle scene until all you have is a mishmash of explosions, cannons firing, etc.   <br /> <br />It is too bad that filmmakers and editors think the American public is so stupid that they won't be able to follow the logic of this classic battle tactic.  As far as I know, at the time the film was released, no one mistook the import of this scene.   <br />
0425107469|5.0|I have read hundreds (no probably thousands) of books (including all of Dean Koontz and Stephen King) and I never ever get caught up in writing reviews about anything.  But having just re-read Watchers for about the 15th time I cant help it I have to tell everyone to read it.  I love this book, it makes me cry, makes me laugh and it has to be the best book I have ever read - and I just know that you will love it too.   I wont go through the story you can read that on any of the other reviews just believe me if you can get a copy read it.  An absolutely fantastic, superb, brilliantly written gem of a book not to be missed by anyone young or old. <br />

0805076476|1.0|Fight Club is a classic example of the pop-culture trash that passes as post-modernist literature. Chuck Palahniuk is so deliberately post-modernist that the book becomes (as do many of his novels) almost clich. As the forerunner to a screenplay, the book is brilliantly crafted, yet as a novel its structure falls entirely apart. The characters are neither believable nor, frankly, likable and the plot (especially the ending) is flat-out silly. Ironically, the single skill that the author masters is irony itself and yet some of it appears to be quote unintentional. He rails against the modern consumer culture, yet he is the ultimate marketer of his own work. (This is evidenced ten-fold by attending one of his nonsensical book signings in which he panders to the crowd by using props such as fake blood and limbs.) Unfortunately, Mr. Palahniuk is far more adept at marketing than he is at writing and Fight Club is the pathetic result. The best I can say of this novel is that it is a relief from the current onslaught of \\"chick lit\\", character-driven novels of deep introspection. But it is not a pleasant break at all. This novel is dreadful at best.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Let's just get down to the basics.  Simply enough, if you are familiar with Fall Out Boy or The Academy Is..., then you will know what to expect as for how the lead singer sounds.  He has a very similar voice, and this music is kind of like a dance rock genre.  It is definitely something you can get down to, and really enjoy.  I find it to be very upbeat tempo wise, and the lyrics attribute to what you find from an \\"emo\\" style.  Since this is what I like, I highly praise this album.  Tracks 2, 6, 7, and 10 are absolutely amazing and catchy.  I'd basically say this:  If you love Fall Out Boy or The Academy Is..., and you want something that you will be singing and loving for awhile, then this is where it is at.
0790737345|4.0|As I watched the movie, it struck me how close the plot of the movie came to the Hindu Dvaita philosophy where the Angels are referred to as Nithya Soorigal...those who have attained Godliness- can witness God, but can never become one with Him. <br /> Inspirational....
0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked this way comes starts out as a book about two boys named Will and Jim. Jim always gets into trouble for not thinking but acting while Will usaully thinks and avoids things. This book is a mystery that will have you on your seat reluctant to put it down. The beginning scenerio is that there is a man who sells lightning rods walking down the street and there is about to be a storm. The man offers Jim one. This is the first time you see Jim's ignorance and Will's insight. Jim thinks it would be cool to have your house hit by lightning while Will is convinced that it would not be worth taking the risk. Soon the boys are in the midst of a carnival that claims the merry go round is broken when infact it runs backwards. They see a man on the merry go round get younger as it goes around. This sets the novel up for a great mystery and plot. The first thing that will catch your eye will be that you are constantly trying to figure this novel out, if you skip one scene or one page you may be confused for the rest of the book. Overall I beleive this book would be good to recomend to anyone looking for a very good mystery novel with good themes and a good plot.
