B009KG64F0|5|Paid a more than reasonable price for this costume which included the dress, choker, and headband with feather. Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a plus size costume !
B00BMZ5YR6|5|Every guy needs these!
B00EEDL0KS|2|Too small, returning.  Like the style and quality but does not fit.  Why no larger sizes available?  would like if larger
B008YK50ZS|5|Bought this for my girlfriend and she wore it the other night<br />It was silky smooth and she loved wearing my colors
B00CF04ZQS|5|This scarf has buttons so you can attach it in a variety of ways when you wear it, was an additional feature I didn't know about but a pleasant surprise, would purchase scarves from this seller again.
B00E414MEG|5|Part of a birthday gift -- perfect fit and perfect fabric!
B00E4ACRVC|5|Outstanding
B00J49ORC0|5|This mask is amazing truly the best mask you can get for the Friday the 13th series, the materiel used is strong and i plan on using it for years to scare my neighborhood , the only thing i did not like was that the dirt paint job on mine was too dark so i couldn't see the red stripes on the mask too clearly but other then that the best mask i have ever owned, i recommend this to anyone its just so good i swear they could have used this in the actual movies.
B001618J5U|5|They are nice style an good fit. Works with shoes or boots. She said comfortable and a nice shade blue.
B00RE88GS4|1|Not a dress
B0026GOODU|5|High quality patch!
B00JXOPQQM|3|Thin and fit in an odd way on the crotch area, which makes them look weird.
B00D625NSS|5|This is a super sexy skirt! It fits pretty nicely, not too big but still roomy. I got an XL (normally a size 14) and the L may have fit a little more snugly in a good way, so if you're in-between you may want to go for the smaller size. Feels great too the material is very nice. As some others have said, the only downside is the lack of a hem along the bottom which would have looked a little nicer. Besides that though it's great!
B003M8HO1U|5|This jacket is stunning, especially at the great price that I got it for.  It is true to size, very warm and cozy feeling.  It has a an inside pocket and also a cell phone pocket on the inside.  The faux fur hood can be removed by zipping it off.  I am not sure why the description says \\"semi- fitted\\" because it is actually roomy, which I love.  This is going to be an everyday'r for me.  I am happy with this \\"Quality buy\\", Oh the only thing is the arms are a little short, but I have long arms so, the sleeves are just above my wrist bone about 1-2 inches.
B0076415UW|5|Nice product. Coolest of colors.  Happy with the product.
B00H7IKEY0|5|I really like these undies and treat myself to several pairs each year.  The undies are comfortable and never show under fitted jeans, dresses or exercise pants.  They hold up well in the wash if line dried.  I will not wear anything else so please, please continue to make this style.<br /><br />Judy Johnston
B00I5U88QK|5|runs a little small but i ordered a size up in case, it will work perfect for a summer outfit
B00NWA09VA|4|It is a very stylish jacket  well as keeps you warm in about 45 to 50 degree weather.  The button on the side of the coat that hooks to the back only had one little piece of thread that held it together. Which is an easy fit. I have gotten a lot of compliments. I recommend it.
B00ARHJTHG|5|I can't believe I'm writing a review on socks. But these things are awesome and I've reordered. Even had a few friends ask about them when we stayed at their place on vacation and they ended up ordering them. 5 stars!
B001PU9A9Q|5|The best silicone nipple that I ever used! The color is perfect. The adhesive is great. And provide a good support for breasts.
B006LHN0NA|4|muy cómodos lo malo es que la talla M es algo grande parece mas bien talla L el modelo es sencillo y casual
B001RLBGNG|4|this was given as a Christmas present, they are socks nothing really to get excited about. Son in law like them.
B00ES83OK8|5|Ordered the purple in the size recommended and the size I usually order for PattyB's items of this style.  While it generally fit, the bands that criss-cross across the chest were not positioned nor wide enough to allow for my DD's.  Have to return.  I did not take a star off for this because this is not everyone's problem; in this instance, my problem.
B007UM6OZ6|4|Got these in the other day (Amazon's shipping is amazing as usual).  Could not wait to try them on.  I'm definately curvy and just lost 45 pounds so I wasn't sure what to expect as it's been sooooo long since I've ordered anything outside of the Plus Size stores.  I ordered the size based on the measurements I took and I was extremely happy to say these were a little big on me, but still wearable with a belt.  I pant length was medium (no other options) and they were way to long, but with my boots/heels, they were fine.  I do have a small waist so these still had the gap in the back, but nothing a belt can't fix.  They were comfy, and I felt sexy in them.  Got online before I took them off and ordered another pair in a size smaller and then another pair in a different color.  Can't wait for them to arrive tomorrow.
B00422MCVM|5|I am very pleased with this passcase. Excellent for the price. Nice building and lot of space for my cards and documents.
B008BRZ108|5|Really soft
B000B892YQ|4|Nice pants,very satisfied with the company and their delivery,same pants in my area(Miami)costs $27 and up.
B00E4N9WMQ|5|Awesome backpack!!  I get compliments on this all the time!!  The front pocket compartments could have been better made but the overall look of the backpack is great!!
B00IOAX3YS|4|I can use this as a cover up
B00B3W89Y8|5|I was looking for pads for sports bras (that have the triangle inserts) and these worked great.  Gives a little lift and adds a tad of fullness.  Perfectly met my needs.
B0055WQNL8|3|The tights are colorful and thick but they run very large.
B00L4APABE|5|These are the cutest socks ever! They are knee socks and they are of good quality...not very thick (which I like) but very comfortable.
B00LCJ1MHS|5|I liked them. Perfect joggers for that price..<br /><br />I wish lint wouldn't stick so much to the black joggers tho...
B002PXTDGM|2|I did not like the look or construction of the earrings. I did not use.
B00H9YT286|5|I bought these for my teenage daughter. Knee high socks seem to be all the rage with teens right now and the more colorful the better. So a nice mix mash of color and The Walking Dead were a perfect recipe for a delightful teenage squeal. These socks are also well made which is a plus.
B004SUGTA8|2|Easy to clean, but gave my son blisters. Not very soft. The white paint on the toe came off quickly.
B00EK8LCB4|4|Cheaper on ebay ... I bought this one as a gift and she loves it. But I did find the exact same shirt for less than $3 to the door (from China) on ebay. It's the same quality, too. But it's a cute shirt and even for $10 it's a good deal. I am a size 8 with a 34DD chest, and the medium fits nicely. It's not loose, so if you'd like it looser, order up a size.
B00188UDKU|5|Good price. As advertised.  Got here on time. I would/will buy here again the next time I need this item.
B00IP175X6|5|I wore this for my brothers wedding, wow, for the price and quality it was a great deal. Great fit, flattering cut. Got plenty of compliments, classic style and cut. Loved it!!!! It arrived on time and service was great from the seller!
B00H7SJWPC|3|This dress is made with great feeling fabric, I truly love the feel of this dress, however it does run slightly smaller in the chest area...be careful things may fall out!! :-)  Yet, I intend to keep it, I've never owned a wrap dress....I will be purchasing additional dresses, yet in a one size bigger…
B00KYUFF24|2|It has been shedding since I bought it. I doesn't stop.
B00A011XDM|5|This is my third pair of Coolibar pants. They are the most comfortable casual pants I've ever worn. I own a black pair that traveled well during my trip to Italy last year. I was able to wash them in the sink, hang them up to dry early in the day and wear them late the next day. The only drawback is that they don't have a pocket.
B00DWV1382|5|So cute. good quality and fit as I expected. looks great with her high tops or flats.  Dress up or down these are a great pair of pants to have.
B007PEHVWE|4|Great socki But for a 15-20 its as hard to get on as the 20-30mm.  But well worth the price.
B00K5ZYSMQ|3|Nice lightweight jacket.  The only complaint is the zippers (fronth and pockets) sticks in material if your not careful.
B000U527Y2|5|This t-shirt fits true-to-size (rare to find that anymore). It did, however, shrink a bit (even in cold water) after washing. Material is very soft (nice!). Image is subtle, words very clear. Overall: one of the best t-shirts I've purchased.
B00D2WDFSW|5|Nice tee shirt.
B009FROH2G|4|I have always been a bargain hunter, and when it was time to buy new suits for work, I was no different in my approach.  I work as a banquet manager, so I am constantly setting rooms, rolling out buffets, organizing storages, etc.  I refuse to spend tons of money on suits that will just get destroyed eventually, so I found these Salvatore Exte suits at a great price point.  Reviews were all decent so I tried one.<br /><br />The material feels nice, not cheap.  The cut is good, not too slim but not baggy or loose.  The pants are nice in this set also, with the inner lining 3/4 length.  All you have to do is have a seamster hem the legs and you are all set to go!<br /><br />So far I have gotten 2 bad suits, but returns are free so I shipped them back.  Kind of a pain, but once you get a good one, the value is worth it.
B00RXJVZJQ|2|these are not magnetic stays I can not recall if it states that in the profile.
B00EDT4GYA|5|This a great costume!  It is great quality and I love it!  i would order from this company again.
B0046COT0K|5|love it
B00Q6SIQP6|4|The hat was to small.
B0051U18NW|5|Bought these for my husband and he loves them a lot! hey are a perfect fit and wear really well.
B0076IXVNM|5|i wear this dress all the time and even though its strapless it stays on and doesn't shift and slide off and looks so cute on
B0018OOV34|3|not bad
B00AXIVFM6|5|This is the best slicker and also a great price too.  It also folds into the pocket for traveling.  I got this for my husband because his rain slicker ripped.  Most rain slickers you find are ones that are shorter.  This comes just at the top of his thighs so it keeps him dryer.  So happy I got this for him.
B007VQNFNK|5|Perfect material, fit, weight, and color!  My husband loves them.  It is really difficult to find grey over the calf tube socks, the stores only stock white now.  This was a great find!!
B00WFI5ZAK|5|Love this outfit
B007WA4CZK|1|Never wore it. Doesn't look anything like the picture when you put it on. The belt is cheap looking too. Guess I really did get what I paid for.
B00N27XWBC|5|Good quality, nice looking belt. Perfect length.
B003N18GZ4|4|My husband and I purchased several of these tie clips for wedding favors to all the groomsmen in our party.  They came quickly in cute little boxes that were nice to wrap up, and the clip itself was very chic and clean.
B006PGGJOE|2|Could not contain more than a dozen American bills... if someone gave me $1 bills for change, then it won't fit.
B0057X9O70|2|Not a bad shirt but no where the feeling of substance and quality that y0u get from Carhartt.<br />You get what you pay for
B00FRKJITM|3|Excellent quality, great-looking sweater, warm.  Fits well for someone with a tall & athletic or slim (northern European) type of build, with long arms but not a huge belly.  Think soccer player or track athlete, not an American football lineman. I am 6' .5&#34; tall 215lbs and wear a size 16.5&#34; neck 35 or 36&#34; sleeve and the XL out of the package is just a hair big for me, but the L would probably be a bit tight.  The neck hole is fairly snug, so if you're George Costanza (big head, short stocky neck) the crew neck style is NOT for you.  **UPDATE** Into season 2 and all of these are starting to get little holes from wool separation.
B004157VMA|3|The custume is really good, but the size won't fit my kid, it's smaller than posted in the web, but it's ok.
B00U5TFBP0|1|Okay, so firstly.<br />They sent me the wrong swimsuit! I ordered a white, v necked tassle bikini, and they sent me a strapless one...<br />&#34;This isnt so bad, maybe it will look okay&#34; it was horrible. I thought even if the top didnt work out, the bottoms are the same, but even the bottoms were a huge disappointment. There is literally NO elastic, they dont stretch at all. They are just cloth cut out into bikini bottom shape, with holes in the sides. Nothing like the slits on the hips in the picture. Also, they were ripped along one of the seams. I feel like I just bought something sewn together by a kid at a craft show.<br /><br />Secondly, I tried on the top. It slipped down as soon as I took 2 steps. If I had actually gone swimming in it the entire beach wouldve gotten a show. It looked terrible, the lack of elastic (especially on the bottoms) made it look like I was barely squeezing into the suit, and I'm pretty skinny.<br /><br />Thirdly, the fabric is see through. I could put my fingers behind it and see them perfectly. Nothing more to be said about that.<br /><br />For the price, I was expecting to get something cheap. I was hoping it would at least fit, and look okay, and maybe last a couple uses. This was the biggest online purchase disappointment I've ever had.
B00KZ1DZ42|4|Ordered xl and they fit really small !
B00TG8BCM2|5|The bathing suit is perfecto! Which means in Spanish it's perfect!. The quality is how I like it..it doesn't look cheap and it fits me good! I'm a thick chick and it shows my curves like nothing before. I have no boobs but a big booty and it all maintains together as one. The shipping came before the estimated date and I was so surprised when it came at my door. Thank you amazon for the amazing results! Definitely recommend it! 10-10 perfect
B00OH6MGL4|3|Just wish they had bigger sizes than they do these really run small. But my kid still lives them
B0006L51IY|5|I have a number of these tops. They feel comfortable on, and are perfect under sweaters to keep you warm!
B00JPEOZXA|5|Will  IT AGAIN OTH COLOR HAS BEAUTIFUL.
B00091RC1U|4|Pretty decent shirt.  It says &#34;work shirt&#34;, but it's not coarse looking.
B001FWIEFU|5|I gave these to my Mom off her wish list and she was thrilled -- there are three, which was a surprise that look absolutely beautiful together or separately.  She just loves them. A great buy for anyone looking to get in on the scarf trend right now.
B00752TT9O|2|I was really disappointing about this tee, a bought cause a feel that Volcom is a excellent brand, but i have to say that the color is ungraceful, but the principal issue was the size, i bough a large size but this feel like a XXL size!
B0007VDN2O|5|All i can say is perfect. I have a 7 1/4 head size and ended up getting a medium; this baby fit snug.
B00LH1DNIW|5|These were a gift for my son-in-law.  He loved them.
B00KDXS0LA|1|Although large is the size my son wears but this jacket came out to be way too large
B004KW89IO|5|I abolutely love these earmuffs. They fit comforably around me and keep my ears warm and protected from wind and up to 8 degrees winter weather.
B007TDBZDC|1|I tried this dress out for nursing, not as a maternity dress.  The mauve color was lovely, but it was extremely wide and extremely short. I'm 5'6&#34; and have an average build so I tried this in a medium.  It really fit more like a top than a dress.  My guess is that it's much cuter on a pregnant belly than on a post pregnant  body...or on an extremely thin figure...maybe.
B00I8EH0V2|4|I like these - they would fit better under a suit without the ruffles, but they are cute, functional and sleek.  I like the snaps down the side for easy removal.  I wish it had snaps on both sides, but I also think the snaps leave more room for leaks.  They are snug if you buy the right size.  I got 2 sizes (medium and large), and while large was looser, I feel like medium is what is needed to do what the product is designed to do.
B00WO1I55A|5|This dress is gorgeous ,its very sexy and i love it! It does fit a little snug in my bust and the sleeves are a little snug but over all its very nice ,my bust is 39 total inches im a 34d 27 ,36 ,i do recommend one size up
B00LD45WFK|5|My second one, I lost the first.
B00N0PGI44|5|Item as described. Shipping was quick!
B007S69F2S|5|I absolutely love this wallet. It holds all of my membership cards, ID's, receipts, change, check book, a pen, my cash, and can even stretch a little and hold my Samsung Galaxy S5 -- and still zip up! I love that it is vegan, and completely biodegradable. I also love the old worldly feel of the design with the map and all. I just love this wallet overall! I am pretty rough on my wallets, have had this for almost a month and it still looks just like when I got it in the mail. Very durable and spacious!
B00EB13DPI|3|These have a good fit. I ordered a size down based on reviews and this worked well. I am not sure about the material.... they are somewhat cute but the material has a cheap look to it. I was expecting more of a jean material look.
B00QPMLLOG|5|This Power Rangers T-shirt fits me perfectly and it looks good on me. Last Saturday, I wore this T-shirt to respect the new television show called Power Rangers Dino Charge (or PRDC) due-to my long-time fandom/love for Power Rangers and Super SentaI.
B00R6UU9WG|5|My Granddaughter loves these gloves, they keep her hands warm and dry
B0037J32OW|5|These are great brand. I buy for my husband to work in. He workings in the food industry. They are well made and last a long time after washing the five pairs he has once a week!
B000LNHHSY|5|For $5, this is an outstanding wig. For $20, this would still be an outstanding wig. I couldn't have been happier with the purchase. It's a steal!!
B00QRFOQ84|5|Love this shirt.  I have a few and use them to layer as I am always cold.
B006ZQQ606|5|it fit beautiful, the lenght was right the V in the back and front was perfect nothing would be showing
B00BKRNHM0|4|I really like this dress. Make sure you stay true to the size chart. The only fall back is the small packaging, but for the price it is worth having to iron the dress.
B006P2OU26|5|Got this tie for my boyfriend, we're both huge fans of the show. He works in politics and gets compliments from people all the time!
B005444DUK|5|Wearing it now actually...probably not as you read this, but as when I received the email asking me about it....because it could be the year 2055 right now as you read this and I probably won't have this shirt anymore.
B00S9M9K7A|2|If you're tall..it pulls oddly.
B00JHCLKNS|4|Well made
B0013LKT1U|5|Great quality pants! I always buy this brand and they last a long time. Fits perfectly and the expandable waste band is a plus too.
B0084J4BHC|5|What you see is what you get - the picture is a pretty good representation of the actual product. Simple and solid.
B006RTVUNY|5|This is a good political pin for any Ron Paul supporter.  These little pins are a great way to show off your views and are excellent conversation starters too!
B00H899UX4|5|soft, nice Tee for a Florida Georgia Line FAN
B00MXISBF8|5|Good fit. Very comfortable.
B00EYNHU3Y|5|Love the material and the fit. So luxurious.
B00I3YNQNI|5|I totally love this dress! The fabric is good and its super flattering. I normally wear a size 16/18 dress and i bought the 3x and it fits good
B005MXHQXO|5|Excellent and quality fabrication.  Very few loose threads.
B00118VHF2|5|My husband has a bad back but loves to wear jeans.  I had been looking for &#34;elastic&#34; waist jeans for him.  We just received them and they fit perfectly.  He is a 29&#34; seam and it is hard to find them in jeans.  Haggar has 29 and THEY ARE PERFECT and look great.  We ordered 2 pairs and right out of the package they showed no wrinkles.  Love them
B00LQL0TXA|4|I bought this coat because I am tired of the bulky look of parkas with nicer clothes, but I wanted to be warm, and it had good reviews. It seems pretty true to size, and I like the design of the shoulders and sleeves, which leave room to wear a light jacket or fairly bulky sweater underneath and still be able to move around but doesn't make you look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. The fabric feels soft to the touch, but my only (very minor) problems are that the collar is kind of itchy on a bare neck and the pocket flaps stick out and make you look like a duckling ready to take off. This I solved easily by stitching the open side of the flap down; it doesn't interfere with putting your hands in your pockets as the flaps are only decorative.
B000PQGAU8|5|This cap is exactly as pictured. It looks good, is made of nice cloth, and it is large enough to fit a relatively large noggin. I am extremely happy.
B003NX8CPQ|3|This may depend on what you are looking for, but I found this jacket very thick, thus adding bulk.  I wear a fleece in the spring and fall.  I like it to be warm, but it doesn't replace a winter coat for me.  I just thought this was too bulky looking.  Thanks to Amazon for free returns on clothes!
B00MGFC802|4|I bought this sweater thinking it would be a cheap print of the dino. It is not. The dino is knit in with the sweater and is very cute. My son is wearing it right now!
B008I6V2XW|5|This skirt is so flattering  and goes well with a simple  t-shirt.
B005CSOC86|5|Love my new zip up.  Its Alot lighter material then it looks.  Will Def buy a couple more just to have. It makes you appear slightly thinner. I am very petite and the length comes right to my hips.  I am under 5 foot  if I were any taller I don't think I would wear this.
B00246GB5Q|5|The picture does not show how bright the top is. I wear it with a pair of black pants and the kids call me the bumble bee.  It is well made and looks good.
B003AX16KC|5|Super Nice Key Fob. I had the old 100th Anniversary one for many years, and after repairing it many times (because it was wearing out) I finally had to retire it. This is a nice replacement!!
B00IN8J7P0|1|I got into this romper and thought I would have to go to the ER to get out of it. OMG. Not good fit at all. I have to give it away now. :-(
B00UWNQXMO|2|Nice bra. Way way way too tight fitting.
B00CC2K0OA|1|The product does work the sizing is all wrong it runs entirely too SMall
B0086L8APW|5|Love these jeans. They are a similar to the 511 style but a little looser around the thigh area. These jeans are always true to size as with the 511 jeans change all of the time. Highly recommend guys
B00ECTUQDQ|3|was okay
B00Y3OVS9Q|4|Fits good
B000VERNA0|5|I am thrilled that I was able to find these jeans. I have been wearing this brand for a number of years and can no longer find them locally. So,please when will you have more?
B005WDQHK2|5|I mean it. Buy these!  I ordered 5, one was the wrong size and I gave it to my grandson.  Material is good, it fits, I'm a big guy at over 6' 2&#34; 250 lbs, and I'm disabled, so I have a hard time with complicated knots like a bow tie.  These make it easy but aren't cheesy like a clip on tie.  Colors I ordered were well represented by the picture.  Compared them to a standard size bow tie and the size is relatively the same.  I am tired of the everyday long tie look, and the fact they catch everything that I drop from eating (I'm not messy really).  Bow ties are coming back in style, but right now why wait to be ordinary.
B00GH0BLNM|5|This vintage inspired polka dot dress is the bomb! I bought it for my daughter to wear with a fairly pouffy white crinoline underneath for her senior portraits, however, she has worn it on several other occasions ranging from a Choir concert to a formal district music competition. It looks great with nude hose, black flats and a high ponytail! She has received so many compliments on the style and vintage look of the dress. Very rockabilly and the quality is very, very good.
B00IQG87AU|5|Well worth the 6$ I was impressed by the fit and quality seen as how I wasn't expecting that great of a suit because of the cheap price. However, it took a while to arrive.
B0002TOTL0|4|Good!
B00BOXT37I|5|I love this shirt.  It fits me really well, and even though it's billowy it still is fitting in some places...so incredibly flattering.  I just had a baby and have felt a little self-conscious in workout clothes, but this is great.  Glitter has held up through three washes already...still glittery, still looking good.  I love the off-the-shoulder cut of this shirt.  I get lots of compliments on it from people of all ages.  I'm glad I bought it!  It's thin but not really see-through, so I wear it over a sports-tank and I'm good to go.
B00U7WB2X0|5|One word.....perfect
B004GHP4Q8|5|Very comfortable and warm
B008AQDWT2|5|Fits good and comfortable vest glad I got x-tra large cause its seems to run small.Would recomend buying one size up .
B00JRNWJTQ|5|Nice dress.  Very lightweight.  Good deal.
B00DZNBI64|4|Accurate, but too small
B00BZA98FW|5|These are super cute and arrive very quickly! Definitely a recommended buy!!!
B009NEGLUC|5|Got these as a gift from my hubby.  Had previously looked at them,  but wasn't sure since sometimes skinny jeans are made in such a way that makes you go up severals sizes even if you're a slender gal like myself. Oh,  and if you have ample butt like me (laughs) these will definitely work for you.
B008M4UO2U|5|I love it<br /> great valI love it<br /> great value ue I love it<br /> great value I love it<br /> great value I love it<br /> great value
B00JLR62U0|4|It's a nice blouse....I just think that it was too pricey for the style but I am ok with it.
B009BR8TYC|5|Great hat!
B00KL8RYVY|5|I really am happy with my t-shirt.  I purchased the XX Large but could have ordered the X large.  I will keep it.
B000MND7HS|4|it hides my leg fat flaps without being too loose in the leg
B00A9VBXAG|5|looks good. Feels good..Warm.  A bargain.
B00G58B7W6|5|The swim suit was so cute.  My kid is flat footed and so obviously the sandals didn't fit, but I never expected them too.
B00MHYIUKY|2|This skirt ran smaller than I had anticipated and was much shorter than I had expected. I thought this would be a floor length maxi skirt on my 5'1&#34; frame but it was a few inches above my ankles.
B00O7WFIHC|5|LOVE this cap! I have gotten so many compliments on it!
B007FDSWQO|4|I bought this for my girlfriend after months of her asking for one. Let me tell you she loves this thing, but she looks silly in it. It is outrageously large for a small, but I get it there are some short, big boned people out there. In any case I'm happy with my purchase, she loves it and I love her.
B00HAV6HDQ|5|Although the product was smaller than I expected (the description said the material was very stretchy, so I got a smaller size than I should have), the material itself was still very soft and comfortable!! It was also a great deal; I looked EVERYWHERE for a bodysuit before I found this one, and the others that I came across were much more pricey than this one.<br /><br />Additionally, when I contacted the owner/company about my sizing issues, they were more than happy to switch out my bodysuit for the next size up! Can't beat great customer service. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase!
B008DSL0UA|5|this fits perfectly, I got a medium, I'm 5&#34;2 and 123 this shirt! Very cute!
B002EX88KK|4|Great wig for mad scientist costume.
B004ZGBXUQ|5|excelente, era el producto que se quería tal cual como lo indica el producto 100% recomendable muy bueno cumplen y a tiempo
B00368CLAK|5|One of the best sports bra I have purchased. The fabric doesn't have too much stretch so it stays in its place firmly and does not hurt or press uncomfortably.
B002RZAR4U|1|dont buy it you can pick up for next to nothing at the dollar stores
B00N0R096U|5|I love these pants. Get many compliments!
B00CNV78GS|5|Have to disagree with other reviewer. Love everything about this shirt! The quality & fit are spot on. Husband gets tons of compliments every time he wears it!
B008DI0P9W|4|love it...now if only there was a way to prevent the tangles lol
B0042UDZ60|3|This shirt came on time and the quality was nice but I was expecting a black shirt. It was more greyish-brown to me. Would have preferred it  look like the picture. Nothing I could really do about it because it was a Christmas present which I myself had to turn around and ship. I was out of time. Don't think I'll be ordering T shirts again online. The price of the shirt was reasonable but then you have to add the shipping. I ordered two shirts they were from two different vendors, you guessed it two shipping costs. This made the reasonable shirts kind of expensive coupled with the fact I wasn't thrilled with them. .
B008AWYYGQ|5|Dockers always look nice.
B00IPOA4YU|1|These compression socks would not stay up, kept sliding down.  Not satisfied at all
B009WQWTUW|1|literally I received a TOTALLY different dress. Like not even similar other than that it was black.
B00HWFCMEI|5|I love these capri's!!  The fit is nice, they are soft and not constricting.  I wear them for walking, working outside and just lounging in.  Very comfortable!
B00HUZQ4RQ|5|Perfect fit
B00M8Z7I4G|5|A bit longer than expected but very comfortable. They washed beautifully.
B000M9LQ3O|5|These pants are extremely fantastic asthey are super duper comfy and allow me to run and such perfectly.  Would recommend :D
B00EVLVIUA|4|Good for sleeping or for non-impact exercise.  I were this when I'm out power walking with the dog in the morning, or when I'm canoeing or kayaking. It is comfortable and provides moderate coverage when wearing t-shirts or tanks.  I would not wear this if I were doing high-impact sports, such as tennis or running, as it does not give much support. Both have held up well with repeted washings - I've probably washed them about 20 times since I bought these a year ago.
B005N7Z1PE|4|Size 2 too large! I wear Medium size normally or size 4/6.<br />Thought it was the number for myself but it isn't... Too wide!<br />But great fabric! The silicone made all the difference comparing to other brands.
B001CCJHB8|5|Very happy all around.
B00J7EYUME|4|I liked the dress but sent it back because I had ordered two dresses and did not need them both. This was very nice but the zipper was a little awkward. You have to be careful when zipping so the fabric and/or sequin's do not get caught. Very nice dress, but I preferred the other I ordered.
B00H01T19S|5|I love this hat! I wear it so much that I believe it is permanently attached to my head. About the fit/size. I am in a bit in between sizes. Large is too loose and S/M can be bit tricky until the hat breaks in. But I wear S/M (snug for biking and moving around, but not painfully tight). I got this one in S/M and feels like it fits tru! Also, the texture and the slick pattern hides dirt and nastyness pretty good. I am getting a second one for sure!
B00284B5S2|5|Used this as a compression garment after surgery. It's a very firm control, so it was a very tight fit and I had to do some work to get it on, but it's totally worth it.
B008S9A12C|5|Almost a good as the versions purchased 30 years ago.  Wish they would make a 28&#34; inseam again.  Totally happy with purchase of one size larger then normal size.
B00E2V214G|1|This is not one size fits all. I'm a size 6 female and the shoulders just bunch up and won't lay flat. It would probably fit better on a busy person over 180 lbs.
B00551PZJU|5|This is my favorite bra...it is padded well, so your nipples don't show through your tops, even through a clingy t-shirt, and it provides plenty of support without any underwires slicing into you.  I hope they continue making this style.  It's the best!!
B00LIV1OMS|5|My baby was the princess of the party with this dress. Looks very fancy, really beautiful and very well made. It looks very expensive. I put it on her for a wedding, everyone loved the dress. It was better than I expected.
B005KKB4SW|5|Fits my Omega Seamaster perfectly, and I didn't realize how much I'd love a band like this.  Highly recommended.  Oh, and accurate colors for a Bond watch strap. :)
B00A2Y1VXY|5|nice length -- I'm 5'7&#34;, and regular pants are often a bit short while tall pants are a bit long. These are just right for in between me. The weight is nice. They're not see-through. I haven't seen how they hold up for multiple washing yet.
B00ED9P3GK|4|I really like the coat.  It is not heavy or bulky.
B002LFBRV8|4|Awwww yyeaaahhh! Axe in da HOWWWSSSSE!!! Axe in da HOWWWSSSSE!!!Axe in da HOWWWSSSSE!!! Axe in da HOWWWSSSSE!!! Axe in da HOWWWSSSSE!!!
B001AESJOE|5|I ordered these for my son.  They are nice quality like Jockey tends to be but not a heavy tshirt like a hanes regular tshirt, not a hanes undershirt, but one sold seperately.  They are nice an long and give him room but fit well to wear under his work shirts.  He likes that they are a bit thinner and allow air to flow.  Great shirts and price!
B00IIVONX8|5|Great fit. Wonderful soft fabric. They look really cute on! (We won't tell the husband I said &#34;cute&#34;)
B0088PK34W|5|Good product. Arrived on time.
B00C5CJPAC|4|These shirts are soft and thin, perfect for the summer. The colors are great. Out of the 4 shirts I've bought though, two of them had issues with the size sticker coming off and leaving gooey residue which won't come off.
B004638B1W|5|Great pair of socks. Very warm and comfortable.
B00B2BX4CM|5|I'm slender with a 29&#34; waist.  Med fits great!  Super sexy!
B00ARHJUHU|2|I expected these to be a bit thicker so I'm less than thrilled....
B00B30IZK8|5|When I saw this hoodie I had to have it. It definitely is unique but it fits me. It wasn't too snug although the shoulders ran only a bit small it still was loose enough to be comfortable.
B00HD0NF1G|3|I bought this for my 2 year old son for whom 2T is normally the right size. I found the sizing on this odd. The top fitted well width wise but seemed quite long but the shorts seemed a little big in the waist but about the right length. The shorts are a nice light mesh style polyester and the inside feels soft. The top is more of a jersey feel to it, it's lightweight but feels kind of cheap. The black at the back & where there is no Spider-Man is thin enough to see through. Looking closely at the stitching the top isn't well made & really unsure how many washes it will last. Worth about the $8 I paid not even close to the $30 list price.
B003XSXCRY|3|Good quality, good price, runs small
B00M59FPSG|5|Perfect
B00WFDREEK|4|Beautiful! Such soft fabric too. It did seem to be quite large for 18-24 months, but maybe he can wear it next summer too.
B00CAKE23E|5|I wear Van Heusen fitted Poplins every day. Blue and black are my fav. GREAT SHIRT!
B00CHNNHFI|5|Excellent hat! Super warm and very comfy.
B00LW8PN74|5|I buy them again and again...not because they are bad quality but because I love them so much. I love the length, and I love the built in shelf. Perfect. My husband bought this set for me off of my wishlist because he never knows what to buy me. This made me happy!
B000OZODUO|5|The hat I bought was in great condition when it arrived. It looks good and so far the sequins have stayed on the hat. I needed it for a party and I'm glad I bought it. The brim is pliant so you can shape it any way you wish.
B00AB9YHQS|3|Be forewarned, when they say \\"synthetic fleece\\" they mean \\"quilted mesh\\".  This jacket is very light and porous, not what you would think of as a fleece.  I have to hand it to Kavu's marketing team on coming up with a way to capitalize on what is undoubtedly a cheap to manufacture synthetic material and then not using as much of it.<br /><br />That being said, this piece would probably be great for layering and for the early fall evenings.  The mesh is double-walled (i.e. pouch squares) so heat would regulate naturally (warming the air in the mesh and excess heat escaping through the seams.  The overall stitching is sound though I would suggest areas of improvement to be the chest pocket (zipper sticks with one-handed opening if all the way closed) and the elbow pads could use a higher denier material as they seem pretty thin and susceptible to easy snagging.<br /><br />Overall good if you get a sweet deal.  If not, move on to an REI or Sherpa
B00NZLRLM6|3|Too big for an infant. We ordered this for a 3 month old and end up being used for a 9 year old :)
B0029XFJYI|4|Pant's fit great and when washed color did not fade I recommend these pant's if you are a first time buyer with girls Dickies skinny pant's or any Dickies just know that the sizes do run smaller than other brands so keep that in mind when you are picking the sizes..
B000WFUPU8|3|this belt although nice is too big doesn't fit well and sits in an akward place when you wear it and is made of cheaper material then it looks like. if your a medium get a small if your a small it likely wont fit you.
B002AQ4WRO|3|I am 6' tall and weigh 150 lbs. and have a hard time finding dress pants that fit well without some after purchase alterations.  I generally won't buy pants online because I like to try them on because sizes vary so much between brands and styles.  I was excited to try out these thinking they would be perfect for my build.  These pants are VERY Slim and were too tight for me.  The fit in the thighs and seat were so snug, I was worried about splitting a seam when sitting down or bending over.  I'm not sure who these are designed for as I am a pretty \\"slim\\" adult and they were too tight.  I returned them immediately.
B00LEOOIDG|5|Color was more of a greyish black
B005FR7WCC|5|I took a chance and ordered a pair of jeans online and they fit perfectly! Very happy with my purchase.
B00T02EKU0|3|Loved the colors , but petite size was too small.
B00AEO1KC4|5|These make me look like I'm barefoot in my Sperry boat shoes. Best liner socks I've ever purchased and easily worth the price. They also don't look to bad without the shoes on. No need to stink up your boat shoes, just get a pair of these! Excellent socks
B00UV4VHT8|4|I'm satisfied
B0094GB27G|1|These are a very bad quality bottoms. Don't go for it. With just the first wash, i could see that the smoothness of the fabric was gone in patches and it continues to get worse, wash after wash.
B00GR4H4V6|5|Bought this for my 16 year old for Christmas and WOW...what a hit! Fits great, looks good, and warm...love it!
B0097P1X6E|3|Pants a bit on the tight side, vest is a bit baggy so it's ok. I hope it helps. :D
B002AWGEMY|3|This is a cute costume. The neckline is a little weird fitting. Very true to the Disney Snow White!
B00B03P9CA|4|I like the style because it only has material where you need it.
B00DIXJEKS|3|This is a very nice dress.  Well constructed and nicely tailored.  It was too big all over, though, so I sent it back.  It is not proportionate for petites, in my opinion, but I took a chance on it.  It would make a great dress for the office or for date night and the red color is very attractive.
B007O3RZVI|4|The chart is right! Had I purchased my normal size it would have been to small. There was a 2 inch spot on seam that was missed in sewing but luckily it was on the bottom! I would purchase from this business again.
B0007QMK3W|5|I have been buying this particular waist nipper for years now.
B004Q3QBLY|5|I just received my new jacket today from Amazon. This jacket had no reviews on it,so I thought I would write one.<br /><br />This jacket is very nicely styled, very well made and is to be used when weather temps go in to the upper thirtys or below.<br /><br />Jacket covers your back side well I am a little over six feet and it covers me well. It has a hood that is removable and has a nice liner inside.<br /><br />It has a cell phone pocket inside. Velco to cover up over zipper nice touch. The weight of this jacket suggects it made for late fall early winter days. Sizes runs true.<br /><br />Great jacket for the money even better when Amazon just had 20 per cent off on all Jackets.
B00FWL6XFS|4|It's rather boxy but a good print and nice quality material. Overall I would buy again but in a smaller size. I typically wear medium in everything and this thing is definitely sized wrong. It runs a full size too larger than what it's marked as.
B00B15FOBS|5|arrived quick and as expected
B00C1BW5VS|5|Love the look and feel of this shirt<br />My son thinks its cool<br />Good quality not flimsy at all<br />Looks like it will hold up
B00GN7Y0JG|4|I love this item. It is just perfect. Yes, it is true the stitching could have been better, but overall, for the price, really it's cute, it fits really well and am very happy with the way it looks. THank you!
B0000ZFS20|5|As expected!!<br />Quick arrival. Just wonderful!!!
B00CBAWW4E|5|Adorable, arrived in a very timely manor..
B002LIU0J0|4|Its ok, sorry I didny take the small. It wld fit better...next time I will take a snaller size, bur it rits very well
B00NSBLE4E|5|Very snug and comfortable. Good to show off physique profile.
B00BQKKWRY|4|Love the fabric. Super soft and doesn't fade. My only complaint is that the shirt fits perfectly, but the buttons still kind of look like they are being stretched, so you have to constantly readjust the buttons to make them straight.
B00XL9R6J0|5|I am tall and skinny, with no figure to speak of. 6' 1&#34;, 140 lbs, 34a bust. Bought the small size, and LOVE the fit. It is way comfortable, and covers enough that I can be active at the beach, and not worry about this or that peeking out at any given moment. I would buy a ton of these to keep on hand, if they had more. You can scrunch the waste of the bottoms down below your belly button, if that is more comfortable, or wear it high up for the supreme 50's look. LOVE!
B0026P4HAQ|2|The shoulder straps are about 2&#34; short  which pulled the bra way too high giving  no coverage at bottom of cups. There was no length left on the straps for further adjustment . Fabric is comforable. If it fit, I would have liked it . I have returned it.
B005I34JCO|4|Great pair of gloves. Very nice quality. But run small/tight, order a size larger. It hasn't gotten cold yet so can't testify to thermal performance, but they are &#34;Thinsulate&#34;.
B00NIHNDG0|5|Great quality and shipping was fast sorry I couldn't keep it. It was too small good for 4 to 6 years old.
B00J3LG2GS|5|He loved it.
B008XAA6E4|2|Wanted it very large and flowing but it's tight.  I saw other reviews that said get it in a larger size, so I did.  But even then it was too small.
B00Q52S9Y6|5|What a great shirt! Shipped and arrived quickly. Very soft fabric, looks exactly like the picture. Super comfortable, perfect for every-day wear. The print is good-quality and soft to the touch. I'm very happy with my purchase and look forward to showing off my Home state wherever I go!
B00HDA326O|5|cute little hats they are a great fit thanks
B00K7HTIK4|5|These are great jeans.  Nice dark color and the denim is soft. Nice slim leg.
B00MFEA48M|2|They were cheap and you get what you pay for.  One sock was a good 1-2 inches longer than the other, one went over the knee and the other did not.
B0018P1WEY|5|These jeans were a nice fit thanks Amazon!
B008KFIVSU|2|They say the dress is empire-waisted, and it is; they don't say that you must measure around the ribcage for waist size on the dress, not the natural waist.  It's a gorgeous dress, and I would have loved it, but it was too tight at the ribcage. My natural waist is around 26 in., and I ordered a medium, thinking I was ordering a size up. A large would have likely fit my ribcage better, while unfortunately being big everywhere else.
B00B1OWFN4|3|its ok for this kind of product, where you don't expect a great quality level
B00C86E9DI|5|Nice Shirts, Nice Price.
B00L9JTZY8|2|They are not very good quality and large. Too long and chunky.
B00MUHMJYG|1|Horrible product. Flimsy and just bad material. Don't waste your money.
B0034G65EW|5|i buy this for a gift they are so cute but when i have in my armn i see that htey are sooo big
B007FCEVZ6|4|Good product, its a bit uncomfortable when its hot outside but u get used to it pretty fast.<br /><br />I recommend it
B00EDZAK76|1|The product was so cheaply made that I won’t let me daughter wear it... Very dissatisfied!!!
B00T518YSU|5|Love it
B0057IO0XI|5|Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  Will look to order some more for him soon.
B001EHBJSU|5|This was a great costume. I ordered for my son. It was a little big but I knew it was an adult size. When he went trick or treating he received a lot of compliments.
B0051WQWLS|5|I'm IN LOVE with this dress, seriously, it's now my favorite. I got the black one when it was 29 bucks and I'd love to buy the blue and the purple as well, but the price went up 10 bucks. It's not fair! (sobbing..)<br />I'm either L or XL in dresses, but L fits perfectly with this one. I'm 5'7 and 180 pounds - not a small one, but this dress makes me look skinny, that's why I want more....<br />UPDATE got the blue one as well. Too much money, but SO worth it! This dress would make even your mom in law look HOT.
B00Z5PKAM8|5|it's a nice quality and unique design.
B007DAFPQY|5|I am going to wear them at the next highland heavy throwing games, they should give me extra ummph!  Really a hoot.
B009Y11UOG|5|The only con i found is that they were too long iam only 5ft 3 inches,so i had to have them cut down.But quality is great,and would definitely recommend! price was good.
B00EYNAUEK|5|Very pretty, fits well
B00B2103LC|5|Love it, smart look for both casual and elegant events.
B005FYKXN0|5|Comfortable t-shirt. Love SOA!
B000ZL779G|3|The tie is bright and vibrant. However, it is very thin. Hope that it lasts a few holidays. Little disappointed.
B00936TEUY|4|Not bad
B004SWIXT6|5|I read past reviews and good thing! They said to size up because there is no spandex or stretch in these pants.  They are really nice and the larger size fits great.  I normally wear a size 6 in Gap jeans or DKNY jeans but I ordered an 8 in these and they fit well.  I would have had to change them if I ordered a 6.  Great style, good and sturdy material and cool look.  Great for work or play!
B008EFYYNM|4|I really, really wanted these pantyhose to fit properly because they are so sexy and really high quality!  The fabric is perfectly sheer, with just a touch of color, and the sheen is really nice.  The nylon doesn't tear easily, even with my husband virtually attacking my legs!  He couldn't keep his hands off of me in these things, he just kept commenting on how shiny they made my legs look! However, the length isn't long enough for a tall, curvy woman- I'm 5'8\\" and I couldn't pull them all the way up!  I'm so sad!!!!
B00ORZIYBQ|5|So far, I am very pleased with this product.  I've read that people are not happy with the latch, but I still don't know what the big deal is.  I would hate it if I drop my wallet and the latch breaks off.  You will be 100% satisfied with this product.
B00E0HYOG0|5|Good price for exactly the product I wanted and can never find in stores. Comfortable so far. A bit warm.
B0066SJN3A|5|I bought this hat as a christmas gift for my niece. She has a vast hat collection and wears this one often
B00F10SF7E|5|These shorts are huge on me big and baggie they make me look like a 10 year old wearing his big brother shorts, love look. The liner is a &#34;granny-pantie&#34; - very large and billowy. Completely comfortable and great fit, perfect for a larger a\waist man. They are lightweight and easy to wash. Wear them around the house and out in the yard and lots better than putting on long pants to go out in the yard. These are a through back to the 80's and I am glad to see they are still around. I love wearing them. Feels like I am wearing nothing at all. They are so comfortable. Easy to move in great for sleeping in too. Will definitely buy more pairs.
B00CF1XCO8|4|The bra was smaller around than what sizing chart said I should be. Very cute looking. Wire sort of cuts in on front but could be because it was a title small.
B002OFIC4K|3|A little tight.  Probably 1/2 size too small but not worth the money to send back. I'll wear them for short times on my feet.
B00E8GL9JS|1|This outfit is adorable and we were so excited to wear it.  We received a 4T as a gift for my average sized 3.5 year old daughter.  I sent her to school in it but when I picked her up the teacher told me her bottom was showing all day.  The skirt is so heavy it weighs down the pants.  She didn't seem to care, but I was so embarrassed.
B006SRTFGO|5|Very comfortable the fit well and keep warm. Definitely a good buy, especially for the price.
B002FU5XDW|4|Great quality, but I wish I would have read the reviews first that they run small.  The natural waist fit is snug in a 12 Long and I am normally a 10. I bought the same flat front pant in the mid-rise in 12 Long and they fit great.  I will be ordering another pair of the mid-rise.
B0006U69RC|5|Love the slim cut and the straighter leg on this jean.  Fits perfectly..
B000FXXWRU|5|As a Carhartt family, we have used their products for 40+ years.  This set of coveralls was purchased for my father who is over 60 now to replace his old pair which was being held together with duct tape:). The Rocky Mountains are freezing this time of year and usually full of snow, we are missing the snow but it is plenty cold and these coveralls are the perfect solution for those who have to work outdoors.
B00FLY4K7E|5|Love the fit.
B00CBM9BG4|3|Very cute the  lace skirt was a little big.  I ordered it a size bigger due to the  reviews  about the outfit running small. But overall I'm happy
B008K9XI0C|5|works great! happy with the quality.
B00E5ROT3I|5|Great suit. Nice looking and fits waist size 34 fine.
B00MN7D6FY|5|I love love love this coat! It's very light weight and the sweater part is very stretchy. Overall the is a very comfortable stylish coat
B006TD8J14|3|BUT .... WE GET WHAT WE PAY FOR!<br /><br />I PERSONALLY LIKE THE STYLE WOULD LOVE POCKETS AND MAYBE MATERIAL WITH A<br />LITTLE SPANDEX --SO NO WINKLES!<br /><br />CHARGE A LITTLE MORE FOR BETTER MATERIAL
B0047HINCO|5|Baby's now looking fancy, he also seems to like it a lot.
B00IDYSRXW|5|Such a cute outfit for my neice
B008XBKADK|5|I am a school bus aiide.  With the extreme cold we are experiencing this winter I felt I needed a longer, warmer coat. This coat is very comfortable, and warm.  I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend it highly.
B00BU3C48W|5|I am absolutely delighted with this wallet - tried two others to replace a 20 year old one and returned them.  This has sass and class, the two outside mini pockets are super convenient for separating small and larger coins.  Multiple inside compartments make organizing paper bills and miscellany super easy, I separate bills by denomination for faster retrieval, plus there is a handle strap included.  Can't rave enough
B00UFVNBTG|5|so beautiful , just stunning top .
B00NNECJ9K|5|Super cute and perfect for outfits I have planned! These are great if you want the look of thigh highs without the struggle of keeping them on. Yes the bear ears are lighter but it's because of the fabric they're printed on but you can't tell when they're actually on. Somewhat tight (my thighs are 17-20 inches on the biggest part) but they should stretch a bit once I wear them!
B00E0N3SLQ|5|This Hat was more than I expected!!  Came shipped in a nice box, and is so true to Color, fit, and I love feeling it because it is so Soft!!<br />I am wearing this hat this Friday to my Toby Keith Concert and I Can&#34;t wait!! to take pictures.  I would recommend buying from this seller any day!  Thank you Amazon!!
B00EDHVUH8|4|This Levi's shirt fits as expected in a small man, in an average body fits tightened, the colors are pretty.
B00CPRF1FK|4|Really love the hat
B006PHVW7M|2|I wish the clasp/lock and interior was more sturdy and I wish the card slots would keep the cards in it more tightly.
B00AB0AX4C|5|great, small wallet, credit card and licence case, can hold a few bills as well
B00CUM34XG|5|Everything  ok
B005GVIW9E|5|This is perfect. It fits well, is long like I like it, and is extremely comfortable. I would highly reccomend it.
B0018OR118|1|&#34;Classic Fit&#34; ??? If that means a big saggy butt and tight, skinny legs that won't fit over boots, then yeah !! Someone built like Humpty Dumpty would probably love them. I was forced to give up on the off-shore produced &#34;shrink to fit&#34;. They shrank, but no matter what combination of waist and length (I tried WAY too many), they did not fit. This version worked for several years; two out of five pairs would fit pretty darn good. The factories have apparently changed the cut and the result is the worst jean ever made. Since I have worn 501's for 40 years, I believe that I am a qualified reviewer.
B005GYGFYU|5|Price is good.  The fit is perfect and moves easily with high activity.  I just wish it had more colors to choose from.
B0089Q8YVE|3|rather large but I was able to make it work once I got rid of the elastic and squeezed in the headband gently
B000XFXJ3M|5|good
B00WRAMEQE|5|Perfect fit :)
B007UM6OXI|5|I am very pleased with this purchase. The jeans are very good quality and fit nicely. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the 2 snaps in the front like the pair I had seen in the Jc Penneys store. That is what I was trying to find.
B008EIZGW2|5|These are the second pair that I have ordered. They are very comfortable. Could use a little more room in the crotch area, if you have a large crotch they may not be so comfortable. Overall great buy for the price. Material is nice and can be thrown in the wash, do not put in dryer. That is all! Carry on!
B0009GB9V4|4|The quality isn't quite up to pare, but great for around the house for the price.
B00NCJXU3K|5|Cute & comfy
B0067E9IBU|5|I purchased this swim suit for my 2.5 daughter in size 4T. She is tall and wears 3t clothes. The swimsuit is very cute and bright, fits her well. I hope she will not outgrow it by the end of summer. I gave 5 stars for great quality and fast delivery, but buy a size larger as it runs small!
B0059LH8BE|4|Size a little small but I expected this so I ordered a size bigger than I normally take.
B008AVROWS|3|fair, but nothing  to write home about, pathetic Carhartt cant even duplicate the same pair of pants in the same size twice...
B00PZ33O0K|5|Comfortable, good quality, fits well.
B000TA74IM|5|Great hiking sock. fit was perfect for my 10-10.5 shoe size. Not too snug to wear a liner sock if needed.
B001JFMH7O|5|Very good quality robe, nice and warm to wear outside to the Hot Tub.  I was impressed with how heavy the material is, as I had never seen one like it in a store.  I do reccomend buying at least one size up as it ran a little small.  I bought this as a Gift for my wife and had to exchange it for a larger size and the company does charge an \\"Exchange fee\\".  Plus you pay to ship the first one back.  Company was very prompt with both the original and the exchange shipping and they were nice people to do business with.  So, yes...I would buy from them again, just heed the warning and buy a larger size than you normally would.  A very nice robe for the money.
B004ARXIMQ|1|The product is labeled \\"Boys Crew Sock,\\" which made me think they they would fit my school-age son, but these socks are actually for toddlers.
B00WFMHZNG|3|This bathing suit is so cute! I just wish you could choose different sizes for the top and bottom. I'm returning it for that reason and the neoprene bottoms are uncomfortable and stiff.
B00L216FCS|3|Not a dress whatsoever but I still wear this as a cut T-shirt
B00HRZBCHG|5|Nice, looks and feels great.
B004ZRDUCE|5|Great product
B000BO1PCW|2|Not what I wanted. I should have researched it better. Mostley my fault, you get what you pay for.
B008MBNNZ8|5|This is an adorable way to bundle our little guy up.  I haven’t had to take him out in very cold weather, but this works well combined with a blanket in the 40s or by itself in the 50s.  He’s gotten many compliments and ooh and aahs.  This is well made and true to size.
B00FC98326|3|Love the print and the fit. It does run large.
B008XCNG58|4|I am very pleased with this coat. It is very warm! Heavy, but not unbearable. My only reason for not rating it as 5 stars is that it runs small. I would have liked a size larger but I bought the largest size available. With the fur on the inside, it is a little snug but with the fur on the outside it fits okay. A size larger would have made it a perfect.
B00JIHL2A8|5|Love the jacket but need to exchange for a larger size. The sleeves were too short and my daughter is only 5'5&#34;.Hopefully the small will add enough length in the sleeves.
B00LL3NH9Q|1|Flowers came off as soon as I opened the package.
B002KLQT98|2|I ordered these for my 39 month-old son, who is tall and skinny. These underpants wouldn't come close to fitting for another 6 or 8 years. Seriously, I don't what 3 to 4 yr old these could possibly fit - the waist is 16 inches (reasonable for a beefy toddler) but the rise is 9 inches! Even on my tall kid, they came almost up to his armpits, literally. I love Under the Nile, and these are nice briefs, but the sizing is way, way off for toddlers.  BTW, the picture may suggest you get 3 pair of briefs per order, but it's actually only one pair.
B00L9EFAXS|5|Shrinks a lot when washed. Out of the bag was a perfect fit I bought a larger size to accommodate the shrinkage
B00M2OXI4W|4|cute
B007IJZ35S|3|From the reviews I had read I believed the shirt to be a fitted T shirt but the one we recieved was very large, square and thin material.  Definitely not worthy the price. Though color was dead on and the writing perfect
B00J2D7QUS|5|Very nice trousers. Comfortable and soft.
B003CICHWQ|5|Great fit!  Glad I ordered the Large size.  I am a 34&#34; waist.
B007R8GJL2|2|The dress was nice but it was too small.  I was unable to zip up the dress.  The size indicated did not seem that way.
B00HRF8O9U|4|it is an ok suit....fits a little snug, but was about what I expected
B0089DX2C8|4|The hat is adorable. I get alot of compliments. My only complaint is the embellishments are glued on and are already coming off after only one use.
B001B19ENQ|5|great! exactly what we wanted. better than we expected. perdect for his 3rd bday party! shipped quickly. would buy again. size was accurate also
B001UOKVFY|4|This skirt is a perfect addition to my wardrobe.. dress it up or down, its perfect
B009S3I5WU|3|Sizes run big.
B00QNEJSPK|5|Good,... Nice blouse.
B00ID0POT6|5|I bought these shorts for my toddler to wear under dresses to cover her diaper. They do the job and are very soft.
B00DCDE20G|4|To anyone and everyone who orders these Tipi Toe cushion ankle socks you will not be disappointed.  They are very comfortable and stylish!!  Great product and happy I ordered them!
B00BXEW5B4|3|While the &#34;small&#34; fits pretty well, they are still a little large in the waist. I have to keep tying and re-tying the draw string to keep them up.
B0002M4VG0|5|Woohoo, I am all up in the style. I look hotter than a firecracker on the Fourth of July ! I ain't lying! I was a cold ounce of introverted ooze until I morphed into the Dickies Man.  Y'all get some  of these , give ya self some room and watch out. I even whistle better. The morning air even has a new life when I am wearing my Dickies.  I am a fixin to add newness to my marriage by getting my bride a pair. Woohoo,
B006STXNWY|5|I love this dress!! The material is so super soft and comfortable and the style is gorgeous. So worth getting!!
B00JX843SU|4|Better than a drugstore purchase during halloween.  I have always been happy with my purchase from Cool2Day.  the hair is already styled and soft.  Take advatage of the free wig cap and these wigs work best for people with a longer face because i need to trim the front.
B002QKHPIW|4|Good item needed a little extra to meet my needs but as expected worth the cost
B00PIF0DW2|5|Looks just as cool as in the picture. Kind of like a thin lightweight cloth type of material, but it gets the job done and looks absolutely badass! Like a giant poster for your bathroom
B00FL2SA9U|5|Awesome shirt!!!!!!! Being a Zelda fan I had to get this and am very happy with it.
B00FATAD1M|5|fingertips are a little long for me on ring and pinky, my friend tried them on and felt the same.  quality is wonderful, feel is exactly as I anticipated.  I will likely order as Christmas gifts this year.
B00GB0EPS6|4|I guess that is part of the fit of a classic western shirt, but it was a little to tight for my husband.
B00JPEP1LA|5|Perfect fit & good support.
B002APZPI0|5|Looked at every store locally for pants to fit a tall skinny teenager without finding anything!  These come in a 30 x 34 which fit him great.  He needed these for school so it was a relief to find them in his size and the color he needed.  Great product for a good price.
B00JJCALJU|5|Fit's perfect. Like the design features.
B00OFUK7RC|5|Looks exactly as pictured! Awesome design :)
B00DCSUPW0|5|This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughters little friend.  I think it will be fine and fit just fine. It looked just as advertised.
B00I90JC3O|5|worked great for the costume!
B00KAVWO80|1|the bottom fit perfect the top piece was tooo small
B003CMZ9RC|4|I happened to snag the last pair of black mediums in this tall legging.  They are super comfortable and plenty long for me.  I am 5'11, 140 lbs with a 35\\" inseam, usually size 6 or 8 in pants.  I was worried about the inseam while I was shopping and purchased these based on the reviews of the other tall ladies who have had good luck with them. These fit great and could even fit someone several inches taller.  There is definitely no need to size up. I would love to buy another black pair or something other than brown, so please add more colors!  I would have given 4.5 stars for these if it was an option, simply because after the very first washing, I found a small hole at the seam on the waistband.  It looks like they were cut too close to the seam while being sewn together. That was a bummer since these have not seen much activity other than lounging around the house. Otherwise, they are great and I will live in them this winter.
B005DTT6A8|5|The tie is very nice. The service was great, despite I got the wrong tie, they immediately corrected the mistake and sent very fast the correct tie with all refunds. I highly recommend this tie and seller.
B000XB6M3K|4|This is a good suit for the money, not the highest quality but for wht i paid i am very happy with it.
B00EBRULAW|5|This is my first time with socks of this type... I was worried they would slid right down into my shoe and drive me crazy all day.  They fit perfectly, stay in place all day, and are super comfortable.  I will definitely buy more of these!  They may not be completely in all of my shoes, but they are in most.  Definitely help with rubbing issues for some of my shoes too.  Great product!
B00N3J9EI4|1|Color is not what is shown, it is a MUCH darker blue. Lace has no stretch whatsoever, so even for someone with thinner legs (like myself) you can't wear them too high on your thighs without them becoming too tight to wear comfortably. Would not recommend. You would be much better off going with a well known brand, and paying a bit more. I will say however, the delivery was prompt, sadly the product was disappointing.
B004QM91FS|5|This thing is adorable in person & just perfect for a dressier event where you still want your baby to be ultra-comfy.  The \\"tulle\\" is not scratchy at all & is super soft for baby's skin.  You won't be disappointed.  EVERYONE commented on how cute my little girl looked.
B005N6C44Q|3|Compared to the [[ASIN:B006GVRBZE Castelli 2012 Men's Privilegio Long Sleeve Cycling Jersey]], this doesn't fit as well.<br />I'm 5\\"8\\", 172 with a 40\\" chest and size 34\\" waist. The arms had a bit of slack, where as Privilegio was more form fitting with proper sleeve length for me. I have Large in both.<br /><br />The design looks nice, however I prefer the Privilegio instead.
B0089OEO1K|5|Great hat, very light mahes it a great work hat or just hanging out. Fits and feels good. I would expect it to wash like the ones issued to us way back when. I bet you'll like it.
B00SSYXR0A|3|had red ink marks on the white panda and all the shirts came stuck together. had to peel them apart.
B009FROGZY|4|Not the same colore
B00M5BVUOW|5|Super cute! It's a nice soft silk scarf and the length is just right. I find that many silk scarfs are too short, but this one as just right! Might get another one!
B00IYXGGSA|4|I ordered this bra because I just had breast surgery.  It is very comfortable and is easy to get on and off after surgery.  I had a minor issue with one day shipping, but that has been resolved.
B00EQD6WJU|4|I'm pretty busty so it didn't fit well across the chest but everywhere else was fine.  Great t-shirt for camping!
B007C5M5MM|4|I bought this as a gift for my child's father, he's a fan of the tv series  and loves riding his Harley, the colors worked out prefect. I just wished that the gift would of been delivered on the day they said....2 day shipping and it was 4 days late
B001AXAMTU|4|You will certainly attract the eye of those around you when you wear this tie.  The only problem is that there is no band to hold the two ends together when worn.
B005C9GLZC|5|Perfect fit, comfortable, and they're holding up well so far. Had them for a few months now and they're all still in perfect condition.
B00FHK0TKE|5|Love this top!!! Wear it with leggings and I'm so happy about the length. Covers everything up like I wanted.
B00BM1E53O|1|left terrible panty lines through every article of clothing I tried on, and gave me back fat. I'm not even over weight but this garment made me look it
B00L7U5Z2K|5|Nice curtin. The graphics, color, and material were all as advertised.  I'm very pleased with it, and it goes perfect with the color scheme I'm using in the bathroom.
B0049E9XTC|5|Bought this for her 6 years ago. She has flown 4 times and uses it every time she has a sleepover or comes to spend a weekend with us. Used a thousand times and is still in great shape. She loves it. You can pack a lot in this.
B0007N3M32|3|The strap slips...
B00M4007HK|5|This outfit is just fabulous. It looks absolutely beautiful on and it's incredibly well made. The price is just fantastic and well worth it.
B009KM5HAW|3|this dress is a nice dress, not  a dressy dress at all, but overall nice dress, the customer service was great, they delivered as expected,
B002HCN4A2|4|Our classic cotton boho tier skirt are perfect for all long and short kurtis. A fun & fashionable skirt by Mogul Interior! This crinkle skirt offers a bohemian style, tier design, and elastic waistline. Skirt is stylish, easy to wear, and is one of this season's hottest looks! Cotton.
B00EDOBR7O|5|very good quality,fast shipping.would recommend to others and I will be buying from them again
B00CPK9LVC|4|Really cute costume.
B002X7A0MQ|1|Every time you take it off and adjust it back the black &#34;leather&#34; get more and more wrinkles like if you have use it for years.  This happen alredy on the first day I use it.
B0048WPU7O|4|My son loves them...not quite as thick of material as the mil spec, but nice and was a good deal!
B00JTKPPG6|5|Great product.  Feels comfortable and is breathable an lightweight.
B00GTFX1LU|2|Shirt was way too small - ordered XXL, fit like a L. The linen material in the shirt is so thin practically transparent, I can clearly see body hair, tattoos, even moles through the shirt. Embroidery okay, but seems cheap. Sent the shirt back because it didn't fit at all.
B00GZKJ5GE|5|With the right colors, this cardigan will fit any occasion
B005NX1ZXK|4|fits ok pants a little small but for the price it's a little better than ok
B006G0CPDS|1|I purchased this article on 12/04/2011 and have not received it a month later. I am still waiting but my email queries have not been replied to. I was hoping to have the tshirt which looked perfect.
B00553XOAA|4|Best support bra I have ever owned for working out. Finally, no more bouncing around and back aches working out.
B00Q2FQEFW|5|bought this sight unseen and was pleased that it was just as nice as the photo.  can't wait to use it this spring.
B00BXGOEKC|5|I absolutely love it on!!
B007CRR7WS|3|A little small
B00O11KPOK|5|Very nice fit with durable materials to endure harsh Snowy weather in South Korea. Excellent product!
B001AOZ34I|5|I wear about a 2-3x and weigh about 240lbs and this fits so good! it's so fun! You can wear it upside down backwards any way! Would totally recommend to any ladies out any ladies out there that want a very sexy garment! needs to come in white, red, and pink too!
B003CRCA1U|5|I've purchased this item before and was happy to find two more on Amazon.  They are great under clothes where you need a little help.
B00F15UJZK|5|She was just beautiful in it for her pictures.
B00K32YNF8|5|Love this shirt
B005J3642G|5|I love this scarf, it is warm looks awesome and was not too expensive. This scarf is something right out of the J.Peterman catalog, the only thing they can do is improve the item description to include some fancy little narrative to really take me away. Two thumbs up!
B00IBY8MTS|5|Sexy and covers all the areas I feel self conscious about.
B0063N5OF4|5|These gloves are awesome!!  They are warm and have very long cuffs to go farther in keeping the cold out of the inside of the glove.  I LOVE THESE GLOVES !
B00CQNS0T2|1|I got it thinking it would be very looser and more like a night shirt but it is so tight and not comfortable at all.
B00CZ5CU74|5|I love these pjs-  soft and super cute on my little guy!  He loves them too which is even better!
B000KL06X0|4|Soft, comfortable boxers that I wear daily and love
B003ZS7H14|4|Got this for Zumba and I love it. The photo shows what it is, spot on. Color, spangles, size, everything is just as it looks online.I'm hoping that the &#34;coins&#34; will stay put thru a lot of shaking...stay tuned and I'll update when I know!
B00Q5BULFM|4|The back is kind of weird, but other than that, good pair of overalls, very fashionable
B00SB0KZ7E|3|Not really impressed
B00HVVNUFI|5|Thank you the item is great!
B00F4KYZTI|5|Great price for something made so well.<br />I was taking a chance buying this because nobody else made a product review...<br /><br />This wig is long, smooth to the touch, very straight, and pretty thick.<br />The inside netting is lace like.<br /><br />No shedding.<br /><br />Just prone to staticky-ness
B000JMP8VA|5|I purchased this robe for my husband.  For the price, I did not expect the quality to be this high.  Is is plush and very expensive looking.  It is a winter white and very beautiful.  The length was perfect for my 5'8\\" husband.  I would definitely recommend this robe.
B00CTUWDUO|1|Product was too small and it was very uncomfortable. The wires kept coming out and stabbing me.
B0086F0JXO|3|My son is 18months and I thought the fit wouldn't be too far off. Was hoping it would be just slightly bigger. But it's way too large. Although I really like the quality and make of this jacket. Decided not to return it and keep it for his future travels
B008REY7B4|1|Cheaply made.  Black chinstrap! Runs big for baby.  Not at all like the picture. You Get what you pay for!!
B008LP0NFI|5|Love Hanes Silk Reflections stockings and knee highs are very convenient for wearing with pants and all kinds of shoes.
B001OI37ES|3|Not my Favorite Bra.  Was hoping for something a little more comfortable and a better fit @ 38b, my normal bra size.<br />I have better fits with Soma and Bali bras.
B00ADTN6HC|5|I bought this dress for my niece a while ago. I wish i knew that this was on Amazon before, I actually paid way more for it. Very good quality, and a perfect Jackie O. type dress. My niece wore it for her piano recital and she got a lot of compliments for her dress (also for her talent of course)I would definetely check here for more Monalisa items, the prices on all items seems way lower than everywhere else.
B00DQV4S3K|5|Awesome shirt, fit perfect.
B00C3QQXOG|2|So terribly fake looking and too big
B000A2KAWG|5|best jeans my husband has ever bought or owned.  The only ones he wants from now on.
B00EFEPHMS|2|I recovered gray yoga pants instead of the long sleeved shirt that I ordered. Not too happy but not really worth sending back either. You can never have enough yoga pants I guess
B001RL7GZ8|1|I have yet to receive this product but have been charged for it. It was ordered at the same time as the blue one.
B000V196NU|5|They (Wigwam) are the gold of the hiking socks selection. They are correct and perfect in all categories. I recommend them !
B00L9JT1YC|4|I'm so glad they are making more interesting socks for men now.  Stylish but not overdone
B002CIQXPY|1|I ordered the wrong size. Returned
B00L60070G|5|Very comfortable. I can ride my bicycle all day!
B00LYTDIC8|5|Really cute top! Would recommend!
B009YCRYPO|1|Are these discontinued? Or just a lack of restocking shelves - ...although my husband would want an opening to urinate but the fit would be good under coveralls for winter...I'm assuming..
B008PDC2AK|3|These PJ's are super, super comfy and soft. The only problem I have with them is that they are not red (as expected). It's more of a dark pink/magenta. Otherwise, they really are the most comfy pj's I have ever worn.
B002T3A69Q|1|I wear a size 18 petite.  I ordered a xxl i this dress. It didn't come close to citing.UG  To me it seems like about a size 16.  If you wear larger than a 16 I would find another dress.  So disappointed.
B00F3DNXTO|5|Very cute robe that I will be using to get ready in for my wedding!
B00GI6J2KY|5|I love this shirt! The fit is perfect! The olive color in the picture did not do it justice it is a true olive green!! I will buy more if these!!!!!
B00855KXMC|5|Great quality product and will be buying from seller again!!!
B003FEIVZO|4|I say not a bad buy for not having to go into a store and try them on. THink I may buy another
B00IB50DWQ|5|Nice for my costume and feeling good.
B005CW04F2|1|I'm 6'1&#34; and these shirts looked like a dress on me. They hung almost down to my knees. The material is extremely thin and insubstantial feeling. I didn't even bother returning them. Straight in the trash.
B006WU7LD6|5|Design: Nice and soft. looks super comfy.  The blue is more a shade of purple.  Not cheap but works as promised if it's organic.<br />Pleased enough with it.<br /><br />Delivery: Fast and efficient.
B0000E14AE|2|I like the stretch quality of the fabric, I like the faded color and quality of the jeans. The pants ran large, which defeats the purpose of the spandex. I would order a size smaller than you normally would. This is one time I was disappointed that a pair of jeans DIDN'T shrink.
B00I0HKJIS|4|Looks great but feels uncomfortable and a little awkward
B00P0DQ7RM|3|I am 5 foot 4 and 225 pounds so I got a 4x.  The first day I was bloated from my menstral and could not get it on do not pass go, I was only able to latch one notch.  I waited a week and could finally get it on.  The fit was tight and uncomfortable which was to be expected but it also dug into my skin and sitting in it was a no no and after hour and half I had to take it off.  I've bee wearing it more but I'm finding that when I wear it longer the top part rolls down, so next time I will probably try one with straps and a size up to give me more adjusting options.
B00OSJLI5K|5|Adorable!
B001JBF7UM|5|These Are Great, I'm 5'6 260Lbs and They Still Come Down To My Knees. I Listened and Got A Bigge Size Then I Need Like Other reviewers Said But In My Case I Should Of Stuck To Xxl. Haven't Washed Them Yet Because I Bought 3 Packs (15Shirts) But will Update later
B003ZSH8XQ|5|I am a school principal and wear a tie every day. It is important for me to keep my tie from flopping around, hanging down in kids' food or throw up, or being glued to a kindergartener's craft. The problem with most tie clips is that they will hold the tie but will not stay perpendicular to the tie. This tie clip is the exception. The spring is really strong and keeps my tie in place while staying straight. The matte black finish is great for almost every tie I own (it looked great with my black Beatles tie today). I am thrilled that I found this, and the price was great.
B00ELQL8B4|5|The pants work as advertised, does work up a sweat and the high waist stays put.  Would buy the brand again.
B00E8RDRC4|3|Nice shirt, length is true to size, but size runs VERY narrow. If your child is not stick thin, then this shirt will be too small. My daughter is usually a size 12/14. I ordered a size up because she rash guards are hard to get on and off wet bodies if fitted. This size 16 fit like a too tight wet suit.
B00G59ZGM2|3|But such a cute suit, so I ordered it in the 18 month even though my baby is an extremely small 11 and 1/2 year old.
B008YMEVKQ|4|I like the look and feel...took off one star...the ad reads if you wear a 32 obtain a 32 belt. I wear a 32 and ordered a 34 to be safe..Glad I did as I can only get to the first hole...a 32 would not have worked...Otherwise very satisfied...tough to buy clothing over the net due to sizing issues...one day we will all have the same tape measurements?
B00U3EZBCA|4|I love the pattern and colors. However the front and back seams along the bottom don't match up. Other than that, I love it.
B008H8BIVC|5|This is a great fit and supports wonderful
B000QWDQUS|4|This waist cincher has kept my belly from expanding during the course of day when I eat.  I put saram wrap around my waste first.  I gave it 4 stars because I itched from the product before I decided to use the saram wrap.  It defintiely works though.
B0011VUF70|5|Ordered these after seeing them in a store that didn't carry my size.  They are wonderfully comfortable and fit just right.  Might order a little shorter inseam next time, but they are great!
B00PB1LMKU|5|Love this shirt
B001CJQWDM|5|Worked great for party and kids. When asked the price everyone was shocked at what I paid they thought it would have been much more expensive. Only bad things is the fabric inside is scratchy and it's very hot.
B00OVDAV6A|5|Great quality. Would buy again.
B00A76EZLM|3|very narrow in the thigh... nuthugger status
B0041EA6NM|1|Tried this 3xlt thermal shirt on. It was so tight i thought they had sent me a large by mistake. Icannot recommend this shirt .Ithink it might have been made in a country where they have no concept of size However i did receive it in the time they stated.
B00D7A2TMC|5|It was a gift<br />Haven't heard back
B00631VDUQ|2|It is what I expected except the neck it very large and if I bought a smaller size I think the arms would be small. The neck came unstitched after I washed it one time and I didn't dry it in the dryer. It needs ironing.
B00NZC5WDK|4|little bit  large,even for me ,BTW I'm a large size guy...
B004HEVDHO|2|I ordered the 12-18 month size for my 10-month old son. The PJs arrived quickly and are very cute and very comfortable. The fabric is soft and stretchy and seems like it will breathe well and have room for him to grow into without being big on him now. However, after 2 nights, the stitching along the waistband is already coming out. Amazon customer service was very helpful and these PJs will be in the return mail tomorrow. I also ordered the truck pattern and hope that I don't have the same problem with them as I really like the look and feel of the Leveret PJs otherwise!
B00RUE4E60|1|Waist band unraveled b on 2 pairs the first time I wore them.
B00BPIQVUO|5|Super cute!
B00LJVAETG|1|Very poor quality in the material and not at all what the picture shows.
B00ACIG6XK|5|Good quality A-Shirts. If you want to look like Robert De Niro in Raging Bull, this is the first step.<br /><br />Yes, they're a bit long, but that allows them to stay tucked while you're training to look like De Niro .
B0081P6L8G|4|Poor stitching in many places. It must be re-sewn at the seams to repair quite often. Impressive looking regardless. Wait for a deal before buying.
B00BIJEFBW|2|This may be polo &#34;style&#34; but don't expect the usual polo type fabric.  This is merely a very thin, lightweight, cheap feeling  T-shirt with a collar sewn on, Too bad.
B00OQPUIY8|5|perfect for christmas parties
B0048KZGZM|5|Very cute, better quality than some others out there, only had them for a few days, but nothing has fallen off them or broken which has happened to others we have bought and paid much more for.
B00BJRFQIY|4|Super cute on my kid.  It fits well, but I was hoping the clip would keep it in place.  The sides are so long that the clip does really nothing.
B004UULQFE|5|I didn't think it would fit as other costumes that size seemed a tad small. However I got up the nerve to try it on, liked the way it fitted. Hemmed it about 4 inches as I am short. 5'2&#34;.loved it had a lot of compliments on it. Was very happy with it and it came earlier than promised which I was very pleased.
B00A6FOGMW|4|Good fabric and construction, but I think they run small AND they sit lower on the hip than is comfortable for me.
B007PM9KHK|5|No comme
B00NIK692W|3|bought this for teenage girl. it's a wired crown; when it arrived (it took awhile), I had to fix the petals because they were smashed. the greenery and floral tape were sparse so can see a little of the wire underneath it. but daughter loves it; she wore it all day no problem and had compliments. if you're crafty, you could add a little more to make it extra special. as it is, it looks dainty and home-made.
B00DRHACJ2|5|A shirt it fits
B004IRV6XG|3|purchase these for my husband who normally wears an 11 1/2 shoe size, so ordered a size 12.  But can't wear them as they are too short.  great sandal for the price, this company does not show a size 13 so did not bother to return.  Have purchased another pair size 13 from a different company.  I love mine that I purchased last year, will definitely be guying more for me too!
B00857O8V2|2|I bought these based on the high reviews and the affordable price. They were completely disappointing. They were too big/loose but too short. I did read the other reviews and they mentioned the length being ok. I'm 5'9 and they barely covered my knees. They aren't sheer so no worries about bending over. The material is really thin and doesn't hide any bumps. Don't waste your time or money on these.
B00KXMH0Z8|4|It's a hat for 13.00? Wtf? Delivery great
B00QVPOCNY|4|It was a little smaller than the creeper one that I purchased in the same XL size.  But he still loves it
B009GPPOQ0|5|Bought a few different colors. Love these socks. Perfect for bed or over leggings in cooler weather. They look great with boots too! Affordable and great quality.
B00O5KSTHW|5|Great quality, perfect socks!
B00JFLGTUK|5|Product worked well for me, easy to fit without help and is sturdy.
B000WO1FB2|4|The only reason we didn't have to return was that they were out of the size I needed, so I went up to a 14 when my kid normally wears a 10.  These are roomy, which is very cute on my 10 year old, but they aren't that long given how other size 14s would fit her.  Definitely size up!  The zipper is also very stiff and hard to operate (on the center bib pocket).  Otherwise these are very well made and classically designed.
B006U1EM66|3|I have a big head so they need to expand a little more to keep my ears covered
B00E22Y9LI|5|Ordered because they were out of it at Sports Chalet. I got the swim top on sale and the bottom, under $15 for all of it and I love it! It fits well, it doesn't cover as much of my backside as I would like but it isn't terrible.
B003ZW6JKK|5|Great FEEL and support. I would recommend this to any one who love  to bike ride.  Good Price too.<br /><br />Thanks for a good deal.
B00EBGGU94|3|I have previously purchased a corset from JustEmily and this size fit my well. However, this leather corset was way too large. I pondered going down 2 sizes. Unfortunately, JustEmily, did not have a smaller size for me which was disappointing.<br /><br />I am looking for leather, or faux leather for a Halloween costume. These corsets are so well made that I'd even wear them without it being Halloween. This has the busk closings which are not my favorite, I prefer the zipper but because it's so well made I didn't mind at all.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase more from JustEmily because their corset quality is very high. Just this particular corset was way too big. I tried a size down from another seller so we'll see how it goes.
B00L3TBR7W|5|My husband was very happy with this purchase. It fits well. It's lightweight. And he was pleased to know they had pockets! Only one concern. Because they're 100% cotton, they'll have to be washed in cold water and hanged to air dry. They fit just right, now. I'm sure they'll shrink if cared for in heat.
B006O5NIDG|4|Good fit, especially in the waist (I'm 5'6&#34;, 125 lbs, ordered a medium).  Beware though--if you have pets the fabric picks up fur.  Flattering fit oerall and a decent price.
B00MENY8UE|3|I was extremely excited for this shirt. I have been looking for a light blue striped button down for a while. The price was fantastic. I used the sizing chart that amazon provided (the hyperlink) and determined a large would fit me best. Don't use that sizing chart. I typically buy in the amazon app, so I never read the &#34;about&#34; for what I'm purchasing (Yes my fault) but when I see a hyperlink for a sizing chart, I assume that's the proper sizing. Anyway, the large was too small in the bust but fit perfectly everywhere else. The material is light and would be perfect to wear here in Texas. Shipping was fast. The shirt arrived in a couple days.  I would just warn busty girls to buy a size up.
B005E0CSNS|5|I purchased two of those hats for the toddler Mario Brother's in my family. The hats are made well and they look authentic. worth every penny!
B00NI1GYS0|3|It runs small but good material the only thing is that the Joker Kid company do not make it easier for you to returned. You have to paid for the return your self. So pants cost $22 return cost $10 no fair!
B00I5VS4P4|4|Cute and reasonable quality, arrived very fast, matching head band is a great match
B004HE50DW|5|Great!
B000QWA2T6|5|LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED IT,
B00LJB2P84|5|Excellent item
B00EAKYP3O|5|This is a very comfortable, very cute, and very well fitting top. I am a size 4, 5'8&#34; tall and I ordered a small and it fits my thinner frame perfectly. It's extremely warm as well and very comfortable. It's a sweatshirt that's comfortable enough to sleep in as well as stylish and cute enough to go out in. I made the mistake of assuming the print on the shoulders were lace; it's not lace. It is in fact a print which I'm actually happier with because it's winter time now and I wouldn't want my shoulders to be cold. I would recommend this to ladies with a small-medium sized bust, it may be uncomfortable with those who are well endowed in the chest area.<br />Sleeves are long enough for my longer arms and the length in the torso is perfect; covers most of the zipper on my pants and the belt area as well. Would not expose my backside or stomach if I were to exercise in it or lift my arms. Perfect product!
B00LXTT03A|5|Love these pajamas!
B00M4D5LCI|5|I thought I had ordered the p.j's in blue no matter I think they are so comfortable I would order again
B0000868MT|3|The leg still isn't as long as I would like, but I have yet to find a knee lenght girdle. This one is not ample enough in the rear so that the rear dips and does not come up to the waist while the waist is slightly high. This is in a perfect size for me otherwise. If I had gotten it smaller, it wouldn't fit my thighs. If I had gotten it larger, it would fit my hips at all. The problem is that this is not a custom cut and I have unusual dimensions. So, it's okay. If have more common dimensions, this will probably fit you well.
B00OIGI0VI|5|Beautiful scarf. Perfect for the winter and summer as a light coverup for your neck. I gave this as a Secret Santa present to a friend and she loved it.
B00JJBCACW|5|Fit perfectly and it was her favorite outfit all summer.
B0096QYHNU|5|It us very very beautiful. My daughter lives it too much. It is good in look and price. Thank you
B00671EHQ4|1|The picture and title claim that the Triforce Symbol is \\"GOLD\\" but I was shipped a shirt with a boring GREY emblem. COMPLETE RIPOFF! DO NOT BUY! Unless of course you actually want a GREY Triforce!
B00DVW6ZMG|3|Well, at least they are white socks... The quality isn't exactly what I would call great, and they feel very fragile. They are very soft though, almost uncomfortably soft... They´re maybe a bit too thin... Especially on the heel. Kinda loose took....
B00CJ6YMZM|5|I bought this dress last Christmas and got so many compliments! I still wear this dress when I go swing dancing and get compliments there too. It isnt as deep of a red as it is in the picture but I love it all the same. The lace is starting to fray a bit in the armpit area...but I still love this dress haha.  It is a good deal and I have amazon prim so it came really fast. A little details about my size for refference (4'10'' about 114lbs) 32C bra size and I think I am a 38 in the hips and I got the small and it fits great and isn't uncomfortable around my arms like some quarter sleeves sometimes are. This is super cute and I totally recommend it.
B001DWNJ70|5|I love this brand, these hats are amazing.  They keep their shape and stay on well, I've purchased about 10 of these hats and have loved all of them.  Just one thing to note, when buying the hats with desings order a size up because they generally tend to run a little smaller.
B00GLQ7TOM|5|The item arrived fast and in perfect condition. My daughter is a size 3 and I ordered a small. It fits very nice but if you want it to fit over sized, like a large top or dress like than I would go larger.
B008PBJZNY|5|These Dockers are amazing.  They look stylish at a very low price.  They fit beautifully and are very comfortable.
B00XP5LUMY|5|I say it is somewhat small but I do have a larger head. But overall I love this hat. I work outside about 7 hours a day and it keep the sun off my ears and off my neck. Plus the because of the material you can fold it up and put it away with little room taken up.
B0060HKDBS|2|Wish it came in a DDD.  It is so hard to find a 32DDD that I thought I would try but it was uncomfortably small.
B006ZVYQQ2|5|My son got these for vacation, they fit really well, great fabric.  Order received timely.  After washing they still look great!
B008H2ETCS|3|Very light, no cushion, very inexpensive, I wear them for house slippers . . .  very comfortable in the summer. Really can't complain.
B000LNHLU8|5|This item was purchased for my 16 year old Granddaughter, who needed this type wig, for an Anime convention.  She was satisfied with the wig, it was exactly, what she needed to fit the costume she wore.  The wig was well styled.  In excellent condition, and exactly as described.
B00IZFNNUQ|5|Very comfortable, nice material.
B0008EOF86|5|Great fit, great look, great price delivered to my door.<br />What else can you say about a pair of jeans?
B008X27V7M|3|They run small, so up the size when ordering
B00HQO69SU|5|Bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  It is the most beautiful  blue, soft and cozy and fit<br />like a dream.  Thinking of getting one for myself.  Gorgeous!
B00KYSDMHQ|3|Good for Phx, AZ summer.
B003IBLDS6|4|Great quality costume for the price. Fit was a little shorter than expected from shoulder to the crotch area, but thankfully fit well at the time we needed it. The bell is real and the detail is pretty great. We didn't end up using the shoe covers since our son was walking. The hood was a little big so my wife did put a couple stitches in the back securing it to the body of the costume to keep it from sliding into his face. Overall still happy with the purchase and was definitely the cutest little cow around! Tons of compliments on it.
B001EGY07I|4|My husband is 6'5\\", weighs 235 lbs and is very well built (muscular arms, back and chest) so this costume was perfect for him!  He could be a gladiator anyways  ;)  We used it at a party a year ago, and I imagine it will resurface for another party in the coming years.  It's a good buy.
B00MC9RYQ0|5|Very lovely dress
B00GD0YKGG|5|Just received this item and I love it! It's so adorable, warm and well made. Great for either a boy or girl.
B00ET71CIE|5|I ordered these for a friend to give to her &#34;mature&#34; ladies at church. We were more than pleased. Perfect simple useful gift. They came quickly and made me look amazing to her. She didn't know where to look to find them. Soft colors. Beautiful detail.
B001LFP0EO|2|I out grew this very quickly!  I even went by the size chart on the website!  As other reviews state it creases in the back & makes extra rolls on top of the band.  Can not wear it under any form fitting clothes because of the crease/gold it makes.  I was so looking forward to using it too
B00OKQ8ZXO|5|This is such an adorable headband. It is perfect for Halloween, or even year round. The little spider on the side is so cute with a purple glitter abdomen. His little legs are made of springs with glitter accents. The only problem is that these little springy legs can get caught up in your hair, especially if it is long. Other than that this is a super cute accessory.
B00J2R38YM|4|Jacket fits well, is lightweight and looks great. however the stitching on the arms is unraveling and is unsightly. I will be able to exchange hopefully. Otherwise this jacket is what I was expecting and wanted.
B0048G4MW4|5|Nice bow tie!  Color is good, and the stretchy neck band is comfortable!
B000B6S186|5|Makes any lace-up sneaker into a snug fitting slip-on that only ever has to be tied once, and kids can put on their own shoes.  Fellow moms at my kids' school want to know how to get these as soon as they notice them.
B008KWXMBE|5|Fits very good and comes with scarf and seems like good quality-especially for the price! I would buy another one.
B00NWXH5AK|5|Great short!
B0084XSZ02|5|I absolutely loved this on both my daughter and her doll! Great value. I intend to buy her another one at Christmas. Thank you!
B00T86DM3O|5|Love the color. The straps on the dress are too long, but that is an easy alteration. Nice quality fabruc!
B0018OKY8A|5|Wow owesome
B00154FZSW|3|i love the bra but its def way to tight around. other then that its just just will have to go out and get an extender for it.
B00HJH2Q5O|2|Super ugly style, I laughed when I put them on then sent them right back!
B00GJ8DLGC|3|These are ok but would somebody please make socks that don't put your toes in a vise? Come on. I have average size feet, 9 1/2 shoe, and the 10-13 socks are too tight. They also are too tight around the leg.
B00KMUOO8C|5|she will love it
B002IRLF3Y|5|The mask if cheap and uncomfortable. Fortunately, I did not want or need the mask as I planned to do my own make-up. So I bought this strictly for the costume, which did not disappoint at all! It fit fine and I considered it a great deal for what I paid.
B001QBTAK8|5|large was a great fit, really like the product and will continue to purchase more shirts. The only thing that I would do to improve it would be to make the shirt material a litter thicker, but hey, then the price would not be as great as it is. The sizing is great.
B00DWC2PII|5|Very nice came quick and wear super!
B005P8B7WC|5|It's exactly as advertised - all the warmth without the bulk. My only problem is that the shoulders are a bit tight. I wouldn't say this is an \\"athletic fit,\\" but as a guy 6'2\\" and 225 lbs, I have limited movement in the shoulder area. I still really enjoy the jacket.
B00L0QPC06|2|Size is fitted,but I received shoulder side cloth teared ,its damaged shirt.thank you sending me return slip.
B000TQSYKS|5|Comfortable and durable. My preferred brand.
B000FXUXC2|5|My son just got two pairs of these dungarees and absolutely LOVES them :) I would buy more for him in the future.
B008G7HWUA|5|I ordered 2 of these they are so great!
B00NHH9W20|5|Really good product.
B00IW21TL2|2|They're fun socks to wear, but very cheap. After 2-3 wears, one of them starts developing a tear. I was a little disappointed.
B004HN4FSE|5|the dress is so beautiful,perfect for my daughters prom,but because she is so tiny the small is just a little bit big on her.but its still perfect.
B008RMH5PQ|5|The design and construction of these pants are very good.
B0037Z7BIE|5|It is soft and hold 6 cards visibly plut a visible I.D. window and a slot under 3 of the cards in the middle. I like it alot but don't understand why it cost $70?
B00CQKVRCW|5|Cool, loose, not fitted.  Not see through!  Love it.  I cut off the sleeve tabs because they kind of hung down.  I still roll up the sleeves and they stay fine.
B00JF5NOKE|1|Just not right at all....  Too small on top, too big on bottom....  Sized inaccurately and poorly constructed  Would not purchase again.
B00FRBPONK|5|I was hesitant to buy this since there were no reviews but the price dropped significantly and I really liked the design so I went for it. the shirt fits perfectly (I'm a size 8 and got a M) and I really like it. the zippers on the shoulders are a bit deceiving on the picture, I thought that once opened they would increase the neck widening but they don't....they are just sitting a little forward from the shoulders and open into nothing.....not a big problem, just not what I expected from the picture. Overall a very god buy and my oldest son loves my &#34;tigger shirt&#34; :)
B00EKTW2LW|5|The only disadvantage of this product is high acrylic content, however, it is so stylish that my BF always wears it, although he has many other scarves to try on.
B00605YT6U|5|This was a gift to family member but, was told that the fit is perfect and the feel of the material is very comfortable.  Using it in Florida and they love the fact that it is cool max material.
B00JBS9T8Q|5|Super comfortable and cute. Love it
B00V5CPVPG|3|I like the hat, but I expected  it to be the color of the photo and its more of a dark plum color rather then a bright purple shade.
B001ELL67U|5|I like to have support, form and comfort. This bra is great for support when running! It maintains my breast high and proud and with support.
B00422M6FE|5|i soooo love this wallet! product came on time. i love it. i wish for lower shipping cost next time so i could order more. and more choices as well.
B00GIGM576|2|Great product but they run really small... If you order them be ready to wait a while to get them...
B00OBG2HOQ|4|It is a great top and matches a few bottoms that I have
B00QS8E6HG|5|Cute and very functional. I will use this for years to come.
B003ILVV9C|5|This is my favorite top to work out in because it's so light, breathable and comfortable. I purchased a size up from my usual (S) and the fit is loose, but not too revealing. I'm able to wear it with jeans and a regular bra for a casual outfit, or with a sports bra to the gym. The fabric is lightweight compared to typical jersey t-shirt material, but not too sheer. It's a fantastic deal for Amazon's sale price, and I'm planning on stocking up on them for the summer!
B00UVHB9U2|5|Comfortable like the way it feels.
B00K6IB3KC|5|Nice
B00WFO94MY|5|I love my new wig and my new look.
B00UZAEBJG|1|XL in childrens sizes...  not adult. My 10 year old can wear them.
B00LOZQUKE|5|Great product; arrived in plenty of time, fitted perfectly. All round success!
B00DZM50HS|3|No problems
B000A521NY|3|Nice product which is well made.  Personally, I find the camisole lives up to the \\"torso trim\\" expectation but it doesn't serve as a very well structured \\"bra\\".  I expect it would be wonderful for those of you with a smaller bust who don't need support or shaping though !
B007SV20X4|4|Somewhat small
B00LMNHWXM|5|Bought for my daughters first birthday and I loved it she looked absolutely adorable! It was a big hit at the party
B00PF0C06W|4|In the picture, it looked to me like this plaid had some purple in it.  It doesn't.  Its sort of a denimy color.  It looks very nice with blue jeans.
B00NBGFE1U|5|Everything was perfect. The shipping took super duper long, and arrived around 2:00am, but I would highly recommend these leggings to other ladies. Only for the ones who don't mind a lot of looks and head turns(;
B00F59HKUO|5|My two granddaughters absolutely love this hoodie.  It's colorful, cute, and has so many fancy touches, it is adorable.  I would recommend for any little girl who loves My Little Pony stuff.
B00CS6R5VQ|4|Fit was great. True to size. Very comfortable!!
B00Q8IUEVS|1|I'm not happy that the photo failed to show the back of the hat.  The hat is unwearable.
B00KQ53H9U|5|Love!
B00F2ZCQ28|5|exactly what i wanted
B00H9ZOROY|5|Love it
B00CDOEA3O|4|I ordered the medium at first since the top looked pretty tight on the model and I assumed that's how big the small would be, and I'm a 32C.  The top was way, way, WAY too loose.  I had to pinch off about 2 inches of the band in order to make it seem to fit.  The bottoms were so big they wouldn't even stay on.  However, the quality is very nice and it was very comfortable.  I'm reordering this in a small since it's so cheap.  Hopefully that one fits better.
B006WKB9YS|5|I ordered this ID holder 3 days ago and got it in the mail today, I definitely did not expect that and was pleasantly suprised! The product itself is great quality, exactly what I wanted. Perfect for some cards and my keys. And for the price!!! Definitely recommend.
B00IDJNEBW|4|nice quality timely delivery
B00HVXXI2Q|5|Great
B009WB8O88|5|Very comfortable, thicker heel is great but the latch skull detail and unique way they fasten are worth it. Wore for hours and still great comfort.
B00QNLC4FE|5|Awesome good concert hat and good looking
B007RP6U4Q|3|Low quality decal
B007A11JWU|1|The best part about these gloves is that they look ok. Nothing else about these gloves are even worth the $30 price tag.<br /><br />I play Milsim Airsoft. I like my gloves to be a true fit, especially on my trigger finger. Sad part is every other part of this glove is a little too snug EXCEPT the trigger finger itself which is a size too big.<br /><br />Not only is sizing awkward, but the quality is poor and comfort is ZERO. After 1 day of Airsoft, every part of the fabric and the stitching is annoying and stabs and irritates my hands as well as the seams came loose on the middle finger which I assume means it will soon fall apart.<br /><br />I have since picked up a pair of Valken Tactical Impact Full Finger Gloves. I expected better from UA but they seemed to have dropped off in quality in recent years.
B000WLPW2I|4|it was nice material and fit just right
B007GQNQUW|5|It is a big discount ,and it is very comfortble,my wife like it very much,I have bought it twice, and I will come back to buy it again
B004LVOW30|5|My daughter looks soooo cute in this outfit. I bought the matching hat too. My only advice would be not to spray stain remover on it. I did and rubbed it with a wash cloth and the black started to rub off along with the white dots. Thankfully it was not noticeable. wash on delicate and hang dry!
B00H30FXSO|4|The suit is fantastic!! The item was shipped quickly and the seller is very accommodating to resolve any issues! The quality of the fabric is great. I have some Brooks Brother suits and the price on these suits are really attractive when you look at the fabric they claim they use. I can say that the fabric felt better and softer than some of my Brooks Brother suits. Some of the sewing can be better, looks like it was done with a machine and done quickly, but the cut and fit was just what I wanted. Once I got the pants hemmed, everything looked awesome!<br /><br />I bought a brown and a blue one just because it fit me so well. I am on the shorter side at 5'9&#34; and stocky build. I wear a 46R from normal suits but they tend to be a little long one me. This 46R was just right being the slim fit version. I will slowly start to buy all the other colors just because the fit is so great for my build.
B009AWJ1MW|5|Good looking.  They make me look good too!
B0007UO89C|3|Good quality and price, compared with similar products. I recommend it without doubts. Fit and comfortable as expected. Good decision
B00LPS7EWI|5|I love these shirts! Especially this one in particular. The colors are so vibrant and pretty. I would recommend this!
B00T5N2FAG|5|excelente producto
B008I582CW|5|I'm a bigger guy and these fit well. I'll definitely order more as the need arises.
B00N8168VS|4|Excellent material
B00JJWCP6M|5|Very satisfied
B00IKBH64Y|5|I purchased the shirt because it was advertised as &#34;wrinkle free&#34; I don't have an iron. Well, its wrinkle free and I don't have to buy an iron, and an ironing board.
B00JZJ1SBM|5|Quality n desine is too good
B0098W8FYY|4|Quality is decent, but shirts run a little on the small side. Would suggest you order a.size larger than you normally need
B00817EA82|4|Unlike some others these Fruit of the Loom actually fit perfectly.No sagging at the back,no pinching,and soft feeling.Will gladly purchase again.
B005CSP082|5|It is very comfortable to wear and is good not only for outside, but also in a cold room. It doesn't feel bulky.
B00MUUNUXC|5|The pockets are an unexpected surprise ! I really love it and works great with leggings
B00H8VAN9W|5|... great new color ... super flattering - no padding - makes the girls look terrific !!!
B003P2VQ0S|1|no elastic in this one..... too small and uncomfortable........other 40DDD's fit fine.  This type bra is for much smaller bodies
B00BQHJV38|5|Beautiful skirt, I have the same style in khaki color and I was so happy to see it in gray too. Awesome fit, very nice quality fabric, the skirt is fully lined, just amazing. Its good for work or church because its more of a dress up style skirt.
B005GVCOWU|4|I liked it. Felt for the price it was fine. It does shrink but read that in other reviews and sized accordingly. Very nice casual pants thought I do wear them to work (office) when I've not done laundry that week. Great for travel.
B00FW7K4T8|4|It fits as expected but takes some getting use to. Especially since this is my first time wearing something like this but it is worth the buy because it does what it says it would.
B0040DKIAU|4|A little smaller than anticipated. I usually wear calvin klein bras though, for reference.
B00H3FDK34|3|I'm a 34C and I got a size medium. The cups are sewn in the band so they don't shift around, but they are sewn waaay too close together! This caused major side boob and overall a weird look. So I used a seam ripper and took out some stitching that attached the cups to the band. After I did this and the cups could freely slide (imagine a triangle bathing suit) the bra looked super cute and I loved it.
B00CYPPNHO|5|Perfect. ..awesome. ..amazing.
B00B6UEN7Y|5|i love it will order more in the future--<br />very good for head coverage -specially for the iyawo's that have to have their head cover --for a while
B007XGEEH4|2|I have been searching for this exact pink/purple color combination for years.  I should have been thrilled...but I was NOT.  When the socks arrived, the colors were good.  However, the texture of the yarn used to make the socks is stiff and uncomfortable with almost no stretch to it.  Unless you're a child or a stick-insect model, these socks are too narrow.  There's plenty of length, it's just that they will not stretch properly to fit a normal adult woman's leg (much less a man's leg -- since these are advertised as unisex clown socks).  The construction is odd in another way, too -- there are little bits of elastic throughout the ENTIRE sock (not just the top cuff).  This means that when the sock is stretched even a tiny bit, you see little white lines throughout the entire body of the sock.  That in turn means that the color is &#34;watered down&#34; and loses its vibrant pink and purple tones.  Another problem with using that much elastic is that it will eventually deteriorate and crumble into little bits.  How many of us have old socks in our drawer that did that back in the day?  All-in-all this is a very disappointing product...and my search for the perfect pink/purple socks continues.
B00CWKUCRM|1|Did not fit as a size 10-12 should.
B006TQHVU6|5|The graphic and colors are as shown and as described. The sleeves are long and go to the mid hand which is what I like. The length is long and the fit is good, which is also what I expected and what I like. The material is thin raglan which is what you would look for in a shirt like this. I would recommend.
B005ZV9W6C|5|I had been looking for a belt that had the same quality of harness or belting leather for quite some time.  I have always disappointed with the \\"quality\\" belts that are found in the large department stores, and I am tired of paying astronomical prices for a well made belt, though I must admit that in the past I have indulged myself with high quality alligator in the past. I only mention that to put my taste for quality in perspective.<br /><br />I was about to purchase a Filson harness leather belt when, at the last moment before leaving the country empty handed, I came across Yourtack on Amazon, and decided to give them a try.  I am so happy that I bought the belt from them.  Their price is unbelievably low when you see the value they represent.  I don't want them to raise their prices, but I would be willing to pay twice as much as they charged for one of their belts.  I bought a Ranger style belt and asked for expedited delivery, as well as, a change in the buckle.  Their normal buckle is solid brass and I wanted to have the silver tone buckle to match my watch band, so I called them up to speak with customer service. I was presently greeted and dealt with in the nicest fashion, and my requests were handled beautifully.  This is the way to do business properly and professionally.<br /><br />The belt arrived in time, and I have worn it everyday since receiving it.  My only problem now is that I don't think it will wear out for years!  I plan to buy a couple of more from them in different colors and styles because without a doubt, they make a great product at a great price.  Do not hesitate to purchase from Yourtack.  I assure you that you will notbe disappointed in any way.
B00841CDU2|4|I wish this robe was longer. I had the sleeve embroidered, and it looks really nice. I went to iron the item, on the absolute lowest heat setting on my iron, and it burned the second I even got close. I found this annoying because there is no care tag in the product. I'm glad that I tested the iron on the end of the belt, but still. Still a very pretty product.
B000HQAXO0|5|My husband loved his shirt just like he is crazy about Jack Bauer!
B005FOIVT8|3|I bought this to replace a Members Only Racer I've worn and loved for 10+ years.  Quality is OK, but there are a few features missing: no zipper on the inside pocket, no snaps on outside pockets.  It also has that annoying collar strap, with no neat way to fold it out of the way.  Sizing is definitely on the small side, and I had to exchange my Large (actually 38) for an X-Large.  It still is slightly tight around the shoulders (Asian cut), and if you wear athletic sized shirts, you might not like the fit.
B00OMPTUP0|5|great price and product
B00R18BGBQ|2|Nice material, fit as expected, good color BUT the buttons were scratched!!! Returing ASAP!
B001H0FX22|5|My brother wanted these for Christmas was able to get some from me and my sister great fine and price
B00OBLIQIM|5|Great!
B0029U0XC4|5|As soon as I received it in the post I couldn't wait to try it on and I wasn't disapointed.<br />You cannot buy this kind of bra in any shop (I have tried) So you have to get it through Amazon but no problem I didn't even have to wait very long before I received it in the post.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.
B00N3RBCLS|5|Exactly what we wanted. Thank you
B00IQJ1VWI|3|Cute dress but it was very large and also quite long. I followed the size chart and also noted it was junior sizing. I could have ordered a small easily as the dress has a relaxed stye. The color was nice and true to the photo but it seemed more maternal than fun and fresh. Even the neckline was quite modest. I am only 5'2&#34; so I would say if you are under 5'7&#34; and you like a longer dress then it will work, otherwise you should plan on hemming it a few inches. Also a belt is essential to give the garment shape. This dress would work as a maternity dress.
B005M4ZI56|4|Great product. I had one I brought in Hawaii but after many years got very weary. This is a great hat you can't find anywhere else but Hawaii!!
B009SPJ3IS|5|This is the first pair of diabetic socks I have tried.  They are very cushioned and warm, the tops, as expected, are VERY soft and do not bind at all.  Despite all of that, they do not slide down! Recommended!
B000WWVIOI|3|I like the belt well enough but the material on the back of it started coming off after only a few times wearing it.  We will see how long it takes before the metal rings come out.
B007M684C6|5|Was just what I wanted and was long enough to not show my tummy.
B00PESU4FY|5|LOVELY AND JUST PERFECT FOR SUMMER OR WARM WEATHER FOR USE AS A COVER UP OR TO WEAR WITH JEANS!
B00Y3I6EOG|5|It looks completely same as the photo. intensos.De colors very good size.
B00HI88M3O|5|Love these socks!!  They are so soft and comfortable to wear.  Unfortunately, I think I ruined the while washing and drying.  Read the care label!!!  I plan to purchase them again because they are that comfortable.
B004LQ0QS0|3|I purchased these slacks for my son ... Then returned them.  He has several pairs of Haggar slacks that fit well and are excellent quality for the price.  Unfortunately, the \\"Metro\\" cut is made for a really skinny man, with no butt, no thighs.  This fit is inappropriate for an active man - bending over could end in embarrassment.  I must say, though, despite the poor fit, the slacks were the usual Haggar quality - well finished with reinforced seams and pockets.  By the way, his size is 32x32 so he wouldn't be considered overweight or hefty.
B002S74AYK|5|I'm 5' 10&#34; 150 pounds. I bought a medium size. Jacket is a little big on me but if i wear a thick sweater it fits good. Very warm in 40 degree weather thus far. Ill see how it is when it gets below freezing here in NY. Love the way it looks and feels. The color in the inside is different than in the picture. It came in dark grey or a light black; I was a little disappointed but over all its a great jacket.
B00L62COMI|3|This fit me good but they are way to short.
B013EHVDEM|5|Love love love it!!it fits perfectly. Fast shipping as well. 5 star indeed!
B001UK7U2A|5|Good quality, the hat is very strong.  This is not a flimsy soft hat.  very rigid.  I got it to take on a cruise with it.  Everyone loved it.
B00H9VS1KY|4|The top is very long.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 124 and this could easily be worn as a dress (not that I would).  However, the top itself is gorgeous.  I typically wear it off-shoulder and with leggings.  Very cute.
B00DR1EZ8M|5|Good quality, good looking, great idea for a belt.
B00127WTI6|2|This just didn't work well for me. The lace was scratchy, the cups were too big, and it was *incredibly* hard to put on.<br /><br />The first might have been helped by washing it, and the second suggests that I might need something other than my usual size. But given that I would only be able to wear it when I has someone to help me get dressed, it wasn't worth going through a cycle of exchanges to try.<br /><br />Mind you, all of those things have also been true of other long-line bras I've tried. I may need to just give up. YMMV.
B00GFAKNJW|5|this very nice, size is good ..
B00RMJZFES|4|Little bit small but my wife likes lt...
B00DRED5N0|2|so My little girl is 9 months old, and this was waaaayyyy too small on her.  She is large for her age (90% percentile) but even so I thought maybe she could fit in.  Also glitter got EVERYWHERE
B00JE7SDZY|3|Love them! Very sexy. I ordered a small and I wear a 3.
B004HWL5FQ|5|My daughter loves it!
B0067N9W76|4|the hands are great looking they are part of a prop that i am making they are going to be great looking with the mask that i bought thanks for making them available
B000Q60ED6|3|These overalls are for sure made for painters.  The fabric is quite stiff and I anticipate will take a number of washings to soften.  Also, they require significant ironing after laundering, due to considerable wrinkling.  The fit is good and true to the description.  The color is pure white.  Will have to see how durable they are.  I have a pair of old OshKosh overalls that have lasted over 15 years through many washings.
B00H2UFK38|5|Gave to a friend who just moved away..so she wouldn't forget us and all the great things that happened in her life while she lived here&#62;
B002ZE5ZUY|1|Bad
B00O38YA56|5|son very pleased with it.  It launders well and fits as expected.
B0089DX2C8|5|Being fair skinned it covered me completely and the drawstring was adjustable enough to keep it on my head despite the ocean winds. It is a large hat so more petite folks may have issues. Beautiful and glamorous!
B00KJF30A8|3|The material was too thin, almost see through. I returned.
B008YJIF8S|2|I like the design of this dress however the quality of the material is not as great. The dress is slightly smaller than the usual size that I usually buy.
B00FQVHE2U|5|Very nice shirt
B00KQ2LWPY|3|Cute and soft, but very large.
B00I94MLL0|5|well done
B00MNP1D06|4|Soft and comfortable.
B00E1ZOY02|3|I'm disappointed in the quality of this shirt. I read the reviews and saw that it ran small, so I took a chance on the largest size. It is a little small for my taste, but it fits well enough for a sleep garment - it's definitely not uncomfortable. The fabric is nice. It's soft and has some stretch to it. However, the first time I washed it, it shrank even though I washed it in cold water and only air dried it with no heat. It still fits but is quite short now, which means I have to have some sleep shorts or yoga pants with it in order to be covered when my roommate is home!<br /><br />I'm disappointed because I've bought and loved Jockey products over the course of about 20 years. The quality used to be outstanding, and their clothing really lasted. They have definitely started sacrificing quality in order to reap more profit, like a lot of clothing companies over the years.
B00DU7JUJC|5|Very cute!
B00MCW8ZFQ|5|Good quality feel and look to it. Very pleased
B00960QZGI|2|I was pretty disappointed that the belt on this dress is just a loose ribbon- not what I expected.<br /><br />We've yet to try it on or wash, but it looks like it will fit.
B007AK1LW4|5|Wife loves them.
B002SG7AR0|5|This is a lovely item, very nice quality, cute and practical.<br />The only problem is that I believed the reviews saying that this one is too big for a preemie and would fit a full-term baby until 3 months. So I bought it for my full-term boy. In fact it is ideal size for newborns (our boy is 50 percentile for weight and 85 for height). By now when he is 1 month old it is getting a little short. I don't think it will last much longer.<br />Of course, this is not a mistake on manufacturer's side - i guess it would fit a preemie for a long time. But for full-term babies this is not very practical. Although, again, very good quality
B007C2SKTW|5|The vibrant blue and other colors jump out at you. The material feels great and has been holding up in the wash.
B00KRGB4I4|5|My daughter just loves theses pajamas. They fit well.
B000N62M9S|5|This is a good jacket for the money, fits just right perfect for the upcoming spring just what you would expect from Dickies. I would recommend this jacket to any one
B0036GORV8|5|Wow, I feel like I've been waiting all my life for this bra! Having always been well-endowed by nature, I never was able to wear the cute, fun bras like all my friends wore. And now Elomi comes out with a bra that gives me great support and slightly minimizing my 34Gs -- everything I want in a bra plus a fun leopard print! I highly recommend this bra to all overly-blessed women who are tired of plain, sturdy-looking beige and white bras.
B00GHUJG0M|3|the arms were kinda snug everywhere else it fit comfy....
B005FN0U3O|4|She likes these, but likes the t-back model better.  She says the t-back style stays up on her shoulders much better.
B002PBQROA|5|I just want to say that this wig that I purchased made it in time for halloween. I did regular shipping and they ship fast! I also recieved two free items. A cute little wooden bamboo spoon which I use for make to mix things with or to grab pigments and such.  Also it came with a eco-friendly towel.  I used that to wash and wipe my make up brushes with.  The customer service was great and shipping was fast.  I believe I receieved the wig between 2-3 days.  The wig was a bit hard to work with because I don't normally use wigs.  The wig looked exactly like how the picture is and for me I just had to play with it to make it look more Lady Gaga-ish because that was what I was shooting for on Halloween. I was a super satisfied customer!
B00NAXEP50|4|i was pleased that my grandson likes it and enjoying it
B0002OQCIS|4|While the silk is beautiful quality, as others have mentioned they are too short!  I usually get a 32 or 33 length for pants and these must be 28 or shorter (I bought size small).  I still like them though because I just wear them as lounge pants...
B008HA43ZS|5|Love it
B008KK1L64|1|The dress is too small. But there is a hole in the sleeve. Defective  It is hard to imagine, such a large factory, made this dress.
B00D8XQJUQ|5|Love it! Great service, great fit and overall fantastic product!
B001FQMDRQ|1|I bought the pink color...it is a pretty shade of pink, but the fabric is so thin and see thru, I'm sending it back.  I'm really bummed, I needed a pink shirt and I've bought this brand before and received a nice quality shirt
B00NKYMDH6|5|I love it! It is so cute and one of the warmest coats I have had!  My daughter bought me the beige one for Christmas and I wanted this one just for fun. Unfortunately my 19 year old fell in love with it also and has sort of adopted it. GREAT BUY!
B00MKKZ1ZM|5|Thanks Very Much For My Comfortable Underwear!!!!!  I'm Very Happy With Them!!!!!  Just Like My Others Love Them Thanks You and Plan In The Near Future Possibly Getting More Thanks!!  David
B00WG5L1M8|5|I SENT BACK TOO SMALL EVEN THOUGH IT SAID XL THAT WAS NOT XL.
B00NYBH6HW|5|Love my new jeans
B006SRTGC2|5|I thought i would shrink after one wash but, it did not so, it is still very little large to me but, the cloth, comfort is excellent and it does 100% what it mean to do.<br />Planning to order one more but &#34;small size&#34; now LOL
B00JSPX226|5|nice and confortable.
B00QL1TYWW|1|I bought these thinking they would be a little thicker than the usual workout pants.  Very disappointed as they are pretty thin. Will not purchase them again
B00FDQC8UQ|5|It was time to clean out the underwear drawer and size up.  Purchased Calvin Klein, Jockey and Hanes.  These by far have the most style, nicer quality of cotton and best fit.  My son is a small 10 year old whose very fit and trim.  These and the other style of Klein's were by far his fans.
B000KSI4OG|5|Much lighter in weight than my old one. For someone looking for a breast wallet this is the ticket. Seems to be a high quality product, well constructed.
B006TCLLJW|2|Definitely smaller than other clothes in this size.
B003ZFUN22|1|I bought Tshirts in the past but this was unimpressive. The print lasted but the Tshirt quality was poor to see the least!
B002OG6JGW|5|Its the Tits! its literally that simple
B00857QBCQ|5|Great support.
B00BZ5UW0C|4|I liked it ....This mask as like that they show.
B003KXX5FQ|3|It did not look like the picture, it was not as full. I ended up not wearing it with the costume I had, but may wear it at a later time.
B009FHN696|4|The footed pajamas are attractive and made of good material. They will be comfortable to wear and easy to wash.
B00HD5FTYM|5|Great product, fits as expected
B00TEU8YKK|5|I was a bit hesitant to purchase this since there were no other reviews but I'm very glad I did! I'm about to have my second baby boy April 2015 and I had been on the search for cute and reasonably priced nursing camis/tanks.<br />I ordered the XL Classic Stripes cami.<br />I usually wear size Large but was afraid it might be too small. I think I would have been fine with the large and it would have been true to fit since this XL is a bit loose on me.<br />The material is nice and soft.<br />I think this can also be worn during pregnancy, I am currently 33 weeks pregnant and it is long and Flowy and covers my bump and I think it will accommodate my bump nicely in the last few weeks of pregnancy.<br />The straps are adjustable and there are clips on both sides of the straps to unhook for nursing.<br />Overall I love this cami!
B006UAKVHQ|5|They are the most comfortable Suki pair I own. I have them in two different sizes in case my weight changes. They seem to have little more room around thighs compared to other similar (in terms of fabric composition) Suki styles. The fabric is the best I have seen as far as Silver Jeans go. I hope they never discontinue this style.
B000F7PLOI|5|Great quality product and price. I am very happy with the company, they are very good with correspondance and satisfaction is guaranteed.  Very happy with all that I have bought from this company.
B00H2V3JLM|4|comes in small sizes, so watch when you buy
B000K24JFU|4|I purchased this Greyhound charm as a gift for a family member who LOVES Greyhounds and she went CRAZY over it.  The charm is actually VERY NICE for the money paid.  I bought the jewelry for a pre-teen.  However, it would be suitable for anyone that loves Greyhounds.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received the item--there is quite a bit of detail in the piece.  It is well-crafted charm, especially for the price.
B00AWJ6QPC|4|This is wondrful! It is nice and snug which helps hold in the jiggly bits but not so tight that is restricts breathing. It is true to size. The only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it were just slightly longer...and that there were some form of &#34;locking&#34; mechanism for the zipper (it is really painful when the zipper slips down while working out). I can definitely see a difference in skin texture after wearing it and it does increase sweat production. Great product!!!
B0042ZWM96|4|This glove is covered with real sequins sewen on. It says it is iridescent but it is actually silver in color and very \\"sparkley\\" It might be a little big for a child. I bought it for my 9 year old grandson to wear at an ice show. May have to make an adjustment to fit him but it will look good under the lights.
B001AYE50Q|2|Made from very thin fabric, does not hold its shape.  Front section above bill needs addition support to properly hold its shape.  Look elsewhere if you want a good hat that holds it shape.
B001IMG4CM|2|The quality was ok but they are not very stretchy and were too tight for my husband who wears a size 9 1/2 shoe
B00A7QU958|5|Damn, I love these shirts as a skinny tall!  The fabric is still nicely stretchable after a few washes. One thing, the v neck starts around the top-mid of my pecs which is further down than I anticipated.
B006EVQGNO|5|I have purchased the mittens, newborn hat, and multiple pairs of booties for my daughter.  They stay on snuggly, keep her warm without overheating, and are adorable.  This is my new go-to gift for newborns!
B00B280V6W|5|I have been wearing no show socks for 3 years with boat shoes and tennis shoes. These are the best I have ever owned.  They offer full coverage of the foot without slipping off or down into the shoe.  They keep your feet dry and comfortable. I was concerned initially because they are only offered in the large size and I have small feet (6.5).  There was nothing to worry about they fit snuggly.  I will never buy another brand again.  This is an absolute must for summer.
B00L43F8A4|5|Great belt for great price
B007P1VG6Y|5|i wish i had this years ago. thats all. very happy with it. love it love it love it. great to keep body warm after warmup till time to perform
B00LXVWOG8|5|great
B00LAF9410|5|Just what i was looking for
B00MXLMHMS|5|👍
B00HV78FYI|5|I love it - great for the money
B004EENYY2|5|It's soft, it fits perfectly. I bought these to actually wear to bed and not just around the house at night. I don't get hot wearing them, and I don't have to worry about my legs rubbing together when the cat falls asleep on them during the night.<br />Sounds strange, but very pleased.<br />Got them for the concept. Keeping them for the feel and fit.
B00PS4QJI0|5|This sweater is of high quality - the knit is very soft and dense and my son loves it.  It is roomy enough to fit a shirt underneath and is something I will re-gift to another friend when he outgrows it.
B002HEXW0M|4|First off, this IS a VERY cute hat... the size, however is fishy.  The tag on the hat reads \\"6-12 mo.\\" but there is also a sticker tag over that which reads \\"0-6 mo.\\". My son is 6 months old & in the 50th percetile for all around size.  The hat fits him nicely, but I can't see it fitting him all the way to 12 months.  I would say the hat is more like a 3-9 month size (which is strange, but probably more accurate).
B00K757S30|5|Excelente
B002JHMY06|5|Good bibs orders them to work in and they seem to be doin good so far had them bout a month union made real warm I own a lot of carhartt apparel and they've done good so far shipping was bad tho had to call and reorder them nexus they got lost on the way would NOT recommend for hunting  good camo but too noisy
B00GABJU9U|2|Disapointed , it's not blue light but dark , very dark blue ! the size is ok a bit large at the waist , but ok for the size , but the color is NOT the same as the picture on amazon ! Carreful girlz !
B0088P457I|5|sexy love this...
B0065Q5WB0|4|This is a good product for the price.  I knew when purchasing, that this product was probably going to run small, but I went ahead and bought it anyway.  It is fine for use around the house and our semi private yard.  It is comfortable and much better than wearing an actual underwire bra.  It is a very thin and stretchy fabric.  It does not offer much support if you are large chested, but it is just fine for what I needed it for (comfort and some support).  It is definitely not for coverage (nipples) or for using as a sports bra.
B005I34IAC|4|Just what we wanted a good pair of work gloves that fit and  will hold up at a good price.
B00F1FCQBA|5|Gold Toe Softwear Socks are very comfortable.  They shrink some in the dryer but all you have to do is stretch them a little bit before you put them on and they are as comfortable as brand new.
B00JRJGA8G|3|too small
B000MX94BG|5|This is a terrific product - fit very well,  not too tight nor too<br />loose - I'm a small person and these help my clothes look<br />better.  I think they would be great for larger woman as well.
B009YRMZXU|5|Love this bra. It is so comfortable, and the cups look smooth under tee shirts. As some other reviewers have stated, you may wish to size up. I wear a 38B in all brands, but the band on the Large size was way too tight on my ribcage. Had to order another in X-Large. However, I don't believe that anyone who is more than a B cup would receive enough support from this bra.
B00KFBVMXS|5|I ordered two pairs and I love them. theyfit wonderfully. the galaxy ones are ridiculously soft. the smoke ones are a teeny bit see through though.
B00HQ51M40|5|everything went very well and is an excellent product and I look forward buying in this environment are very serious and responsible and I thank you very much
B00PIUO6BQ|5|Hello! That my little grandaughter jumped up and down when she received this gift was pure Joy! Thank you! It arrived on time!!!<br /><br />The best!!!
B00AK9TCZA|5|The pants fit really well, the material is comfortable, and the navy blue is dark, but doesn't look black like some other brands. I tried these on at a department store, but they didn't have the size I wanted, and thanks to Amazon, I saved an extra $10 off of their &#34;sale&#34; price.
B00HSC7F60|1|This product arrived with about 1/2 a foot of feathers missing so the string of the boa was showing. Unfortunately not usable so it was returned.
B00LCUDU9K|1|Not sure what human these are made for, but I've never seen a guy who would fit into these.  Maybe a girl?  They do not give you any kind of &#34;butt&#34; for starters. The tight legs and crotch made me claustrophobic. I think it's one of those items that is made in a foreign country for westerners...do they think all westerners are built like models with huge upper bodies with twelve pack abs and tiny legs?  These sucked and went right back in the box to be returned.
B0054YVB1E|4|There is no doubt that there are some men like myself whom don't know how to make a knot for a tie, and instead have tried alternate ties like clip-ons. But yet, there are some companies that have tried to change all that by being unconventional like Uno Lombero. They have developed the zip-up ties, and they actually fit great around my neck. All you have to simply do is zip it up to the collar by the small tip on the back of the tie. It actually fits great around my neck. I like how clever they have been, especially when so many companies stopped making alternative ties. These are definitely a great buy if you are looking for a great tie to get around your shirt.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Style & Quality: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B00CQ1OHE6|3|Loved the sweater, I normally wear a med but I got a large and it is tight on me. Maybe I should of ordered an extra large
B00UHCZ0EM|1|OK I got this shirt , ordered a 2x and it was so small it wouldn't even fit on a really skinny person ..I gave it to someone who is a size extra small and it wouldn't even fit her. If someone orders a 2x , why would they send an xxxxxs. This shirt would not even fit on a baby it was so small. They did refund me which was good but I waited 8 weeks  for the shirt and then it was so  small !!!!!!!
B003BQ05IM|5|The visor is exactly what I had been shopping for.<br />Love it.<br />Any lady golfer would, love it.<br />Fits beautifully
B003DA5YSM|5|The only thing is it took forever to get those socks out of the packaging.  They used ties that if you are not careful, you can cut the fabric of the socks.  Then you had to watch out that none of them fall on the floor for your darling kid to swallow!
B005OFLTT2|5|I have been looking for a couple of years for some briefs for my husband. Regular briefs are too baggy, he doesn't have the rear end to fill it out. And he just loves them. Will purchase more in the future.
B00KXFJWJW|4|Super cute shirt!!!  It totally fit... Just a narrow/fitted tank so ran a little small... Really comfy once worn and really cute!!!!
B00DQYPC28|5|Pants fit perfectly.  They are great for travel.
B00F2DA9LA|5|The boots are so cute and exactly what they look like online! They arrived within if not sooner than the arrival dates. I would recommend buying them to a friend.
B0059EPK3E|5|Really comfortable and looks nice. Very pleased with it and ordered 2 more now that I know they fit well
B00CALD5I6|5|This tie set looks better in person, it's perfect! The items arrived promptly and just as described. Landisun is one of my favorite and I highly recommend.
B002CM0Q6M|5|I was very satisfied with the product and the price.
B00NJ8C7PQ|2|This shirt fit ok, but it is not all that I expected. I thought the bottom was gathered, but it is not. It reminds me of a fancier t-shirt. I do wear it and it can be dressed up, but I am disappointed it it. I would not purchase another one.
B00LNWAM1G|5|I chose the pink color which stands out in my purse.  Plastic covers are sturdy.  I have the felling it will reside in my purse for a long time.
B005GLJG3K|2|I bought this hat for my teenage daughter but it is so narrow that I had to pass it down to my 10 year old. The teenager doesn't have a very large head - the sizing is just \\"off\\" with this hat.  I also didn't think it was of great quality. Seems thin and no where near as good as the Old Navy ones they had from last year.
B003UO67IM|5|After years of looking in glove departments of every store I went into, I decided to search Amazon for a replacement for my old, favorite driving gloves, which had finally disintegrated. These were priced well below others offered by this particular vendor and looked almost exactly like the ones I was replacing, so I gave it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. The leather and stitching seem flawless, and the gloves arrived much earlier than the outside delivery date I had been given. Interestingly, when I laid them on the counter at my local pharmacy, the woman behind the counter told me that her husband had been looking for a pair and - like me - had been unable to find them. I gave her the URL, and when I saw her recently, she told me that she had bought them and that her husband - again, like me - was very happy with them.
B006WIEY88|5|I really like the way this sweater fits me, slim and long in the sleeves, and comfortably close-fitting in the body. As other reviewers have noted, the length does seem a bit shorter than in the photo, but it's not a problem for me because I'm neither short nor long waisted. Also like other reviewers, I feel the sheerness of it requires either a cami underneath or a nude colored bra, but again it doesn't seem to be a big problem. It's a little sporty, which I like, and will be great alone or layered. Nice sweater.
B00L2Y8WJY|5|Cute
B00580L27M|5|We gave this to our son for Christmas because he is a Minecraft lover and plays it with his friends all the time.  He just LOVED the shirt and wears it every week.
B009FG8ELM|1|The socks are not 100 percent cotton either, they feel like nylon socks. very disappointed....
B00ATQ3GKQ|5|Excellent product, very confortable, cool ,very recommendable, just what i need it, i`m very happy about it, thanks a lot
B004S7BVIG|4|Go 2 size up
B004HEX1KQ|1|Bought 3T for my son who wears 2T usually and who will turn 3 in a month.  The shirt was much too small and the material felt cheap.  Returned this item for a refund.
B00OTYBMQY|5|Exactly as described.  Very nice fit and comfortable!
B004L60D56|5|My Niece is fighting cancer and the turban fit her head perfectly Thank you it keeps her head warm and gives her comfort
B00345L05C|3|Not a great value but an ok shirt sized correctly. Pretty comfortable but I would not be in a rush to order another.
B00J63CKFA|5|Great shirt. Got this for a friend that plays warhammer 40k. He tends to believe the dice are out to get him most the time, so I felt this shirt is fitting.
B0038356ZA|4|Pretty good, shrunk a little bit length wise. The feel is not as soft as the whites though.  The black shrunk more than the grey
B007WUNC9C|2|This wallet is very sturdy except for the elastic portion.  After a few months of walking around with 10-15 bills folded and under the elastic it is barely hanging on and is falling apart.  The leather portion is perfect, the band sucks.
B0036XKP76|2|Sizes are really big so if you are a true medium, you may want to go with the small.  However, arm hole is still way too big.  For my husband's medium built, the arm hole goes down several inches down the lats.  Makes a sloppy look.
B0051D8K5S|3|I'm just not liking the new stretchy version nearly as much as the traditional denim jean.  This pair never really feels &#34;broken in.&#34;
B007BZ5HOG|4|The color and style are nice, and the cotton is soft.  I'm 5'7\\", size 8, and usually wear a medium.  I ordered a large based on the reviews, and it fits well.  If you're larger than a B cup, go for the large.
B00ATRPQM6|5|We love The Daryl Dixon tees! They are nice heavier tees but cool enough to wear for summer. Thanks soo much for great products and ease of shopping!!
B003ZAPTV2|5|Honestly, who wants to spend a lot of money on a Halloween costume?  Sometimes you just need a wig to complete a costume but they can be expensive.   For what it is, I loved this wig.  It took a lot of finesse to get it into shape from being COMPLETELY flat in the box, and some of the hair did fall out in the process but wasn't too bad.
B00E9Y51RA|5|I found these a few years ago and now I can't find them many places and when I do, very few left. So, was so pleased when found I could get on Amazon. They wash nicely...I usually hang to dry.
B000WKYOXM|2|I found the material to be a little stiff, the shape to be a little odd and the band to run a little small. I've worn 18 Hour before, but found this particular model to be uncomfortable.
B00EHYJL0U|1|Sizing is extreme,I ordered a large,when this top came it was so small looks like a child's large,can not wear it,this would cost me another $5,00 to ship back.the top only cost 10.99 PLUS shipping,I will donate this top and eat the lost.it seems like anytime a purchase for cancer products are ordered they are sized small.very disappointing.I will be very careful in the future for purchasing products of this nature,
B00DNO19CS|1|Very unhappy. It tore within the first few minutes the first time I used it. I really needed to rely on it to get through security for a PGA golf tour.
B00CE58VMS|4|These fit pretty nicely. I wish though the razor back part was a little slimmer.
B00BRB222A|5|Fit as expected & arrived quick!
B00ACIFP6E|5|Excellent product, good quality, unique
B00L06WY0W|3|Works fine
B00DUDRRKA|5|you have to be in good shape to expect these to fit as pictured. i don't like how they flare at the bottom but that's shown in the pictures. it's part of the styling. the material is thin. very comfortable around the house and outside. women like 'em as do gay men. these shorts say, &#34;look at me.&#34; so there you go.
B00GYX2MXA|4|I was expecting compression shorts like I bought at the local running store. These are lightweight tight underwear. Not what I was expecting, but for what they are, they are good.
B00IWJGLFY|4|I got my order quick..which is good but I'm still missing 3 items that I haven't gotten from that same order. But really pleased with my order
B00F6TW62A|5|I love this dress! It's super comfy and who doesn't love pockets?! It's a great length for formal and informal functions.
B0000ANHTI|4|I brought this Tee for me as a work shirt... I do a lot of lifting and handle dirty machines sometimes .....these are thicker than the womens tees durable and easy to wash........no bleeding colors  ......great for gardening,, a day at the ball park & very sturdy ...the longer cut ...no worries about showing the rear
B00UCM5X1C|4|Great feel, and color looks just like what I saw on screen.
B00B2IHJD0|5|Super cute. I have wood floors and these give my daughter more traction on them. Super Cute too. I get a lot of compliments when im out because ppl think that they are shoes.
B00MYAXG3W|4|Fit well. Cute design. Some of the fringe fell off right out of the package but still plenty on the dress. Only thing I didn't really like was the fringe on the arms. It didn't hang nicely as it split and fell on either side of my arms. So arms were basically bare.
B001FOR4RW|5|Stiching is very nice - color is rich looking. I would recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a belt
B00I9TZKKY|3|little small
B00M89OZ16|4|The dress is excellent, comfortably loose, yet still complimentary.<br />The jacket a bit to large, especially in the way the shoulder is cut too wide<br />Also the sleeve is not set well...big...<br />However, the ties on the sides of the jacket are very helpful in styling the fit and image!<br />Mostly good!  And periwinkle is a good color, too!
B00LTFO4BG|1|Cheap, low quality...but as expected.  Still my 7yr old daughter loves it.
B008PDAIGU|4|I purchased these to use when setting my grandfather clocks every week. Work great for the 5 minutes I have them on my hands every week. The only problem I see is that the snaps are difficult to close by yourself, which isn't actually a problem for me since I don't need them, but others might have an issue with it.
B00AEUV3H0|5|These nightgowns are very nice.  I always buy them for my granddaughters.  My older granddaughter has an American Girl doll that the doll gown fits and my little granddaughter loves that her stuffed froggy has a matching nightgown too.  I also buy the summer ones for them too.  They love getting them.
B000KUIWLY|5|I purchased 4 different sizes of this product....use them for traveling & organizing cosmetics when I switch purses..stylish looking & very convenient as I'm able to view items items in bag through the mesh fabric
B000C02J7A|3|Nice and roomy with enough compartments.    The section with the holster is the largest section.  It closes with a zipper, so there is no \\"easy quick access\\".  The holster is a little snug and retains using velcro. I'm not sure a badly needed quick grab (why else would you be clearing leather) wouldn't result in the holster and weapon coming out together.    Worth the sale price ($10.00) but maybe not full price.
B00KL9117Q|5|Cute fit
B003R9KACE|5|I wore these without garters on a date with my husband and they stayed put the whole time, even walking around. Usually I find thigh highs will creep down which is a pain. Love these and the lace at the top is very flattering and sucks in any inner thigh problems (if you know what I mean..) Love these!
B0085MCJLI|5|These are super cute!  My son looks just adorable in them & seem to be very comfortable.  I would recommend this product.
B00C54FEG4|5|I have size 14 feet (or shoes, if you prefer) and getting low quarter socks that fit well has been nearly impossible.    I use these to lift weights, cross train, cycle and run. I work out about 9 hours per week.    I have a lot of new crew socks sitting in my fitness drawer and have replaced them all with these socks and donated the others.    So rare to find something that works exactly as expected.    UPDATE. After washing many many many times the socks are holding up just fine.
B003UYTEN2|3|I ordered these and a pair of Levi's. The length on the Levi's was perfect, but the CK's were too long. At least a couple of inches too long, they get caught under my heal.<br /><br />Also, the pockets are very short / not deep enough. Each negative gets it -1 star. The pockets I could live with, but not the length.
B00SHSZGBK|5|I ordered the wrong size but This wear exchanged it with no problem.  I really like the tee shirt it's adorable and feels quite comfortable for when I play tennis.
B00CEMKKKM|5|LOVE THIS! It just arrived today! It has a chin strap which can pull down on the beard when you talk. But if you stretch out the chin strap a little it stays in place much better.  Also the button that holds the beard on the head can be moved up closer to the horn to make a tighter fit onto your face. Otherwise the beard has a hard time staying in place.<br /><br />I bought this cause this is my first northern winter and I'm from florida. It will def keep you warm and your face warm too. I cannot wait to wear this to a friends place, party, or even just going for a hike in the snow. It's a great conversation starter. Wore it to the gas station and had several people tell me how much they liked it. I would def buy this item again and the other varieties.
B008ARIW6O|5|nice lid
B00HVTMT7K|4|My son loved it.
B00B585Z3I|5|I love this blouse. Arrived earlier that I expected. It is amazing when I put it on. So beautiful and feminine. What a wonderful product!
B001FFSES4|3|not as good as the other same brand boxer i bought before. cloth is a bit stiff.dont know why the same brand and same style are made of different cloth
B0079MCJPQ|2|I would not call this a bun cage--more like a bun topper.  It's very beautiful, but not very deep. It can't hold my hair (which is not very thick) and I have trouble believing that it would cover the majority of any bun, regardless of how long your hair is (but it would definitely have to be shorter than shoulder length)  Also, it does NOT come with a pin, and it is so shallow that it can't really use a pin.  The only way I can see to put it on is to bobby pin it as a bun topper.  So, functionality is bad, but it is very beautiful!
B00B9ALDIS|2|the large is really more like extra large,<br />guess i will have to use this as a painting shirt<br />or something like that
B0052BQSFI|5|My husband has a belly that takes his jeans down and therefore pulls the back of the jeans down also.  This causes a plumber's crack.  Well, the 527s have the low rise in the front and a high rise in the back and this takes care of the problem.  I knew there had to be something out there to cover his parts. I have spent hours online looking for a solution.  Even ordered other styles that didn't fit.  So I have finally found the answer.  Thank you so much.  My husband doesn't much care, but he hasn't been the one with the rear view.  Thankssssssssssssssssss. .
B008F55KN4|5|Great product, fits well & fast delivery!
B00G0M21QS|4|Love these shorts! Just wish the pockets were deeper.
B00C54FHFW|5|My son really liked this socks and wears them every day.. The socks are comfortable, wash well, and look cool! Recommended.
B002K6HMC6|5|The product arrived on time without any damage to them and came with a nice carrying bag.   The gloves were extremely soft, which is exactly what I wanted, and they are very stylish. The only thing I didn't like about them at first was that the hair seemed to shed all over my hands at first. After wearing them for a few weeks they no longer do this.
B00MGTB174|5|Its very very nice dress thank you
B001W5QM2W|5|There wear and wash well.  They don't fade and are extremely comfortable.  I have purchased several pairs so that I don't run out.
B00DRG3VYG|5|These are great for everyday wear, and not just for yoga!  They look great and they don't feel or look cheap.  Great price.  I like them so much I got two, the gray/black and white/black.
B0018P51RI|5|I love these jeans. There is plenty of stretch and the rise was perfect for me. They fit nicely and are very comfortable. I bought both straight leg and bootcut. I would buy again and would recommend them to others.
B00HZSSD22|5|Slowly replacing my boxer inventory with this pair.  From working at a desk to working outside for hours in the SE US heat these are truly a game  changer in comfort.  Are they worth @$35.00 a pair?  I guess so I cannot afford to do it all in one go but over the next few months more pairs will be ordered.  Yes the reviews are accurate, the other Saxx product lines  are very good, but if you are going to make the investment to make the switch go for the Platinum Lifestyle line, they have made that much of a difference for me.
B000N8RZ1Q|5|Excellent.
B00HBVV02I|5|I bought this for my daughters b-day and I am glad I chose a size bigger. It seems to run small. She loves it and it is a good quality t-shirt. UPDATE: She has worn this about once a week since she got it and it still looks great!
B002PORDOA|4|i wish it was made in pink
B0002E4C9O|5|This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned.  The straps are slightly padded for extra comfort and the bra also comes with a four hook closure for extra support.  I love it so much that I bought more.
B00HLY22QS|4|This is a nice piece and I might have kept it except for the black lace bow appliqu&eacute; on the butt. It looks more like an X than a bow. Just ruined the effect. For me. In all fairness, there SHOULD be a picture of the back of this slip to help potential buyers know what they're ordering.
B00DLJFH3W|4|I like it.  It's exactly as described, but there is no documentation in the wallet or packaging confirming it is indeed RFID protected.  The only place the RFID protected claim is documented is on the internet.
B008LWVAYO|1|I order 2 of the Black Dickies and i was so angry that one of them is look likes its been used and returned with out them checking it, it was all wrinkle and folded different from the new one..
B00N1804CM|5|Love this sweatshirt! True to size and washed up very nice. I recommend. I purchased a couple of other fleece tops which were very nice. Thanx Blair for great items and fast shipping.
B00STV21NQ|5|Prompt delivery and exactly as pictured.  A great gift for the math lover!
B009LNK44E|1|Deserves 0 stars what you see is NOT what you get.
B00GJ8720S|4|sent the onesie to my niece in india for her first birthday. she looked totally cute in it. good find.
B00D6G3QWY|5|Love it. It fit just right.
B00M4PPGG2|3|Bummed that when they came, the print was upside down, which matters since it was a tiger's head. and they said they had none with it right side up. Comfy tho, so I kept them.
B00GGWRNN8|5|Great shirt!  Fits well.
B00IE91J1I|3|Love the pants but they were a little small.
B0063KEC8C|4|Brought a smile to my son's face. He's added it to his collection of Dr. Who buttons. We need a few more!
B0078VGAM6|3|While I own Diesel jeans, hats, etc., and have been pleased will all of them, their belts are a disappointment! The leather has always been tops, but there buckles disappoint! EVERY belt buckle has either been painted or plated. Every buckle, even after a couple of months, looks old. The paint has come off or the plating on this buckle has worn off. Think it is time for me to stop buying Diesel belts.
B000WW97YG|5|The shorts are very comfortable!  I like the relaxed fit (tight enough for security, but relaxed enough to be very comfortable.
B004DMWUR2|3|This was my first time with a posture bra.  Recommend by my physical therapist.  Great for posture. Forced me to stand up correctly.  But very hard on the upper part of my shoulder, near the neck, that not used to a bra strap.  Not sure I can wear it because of that.  Hoping smaller back size might help.
B00HVRFLQ8|3|Love the case, it just has random white dots in random places... Plus I thought the sides were going to be black not white, but that's not a big deal
B009S3IBD8|4|If I liked, if it would recommend, the price also liked ,the color is nice, The only detail is that I get súper wrinkled.
B00EHLKRBU|4|This material is like a pair of good tights.  It's not like the other SlimMe tops, which are extremely firm and thick.  It fits a bit large and doesn't offer a ton of shaping.  But it's decent everyday shaping and comfortable.  I just wish it were smaller or available in a smaller size.
B00O2WXATU|5|nice scarf
B00993OYXI|5|I wear this more than any other out garment.  Not cheap, but American made and worth every penny.  I'm saving up for another one.
B0000C1BSM|5|I love the belt kind of spendy but man I really love it, I added a silver belt tip and it is now Perfect !!!!!!! Well at least it is for ME..... :)
B00K1K2JQM|5|Just what I needed.
B007IEOS40|5|Sweet shirt  this is a great fit and durable material to I would definitely buy again from this vender. K
B006X7PPUY|5|This gown is so beautiful and it fit well.. Our granddaughter looked so very pretty in this gown. Received package as promised.
B00KHNUHLC|4|I love them though they were a bit smaller than I'd expected. Good incentive to drop a few pounds. Otherwise a quality fun product that was promptly shipped.
B00IRW7BNC|4|I ordered the size according to the description written in the sizes. And it fits just as i would've wanted it to.
B00IIJ9RC2|5|great material. great fit. looks cute with the two pockets.
B000NRV6OY|5|I gave this to my sister for her birthday. She is warm and looks terrific at the same time. Although she rides the bus, some folks think she has enough money to own a car because she's dressed so classy. People love her in it.
B012F9ODBA|5|My girlfriend has a unique sense of style, and she was asking me to purchase something with fur on it for her to wear. So I went onto Amazon and found this fur vest which was made from rabbit fur. When it arrived, it fit perfectly both her as well as myself were amazed.
B00J2UMAPW|1|pants waist was super small for a size 20
B0051D81DO|5|I already owned several pairs of these pants in black and wanted some more in different colors.  The only color available in my size and what I liked was navy.  These pants fit great and they are perfect for work.  I will definitely be ordering more.
B00IC8OKW6|1|Ordered size preemie... but the hat is tagged newborn. I thought I had really found an extra small hat for my 2 month old 7lb twins for our vaca next week... but guess not! Will probably be returning as I can get hats these size for alot cheaper.
B002552UHY|3|Since t-shirt was a gift, receiving it on time was important.  Fabric was cheap and cut on bias so t-shirt didn't hang straight.
B00J0SR0X8|5|Design is super pretty... The color purple is soooo sweet! Well made and especially love the seersucker material and the lace bodice.  Bodice rather small, nevertheless its still a good buy and i love it to bits!
B000NKFL06|5|just what i was looking for
B00IN6PU9Y|3|It was perfect but Too small.
B00JBRB8CM|5|This dress is great for the price! It's a bit see through but with something underneath, it's awesome!! Get lots of compliments! Thanks Sakkas!
B00RGNAQQ2|2|Not the best for size quality  and I ordered  a size bigger that why I'll never buy lingerie  online again
B003JH8TFO|5|Fit and finish are great! It doesn't come all flattened out like most wigs. I literally took it directly out of the box and put it on. Didn't have to spend one minute to make it look just like the picture!
B00WSWO0XQ|5|colors match the picture. cant wait to wear it in in sun at the pool
B00U6Y08FW|4|I usually wear a large but had a feeling this would run just a little small, and it does, just a little. Very nice top and I got a lot of compliments on it.
B00HFYFUN6|5|soft and comfy at a great price.
B00F8DBPE4|5|Just what I wanted for grandson's outfit. Worked and looked great.
B00LI3MLCS|2|I was very disappointed to find the sock didn't come to the knee. It shouldn't be titled a tube sock, but rather a crew sock.
B009Z43L94|5|I bought this item for my son, loves it , good quality, great fit, loving it..fast service , exactly how described...would recommend this seller.Thank you
B00FGAOIWU|5|Comfortable. Fits the same as regular bra size. Not for any vigorous exercise. Good for relaxing.
B002GHV28E|5|I purchased this shirt for a man who has crippled hands from arthritis.  He is happier than the devil with the fit and the fact he can<br />negotiate the snaps so much better than the buttons.
B007X4A9X4|5|Perfect work shirt, wrinkle free and bright. I would highly recommend this to any woman out there looking for an easy, wash and wear shirt for all occasions.
B00Q0BN04G|5|I love it!
B00BNSZVEI|4|My daughter is 16month, 10kg, 81cm, very slim~this dress (18month i bought) is just ok, can not wear very long, so the size is small. overall it is nice and cute!
B00H46I69K|4|Levi's jeans seldom disappolint. My almost ten year old granddaughter was delighted to receive these shorts in the mail. The skimmer length was a big hit. The adjustable waist insures a comfortable fit for the entire warm weather season. Lastly, the mod dye job  is the latest trend for these young fashionistas!
B00OP8LFCU|5|These tanks fit exactly as expected, with a built in bra that provides enough support. They're long enough but not too long that they look strange. The last two purchases of tank tops I made were disappointing, with one being too short and the other not actually having the bra top- both of those were cotton cantina, which made me wary to buy these, but I love these ones so much I've bought three packs of four tanks
B006T52WVA|1|The elastic waistband is so much smaller than the rest of the garment that it ruins it.  Otherwise the colors are quite bright. The quality of the material matches the price.
B005EVLI2Y|5|comfortable<br /><br />and good price
B007NEAK92|5|i have always been a big fan of fred perry shirts and this one just as good as my favorites...great true fit. here here!
B00LM1TFXY|5|Ordered dress for granddaughter's  1st Birthday and Christmas! Lovely!!!
B00505DTHQ|4|The cape was wrinkly when it arrived but it's a cool costume!
B00LANVQZY|1|It look very cheap&my titties was a little to small to fit the top
B00IWJBK50|4|Fits great.
B009E2DZPW|5|Oh, my gosh--this dress is perfect!!  I was worried about the sleeves (because I have FAT ARMS), but the sleeve fabric is stretchy!!  And, I was worried that the dress fabric might be too heavy for a spring event, but it's lightweight!!  This is my event dress from now on!!
B00O9GLO2Y|5|To be honest, I wasn't expecting this good of quality from a hoodie. But I got it for my husband, and I am shocked at the quality of it. I will be ordering from this company in the future! I ordered it on wednesday, today is friday and it has already arrived! I would recommend this!
B002QQ7SX8|1|These are unlined leather gloves, the 'shearling' in the title is misleading and untrue.  Besides, if you want these gloves, they're available on ebay for half the price.  I'd recommend some gardening gloves over these stinkers.
B007XDAZR0|5|my baby will look so good in it this jacket is so cute i just wish they had sizes other than toddler sizes
B00JXPWDY4|5|Bought as a gift for a bridal shower and she LOVED them... They are very nice I do wish they came packaged a little nicer but I bought a fancy bag for them.
B00BB8VGD0|5|is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want. cheer up and buy whatever you want.
B000U7077Y|5|i love the glorie vanderbuit jeans the store i use to get them at closed so found them on line
B008VPS5ZS|3|I didn't like the shiny thin material.
B00DQYXGMG|2|The jacket itself fits fine, but I guess Columbia was trying to save some $ on their fabric yield because from the elbow down the sleeves are inexplicably tight. Just a bare arm does not fit through it without pushing the grey lining out the end of the sleeve, requiring one to reach inside from the body of the jacket to pull the liner fabric back in. Forget trying to wear a long sleeved shirt with this jacket.<br /><br />Strange that the rest of the jacket seems to be ok. Just poorly thought out for the sleeves and lining. :(<br /><br />Will have to return.
B00246K78I|2|I'm a size 0-2. Ordered petite xxs and they are perfect
B00PVGC4CA|5|Totally worth the money. Most comfortable pair of underwear ever purchased.
B004YIESRU|5|Great quality as always from Levi's. The jeans fit my nephew perfectly and there are adjustable straps so it is sure to fit your little tyke.
B00NOFLBCE|3|Very cute see through shirt.
B00GY4DS1Y|3|the sweater is nice, but after a few uses and washes some of the seams have come undone.
B00M4VX8DE|5|Awesome product!!! Love it! A++++++++ Hope to do business again soon! ! So soft and warm!
B0018OX8QK|5|Fit perfectly!! it seems like they were tailored just for me. i absolutely recommend them and the price was right on!!
B00EJYPCB0|5|Beautiful fabric. Fit well. Quick shipping. Great experience with this company. Would purchase again.
B0094GIYOK|5|This is a very nice form fitting top, fit as if it were made for me.  So, so pretty, love it.
B0088EYPJM|5|What can you say about a Wallet? I had a Tumi for the last two years and its falling apart . This one looks great, and smells weird for about a week but for the price... you cant beat it.
B00NQWI7QS|2|This shirt is super thin and thread bare in spots. it is about to fall apart after washing it twice.  it looks very shabby also.
B00IYP7MLI|5|Love it. I bought it for my 4 years old daughter. She is happy. Very good quality and very cozy.
B00O1HEAAO|5|Excellent. No roll, no slip and has the coverage I asked for.
B007ZH8FBW|4|I'm a 36 waist, but the belt was a little short (down to the last two holes with almost not enough tab to tuck into the loop).  I would order a 38 next time.  As far as the money compartment  - it is very narrow, but I'd say you could stuff 10 bills in there - you just have to tri-fold them (like a letter), then fold in half the long way (not necessarily in that order).
B005C11DK8|1|Do yourself a favor and do not buy products from this seller. I received this backpack with a broken back strap, making it completely useless. I didn't expect much from a $30 backpack, but a broken product is ridiculous. When I opened the package someone had tried to tie the frayed/ripped strap in a hopeless attempt to cover up the obvious default. Save yourself the headache and buy elsewhere.
B0090DDPYQ|5|With shorts. With leggings. Over a long skirt or with jeans. This is just one great piece of clothing! You can also get matching pieces from this maker in both patterns to make it a bit more of a set. They are quality made and I have bought many of their things without a complaint. No matter what your size, from a small to triple x, everything is made for style AND comfort. I love these folks.
B00JNJ9P5K|5|It is amazing how gorgeous this veil was at the price! I used it for decoration at a bridal shower and I want to use it when I go away on my bachelorette getaway weekend!
B004DNVP6S|5|As advertised, no complaints.
B00JZKWA68|3|I'm giving three stars because the dress itself is so cute, and really quality. It's just what I wanted...but they sent one labeled &#34;S&#34; when I ordered a Medium. Too small. I ordered it for a trip, and I didn't get the replacement in time, which was such a disappointment.
B00NAXBLPM|5|I love this coat  just  perfect for a infant
B003AIKE7I|5|Great shirt!
B00D7R4Y3C|3|This 3/4 Sleeve top is exactly as advertised.  It is a beautiful, soft, lace top, true to colour and design, and fit as expected.  I am 5'4&#34;, 140 lbs, and wear a size 34C bra, and purchased a medium.  However, my big disappointment is that the product I received was damaged.  It had a hole at the back from which a piece of the nylon material about six inches long, hung.  Hence my rating.  To return the product would be too expensive.  However, for the price, it was a good buy.
B00IJSUJ0G|1|Runs very small
B00BUKBJ4U|4|Love this dress!  Excellent price, good fit, good stitching.  I would totally buy from this brand again.
B00LKMPI5E|5|This dress is perfect, it fits perfect the lenght is perfect and good quality, i was suprised how perfect it fits i am 125 lbs and 5&#34;1 high and ordered a size small i thought it was going to be too long but with my 4&#34; heels its a perfect lenght i will use it for a friends wedding really elegant
B0064MF6UW|5|It was very cute for but a on the larger side.
B000ZPKY60|5|Great for potbellies. Rides a little lower.
B005C83GZG|5|Put this on today.  Nice firm control although I believe that it runs a little small.  I am wearing a size 12 pants but ordered the large which supposedly is a 14-16.  The large fit nice and snug.  I cannot imagine trying to get the medium on.  There is ribbing at the bottom of the leg to keep it in place and prevent ride-up and bunching at the knee.  Nice firm control in both the leg and the butt.
B00DDCQNM6|4|it fits me so well. I love long sleeve and light weight v neck shirts, and then i got them here. Bought 2, black and cardinal
B00AKSCXCK|3|The shorts weren't bad, but the material was a bit thinner than expected and they run small. I will be returning them.
B00QWEKOAE|4|So good product quality really it fits so good just i think the sleeves are some shorts like 2 or 3 centimeters.
B00AKSCNWK|5|I really like these. I have never tried any other brand of compression shorts so I cannot compare these to Nike or UA. However they leave me comfortable, dry, and chafe free and that's all I could ask for from a pair of compression shorts. They look cool. Well worth it considering what the other brands are charging
B003UOA53K|5|Bands top and bottom are 3/4&#34; wide.  I am 42D--I wear instead of bra--just keeps the girls from jiggling and are very comfortable.  I must have 30 tube tops total, from this company and others in different colors.
B00ESG47HE|1|Way too small, don't buy. And they refused any exchange or return. I love the design and idea. But come on
B00ISYB748|1|Fell apart the first day and I have a 32 waist. Junk from abroad.
B0013Z82LU|5|This one always fit me nicely, i like the subtle texturing and the price is great, nie to finally get more than one.
B00GPOK6HW|5|Absolutely adorable and great quality! Can't believe the price I got on Amazon after seeing these sell for $98 on the OndadeMar website!
B00OJTMFEM|5|The shirt is great. Runs big.Next time ill order a smaller size.
B00K1J49CU|5|I just got this t-shirt today and it fits really good on me. I love the material its really soft and made of a good quality. I would definitely order another one and recommend this to everyone.
B00GAP6ZBW|5|They were not exactly what i expected but still love them.
B00AI7BNGU|5|Love the design on these socks and wear them even though they're a little tight.  I have my home health aide stretch them out before she puts them on me and that seems to make a better fit.
B00NNFJCN0|4|Sweatshirt is awesome and exactly how it looks, the only issue is the sizing. If ordering I suggest maybe going even 2 sizes bigger than you would normally order to get a good fit.
B00IZC4NOE|4|This is an adorable outfit and fits my 7 year old daughter perfectly.  For some reason, I expected more of a dressy rayon material, but is more of a cotton feel (but does say 95% rayon).  It is a hand wash top.
B00DHJ7RXE|5|Very fast service package arrived as promised
B00HLRPQZO|3|It's basically exactly what it is the delivery took weeks tho :/
B0064O9XE0|5|Great timing
B00CLMAPWI|5|I'm a size 12 at 5ft 6.5 inches and this fit wonderfully well, just the right length as I'm am in shaped 57 year old, however, I dont' wear shorty lingerie lol!  Great product!!!!  Very timely!!!!!
B009CVIDBG|5|Excellent shapewear that is both slimming and sexy. I have tried many shapewear products over the years; most of the mainstream brand names.  in fact. I have to say that every piece of Scandale Intimes I have ever purchased has far and away exceeded the quality of any others- while still costing the same amount. The workmanship is excellent; the design flattering and feminine, while still providing slimming control. This is absolutely something that is pretty and feminine enough to even be worn as lingerie for a significant other.<br />You can't really see the details in the large photo, you have to hover for a close up, but the lacy fabric on the side panels and rear are striking but tasteful. The rear of the piece is more of a tanga/ cheeky boyshort  panty than it is a full coverage bikini bottom- but it has never caused me any problems with panty lines etc.  It provides fairly firm control without making it hard to breathe or bunching in certain areas.<br /><br />My only caution is that this is a French brand, so the sizes DO tend to run a bit small- I typically wear a medium but needed to go up to a large in this.<br /><br />Bottom line- I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend. I not only look slimmer in this piece, but I also feel sexy while wearing it.
B00GABACMY|5|Happy with my purchase, thanks seller!
B0029F26AG|5|It's lightweight, my head doesn't get hot, and it has a drawstring inside so it fits my tiny head. I have this in multiple colors, and would buy it again. It's not the most fashionable, but it keeps the sun off my face and doesn't make me hotter.
B00K3W6R8O|3|This tshirt is not great quality and is very thin.
B00MI5CU08|5|Super cool onsie. Shrinks cosiderably after drying but still fits great. Mushroom and text were not affected after washing. Held up great. I would order again.
B0091DN0FY|4|She liked it....
B001PR22B2|5|I love it. No excessive padding and it fit me perfectly. I also like how the center is low and doesn't show on low cuts. I'm a 32DD and it fit perfectly
B00CONNGVQ|4|Unfortunately, I come from chunky family and it is hard to lose weight after 2 kids. My youngest is 14 months and I have decided it is time to get back in shape.<br />I have purchased plenty girdles but never a &#34;good quality&#34; one until this one.<br />I am a size Large on shirts, weight 180 pounds and I'm 5'2. I ordered a size Large once I checked the Measuring Chart. I was very nervous it wouldn't fit because people reccomend getting a size larger up to 3 sizes more. It took about 7 minutes to completely close with the help of my mother but it fit. Was tight and couldn't breath too well for almost a day but now fits a little loose.<br />I put it on Monday night and it is Friday, I have lost 5 pounds! It must be because it is tight so I cannot eat as much as I usually do.<br />I can already go on the second set of hooks and will be purchasing a size Medium on Monday.<br />I am reduced 3 inches with the trainer and it looks great once it's on. I wear it 24 hours a day, only take it off to shower and put it back on as soon as I'm dry. I'm on a mission! lol<br />It does have a strong smell but it goes away quick. As you can see in the pictures, there's some fat hanging from the top, where it ends. I have to wear loose clothing for it to not be noticable.<br />That and the fact that it's visible through tight clothes but oh well. I can live with it.<br />Another thing is that it's hard to sleep at night with it on and my mayor complain is that I think it's getting loose and it won't work for longer than a couple weeks. Which means spending  $50+ in less than a month.<br />Overall, I'm satisfied and will be purchasing another one in a smaller size soon.
B008GZ0N3K|1|I needed cotton PJ's for my son for the summer and thought these would be great.  They are so thin and cheaply made.  The first time I washed them, they shrunk an entire size.  I bought a 2T and they probably shrunk to a 12 month size the sleeves were up to his elbows and his toes were curled because the feet were too small.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few dollars and buy a better brand.
B00E8GREHO|4|Great ugly sweater for the season. Clean enough in humor for the kids. Fits a little snug on an athletic frame .
B001O5ZTPG|1|Junk, fell apart in less than a week.
B00MGUNTAU|3|Cute coat but it's not thick at all. ....you really get what you pay for..
B00EDZUWXI|5|fits well.  I was pleasantly surprised! well made and comfortable.<br />im a 14-16
B00BBQDO8C|5|[[ASIN:B00BBQD7F2 Sunvary Sexy Sweetheart Mermaid Chiffon Evening Dresses Prom Gowns Long Rhinestones]]<br /><br />So many compliments!  The quality of the dress and high quality of the materials gives Sunvary high marks.  Even more impressive is their customer service. My gown was a custom fit and the team at Sunvary was responsive to my needs and made my final selection more than satisfactory.  Sunvary gets a big thumbs up!
B00RZ4ZHMA|5|I love this dress...look so sexy :)
B003R7LD68|5|these socks are perfect for cold Chicago winters!
B00BJORYCI|1|Plastic garters broke right away...very cheaply made.
B00FBD2G2Q|4|Very comfortable with a good fit.
B00ITHO9VW|5|It's soft and good quality. Size is right and just like the photo showed. I have to say it's the only good outfits I have ever bought from Amazon.
B000IE9N0Q|5|Robe is 5 star hotel quality.  Soft terry on the inside and plush velour outside. Hangs between knee and ankle. Purchased for elderly mother and she loves it. Going to order another for myself. Exceptional value.
B0038AB5Y4|3|The closure is this weird half hook & eye plus half halter sports bra closure. I have to get help to close the bra. It is soooo incredibly insane. But it has taught me a lesson - don't buy it if it has a major functionality issue. The problem is I was desperate for a high impact sports bra and the price was great. Better options are the Champion Women's Spot Comfort Full Support Bra and Champion Women's The Smoothie Bra. They have better closures and better support too.
B003THEL3I|5|Love the blankets. Came very well packaged, even though they are only soft blankets, but all care was taken so they arrive in good condition.
B0059YFY0S|5|Nice fit
B00Q9DEK0I|5|Is nice keep my son worm  and he love it
B00EKO2EGK|5|Pretty amazing. All your junk goes in a pocket in front of your junk...
B0081JANLI|5|Ladies can't stop checking me out whenever I wear this.. Must buy for anybody with a soul.. Hollywoodmania!!!
B006GHMRV6|5|I tried this on today and wow, it is the sexiest piece of intimate apparel I own (mostly Victoria's Secret). This is definitely worth buying especially for the price. It fit great, I'm 5'7&#34; and 130 lbs with size B cups. I was a little worried that it would make my breasts look small but it actually did the opposite! The design around the bust accentuate them and make them look good. I will probably buy the black as well.
B00EOHXBTC|5|I received the product as described . Excellent quality fabric and beautiful colors . I was fascinated to my daughter. I recommend the product to my family and friends. I love..
B0044VLN6G|1|not the size as they post. 2T like 12 months
B00LCX4PU0|1|Too small and not at all true to size
B00424INTU|5|The Western Rhinestone Cross Ornaments Croco Print Leather Belt is beautiful.  My daughter loved the belt.  It was a Christmas gift.
B00MBBL636|5|I bought these for my boyfriend and they fit him perfect! He likes the material and the hidden pocket on the side. I will be purchasing more of this brand!
B00JCUPW3E|5|These are great! Ordered this set for my 6 year old daughter who loves to dress up. They look beautiful and fit great so these are definitely not only for babies. Quality is nice and they really cost a fraction of what you'd pay at the store. Very pleased with the purchase.
B00K0ZOMMW|5|It is smaller than the other XL T-shirt from my order and both are Gildan T-shirts.  Even as a Junior fit XL, it would be too small and I needed a Misses fit XL. Great color and logo, but I will have to use it with PJ bottoms. It's too snug to wear outside of the house....
B00BC0YLTS|5|I've gotten several of these - for myself and family - and everywhere I use it, I get comments on it. It's pretty and functional.  I'll be buying several as stocking stuffers this Christmas!
B00CEW1PC4|3|ORDERED A LARGE.. MORE LIKE XXL..WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION FROM JOIE ABOUT HER CLOTHING.. FOR INSTANCE TANK TOP IS GOING TO BE HUGE.. OR DRESS IS MADE SMALL DONT ORDER IF YOU ARE NOT 32 BUST AND 25 WAIST..
B008IE0VK4|2|bow was cheaply glued and fell off
B00A86S6ES|5|I actually received the blue one first, and it's for my youngest daughter, but i'm sure she's going to love it and wear it well.  I'm still waiting on the Red one since I had to have both.
B00KILEAD4|5|This dress is realy pretty, as pictured, however I ordered it small and it doesnt fit, its too large, Im petite, however it came in perfect condition it only had an awful toxic smell that wore off after a few days hanging outside. I would recommend it.
B00EEIHEXA|3|These are way to wide for women's glasses.
B00A0PYWVS|4|I have purchased these shorts on previous occasions.  Like them alot. Were a little loose when I first tried them but after wash & dry they are fine.
B000FXUW3M|5|A little large but quality is top notch!
B00CJQGNMW|4|I love how full and girly this skirt is! It hits right below the knee and is super full and flouncy. I loved it so much that I bought it in Cream, Black, and Mint Green.
B006Z8GG40|4|Bought it to cut up and use for a Halloween costume although the parts that I used seemed to be of good quality and I have several others of the same brand that I purchased outside of Amazon that have held up well to regular wear and tear
B00EEX6Q66|5|Love, love love this!  Great for wearing out or just around the house.  Highly recommend!!
B0042RHOZ6|5|Purchased 2 pairs, one for me &done for my daughter.we're both very happy with their fit & level of comfort. They were perfect in the recent cold weather the east coast experienced.
B00UM5OBM6|1|tore at the crotch in 5 days
B00O13K4Z8|5|Much better quality than expected
B00OTS6CZG|5|Fit like a glove.
B004XF1BOW|5|I ordered the 16's.  I'm 5'7\\" and all leg.  I usually order JC Penney's St. John's bi-stretch pants, ultra talls.  (But they had the wisdom to discontinue these pants even though they had 970 positive reviews.)  37\\" inseam.  I'm a little heavier right now, so I'm probably pushing it with the 16s.<br /><br />However, these fit, a little tight at the waist.  Pretty stretchy, but firm, thick material.  I don't mind the tighter fit because it pulls everything together (if you know what I mean), and they don't look too yoga pantish.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm going to buy some more!
B00175YIGY|1|Not only was I disgusted to pay almost 9 dollars in shipping for a cheap plastic costume that was tossed in a weak box, but overall the costume is completely not worth it, especially 70 bucks!!!  I expected something of more quality than flimsy sharp-edged plastic.  There is no sword like the pic, but that wasn't in the descrption anyway,  The helmet is sharp-edged plastic that has black feathers, not red. I don't want to even spend another cent to ship it back.  I wish there was a prior review to spare me.
B00207SIRS|4|fit was good
B00AOMYHDA|3|I ordered three pair, each a different color. I received three pairs and they were all the same color. Fail.<br />The pant length is too long for me as well. I wear a 30x30 and the pant leg was maybe 34. I had to cuff them in and will have to take to a tailor to fix. They're also a little tight but I expected that.
B00JRZE9H4|5|I just got this in the mail earlier in the week, and i tried it on right away, it fit great. I am a heavier chested, and i was concerned it wouldnt do what i needed but it did great t fits great and still shows a shape which some maxi dresses do not. great for a easy sun dress or a night out on the town
B00GX9PRH8|4|It fit a bit bigger than expected but I love it. Absolutely beautiful.
B005MR987C|5|I am very petiete and if it doesnt fit you well on the bottom put it on upside down and rubber band the top it will fit perfect!
B00IJHJGOC|5|I loved the dress. I ordered two of them and I would love to have more. I would highly recommend this
B00VTQSQPU|5|MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT.
B009FV9XDK|2|Not fitting as I had expected but I'll make it work
B003VBH88M|5|I bought this hat to wear with my Ghostbuster Costume-it added the finishing touch to a really neat costume.  Everyone asked where I got it.  I found myself wearing it for more than just my costume accent.  But buyers beware the cap seems to be frayed on the corners-but thats just the look-hope this review was helpful!
B009CQDTKG|5|I have been wearing denim and navy blue for far too long. These chinos are a breath of fresh air.
B006B3AQIG|5|Very cute and looks and fits just like the picture!
B00H9WUVTM|5|I wanted to try a silk scarf but didnt want to pay much... These were perfect!  I just love them!
B0071MR89G|5|Can't get enough of The Walking Dead, and i love wearing this shirt. Everyone notices it. Can't wait to buy more!
B00JKF0D12|5|Beautiful!! I love this blouse.....Look great with jeans, capris, or leggings!
B00NGF4GBA|5|Love love my dress! It fit perfect and I love the crinkle in the middle to help cover up my mid section. Love the edgey look the gold spikes add! Most definitely one for &#34;the little Black Dress!&#34; For us thicker Women!😉
B00AYR6RYM|1|Was excited when the top arrived. However...the cut is strange. Tight in the armpits, you better have narrow shoulders and long arms. The bodice wasn't slim enough and belled outwards enough so it was like a maternity top. I am a size 4 or 6 and the medium was just strange. I won't even go on about the fabric.
B00PC0ACS8|1|I couldn't even pull them all the way up.
B00GBPUUBC|5|this gown fit as expected, I wore it to a wedding and it was nice. Everyone said I looked as I was in the wedding party. Well fitted.
B00GWZZ6AQ|5|The pants were a perfect fit. So hard to find this size anywhere without having to order it. So amazon came thru. Washed the pants and no bleeding of the blue. Delivery was on time and will order more pairs.
B00F3O0738|5|Super warm and cozy.  Fit our two year old daughter perfectly.  We wanted something that protected her neck and this is awesome.  We live in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and like to spend a lot of time outdoors even in single digit temps.  This will do the trick.  My older kids (8 and 9) now want one, too.
B002ED6HMQ|5|I LOVE THESE! excellent product. They allow me to wear thin summer bras and sports bras and go without a bra and feel completely comfortable. They stay in place and the adhesive is not too sticky and does not irritate. I only wish I had found these sooner. they are certainly a must have item.
B00N4ZT8SI|3|Awfully thin...
B00HSGP4X2|1|I got this acording to the chart and thought I would be good, when I got it home it was so small it didn't fit all the way around. Nice dress good color but will try later to see if it will work in another color
B00EK1NR14|3|I ordered size 16 since I'm not sure how the sizing for juniors. I usually wear size 10-12 but this one is a little bit tight
B00BYGE8CA|5|Love this scarf, it's light, pretty, airy and it I can pair it with yellow, sand or grey and it looks great.
B001DT95P8|2|The shirt is great.  Fits as expected.  The small print I see now says tie color may vary.  This was ordered more for the tie color than for the shirt and the tie shows up as this color scheme that nobody in their right mind would ever wear.  Seller,  send out the tie color from the picture to make it right.
B0083VMMCC|5|Nice and long ( I'm 5'9) and normally wear a size 10/12 so the 31L fit well (no muffin top) .Great dark wash and seem like they will last a long time.
B006SFSLFM|3|Runs on the small side for me. I am 5'10&#34; and the arms are a tad short. We've had some really cold weather lately (single digits), and layered I still managed to be a bit cold. I would not purchase again.
B00EPQ6DY2|4|Good Quality. Nice and original T-Shirt. Fits like expected. A bit loose 2 Pac style. :) If you like T-shirts with application and humor it is the right choice :)
B00LGRYFZM|5|They run small used as an incentive to exercise more
B00WTTQCF2|5|This tunic is so soft and comfy! I didn't go by their size chart, as some people said the shirt was big. I ordered an extra small, since I'm a size 2 dress, and it fits a little loose around my waist. But it looks great and I love it. :)
B00AEMSCEK|5|very good brand of clothing for children, perfect for cooler climates. is of very good quality, I highly recommend it. also my son feels comfortable and is happy.
B00JGLSNMG|4|Ver y nice
B00EUMG71A|5|Have had so many compliments on these pants.  They are comfy feel and look great:  would recommend to anyone wanting great quality pants
B0026UPI4A|4|These fit well overall, but the piping on the side is a bit uncomfortable after extended wear. It washes well, too.
B00DDQX22G|4|Runs somewhat small. I wear a 10 or 12 pant and ordered the large which fit slightly small but are comfortable in the beige. It seems like the black ones are even a little smaller but lovely looking as well.They come to right at my belly button. These don't look like granny panties but provide nice coverage with no panty lines. They have held up well over the last year with machine wash and line dry.
