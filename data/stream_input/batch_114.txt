B000QFORK8|1|My sectional leather couch is 7 years old.  I cleaned it with Leather Nova and then applied Lexol per the directions.  I tried to buff it out but it was so sticky that the microfiber cloth just stuck to it and wouldn't wipe.  My couch was previously soft with a semi-slick touch but now grabs my clothes and leg/arm hair when sitting on it.
B003973VKC|5|just what I wanted
B004SXYEW0|5|Didn't expect this to work well because it looked to simple. I have used it on 2 different vehicles and 1 had a very complicated 8.4 inch screen with navigation. I have had no problem with this item. I would definitely recommend this tool to others.
B006H9R0UQ|5|Timely delivery, perfect fit!!
B001TH6ET4|5|I am very impressed with the practical size of these bags. These are typical Carroll quality; meaning the leather is of decent stiffness and finish, the hardware are durable shiny bits, the value for the money is above average, and they are made in the USA. Note that the yoke is cut western style; in my case it allows more of the custom paint on my fender to show, can easily be carried over the shoulder, or they could be could be used with a saddle. Buy this saddlebag for when you're not touring, they have replaced my 16x12x6 &#34;freighter&#34; bags
B00PT18QAQ|5|I love it.... Works great.. I really like the way it holds the reading until you release it with the little button on the side. I was wondering how that would work.. No batteries,, YAY!!!.. most of the 'gas' stations in Nashville do not have pressure gauges and it was getting frustrating to say the least.. but now... who cares.. I have the Tire Tek.. :)
B00X04JRMU|5|Definitely a 5 star product.....even better. This waterless wash and wax is just incredible. So easy to use and gives an unbelievable finish on my diamond white Acura RDX. This is way above my expectations.
B007PGK3U4|5|Works great
B002UX5CHG|5|Great as advertised.
B00SXIQP4G|5|I haven't actually used these yet, but I could tell when I first took them out of the box that they are well made.  I needed gauges both for cars (R-134a) and for my newer home A/C units (R-410a) and these fit the bill!  The price is very good too.
B0016HWGQ2|5|Great as advertised.
B000CQ6FOM|1|This thing is tiny.  Much smaller than the stock part.  Doesn't add much bling to the engine bay.  Not worth it.
B00VBIL0P4|5|Excellent product.
B00FTABGTA|5|I received it quickly and well packaged. It looks very good on my truck. I wish I could find a pair that are coiled so that they could be put on the left and right sides and both be facing forward.
B00BD5GYNI|1|No it didi not fit even though I put the right car in the space for car type......I wouldnt recommend getting this item.
B00BYXBAKQ|1|Not as advertised. Extremely frustrated with Amazon at this time
B00BSKYM82|4|Overall this is a pretty good product IMO.  I've had it on for approximately one year as I write this review, so I can give some info about how it holds up over time.  Before you read my review consider that when I applied this product I was upgrading the intercooler on my car so I had the bumper OFF THE CAR when I did it.  Though bumper removal is time consuming, so is masking everything, plus I got to remove parts of my grille and do the grille frame with this stuff as well.  I believe the application was made easier with the bumper off TBH but I understand that most people will not attempt that.  The car was fairly new when it was applied (less than two years old) and though I had wanted to get an actual clear bra done it was a little late (should have been done when new) and the cost is fairly prohibitive (around $500ish, done professionally).  How well does a $25 can of this stuff stack up to something that costs 20x the price?  Well first off let's remember it costs 1/20th the price, so naturally we can't expect it to be nearly as good or last nearly as long.  With that in mind...off we go!  PREP: Some other reviews mentioned the shallow learning curve to using the product and that's definitely true. It doesn't take long to get the knack of application, but one should definitely read/study the application guide thoroughly before starting.  If you follow the directions--the distance, spray pattern, the synthetic waxing (included), the conditions to spray in, etc.--I believe you should get a pretty good result.  Obviously you have to start with a completely clean bumper.  So washing and drying is a must.  I would also recommend you do a claybar-ing of the intended areas as well.  Then you have to apply the SUPPLIED wax.  Though conventional thinking would say any synthetic wax/sealant should probably work, a lot of people aren't aware of what is and isn't synthetic (and marketing isn't always true either), and the instructions specifically tell you to use what they gave you.  So, in that case definitely just use the stuff they conveniently included in the box.  APPLICATION: I did NOT have any problems with the spray nozzle; I also used the recommended trigger (purchased separately).  While some people may end up having problems with the nozzle clogging, note that 3M seems to be aware this is a potential issue and it's mentioned in the instructions that if this happens to you, STOP using the product and contact them.  I'm not sure if they just send you a couple new nozzles after that or a new can or what, but definitely don't continue if the nozzle repeatedly clogs.  If the nozzle clogs, the can will &#34;spit&#34; and if it spits you'll get terrible spots/bumps in the finish which you obviously do not want.  Almost all of the instructions should be taken as true because even if you don't believe them at application, it *will* turn out the way it says.  For example it mentions that the product &#34;self levels&#34; and that any cloudiness when applying will become clear.  When applying, these things concerned me too (guess it's a natural thing) but when the product dried and cured fully, what it says is what happens.  The only thing I'd recommend you do that the instructions shy away from is deliberately applying it heavily.  Not all in one coat mind you, but overall you want to get it nice and heavy.  It says if it's too &#34;pin hole&#34; looking it will be too thin and be difficult to remove--this is true and you definitely don't want that.  It also says you don't want it to get too milky/cloudy (representative of &#34;too heavy&#34; a coating).  Personally, I say, forget that part there's not going to be such things as too heavy esp. with just one can.  The more you have on there, the thicker the protection will be; AND, the easier it will be to remove after.  The milky appearance WILL turn clear as it dries (though note a thick coating will take longer to cure as well).  The only issue with applying it too heavy is thesagging/dripping but that's where not applying it too heavily &#34;all in one go&#34; comes in.  For me it was probably a little easier because I had the bumper off and any &#34;sagging&#34; of the liquid while not-yet-dry was pulled to the edges of the bumper; with the bumper on the car it make look a little worse so try to keep the coats on the lighter side and build up to it.  You will always end up with an &#34;orange peel&#34; effect once it's sprayed on.  Again as the instructions tell you, this too WILL disappear and it will look smooth and glossy once it is dry. This is the &#34;self-levelling&#34; effect.  Due to this you don't have to be careful to get it done perfectly evenly as it truly will sort itself out as it dries.  DRYING: Note that there are two phases of the &#34;drying&#34;:  DRY TIME: There's the actual drying which takes 2-4 hours (on the 4 hour side if you've got it on there nice and thick).  During the dry time you want to keep the vehicle/bumper/parts sprayed OUT of the sun.  Also do NOT touch the product in this time period or you will cause some problems for yourself.  Similarly don't remove the masking tape and materials until the drying is complete.  CURE TIME: This is the second phase, after the 4 hours above you still really don't want to touch the bumper (or any parts coated) too much, but it will be fairly tacky and shouldn't get damaged or &#34;fingerprinted&#34; with any light touching.  In this phase it's actually preferable to have the car IN the sunlight as it will speed the cure time; this isn't a requirement but it is recommended.  The cure time is fairly long--it says between 1-4 days.  Personally I had to go on a 10hr road trip about a day later (I got maybe 30hrs cure time, tops) but it seemed to have cured well enough and I didn't have any problems.  So I'd say a day should be enough.  They also recommend you wax the film just as you would your car, but here I would wait at least a week before doing so just to be sure ofa full cure before you go waxing (most waxes/polishes contain petroleum or similar mineral solvents in them so you really want a definite cure on the stuff before applying anything like that).  While both drying and curing you need to keep the vehicle AWAY FROM WATER/RAIN.  Therefore you should be sure the forecast is good or you have a shelter/garage to keep the car in during that time.  FINISHED PRODUCT: Once the product had cured the bumper definitely looked very nice--even, glossy and shiny.  It looks very good when it's just been put on there.  If you had minor imperfections in the bumper it will actually look &#34;like new&#34; with this stuff coating it (at first at least).  The protection is &#34;good&#34; and by that I mean it's certainly better than having nothing on there at all.  In comparison to a clear bra/professional PPF product? Well it's not really going to offer that kind of protection unfortunately.  The picture shown on Amazon, with the key stretching the film?  Ehhh I'd say that's some very light/careful pressure they have there 'cause otherwise it'd go through the film.  For $25 I don't think you're going to find anything better to protect your front bumper (and whatever other areas you apply it to).  Rain notes: One downside to this product is that the coating, even when fully cured, is essentially hygroscopic to a degree.  That is, it absorbs or takes on water.  Whenever it rains or you wash your car with a hose or something, you'll notice.  The product can become cloudy and show water marks/streaks in it.  However DON'T panic.  These will go away as it dries as the stuff is breathable.  While you can/should wipe the water off as you're drying the rest of the car note that since the water actually gets INTO the coating, some of the marks will not go away until the material breathes and the water evaporates from it.  LONGEVITY: Well 3M claims the product typically lasts a year and as I've had it on my car a year I'd have to agree. The appearance is starting to be compromised and there's some &#34;smudges&#34; or tears in the film here and there, and it shows as bunched up/wrinkled material.  In some spots you can also see little air pockets underneath as rocks, etc. have hit the bumper and compromised the film.  I haven't taken the film off to check how well it protected it (or how tough it is to remove) but I did a full summer detail on the car a few days ago apart from the bumper which I only waxed and it still looks alright.  Aside from the spots mentioned above, the coating still shines up nicely when waxed and the bumper still looks alright.  I mean if the bumper actually looked like it does it would be in pretty bad shape (to me) but knowing it's merely a sacrificial coating is good because underneath it probably is in just about the same shape as when it was applied.  A year really isn't the greatest longevity BUT given the product only states it lasts that long, and it being only $25, means there's not really much to complain about.  The only thing is, hidden in that $25 cost is the cost of your own labour.  I mean if you want to do it well it's probably going to take you a full day, all said and done, to get this stuff on there.  Right now I'm thinking it's time to pull it off, take the bumper off the car and do the whole thing over.  I'm guessing that after doing this for a few years (every year) it will get to be a PITA.  However I guess them's the breaks when you're only spending $25.  Problem is for me in Canada, the product has been discontinued!!! :(  Fortunately it was just discontinued this year so I was able to pick up a new can on clearance for $15.  That was nice and all but I'm guessing I'll have to get it from Amazon/US (provided they don't discontinue it there) from next year as they'll all be gone from shelves here by then.  Apparently the reason 3M has given for the discontinuance is sales/response has been far less than expected, likely due to it being a fairly intensive DIY project.  This is true I suppose.  It takes a lot of prep, care, time and patience to do properly.  It's not like you just mask, &#34;spray bomb&#34; it, pat yourself on the back and crack a six pack--it requires a bit more dedication than that.  However for anyone that does a full detail on their car themselves once or year (or more), I'd say this is no more a DIY project than that.  For the people that never do that and/or pay someone else to do it, this product really isn't for you because you're either not going to have the patience and will do it sloppy (ending with a poor result) or you're just going to give up, pull it off, and then complain about it (not trying to be mean but its clear there's some reviews like that already on Amazon).  CONCLUSION:  PROS: -Relatively cheap -Easy to apply once you get the hang of it (and read some reviews) -Works almost exactly as promised -Good level of protection for the money  CONS: -Doesn't last very long (looks like a year or so) -Time consuming prep and application (not for the impatient or careless) -&#34;Rain/water effect&#34; (streaking/stained look when wet) -Not as much protection as true PPF  Overall I'm giving it 4/5 stars.  3.5 stars is probably more like it but there's no half-star rating on Amazon so 4 it is.  It's a good product and it does pretty much exactly what it says.  It's not a miracle product and it doesn't pretend to be one; it's hard to fault, especially considering the price.  If it were $50 per can it would definitely be getting 3 stars but for the fact that it's $25 and it works as promised, it's a winner in my book.
B000VKTUD2|5|Easy to install. Did it myself and saved probably $100 of inflated labor cost if I had it done at a shop
B00W31VMYC|1|Did not work as advertised. Only was able to connect with bluetooth and that was all. Not able to connect with ECU. This is not as advertised 2015 version. I would stay away from buying this.
B00KASR2Z8|5|Bought this for my now ex-girlfriend's car. We broke up before I could install it so here's a free 5 star review!<br /><br />Shipping was fast and the part seemed to be of high quality.
B000IZ2B6S|5|Nice
B008X03AUQ|5|99 Honda CR-V,diameter of the shock is larger than the mounting holes, takes some work to install be ready to fight!<br />SUV rides 100% better welds look good should last for another 100k hopefully!
B00T8I48VM|5|Sharp looking
B001O0XL7O|5|Best quality brake pads that I have ever seen.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Perfect for my 2014 wrangler unlimited sahara!
B0006IX87S|5|We were recently in 4 different parks through the east coast.  The water didn't have any bad tastes, as it did at several RV parks before we got this.  The water may have been just fine, but I'm not chancing it again after several bad experiences, as well as having the concern of my wife and 7 of my children.
B009LUQFMC|5|These look Awesome, I've actually gotten comments on them. 10X better than the dull yellow looking lights that came factory and all of them can be installed in like a minute with a small pocket flathead screwdriver.
B00G4S6BU0|1|I'm not happy with this purchase at all; it was absolutely not the right color even though I ordered it by the color and code given to Mr by Toyota dealership; I followed the touch up paint instructions and it still came out horrible; not even close to the actual color of my car.
B00WFCQXNY|3|great shipper and quality
B00681BFJU|1|Sorry....no mater how had I tried ,a pro's tried...even a new battery wouldn't program it.  I've wasted $10 before.....SIGH!<br />'
B00DBEPAVQ|1|did not work
B005334PMI|5|This is a super USMC decal not sticker a hair dryer is recommended for installation as the more heat you put on the easier it gets applied Do it slowly and you won't regret it. It looks awesome once applied.
B00L48T1F2|5|Easy to use
B00CKGAGM4|5|Very easy to install and much less than price from Volvo dealer's parts counter.  Don't forget, need to buy bulbs separately.
B00DK1APUQ|5|Fits great
B00HYEZU9G|4|Arrived as advertised.  Mine came without any wiring diagram (i.e., which wire was for ground, running light, and brake light).  Easy to figure out, of course, but it would have been nice if a simple description had been included.  Bolted it onto the rear fender of a 10-year-old 150cc dirt bike, and it has been working fine.  Not as bright as the typical LED lights, so don't expect to be dazzled.  I don't know how many lumens it is putting out, but it visually appears closer to what you might expect from an old incandescent light bulb than from new LED lights.  But, plenty good enough for a (registered) dirt bike that needed a working tail light/brake light/license plate light.  I am happy with it for the money, and if it lasts for a few years in use, I will be more that satisfied.
B000E3FF1W|5|Holding up well, the stiffness seems good, but I'm running them in a ranger so I don't know if they'd be good in a jeep.
B00169PGZI|4|Works well.
B008VM0TLO|4|Install was straight forward but the way my child safety hooks were set up (Dodge Charger) I couldn't' actually ties the shade in place. I had to insert some screws in the holes I had on the hook area and secure them that way.
B0089UEOKA|5|Put this on a 98 civic cx. My car already had a cat delete, i dont care for cats. The install was pretty painless, minus putting the two parts of the header together. Stripped a bolt. The rear exhaust section had to be pulled foward 2-3 inches to meet up with header. No big deal. Sound of exhaust sounds like it can breath now. Louder in the higher RPMs. My o2 sensor went in fine. HOWEVER, after about a week, a smidge of superficial rust has formed. Still a great deal and better performance.
B00UYAVJUQ|5|Good quality, looks great. I didn't realize they were slightly angled but still looks good
B00U224GH4|5|It's really cool it really worked on my car pretty good no problem
B00RIWAOUO|5|This seemed too small until i got it in my 2012 Murano. Smaller bags and car care items went inside net. Grocery bags went behind net and for once nothing flew all over trunk! How cute co says please contact them before posting neg comments. Oh that is my policy!! My trunk looks very organized!
B00CM589B8|3|Mate said sucked
B003N9MQCK|5|It was a great buy
B000BCKWVE|5|Great gear oil for our Jeep SRT8. With the severe maintenance schedule listing changes every 15k miles, it's nice to find quality gear oil that doesn't cost a fortune.
B009RC2HVC|1|Bezel broke when I installed it. I had to used original.  Plastic seems very brittle and I'm concerned it will not make it through cold winter.  If Bezel is any indication of the quality and strength of the handle itself, I may need a back up.
B004VMMJ8E|5|As advertised. Went on nice, looks great
B001AWM5UK|5|love these
B0068FYMVO|5|I purchased two - one for a cruiser and one for a sport bike. Easy to install with plenty of wiring to run from bars to battery.<br /><br />For the cruiser, I used the clamp mount. Super easy to install. Several reviewers said the mount was cheap and broke. I had no problems and it seemed solid to me. It does come with a rubberized insert for smaller bars which I removed. Depending on your bar size, you may need to do the same.<br /><br />For the sport bike, bar clamp was not an option. The best way to mount would be to cut a hole on the far edge of the fairing just below the clutch or brake. There are some good videos on You Tube that show you how to do this. I didn't want to cut a hole in my fairing and didn't want to pay a pro to do it, so I monkeyed around with mounting locations using velcro. Ended up finding a spot on the bar to the left of the key hole. 400 miles and NO problems at all.<br /><br />A couple of notes:<br /><br />1. This product comes with no installation instructions. It's intuitive, but if you need help there are numerous You Tube videos for all sorts of bikes.<br /><br />2. You'll want some zip ties before you start the install. I used them to tie to the frame or other existing wiring or lines to keep everything tight from front to back and to tie up excess wiring.<br /><br />3. I've read several reviews that suggest if you leave the unit connected to the battery with anything plugged into the adapter it'll drain the battery. This product has a male/female connector near the battery mount end of the wiring that can be disconnected. There's enough room to leave the connector exposed slightly under the seat so you can easily unplug it when you turn your bike off. Problem solved.<br /><br />4. If I have one complaint - and it's minor - it's that the rubber adapter cover is difficult to get off and on.
B004HIJXWW|5|very nice
B00IGJKFXE|5|A very nice set for the money
B00QXYL6LY|5|All that.. Looks good not hard to put on at all..lot of compliments.. i beleive the smaller size might fit a lil better (gonna order and see)...Brings the inside out in a good way def recommend
B00KWM8C6U|5|Looks great in my Toyota Avalon!
B0002MA588|4|The mud guards themselves appear to be tough enough, I will update this if it changes in the future. they provide 3 or 4 sheet metal screws for each mud flap with the intent that you will be screwing these directly to your sheet metal of your vehicles wheel well. I used 12&#34; X 1 1/8&#34; metal strip over the mud flap and screwed them directly to the frame of my flat bed. I took off one star for inadequate mounting hardware. The metal strips were less than 4 dollars each at Tractor Supply down the road.
B00IKGKR5O|5|Words can't describe how awesome this is. I live in the mountains and this light is a lifesaver
B009462HB6|5|I have a 2013 SX190 and this cover was a perfect fit, well made and feels and looks like it will last.
B000FKKOK6|4|The horn works well.  I read a review by another shopper that said that this 72102 high note horn sounds better when paired with the 72112 low note horn.  I paired this with the low note horn and it sounds good.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Never knew a battery could make such a difference in the way a bike could handle. The battery is so light that it dropped the center of gravity down making bike more nimble at slower speeds. And still has plenty of cranking power!
B00SVEBAN8|3|Shipped quickly and the etching is nice. Just wish the frame were metal and not plastic.
B000HEBR3I|5|Looks to be well built, however I have not actually used it to transfer gasoline yet, which was the primary reason I purchased it.
B003ZWG6T4|5|Perfect replacement... 8^}
B00HNNQF0Q|4|I like it
B000F5ED44|5|This tool was used recently for brake lines. It is good quality and virtually the same as my friends much more expensive SnapOn. It has a good smooth finish, cuts quickly making a clean square cut, and comes with an extra cutting wheel. This is much better over the lower quality more expensive tools all the chain auto parts stores carry. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality tool at a great price.
B006X8BGPG|2|DOESNT FIT!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Didn't fit my bumper so I had to drill holes for it and I have the stock bumper on too
B00IN9784G|5|Works great

B0089LSMSE|5|great
B00CIRR0P6|4|Product as described
B000BYNGLU|3|Very solid product with great looks. This was the only solar powered vent I could find. It does work but not well enough for my application. Recommended for use with a very small space.
B0001MQ7FO|5|Works as expected.
B000N9HZWY|3|Great product but I didn't get a gasket with mine.
B00696Y74O|5|Simple - It works and the order and fulfillment process was quick. I purchased after I had problem attempting to refuel at an older pump one without the new larger nozzle and yes it was diesel.  The adapter is in my glove box now.  It gives me a bit of security if I ever run into a need to refuel with an alternate method or with an older pump nozzle.
B00NQVFMGC|5|I received in quick time just what I ordered.  It works fine and was a great price.
B008RIEQXY|5|Will use inside cab as well for map/highlight lighting Delivered on-time, packaged as described. Great product! Would buy again!
B000F5DQWY|5|Very loud, find nicely on my mini bike.
B001GJ3FIS|5|works great
B000DN7Q3S|5|Great!!! I just placed them with my own hands. No tools. They are perfect
B00VCUM4QU|3|on fit certain cars check for your vehicle before purchase
B00AMZ0IQO|5|My step mom had been searching for these everywhere, I made her day sending her these!! She was very happy with the product 😁
B00GBSCS5K|4|This is a very good tool roll, well made with great stiching an durable material. What would make it perfect is a better closer, such as a plastic clip.
B007F0RJ3O|5|I debated on the cheaper versions of this that you can cut to size etc...but I am so glad that I went with this one. This offers great protection, the 2 prices allow you to get to the under compartments with the trunk area. I know some mentioned that there was a gap but I did not find this to be an issue at all! Price was great, shipping was fast! I highly recommend this for your Prius!
B000LGU48Q|5|Fast shipping, great looking .thanks
B00480GYZI|4|They do not seem brighter or shine farther than the factory bulbs but they are noticeably  a whiter light and they closer match my white light fog lights when they are on together before the factory lights we're yellow

B00FE01V54|5|This did just what we hoped it would in giving us room for a larger coffee mug than the original built-in compartments.
B00EBQAW84|5|Very good. Looks awesome in my car. I would purchase again if necessary.
B000XBDINW|5|This is the classic spark plug for many small four cycle engines.
B000COOM0S|2|Well i finally finished building the motor, installed the distributor (8/15) and the car fired  right up ran great.  Then died wouldn't restart.  Then later it started fine went for a drive ran great.  Came home, parked the car, went out later to move it no spark.  After checking everything to make sure all connections were correct, i test the TFI module on the distributor...its dead.  After some research it is appears to be a common complaint on these so i have contacted MSD and we'll see what they say.
B00COYZJLA|4|FYI .. ordered for f250. picture show 3 brackets but only comes with two.. seems solid enough but would have preferred 3 support brackets.
B000C7YRNM|5|No problem at all goot transactions

B00BYWXWCQ|4|worked just fine if you have the right cutting tool so other then that its fine
B00DJ5KE9U|5|Easy to use and very portable.  Awesome buy
B00HVJ899C|3|The cushion is soft and reasonably comfortable,  but it gets extremely hot in summer (I leave in CA) if you leave your car outside for a few hours.  And it does not loose heat for hours -- the material inside has huge heat storage capacity and thermal inertia.  Also you cannot easily move  your butt on it, so you end up sitting on the same spot all the time.  It also makes the driver sit much higher, so I have to put my Camry-2014 seat  in the lowest position to sit at a medium-height.
B00SR1SQPA|1|It arrived with a hole in it.

They're so easy to use that I use one pair to cover the front window and one pair for the back window. Each pair will cover the dimension listed because each one is 32x34. They curve under the rearview mirror and leave almost no gaps. 2011 Ford Focus SEL.
B000C542FC|5|Didn't get a chance to physically install this part on my car. I ended up not needing the moog inner tie rods but I did end up replacing my left and right outer tie rods. This was a moog part I used, as far as qualilty, moog is the best if your not going with oem. I guarantee you'll love it!!! Yeah
B00496LXJ8|5|All Good!
B000XRHRZQ|4|As expected
B00SYJNU6U|5|Excelent product
B006GFBGKG|4|I am happy with this product. Its a little different than I expected but I am not disappointed.
B000NSHUZ2|5|Fit great......looks very well built.  That was when it was installed.UPDATE.   Tie rod end developed play (wear) in less than one year....very disappointed in AC Delco.  Another disappointing auto part supplied out of China.  Had same poor experience with AC Delco brake disc's purchased on same order, which required replacement in less than six months due to warping.
B00PYZ00RY|5|Fit perfectly
B000C7YQ3I|2|Product is in great condition But was listed wrong Will not work on my gti it was cheap so I will not ship back
B001B5G9NU|2|UPDATE BELOW!<br /><br />Disk, pressure plate were quality looking items, and ran smooth and light installed. The throw out bearing was missing any stamps and had me questioning it, appearing to be a cheap part from China. You might want to order one separately. http://www.hondapartsnow.com/genuine/honda~bearing~clutch~release~22810-PCY-003.html<br /><br />UPDATE: I put normal grease on the throw out bearing, and it went dry in a couple weeks of hard use!  The petal feel went very stiff and engagement was unpredictable.  You MUST order the high temp grease, or you will be pulling the transmission again to apply it later! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BFDFYKW<br /><br />It also looks like Billman does not recommend this kit.  http://www.s2ki.com/s2000/topic/956248-clutch-recommendation/page__view__findpost__p__21754014<br /><br />As expected, the bearing crapped out in less than a thousand miles.  I called Exedy and they report they do get the bearing from an unknown (various) supplier, and it is not marked whatsoever.  They claim they test them, and offered to send me another unmarked one which is unacceptable in my opinion.<br /><br />MY RECOMMENDATION: only order this kit if its price is cheaper while including an OEM throw out bearing and grease as a separate purchase.
B00BTLEIIY|5|Fit great. Fairly east to install. Good price for the quality. Best of all, they keep my new truck seats protected from my two Great Danes.
B003C508XO|5|I used this to run the scavenging pump on my turbo for ~45 seconds after shutdown. Took a little work to get the terminals figured out but works great.
B00DR15OXW|5|There is a trick to getting these on, but once you do they fit great and seem sturdy.  I got these to replace door skins with flimsy zippers that had broken after several months.  I suggest you watch this video so you can install them correctly and with the least amount of frustration.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnqdTPuhuMs
B00QGE1YB8|5|It's blingy and feels well-made.  I think for the price that I paid, it was worth it.
B00C7XXTRO|5|Perfect fit!
B000CKGAV6|5|Same thing that came out of my car, works with no problems.
B007WR25ES|5|Lashed to the roof racks on our explorer and did not move one inch for 1200 miles through steady winds and lots of bumps.<br />The straps stayed tightened until unleashed. The only drawback is that, for security, it is wisest to take it off at night and put it back on the next day.<br />But once it was on, it did not move at all! A great bag for sure!
B00BJCAPEE|5|👍👌🚘🚘
B00IZR6FDG|1|I ordered 6 of these and one was defective with no return. Don't waste your money on these buy from a place that will allow returns
B00JBIB4B6|5|Very nice upgrade love the headlights fit perfect. Here's some before and after pictures.
B00J5XV4X0|5|Nice quality and a great price. GREAT job, FRAM!
B00GHT8CVC|2|The first one I received came in opened plastic packaging with the top of the handle broken off and not in the package.  Received a replacement and the &#34;o&#34; ring in the handle is too large and has to be replaced; otherwise, it the &#34;o&#34; ring washer looks like it will fall off and slide into the engine. Hoping for better, but I've heard the original, like this one is a poor quality design in the handle.  Not sure there are other options.
B009PAK75E|4|Front is easy to put on and fits perfectly. Back is definitely a hassle to put on and is a bit big. Even though it shifts a bit when moving in and out of the car...it's very cute.
B0049C9XLC|5|Removed factory airbags and installed these ACDelco springs on a TBSS. Ride is better and it carries a load well. Only possible negative is that it raised my ride height in the rear to about 34.3 or so inches from the 33 that I was running with my airbags. But well worth the price compared to having to install new airbags. Install took about a couple of hours and you will need a spring compressor to inset the springs. No instructions come with the springs so they only thing you need to research is how to remove the old bags and disconnect their lines and disabling the air compressor (I just pulled the compressor fuse in the engine bay).
B001CAB9ZM|5|worked
B0009IQXCC|5|Needed something with the UV protectant but without the slimy and shiny residue.  I've used this on a BMW 328i and Mazda CX9 and love it.  Will definitely buy again when I run out.
B002PBUS8Q|5|For me too, this is my first pair of leather riding pants and thanks to the great fit, I will buy another. An unfinished hem is no problem, with some contact cement like Super 77 these pants are easily customized to the length you want.  I'm  6'2&#34; 90-lbs and got the Size 34, they did not need much modifying/shortening and with legs bent on the bike, they are just right! No more flapping in the wind. Also, the pants are of a very high quality . The order arrived in two days and the fit was perfect. I highly recommend this product to my motorcycle friends.
B0028PJ10K|5|I love that i can stack to the level i need.
B01124OWMO|5|Works like a little red button for your seadoo should!
B0002KO40K|5|love these
B00446YIYK|3|It's OK but quite slow. I've reverted to Moccona
B007D44C82|5|Sticks good. Slow shipping
B00UW1T31Y|5|Fits a 1999 Camry LE 4 cyl.. FYI you need to pull out the entire hose unit including the canister attached under this hose before replacing.
B00FSCCV0W|5|Exactly what I needed!!!
B00NSIA9GQ|1|doesn't spin at all
B00PCE6EBS|5|These hold up great and are amazing!
B00OYI9XW0|5|Just what is should have been
B004CT24DQ|5|This starter was to replace the one in my 1995 Ford Ranger 4.0L. Once I received it I took it out of the box and sat it next to the one I bought from O'Reilly Auto Parts several years ago. I was shocked to find that the two parts are virtually identical. The 12V solenoid wire is the same, the housing body and cast end are all the same, and you wouldn't be able to figure out which one cost 2-3 times more than the other. I also didn't have to pay a core charge and now I have my old one to repair and keep as a spare. Once I replaced the starter in my truck it worked right away and has been working fine for over a month now. I'll definitely be buying another one if I ever need it in the future. Great buy!
B003S1RQ2S|5|really fast service and fits my verizon fios backup battery great
B00DT1V7P4|4|good helmit, but sizes run small, order one size bigger than you think you need.
B005HR1ZPK|5|Item was as described. Kuryakyn brand is covered by a label with a bar code. I would recommend this product and seller. Easy to install.
B000PSJMWY|5|Simple tune-up for my chainsaw.  Easy to install.  Easier starts.
B00ZG6JKUO|2|About half of them were stuck together because they weren't centeredon there backing. So I wasted half my money.
B004RCT19I|4|It is the correct product for my generator.  It works as it should.
B005ETCIO8|5|One year in and not a single one has burned out in my 2013 volt. I'm happy.
B000GZQIU0|5|Looks good. Sturdy
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Fantastic light! Fits perfectly on my jeep
B002ONEM78|5|Fantastic warning vehicle light!
B00009PGNS|5|This has been a great cooler.  Nice fit in the van and easy to get in to when travelling. Saves looking for ice all the time.
B000RFSARI|5|we love this. cleans hose well and very easy to use
B00WD7GKDE|3|Looks nice but the tape did not hold when it got hot inside the car.
B000AY3LNO|5|Grandma liked it.
B00D3QUIUA|3|I assume it's working, smells still get into the cabin but I didn't really expect this filter to be perfect. It fits and doesn't block airflow.
B0063CUEQ4|5|Just as advertised good product very pleased thank you for the prompt shipment
B008QXZ6Z2|5|Nice looking design; fits and functions as expected.
B009EJRBZ0|5|I read all reviews carefully and am so glad I chose this. I followed the directions offered by one reviewer, plug the thing in the cig. lighter, attach to tire, turn on. Worked like a charm in about 30 seconds. This is a thing of beauty.
B001FI3NRS|5|Absolutely perfect, fast delivery, just as requested and advertised!!! AAA+++
B00UZEDZ1W|5|These are a serious improvement over the stock bulbs in our 2010 Subuaru Forester. We're really enjoying the superior illumination when we have to drive a night. We live in an are with a lot of deer and are now able to see them much earlier than before, so we have a better chance to avoid problems.
B00BTGDR9A|5|They do the job,  I just didn't take in mind I have a 8&#34; back plate on my polisher so it made kinda complicated work on the edges ..
B001DBXPEI|2|This is a low quality looking china import brand evaporator. I started removing my Honda evap, and realized it wasn't where the leak was. After about 10 years of use and being wet for long periods of time (we live in Houston and AC every day) the OEM evap looked a LOT cleaner and better condition than this one out of the box. I left the OEM one intalled and didn't use this. I was not very impressed. Looked to have some galvanized coating or something on it, which maybe a way of dealing with lower quality fin and tube material corrosion. I'm going to sell it and not go this direction again. I give two stars and it would likely work, and fit the intended use, although I don't think its made very well.
B00C57H32O|5|Easily seen during the day. Delivered on-time, packaged as described. Great product! Would buy again!
B009FBFKKU|5|Delivered as promised, excellent .., all as promised, .price. quality and deliver.
B00CDHD76C|5|I have no complaints about this set.  Yes, it did arrive with heads just being thrown in a box.  I was initially worried that something was missing. When putting every head in its proper place everything matched and was accounted for in the set.  It is kind of hard to open, but at least I know I won't lose anything. It is more than adequate for every mini job you have.
B008D7KXYK|5|works just as expected
B0054HNQ32|5|Great price and work well.
B0013ET0YE|3|the sound is really good but the fitment could be better,one muffler hangs down lower than the other no matter what you do.I tried everything to get them the same height but its not going to happen.The hangers seem to be a little off.
B001DRBYG8|2|Brakes are squealing during initial braking.  Disappointed.  There is also substantial amounts of brake dust present on my rims.  I will replace these soon.
B00OK702NO|4|No installation anything but excellent light output for the money.  And at such a low amp draw if you wire a basic switch lack of hardware and instructions aren't a problem.
B002VPTPQC|5|if you need a simple clean PS bracket for the SBC, go with this one!  Took longer to paint than it did to install!
B00OXBTWK6|4|Looks as advertised, and was received in a timely manner. So far (a week of ownership), I am satisfied.
B00990FTOO|5|Very cute and stylish caps. It fits perfectly. Colors are matching and these are good quality also.
B00AB92832|5|fitted the way was suppose to,very good
B004LGHPQ6|5|A set of these made my 2007 Honda Fit hum like it was new.
B004JNJPLY|5|Correct part perfect fit. Fast service.
B00K7D4OC0|1|Received the grommet in a timely fashion in the orig sealed Hyundai bag.  However when I opened the bag and went to install the grommet it fell apart.  It was dry rotted like the one I had on the car.
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Nice bag, easy to attach to my CBR 650
B000HEADH4|3|It showed up on time. But the mounting bracket was a little bent up which wasn't a big deal because I just sent it back by hand. Mine did not come with the barbed fittings for rubber hose installation. Which means I can't install it at this time. If I would have known this I would have ordered them. But everything that I read so this product was supposed to come with them.
B000O3M5CE|3|works good for me
B00VRFNOLY|1|Does not fit 2007 Chevy 1500
B000V83D2I|1|Just received this with Prime 2 day shipping, but it looks used. The outside is very dirty and looks corroded.
B00LSYW6QI|1|Did not receive the hardware, when it clearly states it comes with the hardware.  Husband already opened the package.
B001LQJWF6|2|Disappointed. There are no tabs or channel for the plate to slide into - so the plate and frame are not tight together. The emblem at the top extends into path of factory mounting screws. POOR FIT. Looks great off but installed..
B00BNVJY48|5|Genuine Mazda Lube at a better than dealer price, shipped in 2 days for free.  What is not to love?
B005C59Y8M|5|Beautiful pieces but decided not to keep.
B00XV4ZWXW|5|Great jacket! Obviously it has its little flaws, I've had the zipper catch a few times. But for the price it's fantastic!
B000C0TCOI|5|Perfect fit for 1988 MR2 upper rad hose
B0009IQXCC|5|So far no complaints after using it for my car and my moms too, it has gave it a shine to my plastic side skirts for my acura rsx. I've restored my moms jeep plastic exterior to look like new I'd recommend this for anyone looking to restore plastic exterior that needs some work on it.
B00BGD956K|5|excellent
B00BGD9F0Q|5|Looks amazing on my camry, haha
B007QV6BDG|4|This is a single jack stand, not a pair; the webpage doesn't state this. Seems like a very good stand but buying two of these is too expensive for me.
B005M186I0|4|Works like it should. Good buy for the money. Mounted on my 2013 Lund Rebel.
B004K2BG34|5|Good quality, keeps strap stored neatly and provides easy transportation if needed.
B001S84MNE|4|Product solved problem.  After installed it took a couple weeks before it started working due to the rock like material that absorbs liquid.  I almost sent it back and one day it began working.
B002ZBWKAU|4|Nice to fit in trunk for emergencies and easy to use.
B004GC8WZ8|5|Great fit on my 2001 Silverado !!!
B000R2R8C4|4|Works great
B000C2SCOM|4|Nicely made and mostly fits what I got it for (a 1958 model car restoration) but the retention ears are a little short and it can be turned past the lock position.
B00ZUEAD6C|2|Arrived late, was lost in transit, and when arrived, the high beams were actually the lows and the lows were the highs (checked next to the original halogen). One didn't have a high at all.  Poor quality control.
B00IWTR6TO|5|Very nice the red line matches the red in the car
B0002SQUFY|1|If you're going to try and put this onto your brake calipers to rotate them back in, think again. You need to PUSH hard to get them to bite onto the notches on your clapper pistons as well as try and turn the 3/8&#34; ratchet which is attached to these. By far, the best thing to do is to buy it, and use it as a paper weight. Next time I'm renting one from auto parts store because this was junk.
B00FALVU8A|5|Applied 2 coats after jet seal gives a nice wet look. Easy to apply and buffs off easier
B000W7Q5IM|5|Took longer to read the instructions then install we will see how it lasts over time. Also they look great.
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|Good
B000SXCLIS|5|Fast shipping and as advertise thanks
B0016IJ0XS|5|Wonderful unit, just what the doctor ordered
B00332GPOC|1|I ordered my deflectors for my wife's car and recieved them July 10. Just had the opportunity to open the box to install them (today August 12th) and found one of the deflectors broken in the box with the pieces taped together.<br />John
B008427D88|5|PERFECT
B005EMOPVY|1|Recived damage item I lost my money look far from original
B006B28CJC|5|Perfect oem match.
B00VVSC8TQ|5|Fits my key fob perfectly!  I love it and it will keep my key looking new for years!!
B004GW7O6G|5|These look sleek on my Wrangler.
B00DRK81AQ|5|Works as advertised
B00WUXBZ04|5|Shipping was right on schedule and product exactly as described.
B002DOME1E|5|great
B001PLWS9Y|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator
B000VKI08I|5|Bought these for my 2007 FJ Cruiser TRD Edition at 135,000 miles for the rt front, the left front went at 95,000... I like Timken but I wish they'd put in grease fittings, if you lube regularly they'll last a lot longer than these permanently lubed versions...
B00MJO4EC0|5|Great fit for where I needed to mount it and does a great job of moving air to keep my engine cool
B004BE2DK6|4|I'm not sure what can be said about a wiring harness except that it appeared well constructed and came with clear directions. The plug included a snap on cover + a contact lubricant. I only gave it 4 stars because the ground wire was ~18&#34; long with a ring terminal and depended on he trailer frame for continuity. That didn't work in my case. I had to buy a separate wire and terminals to complete the circuit to the rear of the trailer.
B0041TRSZ6|5|cheaper than OEM, and fit!
B00AIWJCG8|5|Love it!
B003UNDQQE|3|Work relatively well, but exhaust side of bike is still hot. I would recommend this seller. They work better than nothing, but leave much to be desired. They are easy to install. They look like chrome once on the bike. I found some leather ones that I want to try.
B004TXVOSG|5|what you pay for is what you get
B00WX2DWFI|1|TERRIBLE!  Pouches are TOO small for anything but a water bottle.  Major struggle to return and get refund.  Chinese vendor did NOT want to retund money and made it difficult.  Don't waste your time or money.  Not worth it.
B000CPK2JC|5|Very pleased.
B000R2OOEO|3|returned
B0002MBR9E|4|fit good real noisy though
B0027QWNGO|5|This has been so useful.  Very satisfied with the purchase.  Love the zipper storage for the trash bags.  Would definitely recommend.
B00AEH4PP0|5|Great product, great price. Delivered faster than expected
B000CO86BY|5|Bought 2 pairs, used for wheel/tire rotations with a ~2700# hatchback.
B00GKRQ7DG|5|Looks great on my car!! Very easy to do and it came with a sheet with full instructions, definitely worth it and it's price is low, but even so the product isn't cheaply made at all.
B001KQD7TY|5|perfect match
B00BV6EWI8|5|Served its purpose and wasn't hard to install. Received on day that it was expected, and packed in good shape.
B0017LL3QQ|3|Works fine just a little pricey in my opinion.
B004A2IGK0|4|Item as described.  Great price, works well.
B004NBMDV6|5|Thanks
B006H34AE6|5|This seems to do very well, I have only used it once so far as it has just arrived today, but so far so good!
B00BVB4L0W|1|These are dorman parts wit prices jacked up.
B00BLI06JK|1|Does not fit LTZ400.  Ad says it does but the bolt pattern is not even close.  Had to purchase another light to fit
B00IFGM1QW|5|These look great and stay on. No leaks
B00BD52QCG|1|Wow what a waste of money! The instructions for installation were completely useless. None of the covers fit my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee even though the page said they would. Had three people helping to install them and nothing would work. The slightest movement while sitting causes the material to rip. DO NOT BUY. Also purchased the floor mats and, despite assurances to the contrary from the page, THEY DON'T FIT!
B00BKTQV1M|5|The part was exactly what I needed to fix the odometer on my Ford Ranger. It has been working great now for over a month. I would just recommend that anyone completing this repair first be sure to &#34;calibrate&#34; your speedometer BEFORE you pull the needle off so you don't have to play around with it once you have made the fix. There are plenty of YouTube videos out there of how to fix this part as well as how to calibrate your speedometer.
B000PA03AC|5|Works beyond my expectations.<br />I ended up mounting mine under the door where the radio is on my e39 adjacent to the CD slot, plenty of room in a blank area.<br />Now I'll order two more for my other e39's.
B00WQHMMVK|4|Love it....not too big ....
B000JFJLP6|5|So far so good... Who need a battery bank for a smartphone or tablet? I used this so the kid could watch movies late at night camping on a tablet using a USB powered external hard drive, ran lights at night and even hooked up the power inverter for other reasons and still had a near full charge...
B00FAQO5YQ|4|Reasonable.
B00SZ4H2RM|4|The bar looks great on our 2015 Jeep Cherokee. Added style and character and complements all the other chrome features of the vehicle.
B00VKVUKJ4|3|Not the greatest quality, but looks good on the Escalade.
B001TNPJY4|5|Good product and price.
B000P72CV8|5|EXCELLENT LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B00TKOBL6O|5|Lower voltage and brighter than incandescent lights. I replaced every incandescent light in my 43 foot Jayco Recon Toyhauler. Wish I had done this a year ago! The incandescent lights draw so much current and get so hot, my wiring harness and toggle switch were damaged - this problem is solved with the LEDs. Excellent price coupled with the promise of the LED lighting 10x longevity made this switch a no brainer! I'm looking forward to the years of bright, cool service!
B00QURNR3E|5|I was a little leery about ordering this after reading some negative reviews, but decided to order it anyway.  I think the negative reviews were from folks with larger SUV type vehicles.  Glad I ordered it - I love it!!  It fits wonderfully in my car ( 2016 ILX)  and gives much needed additional storage as well as preventing things from falling down in between the seats.  I purchased these for the additional storage, but can't count how many times I have accidently dropped things between the seats - and was so happy I had these to catch the various items.  Sure beats trying to get my hand down far enough to retrieve things falling  all the way down to the floor! The beige color perfectly matches my car and it arrived MUCH earlier than the estimated date.  They arrived in original packaging and were well protected in the shipping box.
B009W85VM8|5|I have a 1981 ford f150 and it fit perfectly. I love the color I got which is blue. I was at first a little skeptical about all the loops and rope to hold it in place. After installing it, it didn't move around on the seat or bunch up. It is the perfect fit.
B00P2VXOUK|2|Edit: lasted 18 months before it shredded itself. Not great.   This regulator is nothing special, but it's no different than the cheap plastic regulator BMW put in these cars in the factory. I put this one in a few days ago. It's working fine, but I've had the matching (equally cheap) [[ASIN:B00P2VXM8E lefthand side regulator]] from this manufacturer in my car too, and it's lasted eight months. Not bad for $30!  Window goes up, window goes down. It works.  Note that these don't come attached with the motor as specified. You'll have to swap the old motor from the old regulator onto this one, which takes about 30 seconds.
B0000V0EB4|4|Had a similar product that kept popping open due to a poor design.  This product works great
B002MQCYO0|5|good
B000CP86ZY|1|Was suppose to fit my 2015 Buick Enclave but would not work and the package didn't even say it would fit my car..
B004A30MFQ|5|works great like dicor always does.
B00KZC60KC|5|Light works good on my side by side for night rides at the mud parks
B00B1TNQCS|5|Fits my 2014 Tacoma PreRunner perfectly. Looks great. I like the Tacoma logo. It makes the plastic bed more useable. Things don't slide around anymore. I would definitely recommend this bed mat.
B000CJ1OZ4|2|Like many of the other reviews mine seems to have died a quick but painful death, I thought might be bad batteries but after 3 sets I am convinced the motor is losing opening force.
B007V2EEW0|5|Works great
B004IQLZP6|1|Not satisfied with the way the cup is  made bends to easy .leaks ..
B000LQHCJK|5|Work beautifully
B008D8I652|5|Perfect fit, perfect style for a perfect helmet.
B00DBENBNU|1|Did not work even out of the package
B00J5U2HXE|4|Very fast shipping, quality if plastic is okay but not as good as BMW/Land Rover. But it will do the job for a quarter the price.
B00KAJX1Q6|5|Perfect size
B00TTB0NLW|5|oem match, so far so good, love it
B000CM3I00|1|Didn't fit vehicle that it said it would fit. We made it work, but its not an exact pattern shape as a GMC Pickup. The tape that comes with it is useless. I had to purchase a stronger glue that would hold the mirror to the truck. Don't Recommend
B0001EXM82|2|2 of the 4 pieces were not cut properly to match placement on doors.
B00Y8Q96K2|1|Don't cool the bottles in good time
B00ICSPGI8|3|Good Price fit well even with my after market pipes. But was missing bolts to in stall other wise it would have been a 5 star<br />and the instruction were not very good but you can see how they fit.
B00OSVGZHY|5|Easy install, good quality, matches the OEM exactly, No Torque Wrench but my Toyota dealer wanted $340 + $112 Install so saved a lot of $$$$$$.
B00F675VI8|5|excelente producto
B00X9CI3G4|5|Loved them and displayed proudly on our Jeeps
B00DFSVGGG|5|Excellent high quality cable, 1 quantity= 5' ( i bought 4 qualities So i received 20'. And that's mean 6 Meter.  😊<br /><br />I will use it with my car project. for multiple device sources.<br /><br />Thanks
B000HCNUZ8|5|OUTSTANDING
B00JX1NZ3Q|5|Great!!!
B004LX3AS6|4|Good
B001KS8616|1|Lastest two months. Boot is cracked and the ball joint is shot. Replaced the whole front end of the car to find out it was / is this product that was the problem the whole time (did't think it was this product being I installed it (new) two months prior to the front end being rebuild). Passenger side is fine/good so far (which was installed at the same time).
B0012IT4RE|5|The product is what I expected, good quailty and color.
B0010713QW|5|Awesome product!
B00K9BEXTE|5|Proud to be an American
B00D6N0UWQ|5|Could not be happier!  Car runs perfect now.  Product was delivered on time as promised.
B00W67T1Y6|4|Arrived as ordered.. I was hesatant at first to order because i wasn't sure what size my engine guard was, but these come with an insert that you can remove for larger engine guards or leave in for smaller ones.<br /><br />Easy to install took less than 10 mins to gather tools and put both on..<br /><br />Look great as well.<br />Great Product
B005DCKRP8|5|I bought this when I got my new car back in September(11 months) and it still looks like new!  I love it. It's not super bling-bling but it shines in the light. NONE of the rhinestones have fallen off. I am impressed :) Thank you.
B008M4RKNG|5|very nice part, good price
B003KL72E8|5|I like this stuff. And you gotta try the car wash soap. Impressive shininess indeed.
B004GDGMNG|5|Easy to install and perfectly packed, nothing broke.
B000WO5LW6|5|Arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised.  Easy to replace the old windshield and fit / finish was A+.
B00UW6V56U|5|Good quality material and easy to install.
B008XN7SM4|3|Works like it should. the plastic coating slips off on occasion
B003S1RQ2S|5|Fits perfectly in my Verizon FIOS box, but turns out (like many others) my battery was actually not bad.  It seems like in certain cases the FIOS box thinks it needs a new battery when disconnect of the battery will get the unit to reset.
B000FW2MWW|5|Must have for your battery tender. No need to worry about if you have enough cord.
B001MOXAU0|5|Works great!
B0085S0JNW|5|Awesome!
B001THWFII|5|This is truely a great Product.  I used it on my 2015 Ford Mustang wheels and it shined them up Great!
B004QQ8SEY|5|Bought this to replace a &#34;big box&#34; unit that had developed a bubble on the hose. This appears much better constructed, has a longer hose which gives me more flexibility.
B000EVYH72|4|Many of my specialty tools were stolen and I assume pawned this is to replace my old one. Very fair price and works great!
B00ACK79VG|5|The license plate is just the right touch to place on my 2009 &#34;Bullitt&#34; Mustang at car shows.
B009EVOVFQ|5|Great
B00DBLIT8A|3|Not bad for the price. Logo starts to fade after while
B009D291C4|5|Nice parts

B004FPW8SS|5|The best oil for my car, it was recommended by a friend of mine who's a internal combustion engine engineer, I trust him!
B001O0GK9K|5|works great
B00DSRK980|5|Good Bussman fuses at a good price.
B008BVVY1O|4|I just received them and they were hard to install. I assumed I could just put them over the seat and be done with it but I had to go to Home Depot buy socket wrenches to take the arm rests off... Needless to say installing them was more difficult than I perceived them to be when I ordered them. I have a 2015 Honda Odyssey with a two bench seats, also. The head rest were too small but after all said and done it looks nice and hopefully my new seats are protected from my kids!
B0022ZN7OC|4|Been using these speakers for about a year now. The sound is great! I've connected these to my G4 and to my Sony Walkman MP3 player. Volume was more than adequate on my Vulcan 900 doing 75 mph. I gave 4 of 5 stars only because the coil wire had a short in it near the 1/8 connector when I received it. I replaced it with one I bought for $3 at WalMart and it works perfectly.
B010PVJAUY|5|For the money this helmet is absolutely beautiful! I wasn't sure if the graphics would be a sticker or painted on. To my surprise they were silk screened and painted over with a clear finish. All the detail both on the helmet and inside are beautifully done. The chin strap has a nice buckle on it and the clear shield is also nice quality. The helmet looks like a $200.00 helmet. I would definitely suggest purchasing this helmet.
B001PWFPE8|3|I like the idea but didn't work like the product video. Tailgate still comes down hard just not like before. Simple to install only reason for 3 stars is because of the fact it doesn't work as advertised
B00AC6XRDE|4|Provides alot of storage / gets the job done at a price point I could justify.
B00PU15WWU|3|cheap
B00753S8CC|5|LOVE IT!
B00NPUTZA8|5|GREAT PRICE!! FAST SHIPPER!!
B00EWHO1RU|1|Don't waste your money. The cords come unattached of the light. Also, the box to change the light pattern is cheaply made.
B0073V1KEO|5|Made clean cuts through 0 gauge wire. Would recommend.
B00FDQPCR2|5|I installed this light in about 20 minutes. Works well and lights up the area about as good as I expected.
B00F676B0U|4|I have looked for a metal one but could not find one, so had to stick with this OEM.
B000C5A0CG|5|This thing is so solid. You could probably put the weight of the whole car on this and it would hold it up (i wouldn't try that though lol). Fit right into place and restored my cars steering response and stability. 10/10
B006TMKKDK|5|Arrived as promised, un-damaged, installed easily !
B00CUREA5C|5|I don't know how this is possible, but after washing my car, I can dry the entire thing without wringing it out one time.  I drive a small car, but  still.... I can't believe it holds all that water.
B005VKLPMQ|5|just what I wanted factory replacement hope it lasts longer than the original
B01188SXMY|5|Great product, no lost in reception. Look really cool on my blk out jeep.
B000UTTOFS|5|Pretty good meter , very happy with the purchase.
B007C7EJVK|5|Omg! Slam dunk. In stalled in 40min, easy. what a difference in performance. I also added the Gibson exhaust! True power enhancement. Btw I have a 2015 jk
B00WY4BGLW|4|Worked out good on my 03 Highlander with yellow lenses after trying other products.  Impressed great price.
B00032KC2G|5|They fit great, I love that they are Tampa-proof as well
B0024E6E3C|4|will buy next size bigger next time. sun shrinks them up
B0043OV0IA|5|Works as advertised.
B00GT6TZQE|3|The EGR cooler is fine. It seems all the gaskets seal properly. I had one specific issue however, the EGR cooler hose doesn't seal correctly. Last night it worked great. I started the truck this morning let it run and sure enough coolant was running down on the passenger side head by the fire wall. I only recommend these type of stainless steel coolers to my customers but to save yourself the headache just order the Ford OEM cooler hose it's part number 4C4Z8592AA. When you put them side by side you will actually notice the OEM cooler hose/connector is slightly longer than this aftermarket part as well. With the new one from Ford it works like a top.
B0050PPLLI|2|wore out heavily half way though a cross country trip
B00SWAVI4W|1|Will not work on a 2012 Prius as advertised!
B000C5C3XU|5|as described and received promptly
B00YTCIO2G|2|Plasticy but useful
B0002Z9KE0|5|good solid construction an carrying case..works great once get past the first few times adjusting it and its gravy from there on!
B00H3TMNPQ|5|Looks great
B000IXSF42|5|I can't find better than this
B00CI42W5W|5|Have had it for about a year now.<br />Working great.<br /><br />Very stiff. But that's OK once you get it mounted.<br />Stopped that rattle every time I went over the least little bump.<br /><br />A little expensive, but at least it IS good quality.
B00HYIKEKW|4|Delivered on time.... A++
B0001UZUW2|4|you do have to hit the fly against a solid surface--against fabric upholstry, the fly will not die with this device.
B000CJ00EA|3|Very poor packing  and had to straighten the edges back so it would fit. Good price and looks good also
B00192JGN0|5|This is just what we wanted and we are so pleased with the quality.  We have ordered several Camco items for our RV and each item has been  excellent quality.  We will remember Camco when we need something else for our RV.  The price is very affordable, too.
B002FDMBKM|5|Great fit...great product.
B002LEICSK|5|Nice purchase
B00AOA8J7M|5|Arrived as described.  This is my fourth vehicle I have put these mats in.
B001GJ3E2K|3|bristles on brush are too soft to really scrub wheels need to be stiffer
B002UC6P6E|5|As expected, no issues.
B004YA4YPO|5|Nice helmet
B00BUSIKQ2|4|also works for Jeep Cherokee 2015
B00G49DUKI|1|THIS PRODUCT IS HORIBLE IT HONESTLY SUCKS AND ITS SUCH A RIP OFF FOR 15 $ DONT EVER BUY THIS ILL STICK TO OTHER MEGUERUS OR ARMOR ALL TIRE SHINE
B003A26Q80|5|Great stuff. Had the annoying whistle sound of my old BPV not closing fast enough when I let off the gas with conservative driving. I noticed it when I went stage 1 with the Cobb SF intake. I took the intake off and returned it to stock and still noticed the sound. So I decided to bite the bullet and buy this one hoping it wasn't going to rice out my WRX. Sounds just like stock with a shorter &#34;CHHH&#34; when I shift after WOT. Fits perfectly on a 2010 WRX Hatch, literally took me less than 5 minutes to install and completely fixed my issue. More responsive pedal now too, but only slightly.
B008FCE556|5|easy install.
B000JZDB6Q|5|Fit my car perfectly and was great for the price.
B0001CMUV4|5|Again works as advertised.
B000CB3X4W|5|Been using these for years on several different cars/trucks.<br />Changing the inserts versus the whole wiper assembly Saves A LOT of money.<br />Have you priced the dealer replacements? Right...<br /><br />They are becoming difficult to find in auto parts stores, so<br />I keep at least one in each car/truck.<br /><br />One word of caution when changing wiper blades or inserts;<br />ALWAYS block the wiper arm to protect the windscreen from damage.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B0009T6E9S|5|Works as expected
B0017K69MA|5|I hate dirty or flimy windshields.  The outside is easy enough to clean but I’ve never been able to get the inside perfectly clear.  Especially on humid but cooler days when I have the windows open – you always see a cloudy layer on the inside.  I cleaned my windshield with Invisible Glass spray and the micro-fiber cover and it is the cleanest it has ever been.  I think if I changed to a fresh cover and did it again it would be perfectly clear.  Highly recommended!
B004J38GZU|3|The metal parts in the kit are decent quality, but clearly not OEM level.  The fuel needle has a harder tip than OEM (like plastic), the OEM part has a rubber tip so I used the original since mine was fine and I felt it would make a better seal over time.  The bowl gasket is definitely lower quality compared to the OEM item, it did not fit the bowl exactly and wanted to push outside the gasket groove so I had to carefully ease the carb and bowl together and use a small flat blade screwdriver to gently push the gasket inward while pushing the two parts together.  I was concerned it might push inside rather than out, which you couldn't tell until you put gas back in the bike but it didn't because I was careful.  The OEM gasket lays perfectly into the groove and you can assemble with confidence, without the three handed ballet required for the gasket I received.  The parts you see in the photo are what you receive, so don't expect anything more.
B001QI7ITG|5|I like these, they came out looking great and they fit snug too in my 95 wrangler
B00F68HINI|4|I like these splash guards.  They really make my Accord V6 look better and sportier.  They were very easy to install, although for some reason it didn't have enough spring clips to finish the installation.  I had to go visit the local auto parts store to get a couple of clips to finish.  Really not a big deal, considering what I saved by avoiding the dealer.  I have had them on for a few weeks now, and they are solid.  We don't have ice or snow here, nor sand or salt, so they should last at least as long as the vehicle.  Only time will tell.  Highly recommended!
B00X123G8C|5|I rarely make reviews but I have to be the first say my impressions on this product.<br />My father recently purchased a 05 Honda Odyssey as a work van with wheels that looked like it never had been cleaned in its whole lifetime.<br />I've tried many products ranging from Chemical Guys Signature Wheel cleaner and even tried using Sonax to alleviate the break dust problem.<br />Most of the product I've used only had minimal effect, but by doing research, I discovered the power of acid based cleaners.<br />I decided to try this product and by gosh it worked wonders.<br />I've tried diluting the 1:4 ratio and with this it did do some work but with lotta elbow grease. But just as an experiment, I tried not diluting it.<br />The non diluted solution literally ate through the break dust with minimal agitation. I was amazed on how strong this product was.<br />This product is was definitely a 5/5 for me.<br />AS A WARNING, I only tried this on OEM wheels with a coating to prevent damage. I've heard some powder coated or some after market rims can be damaged by acid based cleaners. Use this if you are confident about what your wheels are before it can cause some major damage.
B00Z2R1OJM|5|This product is great for all the handy men/women out there. it's good for it's price. You can put any sizes of drill bits. You can use it with any metal stuffs you have. Clips & etc... It's good quality. It heavy duty. You must have to try it to see for yourself.
B00D9C2CDO|4|Great product, holds a lot of stuff.  Made a multi state trip and had this packed to the max.  I had two luggage bars running parallel to my car and the straps attached really well to these.  There is a piece in the front that I didn't understand.  It zips all the way around and there is velcro to protect the zipper part but in the front there is no zipper and no velcro so when I was driving, there was a part flapping-I know hard to picture.  Still recommend.
B008SBV9ZI|5|Fit like they were made for my car.
B00QIVK4KQ|5|Looks to be very high quality and seems to be working great.
B0042XORMI|5|great buy....fast delivery
B00HZTDKZG|5|GREAT CHARGER - maintainer
B00LI9GXQW|5|Great price fast shipping. Thank you
B009DK6GQA|5|look great
B00VMUA82W|5|Awesome wiring harness
B003T0YXN8|4|Fit my 2000 Camry well enough.
B00B788KRO|1|I must agree this is an amazing product! I enjoy the lovely citrus scent! I shop from AMAZON quite frequently!  This is the very FIRST time I have been dissatisfied!  The box, the receipt, & the item description ALL say &#34;SEVEN OUNCE CANS!&#34; HOWEVER, upon opening the package today, the cans are only SIX & ONE HALF OUNCES PER CAN!!! This is false advertising & makes the savings through AMAZON considerably less! I ordered  & paid for SIX cans. This smaller can makes the total order THREE OUNCES short. Not sure if AMAZON will do anything to compensate for this or not. We shall see!
B00P2D4BXW|5|Nice lights and price
B00HV0RXI4|5|I was really satisfied with my purchase. They were just as expected. Looked new and everything was inlcuded. And when i let them know my package had not yet arrived they wrote back to me and made sure i was satisfied.
B00KH5FY22|4|Giving 4/5 because cannot seem to get it to remember last function. Which sucks. But all in all great for dash or rear glass..
B001OBKJVO|5|Perfect fit
B00K1NS0PS|5|This Kit was perfect for my 20&#34; light bar install on my truck - wire gauge may need to be a little heavier to run a bigger bar (a 20&#34; 124watt bar draws 12-13 amps ) even though this kit claims to be 40a capable - I'd be looking for 12 ga or better wiring for a 40&#34;+ bar just in case. That being said it comes with a connector end that can be installed directly to the wiring coming from the bar so that everything snaps together nice and neat. The switch has a good solid click feedback and is stiff enough to not get bumped accidentally on, draining your battery (if you somehow fail to notice the 12000+ lumens the bar puts out) or blinding anyone unfortunate enough to be looking at the light bar tethered to this great little wire set. Very pleased, time will tell how it holds up and rating will be revised if need be.
B001C09ENQ|5|Seems to work as expected.
B006N96ZJW|5|Fit my 99 blazer, solved all my steering issues. I did all the steering and alignment myself. too easy and the shop wanted over $800 for less than $100 in parts and about 4 hours of work. I will never pay a mechanic to work on my vehicles.
B000GTOSTE|5|Good
B00JBIBID0|5|They fit perfect & looked very good. Very satisfied.
B003YBRM76|5|This exhaust gives my truck a lot more top end power, running this with a Diablo sport tuner and a K&N filter.  With the Diablo tune running E-85 my truck will out run most other trucks, while towing a 3,500 LB boat you will be passing other trucks up hills. Well worth the money and sounds great with minimal drone in the cab, recommend running the side out if you tow as it will echo with the rear out.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I live in extreme desert heat. This is large enough to cover my SUV windshield. Really blocks the light.
B00FOSSPGO|5|Awesome product. Containers make the process easy. Gained .5mpg with this product also
B000BRCKTG|4|Manufacturer recommended product.  Onan is a top of the line company. I would not use another other than their products for tune-ups!
B00CFCI36Y|5|Good for the price.
B00PX6DY18|5|fits vehicle very well
B000CIMDOQ|2|Didn't fit over the exhaust end that it was supposed to.
B00CQAOLL6|5|Works well
B0041CDPQO|5|Works great.  Love it.
B00G23NN0S|5|Amazing , look very nice in my rims and good material
B000TYQB14|5|Easy to install and worked great
B000CAINEI|1|Ad makes it sound like it is specific for my vehicle. It fits very poorly. It is a generic one-size-fits-all
B00PBOR6C0|5|The taillight assembly arrived on time. Took me a little time to figure out how to install it, about an hour and half, because there were no instructions. I'm guessing I was suppose to take it to someone who knew I to put it on.
B00LT4ARZY|5|This was after a lot of research the best solution and the support from Willwood was also awesome ..  Amazon, best price so win win for me.
B009FUF6DM|3|okay
B001G4Z5J0|5|Easy install if you have the wrench. Fits Chevy traverse
B0026MCTL8|5|Just the part I needed
B005GL8BS6|4|Great product
B00NF1PT8O|5|Fit excellent good quality
B0008G5G4G|5|Quality part worked perfect for my custom intake setup,and fast shipping!
B0002SQVNA|5|works well lubricates fantastic for clay barring
B00BITI7KM|3|Clip was put in wrong and broke when took it out!
B0090Q2TGI|5|This shade ROCKS! Take your time putting it in, although it's easy, make sure it clears your rear view completely.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Good
B007QBT43U|5|All good!
B00MRFW4GO|5|I must say that this is perfect. I'm a huge doctor who fan and needed something on my car to make it a littler more &#34;me&#34;, so I bought this. It is super easy to put on and looks stunning. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something Doctor Who themes for their car.
B005VV0ME2|5|It fit perfectly and the price was reasonable.
B001PYGA2W|5|Worked great, but it sucks to get it onto the piston.
B001PYO8LC|5|Bought two for both rear drum brakes on my 2001 ford ranger 3.0 edge. Work great! went in smoothly and are working like a charm. Considering the mechanic gave me an over 300$ quoted to replace these and two cost about 25$ I think im a fairly happy camper lol Dont forget to bleed the air out after you install them!
B005MJYUAA|2|Product fits great and feels good and tight on my dislocating shoulder issues. I used to when I ride dirt bikes in the mountains. I just used it again for the 3 or 4th time and the backing started to come off. The material that the straps Velcro to is coming off the padding. I doesn't look like it can be fixed either with is a big bummer as i really need this and spent the extra money on what i thought was going to be a  good brace... If they would try to make things right i would be satisfied with this product.but unfortunately not..
B000JFL83Y|5|Helped me pull a stuck transmission rear seal.  Love it!
B001MYWBF0|3|It appears to do it's job most of the time.  Though seldom brings a battery to full charge
B006D9VZ60|4|Works great stopped my wobble
B00PMFPNSW|3|Love the rugs and the steering wheel cover is nice but TOO small to fit my Jeep Liberty 2005
B000VT44HK|3|looks good low profile I like a little taller ones and you will have to use other means of putting it on the sticky tape is no good an the screws thingy to attach is no good but I guess when you buy cheaper that's what happens
B00ZU96XRU|4|Fit great on my 2007 CRF 250X.  Sturdy and i like how the bar drops right from the handle, makes it easy to take hands off and on the handlebar.
B00CDAFT6K|2|I bought these to shield the sun from my son in the car, but they don't work all that well. The sun gets through with no problem.
B00KRHX4A4|5|Great fit. I just needed the new rubber button pad as my original pad/buttons had worn down & torn. This fit perfect. An exact match for my original buttons. I simply bought both pieces being sold as price was as cheap for both as it was for just the pad (and I now have a backup key blank for my car if ever needed, all for same price).
B00H4J3SKE|1|Part did not fit my DR50 as it was advertised to be an exact fit.
B00EYTBTM6|5|Everything was as advertised :)
B00CHT4RR4|5|Great jacket, not too hot. I replaced the worthless back pad with a proper armored one though.
B005QTEQK0|5|Well made, love it
B005G5SR0Y|5|Item just like described.
B000E9Z49Y|5|This is shockingly great stuff for cleaning glass. I even use it on my sunglasses. Just make sure that you apply it how the bottle says.
B00TJEZRH4|5|Did the job on a 2004 sprinter van.
B00GC2FCIU|5|Good quality and speedy service.
B0070Y36N2|3|A bit uneven (both exactly the same, I think it's their mold).  But they do look great and are good quality otherwise.  They are legit carbon fiber.
B00GOO48EK|5|Was an exact match to the factory glass and very easy to install just make sure you have the surfaces clean before using the adhesive tape
B004NDPSH0|5|Its perfict. It has everything I need.
B004H9RK76|5|Love it, it is a great piece at a good price.
B00AQKC7LO|5|Very bright, very clear light.  worked great in my teardrop camper
B00IBK86Y8|3|These Tuff Support hatch struts fit my 1984 Subaru perfectly. Once installed, two days of opening/closing &#34;exercises&#34; were required before the struts &#34;settled in&#34;.<br /><br />My only complaint is that these struts open the hatch of my '84 Subaru very slowly, and don't like to be rushed. So I basically release the hatch, lift it 8 inches, step back and wait. The impatient among you will just have to get used to this. It sure beats getting hit in the chin.
B00G93DA6I|5|Very nice product. Good fit for a 2015 RZR 900 trail.  Like the ability to remove the top half on a warm day.
B00L2LTP7K|5|Works great on the back of golf cart.  Perfect color
B005LJGSSS|5|Excellent quality. These fit perfectly on my CRF 230. Easy to install. Super strong steel-bar. Well designed plastic outer. &#34;Match&#34; Honda-Red nicely.
B00PCRSAEO|1|This is not the correct back rest that fits the backrest shown in the photo.  The screw holes don't line up with anything on the GTS
B000GVC2WC|5|very nice product
B00J62VV4W|4|I installed this hitch on my wife's new 2015 Wrangler Unlimited.  I had some minor trouble pushing the bolts through due to the heat shield above the muffler, but got them through.  The nuts were a different story.  There was barely enough room to try and put them on and I was having some trouble.  I ended up loosening the rear bumper (which was easy) which gave me enough room to get the bolts on.  Overall it took about 30 min.  The quality is good and the price was the cheapest around for a hitch.  But next time I'd spend an extra $12 and go with a Smittybilt or Quadratec; the nuts are welded to the hitch making installation much easier.
B00E7BHQGE|5|was perfect. exact fit. thanks
B00H38TTEU|1|Wow what a way to do bussiness a jump from 5.95 to 10.95 one day to next wow
B007L2JNT4|4|Looks like the truck could of come with these mirrors
B004JNJPHI|5|Replaced the broken one perfectly. There is a YouTube video showing how it's done.
B0082OYG3I|5|Super quality!
B0024E5UVO|5|Trimmed to fit.  Better than my old broken dark one.
B007JMTQTS|5|Seems to be very sturdy and well built. great price too.
B000HBGJG6|1|Not worth the money. Leaves white residue which just sticks and won't go away
B00VL9LNVO|4|Some lights did not work poor quality wires
B008HZMI96|5|Perfect replacement.
B00P7VVFF6|4|This is a well made, pretty sturdy net that is as pictured.  It's advertised for use with a Jeep Wrangler and with the back seat out, it will clip to the floor anchors, pretty much as shown. However it's footprint is quite small. The taped side doesn't really stretch and the non-taped side only has minimal stretch.  So, it's limited in what you can do with it.  If you have a small pile of stuff that lies close to the floor in the center of the back, it should hold it down well (like the photo). If you're hoping to contain a larger pile / full cargo area so things won't blow away when the top is down or off, this isn't the right net. Consequently, I ended up returning it and getting something larger. I can't really ding them for that since they provided several photos and as noted, it is well made for what it is.  If it fits your use case, it seems like a good product.
B002DZ2X14|5|fits perfect
B003YLH92Y|5|went right into my 1995 F250 and have ac in this horrible triple digit weather in Arizona!
B000CITKCE|5|This was easy to attach to the battery.  We bought the Junior and this one and I think this one is a bit heavier duty case.<br />We like it
B0085FOVR0|4|It was an easy install everything as promised. Looks just like the picture.
B006RKTG0C|3|Led are ok for night but during the day seems not as bright as Expected And the brackets  don't go anywhere on my car that is functional without me have to buy more parts to install .<br />Trying to use this in a jetta vw dash lights lower .<br />The function x ok strobe seems out sync compare some other Leo lights I guess for $25 it's going to have flaws compare to expensive set made to install quick and easy .
B008C3FING|5|Good things to have around the shop. Use all the time for oil drain plug seals. No leaks.
B001GC2LVM|4|a
B00FEZEVQK|5|Super bright and durable .....just installed these in my 2yo's power wheels mustang. Looks wild
B005SEKFBM|5|This Royal Purple HPS motor oil has extra zinc and phosphorous which helps to prevent failures in high performance engines. So far so good
B005CB7OJC|5|good stuff
B00KB8BREO|3|It works good and is worth the $10 that it cost, but the way that the attachments hook up to it is not ideal.

B001DRHMPK|5|when i took this out (after the 6k oil change) i looked better than others ive used before, i tried to tare it apart but i wouldnt rip in half (most do after use) so ill totally use this from here on out.
B00X5S10FS|2|The headlights worked for about 10 minutes before one of them started to flicker. It was a terrible flicker; as if the light went out and came back on multiple times. I thought it was a cooling problem, but the LED, heatsinks, and ballast was only warm and cooler than the headlight that worked. However, there wasn't a CANBUS error, and the headlights lit up the road fairly well in my projector headlights.Therefore, I'll give it 2/5 stars since headlight bulbs are a big safety issue, its not something you can afford to go out randomly.
B006H33ZEC|5|Nice and bright
B006VOSH5O|5|Exactly what I was looking for on my 2009 wrangler JK.  SOUNDS AWESOME.  Low rumble , louder under acceleration and mellow on highway. Looks great ,  put some black tips on to finish it off.
B00192JFYA|5|Classy and Unbreakable - But will scratch up in time<br /><br />I needed something for the expensive beach house rentals that the guests wouldn't break by the dozen.  They are classy enough for an expensive rental, and would take a lot more than Innocent inebriation to break, and even than, no glass shards.<br /><br />Highly recommended for high risk use or where glass shards are extremely dangerous, like swimming pools or boats.  I expect them to scratch up over time, and be retired for aesthetic reasons.  But they seem perfect for safe rough use.
B000WWSZSU|5|Great replacement part for an aging car. They popped right on and have stayed put for over 6 months of hard bumpy driving. They look just like the original
B00B1W7LS0|2|Great wheel cover, very soft, but leather/pleather melts very quickly in Sun and peels off wheel cover :( very disappointed
B00D9D6JU0|1|Lights didn't work, so emailed company they were great and sent us a new set. The new also did not work.....
B00RMCQTV8|5|These LED bulbs are much brighter than I expected them to be. I was worried they wouldn't be bright enough and I'd end up taking it back out and keeping my original bulbs, but I ended up changing out all of the original bulbs for these instead. The light is a brighter clean light than what I had in there. Very happy with these.<br />Sample provided in exchange for an honest review.
B007J5G63O|5|Super good.
B008RVJKD2|1|I wanted these black microfiber cloths for the kitchen. I have used other microfiber cloths in the kitchen and been very pleased with them. This includes Scotch Brite microfiber kitchen cloths, which are great, but do not come in black.  I want a black kitchen cloth so that stains won't show. But I'm still looking.<br />These GarageMate black cloths did not work well in the kitchen. They don't absorb a lot of water, but continue to release the water as you wipe your counter. These left my counters and table very wet.<br />I tried them for other household cleaning, but found the same problem. Perhaps they are good for a garage when you want to wipe up grease, but not for water.
B000CNN26E|5|Shipping was fast. Love shopping with Amazon.<br /><br />Installed by Marco Muffler here in Sacramento CA. Had it welded on my 2013 Ram 1500.  Aaaaamaaazing sound. Not over bearing and has enough rumble and growl. Interior sound is minimal. No drone. So very pleased with the way my truck sounds now.
B000A835AY|3|Seemed kinda dry when opened. Will not buy again.
B00L7XFUSQ|5|Took some tweaking the spacers but looks nice
B00GSAUHB8|5|Everthing I wanted and more.
B00DQRSK9C|5|Exactly as advertised. So far is working great.
B00NOL6RSG|5|Best deal I could have ever got. The strobes cost only $20 and they are extremely flashy. The lights also change patterns without any issues and everything is still working. I am using it for the past 2 months and I think it would last very long.
B000WP7MJA|5|every thing they said it would be
B00EX4RI68|1|Wouldn't consider it a decal you put on your bike consider it something you put on your note book
B001GG2EWE|5|Cute and lasts
B000YE584U|5|Appears to be as good as the original. Needs to be road tested for a while to see if it lasts.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Good quality wire and it seems to be assembled well and was cut to a good length. A very simple, straight forward hardness with a built in fuse. I used it with a set of LED lights but it would work great with any accessory lights. The only drawback that I've found it that the two little LED lights that are on the switch are VERY bright. If you're planning on using this on your car or truck I would dab some paint on the red ‘off’ light and the green ‘on’ light. Otherwise, these lights are very distracting.
B00KRIJ3M6|5|This is a genuine Lexus part and it is coming from a Lexus dealer. fits my 2015 RX350. Recommended seller.
B002Q7SGHO|5|I put these on our 2010 Chrysler Town & Country van. I pull a small trailer and the car would sit very low. These Monroe's raised it and makes it ride better also.
B0051TPJKG|5|I tried it on my grill, there was a huge flame burning from all the dripping oil, it put out the fire in a split second, a must in every house !!!
B0010B00IA|4|:)
B00GD8PC2E|4|Works great.  My wife's car has an issue with the wiper blades lifting from the windshield when traveling at 50+ MPH.  The construction of these, with the additional &#34;wing&#34; on it, seems to have resolved this, according to her.
B000EVYGZA|4|takes a second for the reading to come up but overall for the price its a great product.
B00T44D1R2|5|Not used will update.
B00XWBT9Z6|1|it leaks and it was ripped from the inseam.
B008X0UQTY|1|The 2 suction cups aren't strong enough to hold it to the window.
B005909KWA|5|Great!!!!! Fast shipping!!!
B00B2VC8LK|5|Excellent
B00C565SF4|5|Bought this prior to Smog!!! Passed! Straight bolt on for 95 Honda Del Sol. Original CAT finally gave in... It's now a test pipe!
B000YCCP1Q|4|Fit & Finish: After one new windshield and three chip repairs I had to do something. As others have stated it is very sturdy and high quality. I installed it on my 2013 Wrangler in just a few minutes after sizing up the job. It looks and fits like OEM and is a nice addition to your build. As another reviewer suggested it fits very naturally just behind the edge of the hood and the two adhesive strips are more than enough to secure it in place (I passed on drilling holes in my hood, but in my opinion they are not necessary).<br /><br />Just line-up the center of the shield with the center of the hood latch and you will feel it settle into a natural position (test fit it a few times). Peel back a few cm of the red backing on both ends of the two adhesive strips and fold them at a right angle. Carefully press the shield against the hood and if the alignment looks right, peel away the red backing on each strip. When you close the hood, the weather strip above the grill makes a nice firm seal against the shield.<br /><br />Road Test: A few days after I installed it I made a 500-mile trip. At speeds of 75 mph the shield is rock solid and does not move at all (you won't need the small clear rubber bumpers that are included). I didn't notice any excess or bothersome buffeting at highway speeds (at least no more than without it).<br /><br />Rocks & Bugs (does it work): Hard to say with certainty that it completely prevents rock chips, but over three days I did take two from vehicles in front of me, and both times I heard the familiar &#34;tick&#34; against the windshield, but no damage and it seemed like the projectiles had no significant velocity. I like to think the shield created a good airstream across that windshield that slowed the rocks down enough to prevent damage. It wasn't too buggy so I really can't comment on that.<br /><br />On balance I'm glad I purchased and Installed it. I can't say I love it at this point, but I can say I like it.
B00CX2YNO2|1|Decent machine work, but the rubber grip pieces come off with ease. To much money for what it is.
B01092IEEM|5|Love the backseat zippers to get access to center armrest. Installation was fairly easy with included clips for the elastic bands and straps to secure seat bottoms. Installation took less than an hour, just don't do it it the hot sun.
B0002TDUW4|5|Looks good on the lower panels of my wheeler.  Keeping the rock chips to a minimal.
B002ES52X6|1|so small that stretching tore it apart.  I have a ford/mazda remote same as on picture.
B008HZH18Y|5|Boat windows are clean
B000FQ7GCE|5|Not bad
B00063003I|5|very good
B000CLMBPY|5|Best quality brake pads I have ever bought!
B00JAO0TKI|5|Oh wow this is soo serious very very bright I'm soo happy with it the pls don't use on road you might blind someone I love it if tried some cheap brands I will make a side by side vid on YouTube and post the link tnx
B00II7TROM|5|Looks good.came with flat gasket but my stock one had an o ring so I reused the stock one and held onto the flat one just in case.
B00HHS4SF6|5|Solid piece and better quality than I expected. The logo/crest seems like it will hold up nicely.
B000AL8VD2|4|Using a little Permatex Dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture.
B00T47K604|1|This product doesn't work in a Nissan Titan. Although, the company was friendly in returning and setting the problem straight.
B00MGTS1WW|5|I purchased this for my recent coast to coast move along with the CURT 18153 basket style cargo carrier and I am very pleased. I drove through extreme heat and rain during my 6-day road trip with a full cargo bag with no moisture issues inside the bag. The bag contains two zippers which allow you to place a lock through both (purchased separately) to keep your items safe as a slight deterrent to theft. It was larger than I pictured and is highly recommended if you're in the market for a cargo bag.
B00RV83UUG|5|Excellent product
B00FBKWG60|1|After only a month the hid quit working
B004A2GOK4|5|Perfect fit
B000X90YUO|5|This compressor is Really Well Built. This will outlast 90 % of it's price range competitors, the &#34;all in ones&#34; (compressor, battery charger, yada yada are just like an &#34;all in one printer&#34; - garbage. This does one thing, and does it really well, (not crazy fast, but I would easily depend on this if I took my vehicle on some off roading adventures, bumping tire pressure up and down for crawling rocks and then back on hardpack). Beautiful all metal construction. It works very well, I buy a lot of tools on Amazon, and this has been my favorite purchase of the year so far! (Guess I should buy some higher quality tires and then I wouldn't need it so often...) (I do wish they sold or advised a good (small) AC/DC converter so I could take this into the house and pump up floaty toys and sleep-over mattresses.) This guy is a bit more pricey than most in it's range, and it's because it does not suck. - Rad. (I have trouble giving a &#34;5 Star&#34; rating because I would never read this, I only read 3 star reviews, but this is a quality product in a sea of mediocrity.
B002BA98LO|5|Excellent quality and value!
B000MS5T42|5|Worked out great for .
B00LFZY8XY|5|Excellent! even it was use fits perfect to my car
B00DDYBT6O|1|Product does not fit tried to contact seller and never replied this is bull s***.
B00881EQ1C|2|This FlexyFrame is just not stiff enough, if you have room on your bumper where you will mount this to lay it fairly flat and install all four screws, it should be all right.  I installed mine on a PT Cruiser and I can only install the top two screws into the bumper, not really as secure as I would like.  I also couldn't get the bottom two &#34;studs&#34; to really hold onto the bottom of the license plate and ended up cutting them off, putting holes in the FlexyFrame and running 1/4&#34; bolts through them.  I think I will find another older license plate and install it on the backside of my current plate, and hopefully that will stiffen it up.  If the FlexyFrame had been stiffer or had an internal metal frame, I think this would be a great product.
B004Y4U6TS|5|it was the right one a little pricey though
B001EAQY8M|5|Great product wish i would've bought 2
B008RIKN7W|4|Works fantastic for my 3d printer, make sure you keep it well greased to prevent bearing damage.
B00S42ZUSI|5|These shades really do the trick and fit perfectly in my 2015 Outback with Eyesight.
B00B1J7Z6G|5|I love it!!!!
B003UVCY00|5|Awesome little light.  Very compact, yet puts out a good amount of light.  I bought it to use on my boat, but I move it to my truck when I'm not using it on my boat.  Having both AC and DC chargers is another great feature.  My biggest problem is keeping my son from playing with it and running the battery down.  Great product so far!
B00YBZWKRQ|2|I guess you get what you pay for. The terminals and button switch fell apart during installation. Had to buy a new switch from the auto parts store and crimp on new wire terminals. Other than that, it works so far with the Nilight 2x18x Cree LED lights I bought. If I had to do it over again I'd just wire it myself instead of buying a harness like this.
B00BITKD2W|5|Easy to install works fine!
B00CG5RYEW|2|I ordered a pink one it was 5 inch then ordered a white one for my hubby. I was way smaller than mine. It was suposed to be the same size.
B00HUFJW0C|4|Strait piece of pipe with a flange on one end.<br />Fit and works great.

B001TI1F5Q|5|my trim is black again!
B00AM24Y08|5|good price
B000GTYN8K|4|looks good.  I had to add a hole on the end because I have a rack behind my sissybar, makes for a very clean line and protects the fender.
B00546KUDM|5|good
B009XIQM9S|5|love it
B0020C9OF8|5|I really like this for driving with my daughter while she is learning!  Anyone behind us cannot miss seeing it, and this makes them aware that we are a little slow because we are still &#34;learning&#34;.
B0083G3AXC|4|It works
B00J321CAI|5|Amazing stuff.
B0038ZYIIO|5|Perfect
B0031R9FGY|2|Not very yellow at all compared to my other set of yellow off road lights that I currently have on that vehicle. These are the lights mounted below the head lights.
B0013FXWUG|3|Easy install.  Sound is OK for the price.
B0045F4NZO|4|fit me fine
B004LWTHP2|1|Seems to work fine, but generates a great deal of HF noise.  If you use a shortwave receiver, beware (didn't notice any interference with TV or wireless)!
B010AMXTHI|1|garbage dont buy they will rip you off and never return emails or calls..
B000OR18BE|5|Works great
B00VXFKGE6|5|This meets my needs.  Mainly use it to water some flowers.  Works well. Can lock it in soaking position and leave under a larger shrub for a a longer period of time.
B0056JC02Q|5|Easy to put on! A bit smaller than expected, but still great!
B00QUL6U8Y|5|It works well and it was easy to set up.  The CD that had the software was damaged during shipment, but the vendor provided me with a link to download the software directly myself, so it wasn't an issue.
B002IV6U12|4|Fits and works.
B0016HTBWY|5|Exactly what was needed and wanted.
B007SS31LM|5|I am planning to do the upper end on my 103 this fall/winter when the weather forces me to stop riding. But I have checked clearances and am very satisfied with the fit and finish of this big bore kit.
B001CJYBGW|5|perfect for our canoe
B00CH0MO5U|4|Was statifactory
B00HLAGQCI|5|Works on my Wifes 04 CRV the old one kept binding up and wouldn't let the door lock.
B00RVAXIRE|4|easy installation
B001JSYC74|5|Love these. Had 1 when I drove a semi. Now use them in the Suburban.
B000C55T7W|4|They did the job.
B001CF3IP6|5|Great product and fits awesome
B00KWDJ6A0|5|Worked as expected. No more code. Thanks
B00LMJDBGS|5|these logos are awesome! they are just a little smaller than my OEM badges on my 370Z, but it isn't noticeable at all. Mic Tuning is a great seller with quick shipping. A++++
B0081S8S9I|5|It's physically larger than the original regulator, but bolts on just fine to the side of my John Deere 140 h3. Great value.
B004CMMFK0|4|Smells great! Doesn't last long tho
B00BMU919I|3|product fine didn't fit the Kia they were ordered for!
B002PUROAM|5|Delivered as promised, excellent .., all as promised, .price. quality and deliver.
B000BGM7QS|5|Worked Well<br />No Leaks
B007XZK61S|1|Had it on for les than an hour b4 it flew off and broke into 3 pieces
B00EHIPZ8S|5|Great product that was easy to install. Shipped in timely manner with good customer service
B003BZX0SK|5|It is a solidly made piece, I have a road demon jr, It would not clear the choke horn and linkage so I had to grind reliefs into it.
B00MO0BVBG|5|As advertised and fit and finish was better than others I have seen
B003UHNMMS|5|it works great
B005LEOGZU|4|Looks great. Had to use a relay for my application to make it work.
B00WSJ6Q04|5|This switch functions very smoothly. There aren't instructions included saying which color wire is which, but when the wire connector is removed, the switch itself has NC, NO, C, +, and - markers which will be visible. (+ and - for the LED).
B000ALG86E|5|Living in California without a garage, I am now able to conserve water that would be wasted on washing my car every 2 to 3 weeks. Since I received this product six weeks ago I have not needed to wash my car.
B008KZKAMK|5|So simple and easy to install.  It took less than 60 seconds to install.  The dealer sold me one that took an hour to get installed and would have been impossible to quickly removed.  This is exactly what is stated.  It fits my 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Turbo and the quality is excellent.  Can't wait to use it.  It will be so nice to have things not moving when the car is being driven.
B00JH12G6E|5|I've ordered from Jet Glow before. Their products are well-made, and look great. I'll order from them again, and highly recommend them. In the photo, you'll notice a blue reflection on the letters. There's nothing wrong with the emblem. The chrome is great. The blue reflection is from the case on my phone. Just so you don't think there's something wrong with the emblem.
B00RZTREIU|5|I am bad at pulling my lexus into the garage. I have hit the side mirror a few times and shattered the mirror. This is a great product and stays on well.
B00ES5Q610|1|This wiper is too long for my 2013 Toyota RAV 4 Limited AWD. I purchased it because the guide at the top of the ordering page confirmed that it would fit. Do not buy this for a RAV 4
B006JZ94NY|5|As others have stated, this fits a Dodge Ram. I installed it on my 2012 Ram 1500 R/T. I also have a universal model installed on a Chevy truck. It works great and looks good, too! It keeps oil from getting sucked through the PCV system into the intake manifold which can accumulate on valves causing poor performance, also when oil gets in the manifold and mixes with fuel, the computer will see it as a lower octane of gas being combusted and will retard timing resulting in lost performance as well. As with all Moroso products, fit and function are second to none. They use only the highest quality materials and take pride in their long history of racing.
B00A1D9GKG|5|Thin enough to see the name of the state as required by law in some states.<br />Clear enough to read.<br />Great quality for the price.
B001NZZ9IE|5|Had everything I needed except for a new spring for the fuel diagram and also didn't come with a new cap for the fuel diagram i had to buy a different kit no biggie though but other then that it toke about a 4 hrs because I made sure everything was super clean and painted the tbi cherry red ;)
B000CFAVAW|5|Great, works perfect
B00HWIB0FM|5|All I got to say that it's loud so I would recommend this product
B0024917G6|5|Can wait to install super light and shinny
B00U5WL0V6|1|improper fit
B0101M9X0O|5|Perfect!
B007SCO2VQ|3|Front Mats: wonderful!  Rear mats: awful.  Weathertech was kind enough to send me some Velcro strips to keep them in place after I called to complain.  they don't really work.  Get the fronts- forget the rears.
B00V30J86I|3|I have NO idea how you are supposed to string this between your seats. I was hoping I could use it to push my purse back on the arm rest, but really all it does is act as a sling shot. One quick stop and your purse is slung to the floor with all contents too.<br />I didn't bother returning, because... well, I'm lazy. It does act as a fence to keep my dogs in the back see tho. I had to use hooks to get it to stay between the two front seats (grocery bag hooks). There is a useless pocket made into the center too. Yeah, i have no idea what it's for. It's sort of too snug to put anything useful in besides, maybe a charger? Don't bother with the fast food bag (which I saw in a picture). It will smoosh your fries.
B000BUQOFO|4|Seems sturdy. Haven't used yet just mad it went on sale right after I bought it, could have saved $3. It's only one so I'll have to buy a second one at the lower price.
B00GHT98Y2|5|Fit right.
B009OBW23O|4|This wax works ok on the lighter color cars.  I dont know why it feels so gritty when you apply the wax
B007P73W5Q|5|GOOD
B00B8K99N0|5|have not installed yet but seems to be of good quality.shipping was fast
B000KYPHRM|5|They came sooner then expected, fit good and look great. Very pleased
B00GSAUHB8|5|Bought two. One for our RV and one for my new car. They are great. Easy to use.
B00JH23PBI|5|battery came on time, perfect fit for R1 with good power, so far so good!!!
B0045GCUKS|5|They look good
B00BMU9G5W|1|Will not fit 2003 Hyundai sonata with 15&#34; wheels
B00MKLPZL6|5|Both my buddy and I put these on our 14' jonboats. Hilarious.
B00KTNAP5I|5|Keeps the car very cool
B0013FT25A|5|Perfect replacement at much lower cost for an Oem part
B00XV506SM|5|Good fi
B002MAUR0E|5|This looks amazing on my car.  Dark tinted windows make it look even better.  Putting it on was very easy and no bubbles.  Gone through the car wash four times already, rained on, high summer temps and this still looks good.
B004PQDNZ4|5|I bought 2 of them I like the way they look on my car
B000BUOSC0|1|Bought last month at RV dealer.  After having a month of travel experience, with this hose, here is my opinion.  Hose is very stiff even on 90 degree days, which makes it very hard to roll up.  Hose fittings are very cheap, I don't expect them to last long.  Hose will expand under normal pressure, becomes very large, I'm waiting for mine to burst.  I do have a hose I have been using since 2003, it is pliable, does not expand under pressure and takes up less room in storage compartment.  It's manufactured by Apex and will cost you about twice what this hose costs.  If I need another hose I will only purchase Apex.  I do not work for nor am I affiliated with Apex in any form, just leaving you my personal opinion.  Thanks for reading.
B00BCRMBSO|4|I like this, but ill have to admit, the material is very thin. When I opened, it had a odor, and i cant put on my car until i air this out. Very much like chemicals. the tops came sewn onto the seat pieces, i am assuming this was just for shipping, but i have to cut it off. I dont think I will be using them anyway since they are a bit small. I am putting this on my Saturn VUE. Its a very nice neutral color, and the steering wheel cover will be used,since it seems to definitely be sturdy enough.
B00UIP4EXG|5|Beautiful decal.
B00IKN33ZI|5|I bought this because the headrest in my Mustang pushed my head too far forward, causing my whole upper body to curl forward and making long drives very tiring. It works perfectly for that, and it is also quite comfortable for my back. I was concerned that it would be too hot here in Florida in the summer but the material is quite breathable. Recommended!
B000BUQOEU|4|Bought a new awning  it is shorter than expected so straps on this product are 2 short
B00S0MRGBQ|5|Im Happy
B000C55MWE|5|Did the job, good price.<br />Still holding solid
B006YC99VE|5|very good
B00RSOLXFM|5|I sent this as a gift - my sister has struggled with bad lungs from birth - and she will make good use of this when the air is bad for any reason
B003HJLWM6|2|Ordered the T-Rex X-Metal grille for my 2014 Ram 1500.  Was happy to receive it promptly, only issues on original inspection were that several posts on the back side of the grill were bent either during picking or packing, no worries, I bent them back in place.  I have done a lot of research and owned several similar grilles from other manufacturers including top of the line Royalty Core.  I decided to go with a mid-range T-Rex for $750, in this case you DO NOT get what you pay for.  This grille is no better quality than a $250 e-bay grille.  I was amazed at the fact that the grille is flimsy and the chrome &#34;lugs&#34; that encompass the frame are PLASTIC, and can be popped out by hand from behind.  I am glad I did not spend the cash on the T-Rex Torch grilles that cost much more.  Oh well, I did not return the grille because popped out all the plastic &#34;chrome lugs&#34; and already replaced them with stainless lugs after drilling them out to 5/16&#34;.  Grille will be re-enforced from behind so a led light can be mounted without bending the grille screen.  Lesson: Ask questions first, don't assume that because it comes from a well known company that the product will actually be quality.  PRO: Removal of the T-Rex emblem is extremely easy.
B0014DDK5O|5|works great.. did exactly what i needed
B00P2UIVAO|5|super nice...
B00WITMN06|2|It is quite thin and flimsy, though it does keep the bike dry.  The cording/strap broke on first use.
B00480J4UK|5|Nice bright, white light.  Not annoying blue.  Increased visibility greatly.
B00GO4R4O6|4|matches my bike well.  very happy with them
B003BKUAVU|5|Purchased for my 2015 F150. Product is great, but please note that wiring to the trailer connections disables the auto start/stop function of the ford eco boost engine. There is an auto detect feature that assumes a trailer is connected since the LED draws voltage. I'm going to try and wire them direct to the taillights and see if that works. Otherwise, love the lights.  Update: removed the taillights and wired directly to those leads. Everything works like a champ now with no issues our impacts.
B0050EFZGK|5|It was the same motor that came with the steps.  The only difference was the receptacle.  The only thing I had to do was get a matching receptacle.  The motor went in without any problems and works great.
B00KHX6WMU|1|Reviewing this to remove it from my list.  It keeps re-appearing.  Had problems with this item and don't wany it in my list of items to be reviewed.
B00PQ63HIA|3|I got this carburetor for my honda 250sx three wheeler. The description sais it fits the bike and claimed to be an easy install with little to no motification.<br />I have had to motify dozens of carbs i had bought for different bikes and have been fairly succesful.<br />But this carb is by far the most fustrating i have ever dealt with.<br />Its probably a perfect fit and set up for newer fourwheelers and such. But if you need for and older threewheeler 250cc model be prepared for major motification.
B00CPE694U|1|Purchased 9 months ago. Unit only lasted 5 months. By month 5 the speaker stopped working, month 6 the unit fried it's self and won't turn on anymore. Installed professionally, but unit is bad, don't purchase this one. Also no way to contact the company.
B006B28A94|3|great quality, but they don't pay me to use it.
B0058J4T78|5|The upgrade was very nice you can see the before and after pictures you can see the big difference
B001KQF6PC|5|Perfect replacement, working great
B007IWE8QU|4|Great cover for a great price. Does the job!
B002LFAQFG|1|I was under the impression that Borla was stamped or etched on the tip but there is nothing just looks like a cheap tip from the auto parts store. This is the only item that u have ever got from Amazon that i was not pleased with
B00EKTJSIW|4|Fit was good on my 2013 tundra extra cab. Cleaned mounting surface with isopropyl alcohol(no risk to paint) and pressed in place for 45 secs. Looks sharp on my grey truck.  No instructions in package so follow mine😉
B000HD6G7G|4|The press in the picture has a two tube guides, but the actual one does not have these guides. Instead, it uses the bottom plate which rides inside the frame as the guide. However, there is a big gap which causes a lot of side to side movement. I guess a wood shim could be used to fill the gap and keep it straight. You get what you pay for. Great for DIY.
B0090Q89VC|1|Work for 2hr after broke have to pay 40$ for shipping and pay for all nee seal and gasket
B001KS86V6|4|The mirror is pretty good. Something seems off just a little but it works.
B0013935FY|5|help to save the paint. easy install
B00XQP9OTE|5|Alsom really good product,powerful upgrade. Big difference. I recommend it for upgrading.
B000C55YY0|5|Quality built made in America piece.
B00WVJPXU0|5|Light's up the Road like you could never even imagine. Road Signs glow from quarter mile away so if your having trouble reading road signs at night<br />This is the Light for you.
B00QHYZ7WO|5|Great product
B000KITSMI|4|The Schrader valve clips in the end. Wish it was magnetic like the yellow jacket valve tool. Works well.
B00HFLH5LE|5|Another quality part and buying experience! Thanks!
B004J9C8M6|5|ok
B00ZGBLXX6|5|Clean and simple, looks sharp.
B0036GKVCC|4|Arrived quickly, good quality components. Using on my 15 Street Bob. A little bit of a challenge to get on and aligned properly, it does provide some flexibility. The screen blocks the wind off of the chest up to my chin and leaves my helmet in clean air.
B009SWAR72|4|The keychain and valve stem caps look great and all four threaded on properly, now it's ime to see how they hold up.
B004RLVZFC|5|I bought my last 3 bug shields from AVS, great instructions and the product is awesome. Bugflector II is the only deflector I buy.
B00466AJ6Y|5|Seems to work fine. Matierial is sturdy and seems like a good quality. I'm using it for a Halloween costume. I guess if your a hardcore biker you could use this as a tough guy helmet as well...
B00RYM1HF4|5|Good size, great adhesive. very visible
B0002NYBEG|5|We use this in our business and we expect it to last a many years.
B0067UG5L0|5|Seems as tough as OEM, for a fraction of the price.
B002G47GE6|5|Except for a discreet Bosch part number printed on the blade, these are identical to the blades supplied thru your VW dealer with a VW part number.
B00EHIO5QG|4|I LOVE THAT LIGHTS NICE AND BRIGHT
B00J491S40|5|I bought these for my 2012 kawasaki ninja 650 and they look a lot better than expected. Went great with theme I got going. Red/black
B00K7U05SK|5|Love these! They look great and I get lots of comments on them :)
B007RP3TAO|1|Quality control issues.  Send the first one back
B00029JKAK|2|a pain the you  know what to use...buy the pliers.
B000KKLLFS|5|These must be good because they get stolen off my car every other week.
B00EDZD9N8|5|love it
B00NNFT09G|5|Fit my accord perfect. Looks like originals!
B000GVA576|5|Looks great
B006OPJSCG|5|BMW oem!!!!! Need I say more.
B00QTCX23U|2|I needed specific items and they were not in this package deal
B000JZZ8EO|5|It is what it says it is.
B00RV46YBC|3|Not really sure how to rate these.  I needed a daytime running light with a 3157 base.  These should switch between white during the day, and then give me the amber-off upon turn signal use.  Unfortunately I only have bright (really bright) amber lights.... all the time.  I don't think there is a problem with the bulb, but rather with the configuration of wiring for my headlight assembly but I could be wrong.<br />They don't switch off with the blinker which I attribute to the wiring, I'm no expert so I am not sure how the chipset would determine if the voltage is switching for  the blinker.  I thought about running a jumper wire from the blinker bulb, but I don't  feel like experimenting with the wiring right now.<br />If anyone at JDM (or elsewhere) has a solution, I'd be happy to hear you out.<br /><br />2007 Chevy Avalanche with Spyder® PRO-YD-CSUB07-CCFL-BK - Black CCFL Halo Projector Headlights with LEDs
B00O83OF38|4|It looks great on my gray f150 but the 3rd break light plug in was too big to be plugged in like it was supposed to. All I had to do though was cut the wires on my truck and on the light and wire them straight together. Other than that I had no problems.
B00BZQQTPS|5|Just as described<br />Awesome
B00DLMJ906|5|fits just right
B000ICNR78|4|Fantastic! I'm a total boss at work now and it's perfect for holding all of my notary items.
B001P6GONU|5|very nice
B0023VOVRW|5|As advertised.  Works great.  Received on time.
B00ELHTAFY|5|Came as expected and good price.
B00G49DURG|3|Did not last as long as I hoped but still a good product.  Would probably go with the spray rather than the pre saturated sponges next time.
B000VKTUG4|5|Fixed my a/c problem
B00F0YCK0E|5|works as described, compact and easy adjustments
B000CL7KMI|5|This is a direct replacement fan motor for my 1977 Datsun 280Z.  It puts out more air that my old one and the $50 price is hard to beat.  Comes with a factory plug for the electrical, so you don't have to cut any wires.
B000GZN9IO|5|Fits my bike perfect
B000WJX29U|5|Easy to use - about as simple as it can get!  My motorcycle starts right away EVERY time. Just hoping it lasts longer than two years (like all my old ones).  I heard these batteries should last 3-5 years!
B00IPS3MBI|4|These wipers are great. It gets all the water off.
B00L3FNG34|5|Nice item for a good price
B00HEGMDGC|5|Replaced these on a 1995 ford ranger. They were nice because the length of wire was longer then I expected and the gauge was also much thicker then the factory stuff, seemed very heavy duty and sturdy compared to the OEM ones.
B010FP1206|5|Perfect fit
B00480FHIS|4|Bulb has met my expectations for replacement of OEM on Genesis.  Gasket is slightly thicker than the OEM, but a little extra force will lock it into place.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|we loved it! we have two bikes and it holds them together pretty good. sturdy as well, though it does weight a bit. we're still trying to figure out how/where to place it on the bike so that we don't have to carry it in our backpack.
B00HEB2XEO|5|Very easy to install, better than original part.
B00PLIXPXU|5|Nice addition to my 14 silverado
B0002M9QRE|5|These are awesome! I've noticed a massive improvement in nighttime visibility over the Sylvania SilverStar sealed beams I had in my Jeep before (which were themselves a marginal improvement over base halogens). These Hella units are not only a fantastic German design, but they're made in Germany (not China!!!), and they're 100% DOT approved for legal use in the US. As others have mentioned they are glass-lensed with an aluminum reflector, which I really like. I also love that I can try other H4 bulbs in the future.<br /><br />I installed them in my 1991 XJ and they fit perfectly after I bent back the tabs at the back of the headlight cup that have been mentioned by other XJ owners. If you have a Jeep and you don't like the HID headlight upgrades I'd recommend these. They maintain OE look and they're German quality for a super reasonable price.
B001IH8P9M|5|Great fit and dose the job it was created to do perfectly!!!
B002SSBPQK|5|Great brush, used it to clean my convertible top.  Nice and gentle on the cloth, I followed another reviewers suggestion to comb wet and play with it for 10 mins or so to remove loose hairs.  After this when I went to clean the top only a few came out, which I used a lint roller to pick up once the top was dry.  Followed up with some 303 protectant and the top is looking awesome!
B000EDQR6E|4|the screws that hold the cord sticking out , but other than that its a great plug. I would buy it again. Chass
B0018PSASU|5|Worked great. I was able to pack my caliper pins while lubricating all the other parts and everything just works so much better now.
B00OJXDZI8|5|Great
B007NKPYII|5|Great product, nicer than you would think
B00D42AFS8|5|Very useful for all emergency needs!
B007ZGIDV0|1|Disappointed in the product. 1. quality of the skull is bad! 2. Dimond is not centered 3. There was no pride when putting this insignia together or it was completely rushed when created.
B00D8YKXUM|5|Quick install
B0055OBLVS|5|very good.
B009DJTCF8|1|This rating is for the product not the vendor. The first pair I received worked for about 2 months. And I took a long time to ensure I was installing everything properly. I even replaced the motors. I was frustrated and reached out to the vendor through Amazon for replacement. They said I had to send mine back before I would receive new ones. I dragged my feet, never sent back the defective ones back and a week later received a replacement pair. They failed after about 2 weeks. Since we had problems with the first pair we didn't use the back windows more than once in those 2 weeks and somehow they still broke. Window falling down and have to push up with my hands to close. Poor quality... horrible product.
B00KTHWJVM|1|did not work something is loose inside
B009OBVRY4|5|For a small buffer and the price,<br />It is awesome, ,
B0024NSMOM|4|good oem replacement
B000BGM7LS|3|Be patient replacing this - works fine once in place.
B00ELR3FT6|5|Excellent
B00120IEF0|5|Perfect fit, and look great on my 2008 GMC Sierra 2500HD. They're well-made, and sturdy. Not the flimsy junk you get at an auto parts, or box store.
B00SYVX2OI|5|The look is outstanding and my wife installed it with no instructions.... So it was very easy.  Could be cheaper in price, but over all a good deal.
B00M468ZSC|5|Purchased for my sister.  Perfect size for her carry on toiletries, etc.
B002T4U3Q6|5|Fantastic
B00CMMVUOO|5|Excellent
B001FDB190|5|Great fit save.s gas
B0010L1YZS|5|Great as advertised.
B006FRQZOW|5|Works great on my 02 and 03 jettas
B0002F66G0|5|Again, I thought the product would be low quality but I was extremely pleased.  It fits our RV spare tire we ordered and looks great.  I'm so glad we decided to order this item.
B007VSVQ52|4|these are awesome.  wish i would have found out about them sooner
B000NPR32U|5|Great as advertised.
B00OQTC9OQ|4|This is the first time I have found car seat covers which actually fit that strange front seat!
B00449KVDO|1|IT DOESNT FIT TO MY VOLVO<br /><br />I spent my money
B000R6T8NW|4|Nice lock.  not fool proof but good enough to keep a honest person honest.
B0007LVJ2A|1|Used this one time and when I released the pin, the lock fell apart I would not reconmend this lock.
B00ON69VVG|4|Good quality for the price I paid. Console cover don't fit, but no biggie. The seat covers are snug and for the most part are exact match to contours of the seat. Thick material also is a plus as I think they will last awhile, if the stitching holds up. Happy with these covers.
B00KCFKPJO|1|Supposed to be the end all, do all, absolute best of generators per all the literature and reviews.  I just picked up our THIRD one locally and it has an entirely different set of problems than the first two. My hubby is an AES certified mechanic with certs on three different small motors, whatever that means - and I probably wrote that wrong. Regardless, supposed to be better in so many ways than our Honda EU2000.  Perhaps it would be, if it would work!  Even customer support is scratching their heads because my husband is doing everything properly, trouble shooting properly, and all other calls into customer service about this generator have been operator error.  Now, as you can probably figure out, it's not just the long drive to replace it in traffic every time.  This whole situation involves much more.  Unpacking, filling with gas, etc., failing, trouble shooting, calling tech support, deciding to replace, emptying it, repackaging it, returning it, getting the next one and starting over.  You know what I'm over?  THIS GENERATOR.
B00KH2EN18|3|Good product
B00F5QN71I|4|Nice little kit and very easy to install.  I had a misunderstanding with a previous kit I bought due to the ad wording not being specific enough. I got the Hi/Lo-HID kit and didn't realize it needed a separate power line run, along with a lot more cord.  I wanted the simple plug and play setup.  So after I returned that kit, the seller informed me of the correct kit to purchase (the Hi-halogen, Lo-HID) and I installed it with ease.<br /><br />I wish the light was a little brighter, but it's still a HUGE improvement over the stock headlight.  All in all, I'd say it was a good purchase, and now I have a spare, too!<br /><br />FYI, installed on a 2002 Honda Shadow ACE motorcycle.
B0002KR88A|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Power Solar Generator
B0016KA9PY|5|good price
B00068XCQU|5|My two yr old failed , called cust srevice and instructed to mail unit for warranty service repair....Unit found defective and sent me a brand new replacement in two weeks without question...The charger works beautifully when properly connected......would recommend it.....
B000COC84U|5|Fantastic little tool. Easy to use.  Well worth the money.  Took me less than half an hour to clean a 8 heavily carboned piston groove.
B000F285EG|1|It split into the first week I had it. Jack was mounted snd secured properly so not sure why it split. I would not recommend buying this product until they can find better quality material.
B00JBMEYLO|5|This was a gift for my son.  He loves it and says the fit of this brand is better than that of most tee shirts.
B0082A35XO|5|Fit my 2007 Mercedes C280 4Matic just fine, car is driving great again.
B004BFW0EO|5|The 3D Eraser is the bomb!  I was so happy how well this product works.  I was skeptical about this, but I am so amazed how well this product works.  I would definitely  purchase this product again. I purchased a 2014 Kia that had water spots from acid rain and tried to wax and polish and the spots would not go away. I tried the 3D Eraser and within seconds the spots were disappearing.  I could not believe my eyes when I literally saw the spots erasing away.  I would Highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried over and over to remove water spots and has given up. Thank You 3D Eraser products.<br /><br />Phil
B00I3LLHIM|5|wish the smaller was one inch longer
B0050VFAOK|1|got this device and it didn't last a day. what a bad buy..........
B006MDH3JK|5|Thanks
B00N5UBQHS|5|Works perfectly with my 51.2 Watt-hour LiFePO4 motorcycle battery.
B0001MQ7DG|1|It worked first time i used ut.  second time i used it, the coil freezed up with ice.  after that it did not work at all.  when you call Koolatron, it takes ovear 1/2 hour for customer service to answer.  they do however come back to you every 5 minutes with a recording that all their service reps are busy at this time and your call will be answered in the order it was received. over 30 minutes of waiting, it made me think how many other people are calling because of falty products.
B00J8AI44C|5|These look great and arrived early! I will be ordering from spec d again. I ordered the clear corners. You will need to get an actual Amber bulb if you get the clear ones. Other than that installation was incredibly easy. Remove one screw and they slide right out! Would definitely recommend! Though the fact that these (being plastic lenses) are so white/clear makes the stock glass headlights look weird. I will be getting plastic lenses for mine.
B001E8MK50|5|Super Nice bags. Can't wait to use them
B000KITSMI|1|The tool it's not good at all,there's no way I will recommend that to anyone
B001Q7X00S|5|Really great stuff, will be ordering more
B000CIQ47S|5|Exact replacement. My lawnmower is running fine.
B003TTL0TE|5|Totally awesome! Very soft, holds suds nicely!
B00VRUDWE8|5|Love the decal
B00GQ34OA2|4|It feets perfectly for my Rav4 2014, whiter light that original bulbs
B006K8GKBO|2|Did't last as long as i thought it would
B004YNOS3E|5|Great Product!
B00M06871Q|5|Don't think twice...it clamps the bar clean and strong....it adjusts easy.....it clamps my note4 in an otterbox strong....doesn't move around the phone stays solid.....I was doing 100 yesturday on my bike and it was great
B0040PRQB2|3|first unit had to be returned as cord melted in cigarette lighter.  replacement seems ok.
B00DSD70X6|5|Looks great on old ford
B000NW6X24|5|great price  and exactly like the original.
B001QUFZSA|5|Easy install, fixed my low coolant code right up. Much better price than the stores have too. Arrived quickly.
B003V9W0G4|5|Seems like a great tire patch kit. Fortunately I haven't use it yet, but I have confidence in it.
B00L1LDOGY|3|Cannot use without the raid keyfob. Therefore what's the point. If you have the fob but no key then buy.
B00VS8FJBS|5|Great part!
B00HR8FCDI|5|Love them! So soft!
B0009IQZH0|4|works good for me
B000BOB5FE|5|Just what I needed.
B00GSAUHB8|3|While your site states that the shade fits a Honda Odyssey, you can fit it in my van windshield only if you work with it a bit so it doesn't slide down. I know you also shipped a sticky pad to help keep the shade in place, but I'm not attaching that to my van. It works OK. I would have given it a 4-5 stars if the shade were a bit larger and fit the van windshield more easily.
B00NLQTDLC|5|Affordable and surprisingly great quality, this is not my first hjc and will not be my last, I previously only bought shoei, but I notice no difference in quality between the two however the price is drastically different. Hjc is pouring out a product well worth the money
B000EQQPN6|1|I had to get them machined down out of round  $80.00 more no saving
B0002U2V1Y|4|worked ok not as good as I had hoped
B00ODFODN8|5|Super great can hold alot of stuff in the bed.
B00J4T7AUQ|4|Picked up a bottle at advance auto in town. Surprised me. Better than I thought it would be. Helped clean my wheels up a good bit
B001DCJ3K2|4|great
B008G31B88|5|Very satisfied. I had to adapt to my Japanese made Camry but it simply was a matter of altering one connection. Figure a half hour to do if your up to it. A lot cheaper, 5 cents of solder and 10 cents of silicone sealer, to do this than buying the ones configured for Japanese built models. They should come with adapters to fit both.
B00BSAX31O|4|Great price and quick ship but these pads appear thinner than the previous ones have installed if memory serves me correctly...
B0000AYBTO|4|Easy to install and works fine
B000C2UL4G|5|very good
B00029WSXG|4|The support arm for the mirror is not as large as the original Ford equipment.  It is not as sturdy either - it shakes a lot more when driving on the interstate than the original equipment did.  It seems to work well enough but is not as good as what Ford originally used.
B00029JLD6|3|ok
B004YWPELA|5|good
B00O1QUUKY|5|Outstanding chamois! I use it to wash my truck and it does a great job. It also wings nearly dry. I make sure to put it up slightly damp. Very good value!
B00QI6S68S|5|Nice
B0039Z3SPW|4|I wonder why it took so long for these to be created, because they should have been around 15 years ago. For anyone redoing their car audio, these are highly recommended. They bounce the sound forward, stopping the waste of sound just going through your door or trunk or hatchback and ending up not being heard. You'll hear the sound better and louder. Plus it helps protect your speaker from dust and debris.<br /><br />Easy to install while installing new aftermarket speakers.<br /><br />The only reason I put 4 stars is because their 5.25&#34; speaker baffles are made for 6.5&#34; speakers. They are too big for most 5.25 applications so when I put it in, I had to do some trimming to make sure everything fit properly. It's not a huge deal, but for the person not wanting to have to do some trimming and want a nice clean fit (even though it won't be seen), these will be a bit big.
B00A5Z7RW4|5|Great quality and fitment for the price. I was a little skeptical at first but after I installed it, I couldn't be any more pleased. I will definitely buy again.
B005UVUJQ4|1|No good
B00BMLKD6W|3|This is an okay helmet but it does run small, I usually wear a x-small and the small was a little tight.  The 3 stars because even though I think it would fit nice if had right size I do not like how big it is on your head........talk about a huge mushroom head!  Graphics are very good.
B003E26ECO|1|Not fit as item description
B00O4Z5XOA|4|Bed worked great. I had ordered the full size bed for my truck but got a skinnier version which happened to work out better.This left me room on one side to but my bags. So far very happy with this bed.
B00DRHL458|5|I bought a black spoiler (040) for my white C class for a sportier look and love the difference it makes. The spoiler looks oem and fit perfectly on the car.
B002R1SW6E|5|Fits perfectly for 1997 Dodge Intrepid!
B00FC22PVS|4|Hard time with connections
B003ODKWRG|5|This helmet is exactly as pictured and described and it fits perfectly. I thought I would wear a much larger helmet but I went with the sizing chart, and it worked like a charm. Great helmet at a reasonable price and it arrived early!
B003ZOL6R4|5|Love it!!! Wish we knew about them years ago when we started camping would of had one way back then. Sure makes a big big difference with the sun and heat from the sun.  Best thing we bought for our camper ever!!
B00FAWUCMO|4|Like that it has American flag. Matches my truck decal
B00G7RP280|5|sweet sticker
B00F66T7XE|5|I spent $20 on cheap parts before I just ended up paying $40 for two genuine replacements.  The other brands either sprayed a steady solid stream or had really narrow spray.  These fan out across the whole windshield and are really the way to go.  Save yourself some money in the long run and buy these.
B0049ZBGVY|5|Rotors worked perfect
B000PWC5JM|4|My husband LOVES these and it makes the car look great!!
B00265M9SS|5|Good product and an excellent price!
B00BU44TOI|5|Bang for the BUCK!
B000823BYC|5|Great product that works just as described.  These are thick mats that come with an anchor system that easily locks the mats in place!  Well worth the $37 I paid for the mats.
B00TUB6EKK|5|I was so delighted when opening the box.  The design graphics is crisp and good weighted materials.  Im ordering one for the grandkids car.  It helps with conversation on the topic of GMO.  Our senators and gov are not talking but Ill inform people till the day I die.
B0015CGUCO|3|clamp used weak steel
B000BUU5XQ|3|I ordered these for my husband and he isn't very pleased with them. They are too thin and too small. Also the honey cone fills with dirt and are hard to clean.  Expected better quality.
B002P8LTIC|1|This item definitely did not work for my 2000 American made Camry...even with the attachment wire that was suppose to work with the American model vs Japanese part. The wire was not at all compatible with my vehicle. The part that I was supposed to plug in was a completely different shape then the slot I was supposed to plug into. What a waste of time and money...thank god I didn't paint it prior to attempting to attach it or I probably wouldn't have been able to return it.
B009C9E7A4|5|Excellent product and fit. Buy here!
B005DEITCY|1|Not leather. Strong chemical smell. Fits snugly on my million mile plus Volvo. Better than the old plastic and foam ones that were wrapped with a plastic string. I may up my rating based on how long it takes the smell to go away, and how well it wears. Smell never went away. Threw it in the trash.
B0050I3DC4|4|OEM Suzuki performance,fit and finish.
B005JJ5CEG|5|I love the fit of thes saddlebags for my bike, I have an RKV200 small bike but those are perfect. I´m using this ones for about 6 months and the only thing that I hate is &#34;not waterproof&#34;, you need to purchase the covers that are complicated to use under rainy days Still I´ll recommend this to any biker.
B00L4NHW7Q|5|Fit for my car
B00SZK26T0|5|These lights are amazing.  The seller is also amazing and friendly if you need any help with the installation.  I have a 2008 E70 and the lights work perfectly.
B00C070M9K|5|kids love it and it looks pretty cool ...
B00H7LPKKU|5|Fast delivery and it performs &#34;as advertised&#34; in every way.  I'm an old farmer and I am impressed...
B007AC03OY|5|I'll give it 5 stars because it was exactly as described by the seller, and shipping was on time, carefully wrapped for protection. The internals for the fob of my 06 jetta fit perdect. However, keep in mind that when you buy this, you have to also transfer the transponder/immobilizer chip, and if you're not careful, the chip will break easily. It's made out of glass and covered in a wad of glue. Be careful taking it out.
B00C4B1F7U|5|Great - Works perfectly, easy to install.  Shipped quick.
B0013HJDOI|2|Cleans interiors and leather well without scratching, but bristles fall out VERY easy.  Threw it out and got something that is much better quality.
B00XIKD4AM|5|I love it
B0009IQZFM|1|Junk,  leaves streaks all over the place.
B00S127B2E|5|Great sound and easy install
B00KHUQ9NK|3|Wasn't too hard to apply to my steering wheel on a very hot day.  Took about 5 minutes or less to totally stretch it out.  Fit my KIA subcompact car steering wheel well.  However, oh, the smell!!!!  I have to drive with the window partially down because I feel poisoned.  It's been 1/2 day....I am hoping that soon this strong toxic odor will go away.  Maybe you won't notice--I have an extreme sensitivity to odors.  If the odor doesn't diminish, I'll have to toss it.
B00DRSBGPU|5|Just what my husband wanted
B00CB3E50U|5|This is by far the best thing. Trust me they stick. And there are instructions to how to put them on. If you don't read the instructions you probably did it wrong and that's why they gave it only one star but if you read the instructions and follow the steps it comes out perfect.
B0048G1TRU|5|FITS LIKE A GLOVE
B004DRRCWK|3|one light is brighter then the other.
B00SJVCRK8|5|Great. No problems
B00K763NNS|4|I was unsure if any covers would fit my El Camino, with the huge bumpers but this one did. It appears to be heavy duty and well made.
B00DLHMZUW|4|The mats are a little long, and the runner mat is slightly too short, but for a universal fit they are very very nice for the price. They are heavy duty and don't make the car smell like rubber when it's hot either. I would definitely buy again
B00F12RAHS|5|The headlights look great on my gray f150. They were easy to install and we're worth the price. I would recommend getting brighter bulbs cause it does make it a lot less bright. The tail lights didn't fit because I have a stepside bed and didn't know that stepside and flareside take different tail lights but I got those sold to someone and am ordering new ones. Other than that I didn't have any problems.
B00M5R6I6Q|4|Be aware that there are multiple frozen sticker books and stickers out there.  Make sure you buy the right &#34;series&#34; of frozen stickers for the book that you have, there are different series and they do not interchange.  The stickers and books are great, but I sure wish I would have known there was more than one series!
B000E63KKC|5|The quality of the key and ignition mechanism is what you might expect for the price. The key is lightly thinner than my OEM one was and the ignition probably isn't as smooth as the OEM originally was either. That said, you surely can't beat the price when compared to the Ford part. This also had to be the easiest thing I've ever replaced on any vehicle as well. It literally took me all of 1 minute to complete and it works without any issues so far.
B0083W18IU|5|easy to install - no adjustment needed<br />the supply line was at &#34;9:00&#34; though and my old one was at &#34;6:00&#34;<br />just had to be careful feeding fuel line to it.<br /><br />96 Honda 4Traxx
B002OUMVWY|5|As advertised. Great product and best price.
B00712V1I0|5|Verry Good Item.
B000HEA95A|5|works as expected. The extension was the perfect fit for my rack. made it look right and hauls a lot of stuff.
B0002Q7C3A|5|Functional. Assisted in troubleshooting a shorted trailer cable.
B000CINB38|5|It's a funnel that does what it's suppose to do
B000HLQ8YY|5|Awesome!  using it on my Cadillac engine.
B00A0JFPME|5|Great replacement.  Just like new.  Got rid of all of the noise that I thought were my new tires.  Increased MPG.  Smooth and silent ride is back!  This was for 07 Lexus ls460
B00JBICAXM|3|Does not come with headlight bulbs and uses h7s. So be prepared to buy the headlight bulbs to go with this product otherwise wonderful headlights.
B000B8GAPK|5|Easy to install and very durable. I noticed an increase on MPG while using it.
B00CFH9IZY|5|I bought a few of these to go on my Ammo boxes.  Certainly not as secure as Ft. Knox, but they do the trick to keep prying eyes out.  I don't remember if it came with instructions or not.  However, c'mon folks, you're Internet savvy.  No instructions?  Search for them on your favorite Internet search engine.
B004ME11FS|4|ok
B00DQ4TJUO|2|This thing is super thick, doesn't store easily anywhere in the car, and is a pain in the butt to unfold and put in the window since it's cardboard. I've already bend the edges on it trying to put the stupid side flap in the window because you can't really prop it up in the window and hold it open all at the same time.
B005OZNRVK|4|The key was cut and programmed successfully. I had to have another key made by a locksmith so that this key could be programmed by the vehicle. He told me that a key with SA on the shank was an 80 bit key, so this one is state of the art. Thanks.
B000FKKOK6|5|I received in quick time just what I ordered.  It works fine and was a great price.
B000CEQCWE|3|ordered two for my intake spacer, one showed up ripped.
B00130G3PW|5|Great product  for a good price. Arrived quickly.
B001CO4WA2|5|Excellent product. Can tell a difference in the way my buggy runs.
B006XGHLTI|1|One of the stepper motors failed to work
B000XQ0X6M|5|I change the engine oil in my shop and i wanted to have different gaskets to replace the bad ones.
B006U42QUC|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 CRV....I love it!!
B002SSKFGG|5|This was delivered on time and was the lowest price I could find on the internet.  It installed very easily and works great.
B004QOK1VY|5|Great Product and great service..
B00CICNVR2|1|pic shows led and product is not led lite
B00BACIWUW|5|Exactly what I expected. Works great.
B00873J0YY|5|Good price. Worked great to get 2 Kayaks onto my Audi Q5. Very secure
B009DIYAR4|5|great fit and seems to be quality filter..
B0009IQZFM|5|Works great for my windows and I'm thinking of buying another one to get my exterior dry also. It's worth the buy in a long run.
B00TYT9ERI|5|Excellent product fit perfect
B00VMRL2Y8|5|Perfect for my mazda tribute,  nice .
B000C122X0|4|Received the fan on time no problem, but there was a chip off the corner of the fan and one of the plastic tops that hold the bolt was broke. I have been trying to fix this fan for two weeks now (bought wrong fan the first time) so i'm going to keep it and hope the one bolt holds it fine. Just installed it and it seems to work fine, lots of air flow, and a little noisier than the original, but none the less the product is good. I'm guessing it got damaged on the way to my house :(
B0018OBG3C|3|Very comfortable, fits very nice in my 2003 Chevy Silverado single cab. Very crummy hinges on the inside and very crummy adjustable cup holders. Otherwise it's great, the seatbelt loop is nice to keep it in place. Lots of space inside under the lid but with crummy fabric liner.. Only 3 stars here. will by a car with a center console next time.
B003L2XP88|5|all I use is royal purple.Baddass product.
B006X8BATI|5|Just spend the money to fill that gap.
B010HKE40Y|1|Terrible Adhesive. Absolute junk
B00479SK66|5|Great priduct. Easy to install, though some simple instructions would have helped.
B00AR2N4IQ|5|good stuff
B008CE06ZA|5|great hitch. love it
B0009T6EA2|5|Fits well
B004BSNNY2|5|Cool cool cool and no new compressor, which I thought was my problem.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|Jumped a 2009 Prius with this! Attached the cables to the car, cable to the battery, took a deep breath and viola! Much better option than waiting for AAA or begging for a jump from someone! I have to admit I was a little worried about this working. Especially when I looked at the instructions and it was obviously written or translated by someone whose first language is definitely not English! Fortunately, it did work so it'll go in the car and I'll have to set myself reminders to pull it out and check the charge on a regular basis! (A note for fellow Prius drivers... don't put it in back! You'll have to crawl over the back seats to dig it out since the hatch won't unlock when the battery is dead!)
B00ZY7HTX0|5|Great
B00XNMP23C|5|They Fit Perfect
B000EQC242|4|GOOD TANK STRAPS
B0087XOTWW|5|Nice and white
B002YKG2R4|5|Exactly what I needed. Thank you
B00BR9L246|3|I like the fact that it has a built in sunglasses.  I use this helmet alot but wish I went with a higher quality.  Just does not seem like it would offer the protection that I would normally like (although I never tested it)  Does not really offer a snug fit even and I find it lifting up at higherspeeds
B00FDX9HOO|3|This smells tike and looks like rubbing/denatured alcohol. You’ll probably get a large bottle at the local drugstore for less.
B00062YA44|5|Purchased this for my 1969 Chevelle SS. Perfect fit and loved the quick delivery with Prime. Edelbrock branding matches the carb too.
B004BCJEBO|5|Easy to install and did not require modification.
B003VAV1P4|5|No problem, exact replacement.
B001C6P0NS|5|Rented one works good for doing water pump on 2.2 engines.
B006C169L0|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Quality, well constructed, perfect fit.
B00E7G1NGI|5|I LOVE my sticker. It's been on my car for about a year, and still looks brand new. Sure helps me find my grey Prius in the parking lot!
B000RXKR6M|5|I have used this wash mitt probably around 40-50 times, and it is still in good shape! I haven't noticed any really bad scratches in my car's paint, so I know this wash mitt is doing it's job. I got two of them so that while one is in the wash, I have another that I can use. I will definitely buy another when this one wares out! 10/10
B000YE6ROA|5|Had this on for a couple of weeks. So far so good.
B006NZTZLQ|5|Works great. Faster than other Elm 327 devices. Software works great and I upgraded to the professional version of the software which works even better. I have seven scan tools and I am a professional auto tech. This was a good addition to my scan tools. It has features that my $4,000 scan tool does not. (The $4,000 Snap On scan tool gets great reviews also). I use this tool primarily for Ford misfire detection and for Mode 6 data. If you don't know what that means you can still get codes from your car and diagnose the car if you learn to understand the data that this scan tool will release from the vehicle.
B00P2KANI2|2|Tried and tried and just couldn't get these to pop the lock on a 72 Skylark.  Might be good for newer cars that require less force,
B00IEKNGAE|4|Great price for slotted and drilled rotors.  No problem installing them on my 2000 Camry
B000M5ZWBA|5|very good tool
B0089LSFJ0|5|Worked great in kawasaki aluminum motorcycle engine. Flushed completely with distilled water before putting this in.
B00FDX6VKC|4|Got the job done, but instructions were not very clear.
B008CE0LD2|5|Used this on a 400 mile trip and it held up well. I used it with an adaptor since my hitch was a class 2 with a 1 1/4&#34; insert. It was very sturdy. This hitch tray was labeled to be used with class 3 and class 4 hitches and rated at 500 lbs. I used it with my class 2 hitch which was rated up to only 300 lbs for tongue weight.<br /><br />There was little side by side play which got me worried but it held up very well throughout my trip.
B00339QEKA|5|Exelente
B000C9MPPM|5|exelent,work perfect with my 2003 pontiac
B0013LF1JU|1|Installed it on June 1st.  August 11th and 1200 miles later it blew out my headlamp.  When tested with a voltmeter it was found to be putting out 18.2~18.9 volts.  Buy the OEM part.  It is worth the extra money.
B003IKGTXG|5|I moved down to southern california and needed something to represented my Seattle pride. Love this sticker and it has worked well on my 1999 toyota corolla bumper :)
B000BO9NOO|2|Missing one component of the fiberglass kit
B00N3N1HIU|3|Well. Tried to insall in rear window.. not happening. Tried adding sunction cups to mount on windshield.. not happening. Had to settle on setting on dash.  But. Nice light. Does it's got..
B00BIA2LJY|5|I bought a 2-pack of these pads along with the Trim Gel because I didn't want to apply the gel with a terry-bound applicator. Much to my surprise, the pads are very well designed, both ergonomically & practically. I have used them to apply the Trim Gel, Carnuba paste wax & liquid polish. I have run them through the wash cycle along with all my shop towels several times & they still come out pristine. I liked them so much, I bought another pair. Kudos to the OEM for a quality product at a reasonable price - highly recommended.
B00MXGNC9K|5|Came quick and looked amazing
B00ELHNQBI|5|It's quality oil and it came to my door. What more needs to be said?
B005HS0OCO|4|It took me a few minutes to install these bad boys in my jeep. The nerds love it. Women love the texture. The dogs dig it.<br />Easy to clean. Looks and feels smooth
B00AERMVYC|5|Works great so far .... Only used on my 2013 GMC Sierra
B0046BFSZQ|5|Super,love,will buy from seller again
B00GTFHUDU|5|Working well a year later.
B005ZV87B8|5|great little tool.
B000C9QV8O|5|Fit my 2003 Chevy Suburban like a glove.
B007JZKBVW|3|Fit my Mercedes C300 OK but are pricy for the quality. These cost about $40 but I purchased some 8500K GP Thunder bulbs on EBay for $13.59 (including shipping) that were much brighter. Also the packaging from EBay was terrible.
B00ZOT9NNW|5|It worked great on the first attempt.
B0043DW63E|4|I ordered this for my wife's 1999 Grand Cherokee. The muffler pipe rotted through and fell down behind the muffler and I was looking for a quick fix until I could get it replaced or welded, Little did I know this was the fix I was looking for. After reading some of the other reviews I ordered the 2.75&#34; size, the tail pipe measures 2.5&#34; and I'm glad I did, if I had ordered the 2.5&#34; it would not have fit. The installation was easy enough and required only a socket set and a wrench. You simply place the two sides of the muffler pipe together and tighten down the clamp. The clamp is thin enough to where if you really tighten it down it conformed to the shape of the pipe, be careful not to tighten it too tight as to strip the bolt and nut.<br /><br />I ordered some tail pipe sealer to use in conjunction to the clamp. With the clamp conforming to the pipe the sealer worked really well and provided me with an airtight fit which sealed the tail pipe and kept the exhaust from leaking through the clamp. This clamp worked so well it's still being used and hasn't caused me any problems at all. I have forgone any other repairs to the pipe because of this and is a great fix if you don't own a welder or want to pay for someone to weld on your muffler system.<br /><br />I recommend this product and would most definitely buy again in the future.
B000WJEKHI|1|Should have bought 5 dollar one did not come with bracket like it said very cheap
B003AS99DI|4|nice thank you
B008B5X5GC|1|I received this for my 09 cobalt. It was either pay 30 bucks here or 60 at the parts store. I choose here. I work with tires so I'm certified to install these and program them. I had this in my car for a weekend. 2 days  not even 100 miles and it stopped working. I don't have the patience to contact and fight with returns and ship it out to have another one here in 2 weeks or so. I'm just going to get one from the parts store. Atleast I can take it back that day and get a return no problem. I wanted to go OE (original equipment) but you never get what you pay for. Lol 😅
B008P8FC4I|1|Good looking GPS, but very slow to find where to go. dont go in to that Rand Mcnally stuff, better with Garmin.
B00PHD7PWG|5|Amazing light. Battery lasts as advertised. The product is very rugged as I have dropped it multiple times and it still keeps going.  Not one complaint.
B001DXNV9U|5|With a MAF adapter, A performance jets MAF sensor, some intake boots and a few longer hoses and new arangments for the vacume lines and so on, all of this and a little paitance and time it will work on any 2009 and up ridgeline with no error or warning lights.
B004HLDR3A|5|Fits my 2004 Mazda RX8, no problems.
B00IK5GYQQ|5|GREAT TIES... So simple to install !
B003Y323NC|5|love it
B00PHU73OY|5|The first one I ordered did not apply well, but after contacting the seller they replaced it and I am very, very happy with it. I looks great and is holding up extremely well. I do find it will at times hold on to dirt and grime that won't come off in the car wash, but I take a razor blade and scrap it at an angle (only takes a few seconds) over the dirty area and it comes right off. I really love the design and appreciate the seller sending a replacement free of charge. Very happy with it!
B001O0TO5C|5|Factory Honda part. Goes on pretty easy. Best to use youtube videos for install directions as they do not come with any.
B00H6ETIWY|5|Great price! Fit perfectly! shipped quickly! packaged right! Happy!!
B0006NE3KE|5|Have used this about 6 times on flats (5 rear punctures and 1 front puncture) In under 15 mins I can plug the puncture and be on the road again which is awesome. Must have on the motorbike.
B004QEKGA0|5|Great carrier for extra travel gear.
B0040CWZR0|5|As described.
B0009JKI7W|4|One of the rubber blades was incorrectly attached to the metal frame, causing the metal to scrape on the windshield making an awful noise.. All I had to do was flip the rubber blade over, and reinstall it, now it works great
B000I1POHU|1|This item arrived missing the pin that holds the jaw in place.  But even with the pen it didn't hold and the jaws opened while tightening nuts 3 1/4&#34; wrench size.  Was totally  useless for what I purchased it for.
B00MG687JW|5|It was an hour past sunset. The parking lot was dark except right under the lights. We came out of the department store and this young man approaches and asks if we have jumper cables to jump start his pickup truck parked &#34;over there&#34; - in a distant, dark, empty corner of the parking lot. I politely declined but offered him the use of our Nekteck Multifunction Car Jump Starter. While we put our items into our trunk in the safety of a much more populated, closer, and well-lit area of the parking lot, the fellow in the pickup truck with dead battery jump started his truck with our Nekteck - we could hear that it started almost instantly. We got into our vehicle and drove to where the young man was standing with our device, big smile across his face. &#34;Thanks, man! Where did you get this? I gotta get one, too!&#34; We told him and then drove home - safe and sound.<br /><br />I've been in places where you didn't want to experience a dead battery and have to ask for a jump start - ex: parking garage alone late at night - this was one of those times and this product shined brightly. So happy we bought it. Thank you!!
B0009YDQEE|5|These were purchased so I could save the original car mats from too much wear and tear.  For the price - these are great.  Fit the car well but do seem to &#34;creep&#34; out of position which is standard for replacement mats.  Look good and are fairly good quality.  Would buy again.
B00I7ELZB4|5|looks and measures exactly as the original filter, very good quality, clear markings, precise instructions. I was able to install it in 20 minutes following the included instructions. The smell was gone when I turned on my AC. Will replace my filter yearly from now on, buying from the same vendor.
B00EKS5FJO|5|Works great.

B00V1MUF9W|5|I used these to hang a swing from a tree branch.  Perfect.
B002M477C6|1|Head lights looked great for about 6 months. There is some clear coating falling off now. makes my car look awful because the head lights are peeling. I would not buy from them again since it was not cheap.
B00N23QY84|5|You either love them or you love them. Great product, limited horizontal adjustability with the bottom rigid squally as it hits the top of the second mount. If it bugs you file and repainted to fit your needs.
B00IEL1TM0|2|Bought these for my VW cabrio and since they were advertised to fit Beetle seats, I figured they would fit good enough. I couldn't even use them. They slipped right off the leather seats whenever the seat came forward, and there was no slot on the side for the handle of the seat to stick through. I gave them to my fiance and discovered they worked well enough on a toyota yaris, though the seat cover does slip around quite a bit still. I kept the steering wheel and seat belt covers and they work great, but it really is worth it to buy custom seat covers if you have anything other than a toyota.
B00IUWLZMW|5|Bought this for my 2008 Kawasaki Ninja 650R<br />Perfect replacement battery for my bike, fit nice and snug and came with new screws so  could ditch the old corroded ones.<br />Digital display is Clutch! (no pun intended...okay maybe a little) Great way to know what the battery level is at.
B005QURVB0|5|The velcro on these works great. Should have bought the 25 pack.
B00DOS0PMS|1|Made a huge mess on the glass shower, and difficult to remove once applied unsuccessfully. Cannot recommend.
B004YWWK6M|1|If you need this item to protect the paint from the Southern AZ sun, get something else.  The top part of the cover basically disintegrated from sun exposure, & monsoon winds after using it for about 8 months.  Item was OK while car was covered in enclosed carport, but with just 8 months direct sunlight exposure, that was it.  The cover is completely trashed.  If you think that one years use is worth the price, then it's OK.  I was expecting 4 or 5 years out of it,
B003ULZGFU|4|Bought it for my trucks spare tire in case i ever need it. It works. Took me a little bit to figure out how to lower it back down however. The paint wont last long, but based on the function of the product, 4 stars.
B00K6DLP7I|4|Good buy and fast shipping
B00LNJI1KI|5|Great quality and super bright.
B00I96JZU8|4|The terminals were on opposite side from the original battery.  Had to do a little work to make it work but overall good product so far.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Great quality and great product!
B00QGJGP5I|3|Not strong as expected
B00REQVA34|1|Did NOT work right out of the box. Waiting for response from manufacturer.
B000C2YXF4|5|perfect.
B006JPUKQO|4|Still on there. Can't complain.
B00MDAJJ34|5|I LOVE BFM! This is so cool!!!!!! The size is perfect for my side window, and it's BILL MURRAY. Can't go wrong.
B001AMEG20|1|Purchased because I wanted separate air valves for each shock.  However, both valves leak air.
B007XE8C74|5|A Great product.
B007Y4BL1C|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator
B004I14B3Y|4|Very satisfied with product received!
B000JZEXG8|1|My mechanic went ahead and installed it yesterday.  Today my engine is running very rough and it showing new faults counting increased emissions which is the primary o2 sensor again.  I now have to drop another 100 bucks to have these installed.  I am quite pissed.

B00MOBP4SG|5|Love it
B0006GF5SK|5|east to use and works the best
B007GR4ZEC|3|Wheel weights What else can be said?
B005DUAVHO|4|They are pretty good and look badass, already had a little accident and the ABS plastic was not even dented. Only drawback is that the resin utilized for the finish goes yellowish with the sun.
B0089CR8II|5|perfect fit and I am picky with my new stuff
B0002Z9QWQ|5|These are the only wipers i buy now, they are more expensive than your basic Walmart blade and even a few dollars more than all the brand name ones sold at the auto parts stores, yet are cheaper than fancy pants aero blades.  Not to mention the fancy all one piece blade designs dont look right on a car that wasnt meant for them, and have that huge adapter to allow the old style wiper arm to hold the new blade.<br /><br />These are by far the best value wiper blades that I have used.
B008BHAOQO|1|Item was defective, unable to adjust output voltage, input voltage = output voltage regardless of potentiometer position. Returning for refund.
B00RKKLR8M|5|Bright colors, beautiful design, love the hummingbird!  It's a tad fuzzy and could be clearer but it's not so fuzzy that it detracts or anything.  If this fades I'll probably want another one just like it!
B001O0BJUK|5|Got a great deal on a GREAT product.
B00O90MHDU|3|They don't spring back into place as well as hopped. If bent to far the spring on the bottom with bend out of shape. The pole itself a little fragile. It got knocked down to the ground and ran over flat on the ground. Picked it up to put back in place. Got fiberglass splinters all in the palm of my hand. Be careful
B004R36UXM|5|excellent seller, great product!
B005XOYCLQ|5|Easier to install than trying to find the original one on the side of the road after it fell off or trying to get one out of a junkyard without breaking it.
B000PL0CTI|3|Burns out pretty quick. But, will definitely handle the voltage.
B00AQAQI6E|5|I replaced the dome light in all my cars. Wow, what a difference. I can read a map. These like modernied my cars. Hay if they don't exactly fit, bend the socket metal until they fit.
B00UUR2AQ0|5|GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT THANKS
B001O0G5PY|1|Received package yesterday opened them up looked like good quality, something told me to count them. I only counted 23 of 24 looked all around the area I opened the bag no luck so back to the waiting game.
B000C0YOB4|5|Perfect fit for 1988 MR2 lower rad hose.
B0084LT9PY|5|I brought this for my wife's Chrysler 300 and she has not stopped thanking me.  It also brings out the appearance of her vehicle.
B000KUYYFC|2|The right passenger side liner had a corner bent when I received it and it never fit right. The edges folded down and looked horrible. I called the WeatherTech and he tried to tell me that is the way they are made and would not exchange it.
B00KSDKWZ2|5|fast shipping and great product with how it fits and feels durable, also got a thank you note from the business owner in the product which personally I liked a lot.
B003UT3XKC|4|I do like this dressing, it has a nice uniform look when applied to tires. Its not overly shinny, which is nice. My only complaint, it doesn't last well through rain (was nearly gone after two mild storms), but that's kind of expected for a water based dressing. I do think Optimum tire bond lasts a little longer on the tire, but I like the finished look of the CG dressing better. I'm planning on trying PERL once I finish up with this and OTB.
B007TB90TK|5|Great deal fast shipping
B00029WSW2|5|Awesome
B00VNBDWPK|4|Really nice product easy installation and capacitors included and connection also but no instruction manual included colour is very nice tinge of blue i liked it but in my expectations i want stronger beam so i will shift to 55w hid in my accord  2013 and will put these in the fog lights and put update for the review
B00SR1SQPA|4|Updated review, was able to get one of two watches i tried to open, seems ok quality for the money.
B008L1MSVY|4|A little smaller than I expected.  I should have looked at the dimensions more closely but otherwise a great sign and my dad loved it.
B00AW82TQS|5|excellent
B00J0O7VIQ|1|These covers are pretty crap for the price. For how much they cost, I expected these to fit my seats like the skin of a 20 year old - smooth, not saggy, etc. Instead, they fit like the skin of a 90 year old grandmother - wrinkly, loose, ill-fitting. For reference, I bought a cheap ~$35 generic car seat cover for my sister's CR-V and they fit better than these do. When I shelled out this kind of money for custom fitting covers, I expected really great fitment.<br /><br />I've installed Clazzio seat covers on another car and they fit perfectly, so I don't believe there is installer-error factored in here. Just a very mediocre product.
B00AWN2Q5M|5|Very nice we love them
B00N03115M|1|This take forever. I did not know that this will take a long time..
B001MU12RW|5|Ok
B00LVSAXQG|5|Delivery was prompt the kidney notified every step of the way and was exactly what I wanted so when I got it who is it excellent every way thank you
B00ATT3DOM|5|The sonata hybrid as well as many smaller cars no longer come with a spare. This spare was half the cost of the dealers price and meets my needs in case of a flat that can't be fixed with goo and air compressor that comes with the car.
B00T5DM8RG|5|Very nice assembly but did not work with my HID system.
B00S67T6PO|3|It came broken and I had to fix it.
B00XZCHCHE|5|Great jacket love it, all pockets really useful. Wish I got a size bigger though, still great for its price
B000A09M2C|5|good product, fast delivery!
B00GHT6COQ|5|Worked perfectly
B00OBUUBIG|5|I am pleased with my purchase.
