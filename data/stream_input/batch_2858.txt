B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game with lots of levels and tasks to keep you busy for hours. You can even keep playing with out in app purchases although you move faster through the game if you purchase more jewels or other important items to the game. Levels pass quickly and do use up more energy but again you do not need to purchase lives to move through the game.

0060989157|5.0|Wow!  This book contains all the debauchery and decadence that you could imagine and were promised.<br /><br />Being a hard rock fan, I was always aware of the Crue, although they were not my favorites.  I always thought they were overrated and that Vince was never what you would call a \\"great singer\\".  But I do admit that I rocked out to their songs and even saw them in concert a couple of times (once at the US Festival).<br /><br />Having said that, I enjoyed this book thoroughly and literally could not put it down, as I was continually amazed by the countless insane and humorous stories that are contained here.  There are two chapters that stood out for me:<br /><br />One is the chapter about Vince losing his child.  That chapter is so heartbreaking that I had to take breaks just to get through reading it.<br /><br />The other is the chapter about Tommy in jail.  He vividly paints a picture of what it was like to be locked up there, and it is a place that you never want to find yourself in.<br /><br />Reading this book, you get the feeling that the band became successful in spite of themselves.  By their own admission, they were drugged out when they recorded and released two sub-par records in a row, and they STILL had success with them.<br /><br />Another thing is that the band actually comes across as un-likeable, although I'm sure they don't care much about that.<br /><br />Nikki, for example, when faced with any adversity, always reacts the same way: Jump up, scream obscenities and punch someone in the face.  And Vince actually killed a passenger in his car because he was driving under the influence.  And there was no mention of the incident when Tommy had a backyard birthday party for his kid, and somehow, another parent's child drowned in Tommy's pool unsupervised.  How can you really like people like this?<br /><br />And you don't get the feeling that the band members have each other's backs.  Instead, they openly despise each other, yet continue to workin the band together because it is the only thing that seems to work for them.<br /><br />It's amazing that after the success they had, some band members could still wind up broke, usually due to a divorce.  Also amazing is, during the John Corabi tour, the tour was cancelled due to lack of fan interest.  Their heyday and the musical climate had passed them by, and left them in the lurch.  Their success was as much a part of the time period that they were in as much as anything else.<br /><br />But hey, I would still rather listen to the Crue than watch an MTV VMA show or listen to any of the other garbage that they call popular music these days.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I give it 5 stars because this book delivers on what it promised:  The Dirt.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|Animation is beautiful.  Pixar draws the streets of Paris and brings them to life.  Great story and characters.  Great for our 4 yo and Mom and Dad.  It's not Toy Story (what is?) but it sits on a shelf next to it without apology.  Rent, buy, enjoy it...really can't go wrong unless you are an animation snob - you know who you are - and that's ok, but for the rest of us, this is top of the line.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is awesome if you have money if not it's still good have fun I sure am add me as a friend.awesome game to play
B005LAIIJY|5.0|WE FOUND THIS MOVIE TO EVOKE STRONG EMOTIONS AND RESPONSES. THIS WAS A TEACHING MOMENT AS WELL AS AN ENJOYABLE MOVIE.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It can be slow sometimes, there is nothing too exciting about it. It's not bad, it saves your battery life though.
B000VMIILU|1.0|First, let me say that I have always admired Ridley Scott's work.  Blade Runner is one of my all time favorite films.  But this one - such a travesty of history as I hope will never appear again on the screen.  Should anybody think this is in any way connected with the real Christopher Columbus, let them read the definitive biography of him by Samuel Eliot Morison, \\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\\".  This film is laughable in its inaccuracies.  Frankly, I was appalled that such a noted director should unleash such imaginings on an unsuspecting public.<br /><br />Gerard Depardieu, one of my favorite actors, tried mightily with this ridiculous script, but I have to wonder why he signed on in the first place.  It doesn't look like an easy task, slogging through all that jungle.  As the real Columbus was tall, fair- complexioned with red hair and blue eyes, as was Queen Isabella, he was sorely miscast.  Although I do agree that it was a nice touch to have an actor with an accent, but I wonder how much the real Columbus had, as he thought and wrote in Spanish.<br /><br />As a flic, I guess it's not bad, wonderful cast, but as a portrayal of an historical man and his voyages to the west, this is pure Hollywood bunk.  He never, ever realized that he had discovered a new world, thinking to his dying day that he had landed on Japanese islands. And already in the early 1500s, he is credited with that discovery. If I could give in zero stars, I would.  Sorry, Mr. Scott.

B00B6U63ZE|5.0|A great read, very informative glad I read it. Best business book in a long time. If you buy one Buy this one!
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is seriously addicting. I have it on my phone as well as my kindle<br />Fire. I am almost embarrassed to say that I have more than a million points on it.<br />It burns the battery down a little but doesn't completely tank it. Great for a time filler.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|way too much chatter from the characters but mostly entertained by it. I hate finding objects by their shadows. glad there isn't too many of those. characters are pretty cool. love the artwork. it feels like I've been playing this forever.....endless searching,  but I keep saying one more and I will stop. help me,  I'm sucked in....lol
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is an awesome game. Great for anyone, who enjoys TCG type games + the art in this one is pretty damn fabulous.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game :) it's the best I've ever played in a long time. And I hope there will be more of these kind of games(:
1401200923|3.0|First, I want to make it clear I haven't read many Batman comics beyond Frank Miller's material. I was lent this series by a friend, and I'm sort of glad I didn't personally buy it. The art is stupendous, and I spent a lot of time slowly reading through the graphic novel just to savor it, but I wish the story had been better. Much like in the first volume of the series, someone is screwing Bruce over, and he's still trying to figure out just who.<br /><br />This is the biggest issue of the story I have, in that once you reach the finale, you're treated to not one, but three reveals as to who is pulling the strings in the background. It's like a movie having three different twist endings back to back. If the writer had picked one, and stuck with it, the plot would have seemed more complete. Instead, it's a bit like a sagging web, things touch, but very loosely. Even with that flaw, I'd still recommend this to others since the other elements of the story are very well done, and the visuals are amazing. Your eyes will thank you.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Madonna really surprised me! This is an excellent movie! Hope she writes and directs more! This movie is really intriguing! Both stories are very real. Don't miss one moment of it!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I want to know so much more! Please hurry and release the next book!!!! I will not feel complete until this series has an ending.
1582406723|5.0|AWESOME!  bought my copy from &#34;gohastings&#34; for a couple bucks cheaper then the highest price found,  shipped to me in PERFECT condition, all anyone can ask for. In terms of the comic, i didnt realize that it would be in black and white, which is not a big deal, i guess i thought it was shotty amazon product picture... still, does not matter, the art is BREATHTAKING.  I bought this comic for the boyfriend but i,as well as he, is a true fan of the walking dead, might have to read it before him!  awesome comic + professional shipping manner = happy customer. thank you again Amazon and Gohastings.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This was the best replacement that I could find for Google Reader. It's still not the same, but it's the best cloud synced service / application that I could find.
1423140591|5.0|Great book!  It picks up where book one left off. The first book covered a Roman leader in a Greek camp, this one covers a Greek leader in a Roman camp (this was spelled out at the end of book 1 so no spoilers here). The mixture of new characters with the continuing saga of Percy Jackson is great for fans of the first series. Rick Riordan does a great job of pulling in plot threads from the first series into this book (and book 3) to produce a compelling storyline. It is well worth the read.
B005SCSL56|5.0|Seriously, I had some doubts .. Because I am a big Fairy Tale buff. But this book was beyond amazing! I enjoyed it and I'm 27, so I know all ages would really enjoy it. I recommend it to anyone that loves fairy tales or a great book to lose yourself into.
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|I had this on cassette tape when I was only 21 and listened to it with my now wife.  Of course, cassette tapes don't hold up. When I found out there was a new remastered version released on CD, I bought it right away.  I was not disappointed.  And, much to my surprise, when I popped it in my car's CD player, my wife still knew all of the songs too!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This book is a charming classic full of happiness and life lessons precious to all who indulge in them. The characters are captivating and their progression through life keeps the reader interested. Overall, a good story full of valuable morals.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great,  hours of fun! Keeps your brain sharp!  Purchased all 3 Brave games, this is the best. FANTASTIC! It is a must have for your collection. Good for kindle, background graphics great. Highly recommend.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I fell in love with North By Northwest a long time ago and have always considered it one of not just Alfred Hitchcock's best films but one of the best movies ever made. I won't go into what it's about, I'm sure enough people will do that.<br />But I am here to say this is a superb Blu-ray edition. My all time favorite Grant/Hitchcock film is actually To Catch A Thief but NBNW comes in a very close second and both films are excellently remastered on Blu-ray. I own the UK edition of the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection and for whatever reason it does not include North By Northwest of To Catch a Thief so to add to my personal Hitchcock Blu-ray film collection I had to purchase NBNW and TCAT as well as Strangers On A Train and Dial M For Murder which is slightly blurry due to the 3D tech at the time but is still a great film. Especially if you are a completest like me and want to round out your Grace Kelly and Cary Grant Hitchcock films in your collection. Kelly did three films for Hitch: Dial M For Murder, Rear Window and To Catch A Thief while personally my three favorite Cary Grant films are North By Northwest, To Catch A Thief and Charade. All available as exquisite remastered editions on Blu-ray. Charade available as a Criterion Collection edition. I originally owned a Criterion Laserdisc of NBNW but this Warner Digibook Edition blows that out of the water, it's a shame that Criterion lost the rights to so many titles like 2001, North By Northwest, The Fisher King and Time Bandits but they have found renewed life on Blu-ray. I only really mourn for The Fisher King because only the Criterion Collection Laserdisc had commentary and deleted scenes and so many special features that do not accompany any other video version of the film.<br />But North By Northwest either as a stand alone digibook by WB or in the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection is in itself a masterpiece of a movie.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|The stabilizer perfectly holds any type of camera. It works perfectly for follow up shots and the LED light adapter on top makes it perfect for night filming. I highly recommend it.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Atul gawande is a treasure. This book was inspiring. I am constructing checklists for my work now and expect the same efficiencies. The safe surgery checklist of who comes from his group.  Great read
B0000024YL|5.0|It's all been said before, but I'm going to toss in my support for the five star reviews.  This is their best, period.  Almost everything on it is excellent.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory has done it again.  She takes you back to the 15th Century and all the turmoil of the War of the Roses.  I have read every book she has written on this subject and find this one of the best yet.  A must read,\.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is my first Gillian Flynn book and I'm absolutely satisfied with this engaging thriller. It was captivating and keeps you wanting and needing more. You tell me, are you the kind who care for your sick child out of love and compassion or do you have the love and passion to keep them sick!!
B003NFM3JK|4.0|This is a very cute Disney film. I can recommend it without hesitation. It's a cute cartoon that adheres to the Dicken's classic and moves quickly.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is the best alarm click I have ever had. I like the ease of setting the alarms and the alarm sounds.  I really like waking up to the sound of a rooster in the morning!  The screen when the alarm goes off is easy to read when I don't have my glasses on yet.  There are a lot of options to customize the alarm.  I like the option to have the volume start low and increase,so I can wake up slowly or shut it off before it is too loud if I am already awake.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's been a long time since I've sincerely cried reading a book. I am a better person for having read this book. Thank you, John Green.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Did exactly what I thought it would do. Nothing more, nothing less. solid product overall. a necessity for Ps2 gaming.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My 6 year old son loves it and was surprised when he opened the box.  From a parents perspective, I believe the price it not worth what comes in the box.  It is definitely not like that video game in which my son spends hours exploring and building.  Because it is limited to just the few pieces, I can see my son building it and then moving on to the video game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is the first game I played on my new Kindle Tablet and I loved it! I really recommend it for those who like solitaire card games.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a good suspense thriller.  It had some good twists.  I highly recommend this book for spy novel lovers.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recommend game.  I can never get enough of the minions.  would always rather buy game than buying advantage over others.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good characters and a suspenseful plot.  I always think they are good when I cannot guess the ending and I didn't on this one.  I'd definitely recommend it.
B002361MLA|3.0|I have not yet read this book I bought it to read next.Hope that it is as enjoyable and insightful as last book I read
B0096YP8G2|5.0|This is a very nice, and very affordable overview of Bob Dylan's career from 1961 to the 1980's. This set lists familiar Dylan tunes, but gives rare performances, and previously unreleased takes instead of the more familiar versions on Greatest Hits Vols. 1 & 2.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have given up taking a book to bed now I play spider until I fall asleep and in the morning I pick it up before me glasses.<br />Sad! I know
0307341550|5.0|I recommend reading all of Flynn's novels - she creates the most sick and twisted plots and never ceases to amaze you or surprise you. You can never predict what is going to happen next and I LOVE the thrill of that. So hard to put down.. I'm 22 years old and absolutely loved it. Gave it to all of my friends and they (college sorority girls who I wasn't even confident have ever read a book in their lives) COULDN'T put it down! Definitely worth it..
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I bought several copies of this book to give to friends and family since my wife loved the book so much.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I've had this board for over a year. BIOS updates fixed most of my initial complaints. I received rev. 1.1 w/ EFI DualBIOS (not UEFI)<br /><br />With DualBIOS, a backup ROM rewrites the main ROM if it's unusable. Bad settings, power outages, and even a botched BIOS flash fixed themselves. The CMOS reset jumper is almost unnecessary.<br /><br />-The northbridge runs hot as shipped. The UD5 and UD7 models have better heatsinks. I applied Arctic MX-4 and new heatsink clips when the warranty expired. Problem solved.<br />-I installed 2 AMD Radeon HD 6870's in Crossfire. No problems. Ever.<br />-Azalea audio chip rocks. I use analog 5.1 surround and SPDIF to Dolby Processor without qualms.<br /><br />My only real complaint:<br />-Overclocking on this board is weird and confusing. Check the Gigabyte 990FXA Owners thread in TweakTown's AMD motherboard forum for tips. The F10a beta BIOS helped me a ton. It's on Gigabyte's website.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and so do I. How can anyone not love Tinker Bell? lol

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I can understand the disdain many have with the rebooting of Star Trek.  Many people feel as though J.J. Abrams has taken the films into a direction away from the original Star Trek.  I on the other hand love the two movies he has released.  The casting is spot on, and it isn't about constant fighting and explosions.  Into Darkness took me by surprise, and I'm sure others will be surprised as well.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.
B009AMANBA|5.0|HERE WE GO AGAIN TO SAY SIMPLY FANTASTIC.<br />VERY INTERESTING HISTORY AND THE ACTING NEXT TO NONE. GREAT GREAT GREAT
B00646UU5Y|4.0|Gave this only 4 stars because it just leaves you hanging in the end. Seems to have spun off in the US but the enthralling original from the UK is better.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Its a lot of fun and addicting.  It is a little frustrating to have to wait a certain amount of time before you can continue to play again.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|A great movie to watch when you have nothing else to do.  Even the kids liked it, even though I forgot about some parts that weren't to great for them to watch.

B005AKFXZW|5.0|Wow - the best book I have read so far!  My mind was playing all these colourfull games with me.  Steven Spielberg should read this book for a possible movie - it will be so awesome! When I finished the book, I felt like I was standing on the large open veld looking for the circus, but it was gone!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I've seen the movie, and I don't usually buy DVDs, but I saw this was going for less than $3 USD so I picked it up.  Shipped right away and was packaged well.

B00DLKXF3A|4.0|Alright listen to it. The way they went for this album is way better than I had expected although I like the explicit or spicy language better on prior albums, just because if I wanted to listen to a radio album I would buy everything at walmart. It doesnt mean im an idiot for enjoying spice that is done well.    Now I took me back in the day I get the feel and the vibe for this album very well done, when going into this album the little sound bites dont do it justice on here I had to youtube the entire cd because those 30 sec clips just put me on the fence. And hey I ended up buying becaue you need to take what they said they were gonna give you this time around and take it for what it is  simple and well done.    I personally was hoping for a double cd like sod we would get this cd the 6m to a yr. Later we get a cd the keeps to what brought them to the table crazy fun s***. I can keep wishing thou.    I really cant see why alot of are  people hating on the new kid by saying he suck hes not like this guy or this guy. this is the way the band wanted this cd how is that his fault with the simplicity of the drums.    Im not going to put down the opinions of the people who dont like the album by sy saying the true ax7 will enjoy. Thats bull s*** just because you dont have unicorns and fluffy  bunnys and rainbows to shove up are favorite band of yours ass doesnt mean you not a fan now or ever where. So support what you like or dont like. They can handle criticism otherwise they would be in this business if they cant then they should quit.    So well done fellas now how about a country style cd I loved dear god. It was way better than any country at the time you could make it a double cd sowe would have this awesome country cd by you and a insane your older style cd for who enjoy spice.    Also I used to be  big into wrestling if triple h fights at wrestlemania and doesnt come out to a live performance of hail to the king. Then im probably not gonna buy the ppv I know itsounds stupid but hey ive paid for way less of a show although I was expecting better instead of meh lately for the wm.
078324228X|5.0|The only reason I am writing back is because I still believe in amazon products, as well as this film I bought , but it skipped so much I just gave up and passed on it! PLEASE DON'T SEND ME JUNK
B00B2166BS|5.0|Product works as expected, but there are a few minor annoyances: 1. The indent has to be up. It will connect the other way but won't charge. 2. It will fall off fairly easily if bumped. 3. The leather case has to be open and folded under in order to get to the port.
B00640UICA|3.0|It is a great game that keeps my kids occupied for hours. love having it on my kindle. thank you
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|Bought this for a granddaughter and haven't tried it out so hope it works OK for her.  I just bought it for her because I bought a CD for her sister so felt I had to even out the playing field.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|A good read plot well organised read on holiday will by another of hers again I think this having to write a review annoying isn't just the star rating enough /

B008RA3X5E|5.0|If you are the one of people who have trouble with awakening up in the morning then I would recommend this it's worth every penny also if you have music on your kindle then sure because if like listening to your own music and you don't have any music then I wouldn't recommend this.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Great film. Much better than I was anticipating. Light years better than Sly Stallone's campy version (also available on amazon video instant watch if you wanna compare). Hope they make a sequel to this one.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a Very entertaining game, I am enjoying it very much. Would definitely recommend it to all my friends.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|The movie isn't even about tragedy or cancer, it is just as much about friendship. I have seen other cancer movies, but I haven't cried this badly at them. The script feels really well written, staying down to earth and away from great life-changing epiphanies at the last minute. I was worried of seeing yet-another-tragic-cancer movie, but this one is neither boring nor repeating old cliches. This movie deserves it's five stars!<br /><br />And yes, Cumberbatch in the lead is doing a fantastic job, of course. If you like him in BBC's Sherlock and are considering watching this just for the actor and can stomach watching a movie like this, this is a must-see for sure.
0792156684|5.0|By now I'm sure everyone has seen this movie. A tragedy yes, but the story they put behind it is wonderful! Leonardo and Kate, again, what's not to love?
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Loved reading this book! It was refreshing and such an enjoyable read. The story is an amazing take on Cinderella with a sci-fi twist! Loved it!!!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I just can't believe how well this little device works right from the onset!  Setup was a snap. Works perfectly with my iPhone 5.<br />Once paired, I don't even have to think about it, the rest is automatic ( as long as I keep it charged).  Love this little device.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|if it was possible, this book was even better. cant wait for the next one.this lady knows how to write
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a heavy duty, well constructed knife that comes in handy quite often when camping and hiking. It is the one knife that is always with or near me.
B00846REIS|5.0|i dont know what else to say than give glowing praise to this author. wonderful read, wonderful story. buy it
B005H9B2CE|1.0|Even Natalie Portman couldn't save this dog.  Absolute bilge.  Waste of time and money if you bought a ticket. Not recommended for anyone over 5 years old.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|the book and story were incredible. read it in 24 hrs. soo much better than 50 shades, it was a fast read
0441172717|2.0|I thought I would really love this book, but in the middle of the book, it skips ahead to a couple of years later, and after that I felt like there was a disconnect between the main character at the beginning, and who he is by the end. Consequently, I kind of stopped caring what happened.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great for all who need mental challenges. I never had a chance toontown play Mahjong before and I find it very stimulating.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing. It's very reliable as well. I might just like this app more than my own cell phone alarm.
B00E38KGF4|2.0|Wow!  Thought BD as one of the best...use it for several clients...that's stopping VERY soon!<br />Tried it for 2 of my droids.  Always the same: 5-10 minutes on scans (which is okay-ish) and 10-20+ (or many fails) on it trying to contact its server (NOT okay-ish, PERIOD).<br /><br />Back to Avast! or TrustGO...maybe another.<br /><br />Very poor, very poor.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Updated about 30 minutes after post because of typos or a missing phrase.  Basic post still the same.<br /><br />...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LIKE THIS GAME FOR MY BROTHER AND SISTER they like this game it is fun and sometimes it get even harder
B006LSZECO|1.0|The characters were unlikeable.  The plot was nonexistant.  I hated every word I read, but just can't make myself not finish a book I've started.  I kept hoping it would improve, but it didn't.  I don't understand all the rave reviews.  Am I the only reader in the US who didn't like this book?
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like the 60 second time of each session of this game. I will wait for more hearts (life's) to play for free.
0525478817|5.0|Quality product and book. Anything john green touches turns to gold so if you're a fan already you'll be sure to come around for another YA novel to make you cry for years.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really enjoy being on Facebook. An i like how they have an app for it for kindle so we dont have to go to the computer anymore.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You can't have a trilogy with out a dark second act.  My favorite of the three books by far.  Totally engrossing .
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft ! I didn't have the computer or the Xbox version so I got this pocket edition one. Totally worth your money.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Could not put it down.  In spite of the torture and human suffering, I enjoyed this writing immensely.  Well written and offering an understanding of North Korea with a sense of humor at times painful but true.  A triumph. A masterpiece.  Different from most Western authors similar to Central American writers - gripping and excruciatingly faithful to truth.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Now this one is addictive for sure. It is similar to some but for some reason hard to stop once you start.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I can't add much to what previous reviewers wrote except to say that I loved Maze Runner and Scorch Trials.  They were outstanding.  I couldn't put either book down, and they were a refreshing, innovative look at a dystopian world/zombie apocalypse.  When I reached Death Cure, I began to realize I was caught in a vicious circle where there would probably be no definitive answers to a myriad of questions plaguing my mind.  I was right.  I felt a little cheated, disappointed by the end of the book.  There was no resolution to satisfy the investment I'd put into the first two books.  So I purchased the 4th, Kill Order, hoping the answers would be there.  Actually Kill Order felt like a book filled with hand to hand combat from beginning to end, driven by minute detail that made it hard for me to make it to the end.  I had hoped for more about the creation of WICKED and Thomas' role, but it simply wasn't there.  I wish Dashner had lengthened Maze Runner and Scorch Trials to include some of what was in the last two books, then provided a resolution to the story.  As it were, I read through two final books that were pretty much unnecessary.  I'm much less likely to buy more of Mr. Dashner's books and invest any more time or money.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|The first thing I need to say is: This is the 12th book of the series (not including novellas, short stories, and free e-stories), and in order to enjoy and experience everything this book has to offer, start with the first book of the series, [[ASIN:0425212866 Slave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)]].  Read each of her Psy/Changling books in order because each new book builds upon the back of the previous book(s) to create a world you could believe actually exists filled with characters you come to know and love...and love to hate.<br /><br />I have to say that it is really hard to give a detailed review of Heart of Obsidian because so much happens in this book that ties in with the previous books it's hard not to have spoilers, and I absolutely DO NOT want to spoil this book for anybody.  What I can say is that this is Kaleb Krychek's story and what a story it is.  In previous books we've been teased about who Kaleb is.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy?  Is he like his former mentor?  Is he a solid follower of Silence or is he a true sociopath?  I was dying to know who Kaleb was and this book absolutely delivered on telling us who he is and why.<br /><br />The other part of this book, as with all of her previous Psy/Changling books, we are thrust into the escalating conflict of the three races.  I really love how each book includes characters from past books so we can catch up with them like old friends.  Oh, we also get to learn a few secrets, like who the Ghost is.<br /><br />I see on Nalini Singh's website that there are to be at least two more books after this one and I cannot wait!
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|The Oatmeal has perfectly and succinctly captured the essence of our peculiar, wonderful relationships with dogs. Read this with your best friend.
031623480X|3.0|This book has good advice: if we eat as described and follow the other guidelines, we'll certainly be much healthier and happier.<br /><br />However, the blurb make it sound like this is a serious book on health that goes though the various issues with some depth of information; and that it concentrates on the specific (non-celiac) problems with wheat.<br /><br />In fact, this is actually a self-help/diet book, full of sensantional comments and unsupported statements: it has quizes to determine if you have problems (you do), a 4-week programs to save yourself, and the obligatory section of recipes. It doesn't actually answer my questions on gluten, and seems to be much more focused on overall health via the entire diet, as well as exercise and sleep, rather than having any real focus on grains or wheat.<br /><br />If you like this genre of self-help diet book, it's a great resource. There are truths in this book, and the resulting advice is, I think, correct - it would certainly be very helpful for many people.<br /><br />Personally, I'm mostly annoyed. I was already on board with carbs-are-bad and butter-is-good (though I am not eating low-carb by any means), and am wondering about wheat. The author doesn't provide a scientific discussion of the issues; there's no supporting information or evidence for many statements (either for reasonable or questionable statements); and discussion is simplified to meaninglessness. Passionate declarations don't convince me as much as basic science, approached with balance and reason... so, alas, this book does not seem to be the one that will convince me to further change my diet.
B000I9W08I|5.0|This is a family-friendly movie filled with humor and music.  The costuming and period sets are great.  Whenever I want to take a stroll back in time I turn to this easy to watch uplifting movie. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I wish I was like gru and had a thousand tiny minions to help me through the day :p but this game helps with that need kinda :p
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This was a great Indie film.  The only caution is it is not for young kids due to the violence and profanity.  Chloe Grace Moretz did a great job playing &#34;Hit Girl&#34;.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|No matter what your beliefs are concerning Jesus, this book gives the reader a chance to look at the life of Jesus from an historical viewpoint as opposed to the point of view presented in the bible, giving a much broader idea of how the Christian religion started and grew. The book presents historical data that reflects the broad dynamics of the time, with actual historical accounts written by the eras' historians in their words.  If you are interested in the life of Jesus as just a man who had a great influence on mankind, or as the son of God, who gave the world a blueprint for heaven on earth, you will enjoy the wonderful stories and historical records that are presented here.  I came away with a better understanding of the life and times of Jesus and how his presence has created a world wide religion.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This the first automatic watch I've ever purchased. I've had it for about 10 days now and it seems to be keeping time rather well. I haven't noticed it to be fast like some of the reviews mentioned.<br /><br />If you're on the fence I say take the plunge: its a great watch that will age magnificently. Plus, its a great deal if you buy it on Amazon!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I felt like it was a mesh of Alien, Reign of Fire, Star Wars, Star Trek: First Contact (the one with the Borg).  I thought it was a great sci-fi movie.  Check it out.  I think you'll enjoy it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|From start to finish one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. Very amusing and heart felt. I could watch it again and again.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|This product seems to do all that it is described to do.  I am very happy with it and feel that my android is much better protected from malware and viruses.  I would recommend this product to anyone concerned about the security of their mobile device.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures is a beautiful movie, it shows the respect the Japanese have for each other in a way that we in the west dont see. It was funny as well as moving.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am very pleased to have this Kindle app on my android device.  Now no matter where I am I can just tap on an icon and start reading one of my favorite books.  Fantastic expecially when you get caught somewhere and have to wait on something  for a while--just whip out your android device and start reading--makes the waiting a lot easier.<br /><br />I would recommend this app to any reader with a mobile device.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I like the Expendables series because its action pact and doesn't take it self to seriously.  The action is good and the characters played well together although I was a little disappointed to not see Mickey Rourke this time around. In the midst of all the unbelievable action and characters the most believable character in the movie is Dolph Lundgren. Notice him scribble some advanced theory on a napkin or when he tries to make a bomb out of phosphate cause hes a master chemist. Why is it funny because in real life he does have a masters in chemistry from University of Sydney went to MIT under a scholarship. Not only that he was in the military, trained in karate and is a 3rd degree black belt also won a few tournaments.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|I am not a \\"huge\\" Avenged Sevenfold fan, but I do really like listening to them, and I was eagerly awaiting this album to come out.  Initial reactions....dud.  I actually think they may have fallen asleep at their instruments.  This album comes out like the easy listening version of heavy metal...sure it is heavy, but it is just from playing their insturments loudly.  And shame on the drummer.  It's like they gave two sticks to someone with a rudimentary idea of drumming.  For the entire album it is bass-snare-bass-bass-snare, mix in a few toms and overplay your cymbol...repeat, repeat, repeat.<br />I am being harsh...their are glimmers of hope.  I think that things picked up more toward the end, but not enough to make up for the atrocities in the beginning.<br />I'm reading other reviews talking about the great \\"new direction\\" they are going.  This is the excuse of someone who has their bat skull symbol tattoo on their arm and are nervous about how they will be percieved by their friends.  I have been listening to all kinds of music (rap and country not included) for a long time now so I know a thing or two.  This is an excercise in greed.  Needed a new album, spent about a week putting some stuff together, rolled into a recording studio, pushed it out for the masses at $10 a pop, we all bought it because they have been so consistent for so long, make it back up to the fans on the next one.  Just hide your tattoo for the next couple of years, you will probably be proud of it again later.
B004K0C80G|5.0|I REAAAAAAALLLLY LOOOOOOOOOOOUOOOVE THIS MOVIE. IT IS INTENCE BUT IT IS AWESOME MUST WATCH. I TOTALLY RECCOMEND THIS PRETTY MOVIE
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect.  Got my money's worth with this edgy tale about family, love, and forgiveness.  Deniro was a bonus and Lawrence is dynamite.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the characters and the way he weaves a connecting story about how their lives intersect without telling you the whole life story of each of them.  There are so many good and caring people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds.  There are also some people who are selfish and narcissistic and cause problems and pass them on to others.  The author is a great story teller and we need to get some perspective about people in the middle east.  There are too many people in America who hate Moslems and this story lets you see that they are people who love their families and try to do the right thing..
B00CUKTG2Q|4.0|For their fourth CD, Franz Ferdinand rejuvenate themselves for \\"Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Actions.\\" \\"Tonight\\" was a more introspective affair, and allegedly a concept album about a day in the fife of the Ferds. Not this time. RTRWRA pulls out the choppy guitars and funky drums and bass of the first two albums. \\"Come home, practically all is nearly forgiven,\\" they invite right off the bat. Which is classic FF. Maybe you fell off the bandwagon for \\"Tonight,\\" but that's not their fault. Get back on board and enjoy the ride, just as long as you remember who's doing the driving.<br /><br />The destination is a party on the Ferd's terms. You'll get it from the fuzzy guitars on \\"Love Illumination\\" or the ripeness of the semi-psychedelic \\"Fresh Strawberries\\" (one of my faves on the disc), dance to Chic pound of \\"Evil Eye.\\" Or you can wonder what they are saying to you as a fan as they demand that you skip the pop music and \\"don't wear bright colors, you know I hate bright colors,\\" as they wish \\"Goodbye Lovers and Friends.\\"<br /><br />The over the top Alex Kapranos snarls and brags across RTRWRA's 10 songs, with nearly relentless energy. Feel how insistently he commands you on \\"Treason! Animals!\\" or the title track \\"Right Action.\\" They do throw in a couple of change ups, like the synth heavy \\"Brief Encounters,\\" which sounds like it would have been at home on \\"Tonight,\\" or the only self-effacing track on the album, the still dance heavy \\"Stand On The Horizon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Right Thoughts Right Words Right Action\\" is a fine return to form for Franz Ferdinand. If you're looking for the sort of awakening pop punch of the debut or \\"You Could Have It So Much Better,\\" you'll find it here.

0399165274|3.0|Call me confused about the title of this novel. The book is ostensibly about The Kill List, if the title is any indication. But for the purpose of the novel, the list is limited to one person, known as The Preacher. His main antagonist is a US Soldier known as the Tracker, and coincidentally, The Preacher killed The Tracker's father to give him added incentive to do his job, which was to kill The Preacher. I liked the novel for the most part, however, the ending was so bad that it was almost unintelligible. Even where I understood everything, I was bored. Forsyth has done this to me over many of his novels, usually boring me with too much information as he wished to let us know how smart he is and how well he researched an issue. Yes, he is capable of good writing, even great writing, but he is inconsistent. In The Kill List, that inconsistency leads to great disappointment.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is very useful and easy to access. Before downloading it I could never tell just his much time I had left until 2 minutes before the Fire was about to shut down usually right at a great part of the book I was reading.  Now instead of annoying constant '11% battery left ' warnings I know in advance how much actual time I can expect to use on the charge.  plus there's more info from the app.  I haven't noticed any decrease in use time before a recharge like some other reviewers have mentioned.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend of mine and what a read!  The story, the characters, the style, everything is excellent!  Pick this up if you haven't yet.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|First of all, I need to say that I have NEVER seen this movie before, but I love Anime and hearing that this movie is the first major Anime that was released in America, I have to see it! The other versions are too expensive, even the used ones, so I am very happy that they are re-releasing this set for the 25th anniversary. I will definitely be getting this movie. And, I will update this review once I had a chance to see it, and view the special features. Peace!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book is one of my very favorites.  I highly recommend it for any fantasy fan as a must read.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|For those readers who love Pendergast, this book is a delightfully dark look into his life and emotions. While Pendergast is usually cool and collected, in this third book of the Helen Trilogy it almost seems like he is lost and may never return from the dark depths. I, personally, rode the emotional roller coaster with Pendergast and was pleasantly shocked as an unexpected twist was weaved into the story.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This is so addictive and it also has many different layouts to try your hand at.  I play this at least 3 times every day.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Why should we spend more money for the same new thing?<br />It's used but like a new one.<br />I really enjoyed this movie again and again.<br />I Really love it!!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is the best way to watch You Tube.  And the sound on the HD Kindle Fire is AWESOME!  It is also easy to search for the video you want to see.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|Took a star away as it takes steps to get to where you wanna go on amazon. Otherwise it delivered as I thought it would
1582406723|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. There is a lot of action and the story is quickly paced, not leaving much down time for you to get bored or think, \\"get on with it, already!\\" I love learning about the characters and seeing how their stories progress as it goes by. Love this new take on the zombie story with a character-driven plot.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I love this movie because it's so different from other movies; it's like listening to a great CD and there just so happens to be a story that goes along with it. If you haven't seen it, you need to!
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|\\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is a bunch of grand performances in search of an actual script.<br />That the plot has holes large enough to accommodate an exploding supernova should come as no surprise: the screenwriters, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof have a long history of substituting tropes, non sequiturs and jarring plot shifts, in place of coherence, character development and tight plotting.<br /><br />This was tolerable in the first JJ Abrams 'Trek' film, because so much of it was fresh and interesting. However, \\"...Into Darkness\\" plays like a bunch of fanboys throwing their fave Trek scenes into a hat, pulling them out randomly, pasting them together and calling it a script.<br /><br />We have 'Khan', the greatest Trek villain of them all...and, one of the greatest in SciFi history...or, do we? The role is miscast with the extraordinary actor Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's 'Sherlock'). Do I believe that he is brilliant...ruthless...superior? Absolutely. Do I believe him to be Khan Noonian Singh? Not for a moment...he is too elegant to be believed as the ultimate, genetically engineered warlord. What's worse, Khan's marvelous backstory is hardly mentioned...and, is only used as a plot device to give Leonard Nimoy an absolutely unnecessary cameo.<br /><br />The laziness/sloppiness of the 'screenwriting'reaches its nadir, when the \\"...enter the radiation-filled chamber/save the ship/die a hero's death/miraculously come back from the dead...\\" routine from 'Wrath of Khan' is replayed...but, with Kirk and Spock switching roles. The shark has been well and truly jumped.<br /><br />Finally, we have a lazily contrived series of events, starting with an Away Team adventure that seems more Bowery Boys, than Star Trek. These implausible blunders are supposed to make the audience believe that Kirk is a moronic, purile egotist...demanding to go on a black ops mission in order to avenge a death...AND, that the Admiral in charge of Star Fleet (a mis-used Peter Weller)would sanction it without a 2nd thought. Its hard enough to believe that Kirk would (even out of a need for revenge) risk his ship and crew this way. That the crew would blindly follow him on such an insane (asinine) mission is pure tripe. The movie reaches Ludicrous Speed, when we are asked to believe that a massive ship (and spacedock) could be constructed by this Admiral, without anyone at Star Fleet being the wiser. The theme of building tensions and political backroom skullduggery between the Klingons and Star Fleet, drove many excellent episodes of the Trek canon...and, would have made an interesting movie. So, also, would have a new approach to the Khan/Kirk dynamic.<br /><br />Instead, the mashing of the two creates dual, under-developed plot lines that never mesh...and, its a pity, because the acting is simply superb.<br /><br />The cast of this latest Star Trek incarnation lays full claim to their iconic roles in \\"...Into Darkness\\", with the exception the (normally) excellent Simon Pegg as 'Scotty'. His borderline goofiness of the first film has gone over to ham-fisted mugging...for which director Abrams must take a large part of the blame.<br /><br />Zachery Quinto has taken Spock fully into the realm of having/acknowledging emotions. I don't cotton to this version of Mr. Spock...it eliminates the constant struggle with his dual nature; but, Quinto does such a superb job navigating the nuances, that you can't help but like the character. Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is the highlight in this movie. Despite the contrivances that the script forces him into, Pine rises above it, and makes the role of Kirk his own. This IS a Captain that a crew would follow, fearlessly on a 5-year mission into Space. The scenes between Pine and Bruce Greenwood (Pike) are marvelous expressions of mentor/student, father/son dynamics...and, completely organic.<br /><br />I was also very disappointed in Michael Giacchino's score. It is (literally) the same score from the previous Trek film, with the Romulan leitmotifs being recycled for Khan, and the Klingons (sounds like a garage band).<br /><br />Bottom line: there is too much to like in \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" to allow me to dismiss it out-of-hand. The cast is on-board, and ready for action...however, the director, screenwriters and composer are all on cruise control.<br /><br />That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good easy read while on vacation. Made you think, what would I do. Good characters. Several story lines to follow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun !!! I totally loved it !! Anyone that is reading this should download the game !! It is very much worth it !
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I enjoyed this game and was surprised that I didn't have to buy tokens but the other shoe dropped soon enough. You get to level 10 and cannot continue the game without purchase. I tire of that.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This was a fun and easy read. It packed lots of good stuff, great story line. It was written as to allow the reader to use a vivid imagination with the descriptions of the book content. Excellent!!
B0047SF41G|5.0|I loved this movie; especially Isabelle.  She was vital in getting Royce back to being a human being with feelings.  It was a shame that most of the group died; one at a time.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Absolutely love Grisham books.  All of them are great.  This is book you can't put down.  Fast reading because it's so well written.  I highly recommend this book.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|A lot better than I thought I couldn't figure out where they were gonna go. When they went there I was pleasantly surprised.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It came to me ontime and in good condition, Was pleased when  I played it that it worked well as I so enjoyed each of the sons as they played
1936608898|5.0|This is a great book on how the foods we eat can harm our bodies or help heal our bodies. As a nurse, I was excited to read the scientific evidence to support this. This is not about dieting, but rather a new way to think about the food choices we make.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I loved opening my kindle and finding it swept clean.  Not to mention, the price is right.  Keep up the good work.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Music is great to work out to or chill out to...take your pick.  I purchased it because I love how soundtracks  put you back in the frame of mind of the movie.  In my opinion Skyfall was the Best Bond flick ever!  Of course the great rip off was that I had to purchase Adele's theme song separately.  Good to see commercial marketing techniques are alive and well.
B000002HJD|4.0|Even the Doors old producer at the time Paul Rothchild, complained that this was the ultimate abomination upon the legacy and memory of Jim Morrison, I feel a bit differently however, and think that this was an inspired and unique way of paying homage to Jim and his important contributions to popular music of its time. While this release, I don't think, managed to win any new fans of the band, it certainly has awarded the remaining Doors another notch of existing creativity to wet their beaks with. This release continues to divide critics as to its validity of being a true artistic accomplishment or a shameful cash-in on the Doors' and Morrison's name. I find it a rewarding experience and granted, some of the musical accompaniments and arrangements may not necessarily have been what Jim had in mind to correlate to his poetry readings which were recorded during his birthday in late 1970, but, overall, An American Prayer is a worthwhile experience for the Doors fanatic. The inclusion of a live version of Roadhouse Blues is no doubt, an incentive to owning this release, but it seems to flow well into the overall sequencing of the record itself and some of Morrison's pieces like The Movie segment on into Lament and closing with the remaining Doors' interpretation of 16th century Italian composer Tomaso Albinoni's Adagio piece makes it all the more wanting in a definitive statement from the Doors as a whole. The since updated remaster includes a few bonus songs in the forms of Bird of Prey and The Ghost Song which further add relevance and are nice inclusions to the original release. Recommended for the serious Doors fan. Casuals may not be as impressed, but it all depends on your interest level.
B0018OAOQC|5.0|One of my favorite bands at the moment.Michael Poulsen's voice just soars with so much raw emotion and the drums ,bass and guitar are sick! LOVE!!!!!
B003NRYMZQ|1.0|I could not even finish the series. Too much time was introducing new characters and trying to build a relationship with the audience.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun.. brings me back.  Love it . Great for passing time. Played this game when I 2as young on atari.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I enjoyed reading about her career and would have enjoyed learning more about her experiences in improv, SNL, and 30 Rock. I recognize that she wrote about more than that, but here we are.  Happily, she breaks out her experience neatly into the various chapters, so you can home in on the topics that you want to read.

B00DL47RQ2|4.0|Woody Allen's 45th film takes him away from his recent foray's to Europe and plants his cast in San Francisco with extended flashback scenes in New York.  While the situation is hardly funny, there are enough elements to certainly put the film in the category of dark comedy.  Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is the wife of Hal (Alec Baldwin), a wealthy beyond description, investment banker who just so happens to be a white collar crook, unbeknownst to Jasmine.  She is the woman who knows how to live the good life but pays no attention to what's going on around her, especially when it comes to business.  Her business is shopping and hosting elaborate dinner parties.<br /><br />We find much of this out as Jasmine visits her sister, now single Ginger (Sally Hawkins) and her two bratty sons.  Each make a big point out of the fact that they are not biological sisters.  Both were adopted and raised by the same family, but Ginger always says, Jasmine has the better genes.  Ginger, by Jasmine's account has the worst taste in men beginning with her husband Augie who is in construction.  He's played surprisingly well by Andrew Dice Clay.  Upon Jasmine's arrival, Ginger is about to get engaged to Chili, a mechanic played by Bobby Cannavale.<br /><br />Both men are a little rough around the edges and certainly the antithesis of smooth and sophisticated Hal.  But yeah, Hal's a crook.  Not only that, he's a womanizer and everyone knew, except for Jasmine.  Or maybe she knew and just looked the other way.  Enough was enough and in a fit of rage Jasmine, pulls the plug on Hal's business shenanigans.  Jasmine had no idea that the government would strip her of all of her wealth as well.<br /><br />Allen turns Blanchett loose on her character and she is amazing, going from a beautiful socialite concerned about appearances and her next visit to the Mediterranean to a groveling drunk on high doses of Xanax.  A woman with no visible skills, no money and no idea of how to proceed, she's a train wreck.  You'll feel sorry for her by the end of the film.  While Blanchett's performance is sure to get Oscar's attention, the rest of the film bogs down much too often, going over some of the same territory.  While I thought Clay's performance was an eye opener, Louis C. K.'s as a married man having a brief fling with Ginger, wasn't.  Overall this is a film worth seeing, if for no other reason, Cate Blanchett's remarkable performance.reck.  You'll feel sorry for her by the end of the film.

B009AMAJVO|3.0|I had high hopes for this purported action/thriller that reunites Noomi Rapace with her director from the original \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" Niels Arden Oplev. That was one of my favorite films from 2009. Unfortunately the movie gets a bit stuck with a lack of cohesive dialog and with a convoluted shoot out ending that seems to contradict the feel of the movie up to that point.<br /><br />I had the sense that Oplev was trying to emulate the tone set by fellow Dane, Nicolas Winding Refn with his 2011 Move \\"Drive,\\" another movie I love. Here, Victor (Colin Farrell) is an immigrant from Hungary whose wife and young daughter were killed by Albanians hired by the local crime boss (Terrence Howard) on behalf of kingpin (Armand Assante). The reason? They wouldn't move out of an apartment building needed for \\"renovation.\\" Everyone thought Victor was killed as well, but he wasn't and he has vowed revenge. Evidently no one knew what he looked like.<br />So Victor has infiltrated the crime inner sanctum operating as one of the gun toting soldiers. He is slowly eliminating those responsible and has a big plan in place that would take those remaining in one fell swoop.<br /><br />Victor lives in a high rise whose balcony faces the balcony of a twin building many feet away. That apartment is occupied by Beatrice (Rapace) and her French mother, Valentine (Isabelle Huppert, \\"Amour\\"). Beatrice has been disfigured as the result of a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The driver got off with a light sentence and she's incensed to the point she wants him dead. Having seen Victor kill some dude in his apartment, she blackmails him into killing the drunk driver. Huh?<br /><br />Anyway, Beatrice and Victor make goo-goo eyes for most of the film but never take it anywhere. Again, I'm thinking about \\"Drive.\\" In addition to this dumb premise there are others. Neighborhood kids tease Beatrice, calling her a monster and throwing rocks at her. Huh? While she still has a few scars, she ain't that hideous, boys. The acting is fine. But the actors need something to work with and that is the problem. For an action-thriller, the movie is a bit short of both.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The film is flush with night time scenes both inside and in low light inside situations.  This seems to effect the visuals.  At times, distinction between shadings is a bit problematic.  I'm not saying this is unwatchable, but occasionally noticeable.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent, bordering on demo grade.  Several scenes inside club get the surrounds hopping, and of course the final shoot-out puts the viewer in the middle of it all.  Excellent .1 feeds to the subs enhances the sound as well.  Extras include 3 short documentaries about the making of the movie, to go along with some Sony trailers.  Subtitles are in Spanish and English SDH as well as English for some foreign language bits and pieces (Albanian/Hungarian).ain't that hideous, boys. The acting is fine.

I thought it was just me, so I asked several other co-workers to give it a try and each of them also stated it was too awkward and uncomfortable for them too.<br /><br />For me, the discomfort comes from having the base of my thumb (where thumb connects to palm of hand) constantly in contact with the back of the mouse.<br /><br />Was hoping that this mouse would help, unfortunately, it did not work for me.

B000ID1J5E|5.0|Filmed in various gorgeous western settings including Montana's Glacier National Park, THE RIVER WILD (1994) is a crime drama that plays out on a river with various rapids, hazards and eddies, plus a mile-and-a-half killer section that's so dangerous, rafters are no longer permitted to navigate it.<br /><br />These monstrous falls and rapids are at the convergence of three rivers, one of which is arctic cold. Anyone unfortunate enough to be thrown into the water while trying to buck the currents won't necessarily drown but will surely die of hypothermia.<br /><br />As the adventure begins, Tom  Hartman and Gail, his expert rafter wife, take young son Roarke on a river trip as a birthday present. They encounter three men who are also rafting. One's an expert guide, the others seem oddly out of place here. When next they meet, the guide is gone (he supposedly abandoned the others) and the two ask if they can tag along, because neither knows thing one about rafting and there's no way to walk out safely.<br /><br />Terry and especially Wade are creepy, possibly dangerous, and the couple decide to try to break away from them. This attempt fails, and this is where they learn the full extent of the danger they're in. Now captives of two robbers, one of whom (Wade) killed a man during the heist, they mustshoot the dangerous rapids with Wade and Terry or risk being murdered here and now. The Hartmans have one slim hope: Wade can't swim. Just maybe, if Gail can cause the raft to overturn before they reach the rapids, her family can get out of this alive.<br /><br />It's an exciting story that stars Meryl Streep and David Strathairn as Tom and Gail, Joseph Mazzello as their brave pre-teen son Roarke, Kevin Bacon as homicidal Wade, John C. Reilly as Terry, his none-too-bright cohort, and Benjamin Bratt as Ranger Johnny, a nice fellow who encounters the five at exactly the wrong moment.<br /><br />Features a spectacular final rafting sequence followed by yet more nail-biting action.

B00D3KWS9U|4.0|Back in 1979, we long-time Trekkers eagerly awaited the rebirth of our long-lamented, long-departed favorite sci-fi TV show, STAR TREK in a new, improved format: widescreen, Dolby stereo sound, and with the original cast reunited. What anticipation! It was such a thrill finally walking into that theater for what promised to be the motion picture event of a lifetime!<br /><br />Yet, where is there to go from such lofty expectations but into sub-warp drive? That's life after all, but who was thinking along those lines just then?<br /><br />Make no mistake: this very first Star Trek movie is S-L-O-W paced and the plot twist of a man mating with a computer almost embarrassing. Here, an antique space probe initially IDed as \\"V'ger\\" eventually gets it on with Commander Decker (Collins).<br /><br />As for the regular cast, Lt. Uhura looks chunkily middle-aged. CPO Janice Rand (formerly Ens.), who disappeared mid-way through Season #1 (whispers: Grace Lee got fired!), is just as mysteriously back and just as mysteriously irrelevant. Mark Lenard (Spock's daddy on TV) turns coat and is now a Klingon captain (nor shall we forget Lenard's 1966 Romulan commander gig). Misters Scott, Chekhov, Sulu and Nurse Chapel are still grousing on the script-line periphery while our golden trio, the ever-irascible Dr. Mc Coy, the always pedantic Mr. Spock and a nicely-preserved and spiffily-divotted Admiral (sweet promotion, but don't count on it forever!) James Tiberius Kirk rule the bridge, the ship, the movie and our hearts!<br /><br />If only for the Enterprise's \\"big three\\" STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is worth seeing again, so go for it, crewman!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.3) Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) - William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy/DeForest Kelley/James Doohan/George Takei/Majel Barrett/Walter Koenig/Nichelle Nichols/Persis Khambatta/Stephen Collins/Grace Lee Whitney/Mark Lenard

1451695195|5.0|This is truly a wonderful book. It is the story of certain death and then resurrection. Written by an MD neurosurgeon, it is his  personal experience with certain death, and then his physical and spiritual resurrection. His healing did not come through medical science but by a visit to the hereafter. Upon his return he came with an new insight into the meaning of life and how it should be lived and what science must eventually learn to be truly helpful. Well written both from a scientific and spiritual point of view, you will both be amazed and be inspired to see your life in a wholistic new way. Don't miss this real life drama and the inner knowledge it brings to the reader. It is a gripping story.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|This memoir starts out a lot more interesting than it ultimately turned out to be. The legal processes and some of the ways the women's prison system operates is interesting, and I'm sympathetic to the social commentary in the book, but even though Kerman's experience in the prison only lasted for a little over a year, it felt a bit lacking and could have used a little more detail. Admittedly, you get you more meat and not much fat out the book, so it has substance, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this, it somehow felt like it could have used a bit more padding. Still, a decent and worthwhile read.

(The show might jump 6 months between the beginning of an episode and the end, or it might only be an hour or two, but the next episode is several months later.<br /><br />It would have been much better if it had a single plot that carried through from beginning to end, like warehouse 13 a related, but much better produced show.

B0001I562I|4.0|There are several films that I remember watching countless times as a child -- \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" \\"Flight of Dragons,\\" \\"The Never Ending Story,\\" and this odd, underrated film.  There were a few scenes that always scared the bejeebers out of my younger self, but despite that I quite enjoyed the flick.  A great deal of the plot went right over my head as a child, but the film captivated me nonetheless.  What child wouldn't want to go flying around in a shiny UFO, with a sentient robot and a gaggle of weirdly adorable aliens for company?<br /><br />Now that I'm older and have had a chance to rewatch the film, I understand more of the plot -- and while I wouldn't rank it as high as other classic sci-fi and fantasy films of the '80s such as \\"Back to the Future\\" and the aforementioned \\"Never Ending Story,\\" it's still a fun flick that can appeal to both kids and adults.<br /><br />It's the late '70s, and young David is mostly preoccupied with training his awkward dog to be a champion Frisbee catcher and avoiding his annoying little brother.  But late one night as he's searching for said annoying brother, he falls into a ravine... and wakes up eight years later to discover that everyone and everything except him has aged during those missing years.  When a group of scientists discovers that not only has he not aged, but his brain contains starmaps and schematics that make him an invaluable asset, they threaten to keep him indefinitely.  Understandably freaked out by this, David escapes, chances up on a UFO that was captured around the same time he woke up, and climbs aboard.  There he befriends the ship's logical but curious computer system, Max, and when he discovers Max is responsible for his predicament, he helps the UFO escape and tries to return home.<br /><br />The concept of this movie, while it's been done before in literature (think of it as a futuristic Rip Van Winkle), is fairly unique to film, which adds to this film's charm.  It has a realism and earnestness to it that most modern sci-fi films lack, partly due to the strong performances by the various actors but also due to the realism of the special effects.  With CGI technology not quite up to par yet, this film works best when it relies on puppetry and animatronics to bring its alien characters to life, and both Max and the alien specimens aboard his ship are all the more believable and impressive for it.<br /><br />If I have a nitpick with this movie, it's with Max.  Voiced by Paul Reuben, better known as Pee-Wee Herman, he works best when he's his usual logical yet curious self.  But partway through the film, thanks to an accidental mind-meld with David, he becomes pretty much a robotic Pee-Wee, cracking obnoxious jokes and speaking with an annoying nasal voice that's just a deeper version of Pee-Wee's.  It's not enough to make me hate the film, but it does get grating enough to knock it down a star.<br /><br />All in all, despite the dated CGI and obnoxious Pee-Wee impersonation, this is an underrated classic of the '80s, and worth a look for sci-fi fans young and old.  Good for kids 8 and up.o it that most modern sci-fi films lack, partly due to the strong performances by the various actors but also due to the realism of the special effects.

B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Being a fan of the original terminator I decided to buy a few episodes and ended up purchasing all of them.  I found the show to be well written with a good story line and good acting.  The HD version is an added benefit while purchasing it instantly I will never have to go searching for a dvd.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Everyone should read these so that America has a clear understanding how much people hate us.  The misconception of who we are and what we stand for.

I met Joe P he's rude & unsociable. Steven I get he's charismatic lead singer etc. I would have loved to have seen interviews with the \\"band\\". Brad is a much better player than Joe. Tom adorable. Joey a machine & powerful player. Casey Tebo get your head out Steven & Joes Ass !
1451697686|5.0|I kind of defied the mantra of the book because I had it as a library book - GOOD - but I really wanted it to be easily picked up around the house to encourage us all to keep taking in the lessons and helpful advice, so I bought it, which is not exactly embracing a zero waste philosophy - the #1 word of which is \\"REFUSE\\"  - as a verb, not a noun!<br /><br />I loved this book. First of all, I could relate to the author. My starting point is not due to financial need and neither was hers. That's good. She CHOSE this approach for altruistic reasons and that's where my head is on the subject. I don't want a book that tells me how to make bird feeders out of plastic jugs - ugh. But I love learning how to make blush from cocoa powder, cinnamon and talc. I like that she makes me aware that recycling is just one piece of the puzzle and not even nearly the moist important piece. I love that she makes me define \\"away\\" - as in \\"just throw it away.\\" Where is AWAY? Very often, AWAY ends up being part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - a floating island (actually, there are two of them) of debris, in the ocean, measured in miles, not feet, composed greatly of plastics which are killing wildlife, especially sea creatures and birds.<br /><br />See: [...]<br /><br />Does she go over the top? Yes! I am nowhere near ready to compost my finger nails or use a natural wood toothbrush with natural bristle, so that it can be added to my compost bin. I'm more at the level of needing to start a compost bin! But it is fun to read about all her attempts. It seems she's thought of everything and I like that! It gets me to thinking too. Because of her, I now recycle the hair from my hairbrush bu tossing it out the window for the birds to use. I would have never thought of that on my own. She's got me thinking about buying pencils without erasers because they never wear out at the same rate AND because of that added piece of metal. Use a separate eraser. It sounds like such a tiny thing but part of our problem is that we don't really grasp the enormity of the world population and therefore the enormity of waste even when talking about small things.<br /><br />Here's another thing I like: she is not an absolutist. Some things she's tried and rejected as being too ridiculous. Other things she refuses to give up. I think that's a healthy attitude, especially if you really are trying to do everything you can. I am not in the least bit offended that she flies to Europe (to visit family as well as to enjoy life). She's so far ahead of most of the rest of us in not being wasteful, she deserves her flight ticket.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book. And remember the 5 R's - in this order: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot.t of our problem is that we don't really grasp the enormity of the world population and therefore the enormity of waste even when talking about small things.<br /><br />Here's another thing I like: she is not an absolutist.

B009LK6JS2|4.0|I love the simulator! It seems very realistic. I am using it to practice real flight maneuvers. I can do most of them but some, such as the hammerhead stall, is impossible due to the lack of rudders/ vertical stabilizers. This would also make an airbase takeoff more realistic because if you have to adjust while going down the runway, the last thing you want to do is bank. This is an overall great app and by far, the best mobile simulator on the market, but it needs rudder control. PLEASE LET RUDDER CONTROL BE IN THE NEXT UPDATE!!!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is on the top of the list of one of the best books I've read last year.  It was so good, that I continuted to read the other three books following Ender's game.  Of course, the other three books were nowhere near as good as the first book.  And I have yet to read all the other side books.  I'm looking forward to the movie coming out on Ender's Game, but it probably won't be as good as the book.

B00DFFHUUA|3.0|I wasn't a huge fan of G.I. Joe as a kid, and I did not like the previous film.  However, even a non-fan like myself has to admit the characters in the previous film and this one were nothing like the cartoon characters.  I mean, Cobra Commander doesn't have a very memorable voice in these films.  In the cartoon, his voice was annoying but very memorable.  I'm surprised they didn't stick to the cartoon voice for the fans.<br /><br />Okay, with that out of the way, here are some pros and cons.  First, the cons. The writing sucks.  The story is very simple, and it is not told well.  The previous film had some twists that made it a little more interesting, and since it was more of an origin story, I liked it more.  However, it, too, was a bad story with bad writing.  I did not expect good writing, though, so this is overlooked by me while watching most of the movie.  I just can't help but think the writers were undeserving of their jobs, because there are some extremely dumb plot devices in this film.  Also, the characters from the first film either did not show up or were killed off at the beginning of the film, so this series has no consistency as far as characters go.<br /><br />Now, the pros.  The film is action-packed.  There is a lot of high-flying, gun-toting action throughout the film.  That was the reason I bought it.  I like some of the action sequences.  Sure, the action scenes are poorly choreographed from time to time, and the ninjas aren't very stealthy, but it is fun to watch all the ridiculous action, anyway.  I mean, there are few films that actually offer this level of action.  Even The Expendables 2 left me wanting.  G.I. Joe: Retaliation simply gives me what I want and not much else.<br /><br />Overall, I give it a 3/5.  It is a terrible movie in all areas except action.  It doesn't hype the action, either, so unless you just want to see The Rock, sorry, I mean Dwayne Johnson, fake-fight a few times and see some ninjas running around with high-tech grappling hooks, this is not the movie for you.  You may actually enjoy the \\"Rise of Cobra\\" movie a little more.  I recommend renting it rather than buying it.grappling hooks, this is not the movie for you.

B00CUIVGZS|3.0|I've always loved Corea's electric piano playing and during the better days of fusion in the early 70's followed RTF with great pleasure (though I must admit I always thought Bill Connors a better fit than DiMeola) so as with the other giants of that period it's been interesting (but not always rewarding) following their careers over recent decades.<br /><br />Frankly I'm quite ambivalent about this album.The one truly strong point is the playing and the balance he provides, of Tim Garland.Corea does what he usually does,fine musicianship around fusion and latin flavours whilst the other musicians are all very competent and skilled..but somethings missing.<br /><br />I don't think Corea is alone in this, as many of the stars of fusion in the early seventies have found difficulty in finding direction and identity over recent decades..McLaughlin,Coryell to name but two.<br /><br />As I say it's ok..but frankly I've heard it all before and years ago.<br /><br />That said, I do love Garlands playing.

B004UAKAE2|5.0|How nice to watch the fist episode, of the first season, of the first show, that started America's love affair with British period dramas. I remember watching this with my mother when it was new; going back today, it's more enjoyable than ever. Downton Abbey is but a \\"wannabe\\" of what Upstairs Downstairs invented; it's not about the expensive wardrobe and scenery, it's the great characters and storylines. Thanks, Amazon, for letting us relive these fabulous shows! There's nothing more to say except: Watch This Show!<br /><br />Wait! - Yes, there is something else to say: Pauline Collins! Although she only appears in some episodes, her evolving character, Sarah, adds more excitement to the show than all the other characters put together. If you can't watch all episodes of Upstairs Downstairs, make sure you don't miss the ones featuring Pauline Collins as Sarah!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvel went a smart route and built up an audience bit by bit and movie by movie culminating in this film and dump trucks full of money. As far as Oscar winning film making? Absolutely not, but if you are looking for a fun movie that still works during replays then yes, it works for you. I saw it twice in the theater and this still holds up whenever I pop it in. The blu ray looks very nice and the extras continued to keep me interested. I didn't watch the DVD since I usually &#34;loan&#34; those to the relative/friend who never seem to return any they &#34;borrow&#34; so I can't really speak to the quality. It must be good because I still haven't gotten it back though.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|...to drowning in pure darkness.<br /><br />It's been six months since Debra murdered LaGuerta to save his brother. While Dexter is living the high life, free from all clouds of suspicion, Debra has quit the force and is now working as a bounty hunter.<br /><br />Dexter's concluding words in the last season, &#34;We all make up our own rules&#34; takes centre stage.<br /><br />With the one constant relationship, the one unconditional support in his life gone, Dexter's tenuous grip on familial support is gone. Dexter must step up to the plate lest his sister go off the deep end in more ways than a few.<br /><br />The dark secrets behind Harry's Code are revealed. Dexter is fleshed out in profound, minute detail.<br /><br />Perhaps the strongest component of this powerful finale are the sheer quantity of challenging moral dilemmas the characters and viewers are confronted with. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply finish by saying that there is more here than in a thousand introductory ethics classes.<br /><br />This final season takes a sharp U-turn from episode 7, and the final episodes are more adrenaline-pumping than a dozen back-to-back Formula One championships. This blu-ray collection makes the perfect bookend for any Dexter fan.

1936608898|3.0|There is tons of good information in this book.  However, it is a book of the hows and whys of a Paleo Diet, which excludes all dairy and grains. I don't buy Melissa Hartwig's explanations on these exclusions.  I have taken a common sense approach:  I have cut way back on wheat products, and now eat quinoa, wild rice, and sprouted grains bread in very limited quanities.  I also consume fermented dairy foods, such as yogurt, buttermilk, kefir. and cheese.  Naturally no sugar, no white flour products, fast food, or processed food. I eat fresh fruits and veggies from the farmer's market. I am doing some simple countertop ferments like pickles, beet kvass, and koumbacha. I eat organic eggs.  I know I should eat organic meat, but it is too damn expensive to do so all the time.

B00BB3UYS8|4.0|Outview (Inner Movement #1) by Brandt Legg<br /><br />Outview (Inner Movement #1) by Brandt Legg  is a story chock full of different supernatural concepts like astral traveling, reincarnation and people having psychic powers.  These concepts make this book a great fantasy page turner.  The book was well written and has great potential in becoming a strong series.<br /><br /> I enjoyed the strong bond between Nate and his brother Dustin.  Nate never gave up on his brother and loved him dearly.  Nate's friends were an asset to him and this book. Legg has written the book in such a way that grants the reader to delve into their own minds and picture what is happening in the story.  Legg allows the reader to investigate further about his topics by giving the reader the names of actual books that they can read to help them better understand the subject.<br /><br /> Outview grabs hold of you and makes you think about yourself, the universe and your place in it.  I really enjoyed the book and cannot wait to read the next in the series.  I found this book so thought provoking and enjoyed it more than I thought I would.<br /><br />This book should be put on your definite  pile of books to read.<br /><br />I did win this through Goodreads First Reads and have given an honest review.<br /><br />4 stars

B001K3KK0Q|3.0|It was okay for it's time, I guess.  The remake was much better.  This version of the famed book was a little slow in places and I found my self dozing off at times.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|people are crazy. the only suspcisous permission is the bookmarks but that makes sense when you see the ability to add links to your notes.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Got this for my wife for one of her Christmas stocking stuffers. She loved it. Great Holiday Classic! One of our \\"must\\" watch movies come Christmas time.
B008J34466|5.0|Great album to work out to, enjoy while driving anytime anywhere. Got this for myself, but, my teenage son stole it - GRRR
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This has some framework for a good story, but is in dire need of editing. This series is full of lazy word usage (get a thesaurus), numerous grammatical errors, and the mixing-up of characters names. Every relationship is rushed, with characters instantly falling in love with each other or deciding they hate someone and are now sworn enemies after only exchanging a glance. Characters remain flat, even by the 3rd book, which is when I could no longer keep reading. There is such heavy-handed foreshadowing that every \\"twist\\" could be seen coming by any child capable of reading.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most is that the author seems to just google names for the characters. For instance, the evil king of the neighboring country has a last name that's just a bastardized form of the protagonist's last name. This might be on purpose, but if so, again with the heavy-handed foreshadowing. Even more laughable, a woman was given the name 'Alistair', which is a male's name. After she told a male character this, he responded with \\"that's the most beautiful name I've ever heard.\\" I wanted to throw the book at the wall. But maybe this is foreshadowing too? Will she turn out to be a guy?<br /><br />To sum up, if the author learns how to flesh out his/her characters and make them multidimensional, if he/she takes more time to develop relationships between characters such that it seems believable, and gets a good editor to find and fix all the glaring errors that break immersion and frustrate the reader, this might actually be a good series. Then, this might deserve 3 or 4 stars, but as it stands, it only deserves 2.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|So far, this backpack has worked very well.  It's comfortable and fairly roomy.  I have a Canon digital body with lenses, (2) separate lenses, a flash, and a Canon film body in the main compartment.  Cables, charger, and other accessories fit easily in the other compartments.  I do like the fact that it doesn't say &#34;Canon&#34; or other photographic name, as that could offer a little protection against theft.

B00BY9GQHM|4.0|I like hidden object games and this is a fun game.  Sometimes it is hard to see because the screen is so small, but for the most part it is a good game and the mini-games are fun and not too hard.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|HAD FUN MAKING COMPARISONS OF THE MOVIE WITH THE ACTUAL WRITTEN STORY WITH MY CHILDREN... ACTUALLY MADE THEM WANT TO TRY & FIND THE BOOK,
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game.  It has a 1 minute version and a 5 minute version so if you don't have much time you can play a short game and the stationary camera mode is very challanging.  If you like Mahjong, you will like this game.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Very &#34;English&#34; characters. Older readers may enjoy this book more than the younger readers who might not be able to relate to the characters and their situation.
B00DCRE83S|2.0|As reasonable and predictable as this is, there's no escaping the fact that if it wasn't Jason Newsted, ex Metallica bass player (who seems to have emerged from hiding amid a deluge of press and self-promo, incidentally) nobody would care. As it stands, only a few people care...I'm not one of them.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a good story and the actual language of flowers is an interesting topic.  The characters were unusual.

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I got the Deluxe Edition. Its Includes 2 Card Board A7X Coins, Colored Booklet and a extra track \\"St.James\\" The Packaging is really cool, better than the standard edition. I WAS honestly going to send it due to me already having the standard edition signed by Avenged Sevenfold. I went to go see the on august 26 in Hollywood. So i decided to just fram the signed album and use my Deluxe One. The album itself is great. Its probably \\"Album of the Year\\"
1594132054|5.0|delivered quickly.  i got the large print edition -- it's a bit larger than I expected -- so the book is a bit thick.  Good purchase

0062255657|5.0|Do you like Neil Gaiman? If so just buy the book already. It's a wonderful read that will keep you turning pages until the end. Honestly the only thing I didn't like about the book was that it was to short. I wanted more, more I say.

006226303X|5.0|Have always enjoyed Gaiman's stories, but this one is lyric.  I ordered it on disk and was delighted to find that he read it himself.  Unlike many authors who choose to record their own books, he has an excellent voice and he captures the mood of the story perfectly.  If you haven't already read it, or even if you have, consider the recorded version.  Excellent!

B008GGA5EQ|5.0|Thurlow's work never ceases to amaze and surprise me. I always get deeply engaged in her stories, even when she writes about the type of sex that doesn't usually interest me--a testament to her skill as a storyteller and a seductress. Beautiful writing, well-developed characters and intriguing plots are three reasons why I keep coming back for more.<br /><br />Chloe Thurlow is gifted writer; a modern day Anais Nin. She weaves erotica into something that transcends sex.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot, that would spoil the fun, so here's a little tease: Girl Trade delves into the exotic world of tribal life and the sex trade. It's about reinventing yourself and taking an unflinching look at who you really are underneath all the artifice. Erotic love is explored on many different levels. It isn't meant as a road map to life, far from it. I see the story as a metaphor for how women have locked their sexual impulses away in a box for too long. We've been so busy trying to be good girls that we forgot to honor our primal instincts and our divine feminine.<br /><br />By reading the negative reviews, you'll gather that this book is not for everyone. But if you are a wild child, a sexual adventurer or a passionate soul, you will find something marvelous in Girl Trade. You might blush, laugh, cry or get turned on, but more importantly you'll learn something about yourself and that's the best reason of all to read it.
B000EXZI14|5.0|Love love love this CD.  What can I say great quality product, sound, appearance etc.  All my friends and family have had the pleasure to enjoy it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Having lived in rural Ireland around the time the 'contemporary' events in the book take place, I can attest to the authenticity of the author's perspective. And, as I attended a Catholic boarding school there, I fear the historical bits were not completely exaggerated - a little, perhaps, but that's dramatic license for you. I was very taken with this story, and I feel the author really put a great deal of heart into the telling. Well-written, characters believable and true to the time and place, engaging, heart-rending, and ultimately uplifting. Some reviewers have called the ending unbelievable or contrived, but I know of true events that parallel this tale. I would recommend to a reader who has some knowledge of rural Ireland - not the shamrock and leprechaun land, but the real country.
1594746036|4.0|I was amazed by how intriguing the storyline was. I was pulled right in and kept wanting to read more. However, I was left confused by the abrupt ending of the book. There was so much build-up in the details of the storyline that I wondered how it could end so brusquely. As the ending of the book approached, I thought, \\"Ok...there isn't much left of the book. How is this intricate story going to be wrapped up so quickly?\\" Sure enough, the book ended a bit anti-climatically for me. Perhaps there are plans for a sequel..? I hope that's the case. Otherwise, the author spent a whole lot of time writing this incredibly detailed and interesting story, only to end it in the middle of the most pivotal part. If there is no sequel, I must say that I'm a little disappointed. However, this was a very fun read and I am definitely glad that I had the chance to read it.<br /><br />Update: Ok...so I just found out that a sequel is coming out. This is good. The book still ended more abruptly than I was comfortable with. It cut out at the juiciest point. I guess this ensures that we'll be reading the next one, right? ;-)
1451695195|2.0|From a trained neurosurgeon, I was expecting a more nuanced story.  I have no doubt he believed that he really was &#34;in&#34; heaven a moment or two, and perhaps he was.  But to designate the inbetween steps or places with fanciful names as if they were real and discernable neighborhoods, brought a comic book aspect to an unknowable prospect.  &#34;Proof&#34; of Heaven should have been a tip-off.  Faith may be knowable, but it is not proveable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was told by many friends how much they enjoyed this series.  I am so glad I listened to them.  Such interesting character development.<br />I truly enjoy every episode.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Lately, there have been a lot of shows  using the device of twins borrowing identities. Perhaps it's a trend, perhaps it's just a fan fave, as Shakespeare himself went for it in Comedy of Errors and Twelfth Night. In any case, Orphan Black up the ante. Not twins or triplets, but human clones. And there are at least seven of them. Plus, it's better than last years duplicate thrillers: Ringer (as much as i'm a SMG fan) and The Lying Game (which is pretty good in a lightweight way).<br /><br />What is crazy impressive about Orphan is that Canadian actress Titiana Maslany (Shakespeare reference right there in her name!) manages to pull off wildly distinct personalities was incredible aplomb. I mean, seriously, you can just feel the different presence of these girls. You can even see quite effectively when one of them is pretending to be another. Watching uptight suburban mom Allison pretending to be punk Sarah is hilarious -- and effective.<br /><br />This show is Science Fiction, but the SF is confined to the clone thing and it's low budget too. There aren't a ton of effects. What there is, however, is very good writing, casting, acting, and pacing. It's a great show really. We can't know that the quality will survive into later seasons, but this one is break neck. The characters are sympathetic and interesting, and boy is she(s) put through the ringer (sorry SMG). The tone is simultaneously dark and comic, but always tense and unpredictable. There is one bit in the pilot where Sarah (playing Beth) is caught in an impossible situation. She goes to the bathroom to buy herself some time, then does something completely unexpected that actually works as a clever solution. This is very effective thriller plotting. It doesn't feel forced or overwrought but merely tense.<br /><br />Importantly, the complex central mystery is drooled out episode by episode, but it is drooled out. We find out quite a lot -- although hardly everything. The amount of reveal is very effective in this season, but could be problematic next year as they will not be able to depend on the same  dynamic. The show might not be able to depend on the clones even playing their normal lives (or each others).<br /><br />While Maslany steals the show. Many of the secondary actors are very solid as well. Jordan Gavaris as her (very) gay foster brother is a standout. He about says it all when he sits down at a piano and says, \\"let me show you a bit of Queen.\\" Kevin Hanchard is solid as cop twin Beth's partner.<br /><br />The show feels slightly schizophrenic with regard to its sexuality. At times, in some episodes (like the pilot), it's pleasantly steamy. Maslany does a good bit of walking around in underwear (always a plus). But this remains uneven, unpredictable. When two characters close we never know if the camera will linger or cut to morning. In a way, this keeps the viewer off balance. Deliberate thriller style or mere inconsistency? Who knows.<br /><br />Either way, the show is very much worth watching.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dreamhis season, but could be problematic next year as they will not be able to depend on the same  dynamic.

B00338QENI|5.0|The story of Henrietta Lacks is a compelling description of her life and her place in this world.  The author's storytelling was well rounded, unbiased, and personal.  A great read.
0425267695|4.0|Structurally, this book borrows heavily from The Name of The Wind. It opens with a box story about a famous military man and then slowly dolls out the (first) chapters of his long career, beginning with his schooling. Blood Song is well written, with solid practical prose that doesn't get in the way. There is none of the elegant and overwrought voice of the aforementioned Rothfus, or the descriptive nuance of Martin, but it's well written.<br /><br />Even though the scope is big, this is a more focused story than A Song of Ice and Fire or A Wheel of Time. We follow our single hero fairly tightly (even if his life meanders). Except for the occasional return to the frame story there are no other points of view. Al Sorna, our protagonist, rises within a kind of military-religious brotherhood perhaps most akin to the Knights Templar. The world building is very solid and the author clearly knows something about the late medieval period. There are several religions and nations and they clash in a fairly realistic way.<br /><br />The overall effect is one I'm still processing. I liked the book. A lot. It's one of the better epic fantasies I've read lately (and that is my favorite genre). The first third is great, during the youth and training of our hero. Some of the characters are excellent. My biggest problem is from about the 50-94% point. Here Al Sorna is commander of a big military expedition and the narrative became a little harder to follow. It's not that I couldn't tell what was going on from scene to scene, but they didn't fit together seamlessly. Unlike the earlier sequences, they also didn't seem to have the weight that I think the author was intending. There is similar stuff in The Name of The Wind (not so military), but it resonates much more emotionally in that novel.<br /><br />I'll explain what I mean. Al Sorna has this \\"unrequited love of his life\\" (just like Kvothe and Denna in TNOTW), but their interactions, while fine, lack the heavy sense of tragedy of Rothfus' superior novel. It's not bad, but it just comes off a little weak.<br /><br />The  end of the book is good. There are two big \\"fights.\\" But the sequencing felt a bit disconnected. And that's basically the thing with this novel. It needs editing. The parts are good, but the sum doesn't reach greatness.<br /><br />As an after-note, I'm a little mystified as to how this book has such incredible ratings on Amazon. At this writing: 1003 total, 863 5-star, 108 4-star, 22 3-star, 7 2-star, and 3 1-star. This is very very slanted toward 4-5 star. Now, it's got enough good stuff going for it to be a 4 star novel, and epic fantasy unfortunately is full of some serious duds. But an average of 4.8? This is higher than A Game of Thrones which is the best series start in the last 20 years. I can't help but wonder what weird factor is going on here.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening DreamRothfus' superior novel.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Just a joy to read and a great deal of fun, the photographs that punctuate this novel are a real treat, every new one a joy to discover. I rarely enjoy illustrations in a novel as they often conflict with my own imagination, but here it wouldn't be the same without them. Knowing these photos are real makes the extra special.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|t was with mixed feeling that I went off to Man of Steel. The trailer actually looked pretty cool, but this is a Zach Snyder film and I loathed 300 (way, way too poor a representation of that most awesome of historical battles), found Watchmen overblown, and was just plain blown by by Sucker Punch. Actually Sucker Punch fascinated me. It was both so bad and so intriguing at the same time -- plus the soundtrack rocks. The film just failed as a film.<br /><br />In any case, the Superman reboot. Some things I liked:<br /><br />The visuals and art direction. Boy does a lot of stuff explode.<br />The soundtrack. Sounds like Batman (not surprising, Hans Zimmer returns).<br />Henry Cavill is just about right as both Clark and Superman.<br />Amy Adams is cute as Lois.<br />Krypton and the Kryptonian technology. It looked cool. Somethings were silly - but it looked cool.<br />The impressive sense of power given to Superman and his opponents.<br />Some strong visual references to Superman II.<br />Russel crow leading Lois through the spaceship.<br />The fact that both dads were Robin Hood.<br /><br />Some things that sucked:<br /><br />Too many explosions. Not enough character development.<br />Superman's cheesy Kryptonian mom and even cheesier birth sequence.<br />A lot of the plot feels rushed and barely makes sense.<br />Everyone seemed very calm and well informed (they needed to be to make the plot work).<br />The extras (like the Daily Planet staff) = cheesy!<br />The whole tornado sequence. Fromage!<br />A lack of any dual identity antics.<br />The forced \\"Clarks gets a job\\" sequence at the end.<br />Michael Shannon as Zod. Lame. Lame. Lame.<br />Plot holes. Lots of plot holes.<br /><br />Fundamentally, Man of Steel tries too hard and takes itself too seriously. There is almost no sense of humor. It focuses on plot and background at the expense of character. What arc it attempts, Superman's deliberate act of choice of humanity over his (not highly appealing) Kryptonian comrades is hardly in doubt -- and forced at best. We are treated to numerous statements on the part of both fathers as to Clark becoming the \\"kind of man he should be.\\" Heavy handed to be sure. But still, they kinda, sorta, maybe worked, mostly I think because of the equally heavy handed but effective sound track and slow Synder-esque directorial style.<br /><br />I really did basically dig the whole Krypton thing and particularly the visuals of the home-world and tech. All that gray particle stuff I interpreted as nano-tech, but who knows what they had in mind. And what the hell with the dragon-fly dragons?<br /><br />Given that Superman is nigh on indestructible, the insane building smashing during the fights was kind of cool -- until the hundredth building. I mean they really punched through shit. Lots of CGI in this film, most shots. The battle between Superman and Zod was decent, although one does have to wonder given all this invincibility why and how one of them actually can be killed. It didn't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />There is no subtly to this film. The character driven mechanics of the 1978 Superman and sequel are missing entirely. Lois meets Superman as Superman, there is no Clark Kent reporter or secret identity, and hence one of the amusing/enjoyable things in secret identity superhero stories. This human drama has no room in this film of epic space battles and guys getting slapped through buildings. I can't understate this -- Kryptonians are punched through large solid structures at least 200 times in this film.<br /><br />Some questions:<br /><br />How do the new Kryptonians \\"powerup\\" so fast?<br />If Superman's dad was so worried about Zod choosing the bloodlines, how come he got to choose them himself?<br />Why is there only one copy of the codex? And while we are at it, why does it look like a plastic skull?<br />And #1: if you planet is dying, why do you \\"save\\" all the villains by tucking them away in a black hole?<br />Why do the masks/helmets of the bad guys keep fading in and out except to show who they are?<br />How can the energy drive of the 2 part teraforming machines link up? Some cross planet induction?<br />Why does Lois get to go on a military bombing mission?<br />How come everyone in Metropolis hangs out for so long when the killer alien squid of doom shows up?<br />I can understand how Superman really gets around, but it seems like Lois and the military dudes can teleport.<br />Why does even young kent have a magnetic attraction to disasters? (tornados, falling buses, exploding oil rigs)<br />Why doesn't Zod kidnap Superman's mom and use her as leverage?<br />Why does he explain all his plans? Wait -- he's a comic book villain.<br />Regardless, it's a watchable film, and certainly Snyder's best yet. It's just not a great film by any means, being about 95% style over substance. Isn't it obvious to these studio types that movies are really all about character? I guess not.<br /><br />And most amusingly, Man of Steel and The Last of Us (the latest Naughty Dog game) both came out on Friday. Apparently, LTOU grossed more!<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dreamelmets of the bad guys keep fading in and out except to show who they are?<br />How can the energy drive of the 2 part teraforming machines link up?

B0027MJU00|5.0|One of the best I've read.  I was absolutely fascinated from start to finish.  Great mystery.  I have recommended this book to all my friends.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It's terrible! It's a total rip off of dragonvale and it constantly crashes! It shut my kindle fire completely down and I had to get help to get it back on.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This one was marginally better by far than the other two. She takes scenes from The Thomas Crown Affair and mixes a lot of Eve and Roark from J.D. Robb In DEATH series but still a lot of hype for a book about sex with some dialog thrown in. Still not a very good writer but she is laughing all the way to the bank I'm sure.

0780619587|5.0|Based on a true biography of a father who instills a love of music (being especially partial to Rachmaninov) into his children, particularly his gifted son, David Helfgott. After David comes to America, a professor, realizing his virtuosos, develops an overarching ambition to do whatever it took to ensure his student reaching his full potential as a pianist. During this time, David is also beginning to manifest symptoms of a psychological disorder. The community, instead of being put off and rejecting him because of his disturbing, quirky or kooky behavior, embrace and show tremendous support and encouragement. A most touching story with musical performances that are an auditory delight throughout.

B008XKSW7M|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It's definitely a chick flick you would  watch with the girls but<br />there are scenes which the guys would enjoy.
B00BU18U82|5.0|My grand-son and great-grand-daughter love this game.  He is 13-she is 5 so it is good for a wide range of players.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzles are interesting and fun to play.  Wish they had more free ones.  The puzzle packs are a bit pricey.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Enjoyed Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman in this future apocalypse movie. I wish there was a more detail, but who knows maybe there's going to be sequel to answer all my questions.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|For my new Kindle Fire HD 7, this is a perfect fit. That is the Kindle Fire HD 7with nothing attacked to it, no case. The case is beautifully made and the two zippers operate perfectly.<br /><br />This is a snug fit, good for protecting the enclosed Kindle Fire. There is no room inside it for a case over the Kindle, and even some screen protectors might make a difference! This is my first tablet computer without its own keyboard, which means you control it with touch signals on the screen. So there's a lot for me to learn! I have a Kindle e=reader, but it has a keyboard and I haven't had any need for a screen protector for it. I love it and use it every day. So now, a new thing to explore!<br /><br />This case deserves a strong recommendation!

B00DHHWYAW|4.0|My favorite film of 2013, the severely underrated, The Great Gatsby finally arrives on Blu-ray 3D this week in a nice, full featured set.<br /><br />Movie<br /><br />I don't think I've ever read The Great Gatsby. I know it is required reading in a lot of High School English Lit classes, but I'm fairly certain, surprisingly enough, that I didn't take English Lit - not even in College (I took French and Spanish instead). Always the practical one, who knew that I'd end up being \\"forced\\" to read all the classics anyway?<br /><br />After a string of misfires (I hated Shutter Island and Inception) Leonardo DiCaprio returns to form. He is perfect as Gatsby. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. Gatsby is a complicated, yet simple man. His entire existence is his desire to get the girl, Daisy (Carey Mulligan) that he foolishly let go of.<br /><br />This is a role that was tailor made for DiCaprio. If DiCaprio wasn't already an A list mega star, this movie would have made him one. He just oozes off the screen and is simply radiant here (can I use the word radiant to talk about a guy?).<br /><br />In any other hands, Daisy could easily be hated and come across as shallow, naive, and as someone just going through life, but Mulligan brings a lot of hidden layers to Daisy. You can see the inner conflict through her expressive eyes.<br /><br />As wild and over the top as Moulin Rouge Director Baz Luhrmann usually is; The Great Gatsby is his most assured, straightforward, gimmick free (not counting 3D) film to date. From a pure story telling and directing standpoint it is by the numbers. There are very few scenes that made me feel like I took a bad acid trip. Even the party scenes are beautifully shot and framed here.<br /><br />Much has been written about the modern mixing of Hip Hop with 20's era Jazz and how it wouldn't work. Luhrmann actually did an amazing job of not overdoing the gimmick. Yes, it is noticeable, but he uses it very sparingly, so it never tookme out of the movie.<br /><br />There was one scene when they were on the bridge and they passed a car that had rich black people in and they were playing Jay-Z's Izzo (HOVA). It was odd and random just to have rich black people appear out of nowhere. I loved Luhrmann use of various versions Lana Del Rey's song Young and Beautiful in the love scenes. It really added texture and emotion to the romance.<br /><br />One of the most beautiful moments in the movie comes when Gatsby is lamenting everything that he's lost, and Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) says, \\"You can't repeat the past\\" and Gatsby responds with an earnest \\"Of course you can old sport,\\" such a simple but impactful moment.<br /><br />Generally, I'm not a fan of narration, but Maguire does an amazing job with the lyrical prose used in this movie. Maguire gives a mature, nuanced performance here where you can really see his love and infatuation for Gatsby grow while his distaste for his friend Tom Buchannan (a wonderfully evil Joel Edgerton) increases. At times it almost seemed as if Nick wanted to jump Gatsby's bones.<br /><br />This is my favorite film of 2013. It hit all my buttons - beautifully shot, very hopeful (but with an ultimately sad end), and had some flashes of brilliant prose.<br /><br />Video/Audio/Packaging<br /><br />This movie received a lot of flack because it was pulled from its original release date and delayed by 6 months so that Luhrmann could add 3D. I'm here to tell you the 3D really doesn't ad much to this film, yeah there is some good depth to it, but it seems like a gimmick and pretty pointless. I preferred the regular 2D Blu-ray version.<br /><br />The quality on the Blu-ray 3D is solid, if I'm looking directly at it, however if I lay down on my couch it become basically unwatchable. Lack of viewing angles is one of the drawbacks to using Passive 3D technology, but normally they aren't this off.<br /><br />In this day and age, can we get rid of letterboxing? Please? I have a large screen television for a reason; I don't want half my screen taken up with black bars. The Blu-ray 3D would have been more eye-popping if it used full screen. Other than the letterboxing issue, the transfer is almost flawless. There are a couple of scenes that purposefully has some grain to help establish the time period.<br /><br />At $29 (Amazon price) this is the most \\"expensive\\" Blu-ray 3D set that I've purchased all year and the packaging is cheap as heck. There are three discs and the Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D discs don't even have individual holders - just two discs slapped together.<br /><br />There's no artwork on the two Blu-ray disks, just Gatsby written on it in a fuggly font. Looks like some amateur bootleg disk, not a professional $30 Blu-ray 3D set. What was WHV thinking? Oh, I know, \\"We'll do a better job with an extended version in a few months.\\"<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />The Extras on this set are nicely laid out and contain a lot of solid information about every aspect of creating this movie. I kind of wish there was just one full length documentary (broken into individual featurettes), because it felt like I was hunting and pecking through the menu.<br /><br />It was weird that the Blu-ray 3D trailer is on the Blu-ray disc, but not the actual Blu-ray 3D itself. I mean what do I get out of seeing an ad for Blu-ray 3D in 2D?<br /><br />There is One Trailer for Gravity<br /><br />1926 The Great Gatsby Trailer (1 min, HD) - This long lost trailer is a fun look at the old silent film classic.<br /><br />Within and Without with Tobey Maguire (8 mins, HD) - Tobey Maguire brings his camera on set for some rare moments with Co-Stars and Director Baz Luhrmann<br /><br />The Swinging Sounds of Gatsby (12 Min, HD) - This feature looks at the amazing, eclectic score that blends the sound of Jazy-Z, Bryan Ferry and other contemporary artists with classic 20s era jazz<br /><br />The Jazz Age (15 Min, HD) - A nice, detailed look at the history of the Jazz Age and the parties that inspired it.<br /><br />Razzle Dazzle: The Fashion of the 20s (15, HD) - This is exactly what the title says, a look at the fashions of the 20s.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's Visual Poetry (7 min, HD) - Baz talks about the importance of using 3D for this film to create \\"poetic glu.\\"<br /><br />Gatsby Revealed (30 Min, HD) - This is essentially a 30 minute documentary (broken up into several pieces) that delves into various aspects of how various scenes were created and staged. Very well done.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - There are three deleted scenes, one of which includes an Alternate Ending. The Alternate ending is interesting because it shows Gatsby's father coming to pay his respects and there was a romance between Nick and Jordan that unfortunately got cut because Baz didn't have enough time to fully flesh it out.<br /><br />Digital UV Copy - After spending a lot of time complaining about UltraViolet and clutching onto iTunes, I'm now fully onboard and love the idea of it. When UV first started, my primary issue was all the various sign-ups and the fact that I could not play the digital files anywhere. In the last 8 months UV has become almost as ubiquitous as Netflix.I can get UV through Vudu, CinemaNow and Flixter and all those apps are available on every connected device (TVs, Blu-ray Players, Game Consoles) I have.As much as I love iTunes, it annoys me that I had to buy two Apple TVs just to watch my digital copies on my TV.<br /><br />With that said, I hate having a fractured digital library - I have 300 UVs and 100 iTunes now, so I wish studios would provide both UV and iTunes copies. It is also annoying that Digital Copies don't include the extra features and that services like Vudu sell bonus materials separately and that iTunes Extras don't even work on Apple TV.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This movie is the ultimate love story about a man that would and did do everything he could to gain back what he lost. Having never read the book, I can't comment on what has been changed but it is a movie that everyone should enjoy. This Blu-ray 3D package is disappointing, I'm not sure what I expected, but I wanted more than was delivered. Even so, it is hard to be mad when I love this movie as much as I do. The sloppy packaging, the outrageous price and the annoying letterboxing are the only things holding this back from an A+.<br /><br />Grades<br /><br />Movie - A+<br />Video - B+<br />Audio - B+<br />Extras - C<br /><br />Final Overall Grade - B+
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I loved the Gwynyth Paltrow version so was reluctant to spend any time on another version, but this was amazing. Johnny Lee Miller IS Mr. Knightley and Romola Garai was fantastic as Emma. Obviously this one is much truer to the book since they have more time. Everything about it is top notch.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I have not tried much with it yet, but it looks alright.  Take a picture and change the effects and image.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I wasn't expecting much as this movie got panned but it exceeded my low expectations. Wasn't that bad. I like sci-fi and special effects if they are done well and I enjoyed this movie. Wasn't great but wasn't bad.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I like the color scheme and the game animations.  It is a good solid checkers app.  if you don't have one this would be a good one to get.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent book, riveting and hard to put down. You get a really good inside story of how the mission was put together and the personal thoughts behind the men who had to handle this dangerous situation.

B009GX69RK|5.0|Schmidt IS the king! (Max Greenfield)<br />Nick's character made so much progress since the first season.<br />Zooey Deschanel's lovable ' breaking for birds' attitude carries on too<br />Will watch it over and over!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|great game. love the many levels and graphics. The story line is great too. I will be purchasing the full version.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well-written psychological thriller. Scary to contemplate the extent determined, demented minds will go to manipulate others in order to achieve their goals.  People like that do exist.  It is difficult to imagine any other suitable ending so that worked for me.  Marriage takes a lot of work and perhaps the most difficult challenge is trying to understand what a spouse is thinking and feeling, when he or she fails to communicate.  This novel supports the notion that women are more dominant than men and shows how codependent marriage couples can become without them even realizing it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I wasn't sure about buying this book at first but as you read it gets harder to put down as you progress through the chapters. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the 80's, video games, and some of the best 80's movies ever. THIS BOOK WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This is a phenomenally-good movie, don't get me wrong. It is witty, charming, and heartbreakingly beautiful in a very raw sort of way. It is just not a feel good rom com, so if that's what you're looking for, you may want to look elsewhere. Despite a few funny moments, it deals with some very intense subjects such as mental illness and death. It's definately worth watching, if for no other reason to have a deeper understanding and compassion for folks in real life struggling with mental issues and pain. And it balances thoses issues respectfully, intriguingly, and realistically; but if you're looking for a lighthearted escape, this just isn't it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is fantastic! Except for when it freezes up. Or doesn't save your progress. It also has connection errors frequently, but that may be just me and not the server.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I read the reviews and thought it would be a good game. But I could never get it to work.
159562015X|5.0|Strengths Finder 2.0 has been very helpful to me. I find it so nice to finally look at my strengths instead of looking at my weaknesses that I have to build on. Looking at my strengths and building upon those can help me in many facets of my life.
B00503BN1M|3.0|We like the actors in the film but the story was not great. It is worth seeing once. Not one we would buy.
B00CE0ZY46|4.0|Thought the series is very funny and clean, the characters appearance changed slightly from the first season, the first season characters looked better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lots of action couldn't put the book down but not sure how I feel about the end. Overall good read.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Start to finish, this is a winner. Her voice is stunning, the music is enthralling. I love everything she does, and this is one of my favorites.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love it but every once in a while,the game automatically deletes my scores.  Besides that it's a great game.
B00867GKIK|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie when I saw it in theaters. I'm so glad I get to enjoy it in 3d at home.
B0002XMKYE|5.0|This magnificent movie is one of my favourites. It is difficult not to fall in love with General Patton. But be careful. It just may be George C. Scott's performance which enamoured you.<br /><br />The account of Patton's record during World War 11 is taken from memoirs of himself, Gen. Omar Bradley and German records. This is the one general the Germans stood in awe of: the one general they feared. When the Germans were burning records and making a retreat during the end of the war, one of them, burning his picture, called Patton the pure warrior, whom the absence of war would kill. Within the next year, Patton was dead, dying from an accident after having come through the war unscathed.<br /><br />Patton was a lot of things. One thing he was not was political. He didn't know how to keep his mouth shut. He said and did disturbing things, getting in hot water continually with Ike (Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower). He couldn't get away with anything, since he made such good copy, the reporters were always after him.<br /><br />He slapped a soldier and declared him a coward who was shell-shocked (or whatever the modern term is) and whose nerves were totally gone. For that, Ike made him apologize to the soldier, units of soldiers, and the hospital staff. But did he do it on their level? He did not. He stood on a balcony above them, looking down on them. Had he been on the same level, it might have been more effective.<br /><br />He stormed across Europe to Berlin, marching his soldiers 24 hours to relieve the Battle of the Bulge soldiers, then on to Berlin. But still, he couldn't stay his mouth or stay out of trouble. In an interview with reporters, he was asked about leaving Nazis in key positions. He said that they knew how to keep the water works and electricity working. In response to one question, he said that Nazis had joined the party in the same way that American Republicans or Democrats had done. It was in response to a trick question, and he fell for it.<br /><br />He also wanted to kick the Russians in the behind and send them back where they belonged. He told Ike he had the troops and begged to be able to do it. Given the cold war that developed for years and years, Patton was right.<br /><br />But he was politically incorrect. He suffered for it. The Americans got rid of him. In a well-balanced scene, it showed Field Marshall Montgomery of Britain being received by the King of England to be honoured with the country's highest award. The scene switches to that of Patton leaving his post and shaking the hands of every one of his staff.<br /><br />It is heart-rending, but let's keep in mind that Patton's boss (Ike) was looking, even then, towards the presidency. He couldn't afford to have such a politically incorrect general who made such good copy for reporters. So Ike got rid of him.<br /><br />However, it is also possible that, as the Germans predicted, this greatest of warriors had outlived his time and that the absence of war killed him.<br /><br />Patton was a deeply religious man. My favourite scene is when he was on his way to relieve the Battle of the Bulge warriors. It had snowed deeply for days and air cover was needed. Patton sends for the chaplain. He tells him he wants &#34;a weather prayer.&#34; He assures the chaplain that he, Patton, is on such good terms with the Almighty, that if the prayer is offered, the next day will be clear for air cover. Then he says: &#34;I expect that prayer within the hour.&#34;<br /><br />The next day was clear. And that was Patton.>He also wanted to kick the Russians in the behind and send them back where they belonged. He told Ike he had the troops and begged to be able to do it.

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I'm on pins & needles waiting for the Blu-Ray/DVD version to come out on September 10. My family is gone for a week, and I have lots of extra time NOW (it's still August). What to do? Amazon Instant Video to the rescue! I'm now watching \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" on my big-screen laptop, yay!!!<br /><br />Make sure you spend a few extra dollars and get the HD version, if your device supports it (most do now). Plus, you get both versions anyway, when you purchase the HD.<br /><br />And be careful when you place your order. Amazon makes ordering via Instant Video so easy, that it's also easy to make mistakes. I accidentally ordered the Standard Def version. The Amazon customer service rep I contacted wasn't too keen on fixing that for me, since I have called about some similar mistakes I've made in the past. But he did so reluctantly \\"this time.\\" Orders placed to Amazon Instant Video are non-refundable, non-exchangeable, and non-correctable.<br /><br />PS - Am editing this review. Just finished watching and had tears in my eyes! Btw, I'm a Trekker from the 60s...
0312641893|4.0|Keeping in mind that this is a young adult book I, as a 27 year old college student, nevertheless was entranced by it. Yes the writing and plot transparency leaves a lot to be desired. But this book is definitely worth sticking out to make it to Scarlet, where Meyer's writing improves dramatically. If you would enjoy a gritty but PG sci-fi reboot of classic Disney tales, then I recommend this series.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Do not like it I think it is stupid it is not a good game a kid should not play it it is not good for kids
0062238868|1.0|This book glorifies war and open season of \\"brown people\\" no wonder the rest of the world is developing such a low opinion of America.  I don't think you would see the same style book about WW1 or WW2.

B00DHHWYAW|4.0|Personally I loved the movie, and I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's stylistic choices, but that doesn't seem to be the case with everyone. You'll either hate it or you'll love it. Tobey Maguire really does give a great performance, and Leonardo DiCaprio is great in the role.<br /><br />As far the presentation of the box goes, it is the typical cardboard slider on top of the Bluray box that has lenticular printing on the front. It has most of the characters, while I think the other presentations only have Leo on them. What I found odd was that when I opened the box one of the disks was loose and there are only two places to put the disks in but there are 3 disks. I assumed since they are thinner than normally, two would fit on the same side.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love Minecraft. I wish that the Kindle version let you do more. I cannot make red dye. Farming is not possible. No seeds. No grass. Lots more work to be done.  It is fun but please add stuff.
B000IKQMFO|4.0|After having seen all three available seasons of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;, I found this to be its poorer cousin. Good, very good in fact, but just not excellent. This, however, is a review for &#34;Gosford Park&#34;, and not &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;. I found the characters lacking in richness and warmth, although the costumes and period accessories were brilliantly accomplished. Personally, if I were choosing something for myself, and had &#34;Gosford Park&#34; and &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; to choose from, I would select &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; for hours of entertainment.

B00005N9CV|4.0|\\"Live From Rio\\" from Netflicks came to love this lady. I have all of her studio Cd's up to this CD. Her first 2 Cd's are really good. Her next three are masterpieces, in particular my favorite \\"When I look into Your Eyes.\\" If I may use a reference from another genre, Up until \\"Quite Nights\\" she was Beatlesque. \\"Girl in the Room\\" was like a Lennon solo album, and this CD could be compared to a post Wings McCartney solo venture.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Gave it a perfect 5 stars, very visual, very deep! if you like this type of movie I suggest The Matrix Trilogy, and also Inception and A beautiful Mind.  Never mind the trolls, they all have way too much time on their hands and thus go around to every positive review that exists all so they can spew their brain vomit to everyone who has a differing opinion.  Thats why there is an ignore list (come at me trolls, it needs to grow!)  at any rate, if you like good action, cute girls, a deep plot, and an awesome soundtrack, this is the movie for you!

B00A7KKPDK|5.0|A cousin of mine recently posted a photo of this book on her Instagram account with the caption, \\"I don't usually like to read but this book is awesome! Made someone like me finish it in three days. It'll make you smile, I promise.\\" When my sister, who is also not a reader, asked me to look for this book, I knew it had to be good.<br /><br />Seriously... I'm Kidding by Ellen Degeneres is like watching Ellen's talk show, only it's on paper. What struck me from the very first page is how, as you read along, you can actually hear Ellen talking. And for a writer, where tone and voice is so important, that just goes to show that Ellen's voice is so, so strong (which got me to thinking about my own voice as a writer and what it sounds like, but that's probably something for another blog post). That distinct voice is actually the key to really enjoying the book, because you find yourself imagining Ellen telling the story to you in that cheeky way of hers. The punctuation (or lack thereof) also makes all the difference when she tells a story.<br /><br />The book is filled with little anecdotes, random musings, and as Ellen herself puts it in her note for the reader, \\"I decided to include a little something for everyone in this book. You're going to find some short stories for adults, coloring pages for kids, and many things for all ages in between.\\" What I love is that in the middle of all the humor --and there is a LOT, since it's Ellen-- there are also many nuggets of wisdom.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of Ellen to enjoy this book. It's easy to read, light and humorous, but still has enough wisdom to make it worth your time and money. The title itself, Seriously... I'm Kidding, encapsulates this very balance. So I found myself laughing while reading, at the same time thinking, \\"Wow, Ellen makes a lot of sense!\\"<br /><br />Try to grab a copy of this book, if you can. It's the perfect way to destress after a long day. After all, laughter is the best medicine!<br /><br />(This review can also be found on my blog: [...]

B00C7E3EFU|5.0|I won't bother with a plot synopsis,I'll just concentrate on the remastering job done on this movie.In a word SUPERB.Dean Cundey has done a truly fantastic job here.To this reviewers eyes and ears,The Fog has never looked or sounded so good.Throw away any other versions you have of this great film,and purchase this version.It really is that good.Can't wait for the 35th anniversary of Halloween after watching this.<br />Check out the Shout Factory versions of Halloween 3 and They Live as well.I hope you people can one day do a job on Escape from New York,which would really benefit from a decent HD transfer.Keep up the good work!

B004N76NOI|1.0|This was a horrible film. It had two of my favorite people in it so I watched it, but this film was not worth my time. I kept hoping it would be worth it, but it kept getting worse and worse.<br /><br />I liked seeing my two favorite people but not what they did. The acting was okay, but not believable. The storyline could have been better, and all in all, it could have been better.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH, is a WASTE of time!!!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|If you like the type of movies with love, danger, excitement and discovery of ones self, this movie is for you.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|I had a friend staying over so we could leave out very early in the morning to go to the hospital for her upcoming surgery.  I gave her my alarm clock but needed one for myself because I didn't want to change the time on my husband's alarm clock.  I remembered my daughter saying that she uses her Kindle to get her up to get the kids off to school.  I looked it up and found this one for free....it is an awesome app.
B004X75RK4|5.0|So many great lines to quote, and very funny. Reynolds and Bullock definitely are superb in this movie. Their acting is flawless, they never skip a beat, definitely slow well together, and have amazing chemistry. They are amazing, and this story is fantastic. They could not have found a better two, to make this work.<br /><br />FABULOUS, and Highly recommend this movie to anyone, who is looking to laugh and have a good time.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This child has played this game since she was three.  I keep looking for new versions for her.  She is amazing and I love to watch how her little mind works.
B0086700CM|3.0|Do not know, because I have not used this product at all. I am sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|I don't care for this.  It wasn't quite what I was looking for.  It might be alright for someone else.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|The movie was a little slow and did have some good action. Travolta was a little strange in his role. Overall worth the rental fee.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am one of those suckers who is horribly addicted to these books.  I blew through the first one and now the second one.  I am on the third with no sign of stopping.  Love it (got the Kindle addition) and I take it everywhere I go :)
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|Okay...I don't really understand why some people aren't \\"satisfied\\" with this CD, but I love this CD!!! Ever since it started streaming for free on Amazon I've been listening to it everyday. It's a fun CD to listen to. Just give it a chance and you won't be disappointed! The more you listen to it the more you'll love it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Though the book itself drags a little I love the trilogy.  Bought the kindle version and couldn't be happier :)
B00EHAIHWM|5.0|Okay...I don't really understand why some people aren't \\"satisfied\\" with this CD, but I love this CD!!!

B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|My 3 year old step-son absolutely loves this movie.  Seller was timely and reasonably priced.  Very pleased with my purchase :)
B005FMZWD8|1.0|I bought it for my nephew who lives abroad I sent it to him gusse what?it is without battery!!!!what a shame?and a cheat? I feel disgusting about it because first they say it is free file very from the USA and then at the check out they charged me delivery plus custom charges and then we have a watch without battery<br />I wonder how will my nephew will find a suitable battery for it and how much it will cost him<br />You disgusted me amazon.com,you cheat,terrible
B001D57C0C|5.0|I found this group due to a random youtube video for Angels and liked it enough to search for other songs by this group. The lead singer has an amazing voice and she is backed by a very competent band. This album flows together nicely and before you know it the album has finished playing.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|great app and it works brilliant, This app works so well with my galaxy S3  just take a photo and it's uploaded to keep it safe there and then very happy with it.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|Angels and a Shot in the Dark were my favorites before buying this album and now I have a host of other songs that make it into my playlist regularly. This is a nice upbeat companion to Silent Force and I highly recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Brilliant app, and it works a treat so happy with it and I would recommend it to anyone, i'ts very good
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Ninety-five percent of the time I just felt apathy.  Every time I got to one of the far too many Queen Cersei chapters I had to convince myself to slog through it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I use feedly in my Kindle Fire HD, and it is able to show all my feeds and organize most in a beautiful magazine like screen. However, it is significantly slow to open the articles and perform operations, and does not support pasting a link on the search textbox.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Good quality on Sony Wii and iPhone.<br />This movie is hilarious. Can't wait for the second one!<br />It is highly recommended.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have read many \\"junk food\\" books as I call them lately, a book that keeps you engrossed but doesn't tax the brain . I haven't been impressed with any up until this one! The author has a way of pin pointing feelings everyone has,or thoughts everyone thins and puts them into words. Every character is developed so you feel like you know them. I can't wait to read more from this author!
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|A very historically accurate portrayal of WWII conditions for the Jewish People that is based on a true story.  The plot is not only based on reality, but it is also superbly acted out.
0307730700|5.0|Another book about an amazing, complicated human being who defies human limitations.  What an amazing life and family. Well written!
B00E25RD68|4.0|I have found that real life oftentimes is more bizarre than what the movies can deliver, sad but true, so who is to say this could not happen. What is good about this movie is the use of the camera at times. The scene where the antagonist is piecing together his memory of what may have led to his situation is well done. We watched the entire movie. It engaged us immediately and kept us interested despite some very uncomfortable scenes. A few twists in the story as well kept us interested. We watch a wide variety of things, including anime, so we are used to some of the extreme things in some Asian films.<br /> The stereotype of the trained fighter/martial arts guy with Right-on-his-side coupled with his anger and determination allowing him to take out a group of large men and leave them on the ground as he exits is perhaps used a few too many times. But hey, I sit through James Bond causing all women to swoon and that is just part of watching movies- suspending disbelief.<br />  There is much violence, sex, foul language and the story line and premise are a bit unbelievable. The sex and violence also serve the story line but still, it is uncomfortable.<br /> As an aside, I feel very sorry for South Korea because nowhere have I seen worse wall paper. Yeah, I know American movies don't show the grit of life as much as they should but the grit of South Korea in this movie means I will never put it on my \\"want to visit\\" list.<br />  If you like to see movies that are different and do a few things even if not all things well, then watch this one. We watched the subtitled one and someone said the dubbed version comes off as too comedic.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large numbers for us old folks and does everything I need it to do! Great product and the price is right.
B003QS67F0|3.0|We expected this to be better because of the quality of the stars and the director's other movies. However, something was just not quite as finished and tidy as other Nolan movies. There was a bit of a surprise at the end but my son had it figured out, not us. I think that better editing might have helped the story flow better and might have helped us be more invested in the characters. It was well acted but somehow I never got invested.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|Anyone who was a late teen to 20-something in the early 80s will see and feel a lot of familiarity in the movie.  Lots of stories going on together.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|The story moves and has impact at every step of the evolution. Edward Norton is excellent in acting and narration. One should not think too hard about how some things occur or mesh but rather just go with the story. There is some foreshadowing but you only realize it afterwards. It would be fun to see the movie a second time just for that.<br />  You might contemplate manhood, ordinary life, consumerism, what's missing, cults, motivations, your lousy day to day existence and job, all sorts of things, but at the end the movie is not a downer, at least not for me, but I am a stay-at-home mom/upper middle class community volunteer. My business husband and my movie/literature/anime/classics/science buff teen college student found it very worthy of discussion and watching as well.<br />  Everyone should see this movie. You need it as a reference.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you love living and breathing you should read this book.  A true American Classic, even before the HBO series.  If you love any sort of genre this book is great for you.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|Enjoyed the story, but it is not truly memorable. However.It's good science fiction. A bit disappointing after seeing the Twilight series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Touching, moving, emotional, and funny. I really enjoyed this book and it was a fast read. Definitely read it with a box of Kleenex nearby.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I now have a more complete understanding of one of my favorite performers.......Keith Richards! He is quite the interesting man.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wow, I really do like this media playing alot,<br />worked really good right out of the box.<br />I will be telling all of<br />my friends about it.
B00756GRUE|4.0|I have no issues with the watch itself.  It is quite striking. The watch band doesn't thrill me however.  I've adjusted it as large as it goes and it just fits.  There were no extra links provided and my wrists aren't huge so some wearers may have problems if their wrists are larger than mine.
B005LAII44|3.0|While I absolutely hated the first G. I. Joe, I definitely think this is an improvement.  However, I'm still not sold on it.  It just seemed to lack the punch.  Didn't find the characters very interesting at all.  While I did buy it, intending to watch it again, it' not something I can give a 5 star rating to.  Sorry.
B004LROUNG|1.0|No Grisham is great literature, but this one is so predictable, formulaic and banal that you have to wonder if he had a gambling debt to pay.  Skip &#34;The Litigators;&#34; it's like cheap, waxy chocolate--no treat, and indigestible.
B008JFUO36|4.0|Very good movie even though I'm not a big sci-fi fan.  I particularly enjoyed the love story, the surprise twists and turns, and the ending left me wanting more.  Glad I added it to my collection and I will definitely be watching it over again.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Great read, fascinating stories of how checklists were developed and refined to save lives. I would recommend to anyone for personal or professional development. Put your ego aside.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory is masterful in her ability to write about history and entertain at the same time.  She drew me in early on and I have been a fan of hers ever since.  I pre-ordered this book because I didn't want to miss out and she met my expectations once again.  If you're a Philippa Gregory fan you won't want to miss out on this either!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Please, change the description of this App, it says \\"Designed for Kindle Fire\\". Nope, not working! Maybe change one day.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I was disappointed with the ending of this book because all the chapters leading to it were vivid and representative of Adichie's consciousness in the politics of love and the plights of ABs/NABs. The writing is so very well done, I expected the ending would be more substantial. The last line is perfection, however.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game but recently all I am doing is taking care of sick people &amp; animals &amp; repairing buildings!  Some of the time is okay but it is getting to the point where I don't want to play anymore.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Sad that it is over. Please give us more levels soon! Only had to cheat a couple times. Really Fun!
B000F8O35U|5.0|My grandson is obsessed with this movie! He is mesmerized when he watches it!  As is the rest of the family. Its such a great story!
B000YDAYHC|5.0|These boots are great and fit comfortably. I bought them a size smaller then my dress shoes/running shoes and they fit perfect.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I would recommend this game to all ages . Fast and funny characters to choose from. Can improve your adventure over  and over again !
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. Super easy and quite nostalgic.  Definitely glad I picked it up. Get it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This a fun way to exercise your brain. You will find that the more difficult the game is, the more you will want to play.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Sweeeet game. Pretty cool. 20 words? Okay um the game is addicting and I really like playing it when I'm bored or when I can't sleep.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|I think I saw this movie at least 3x when I was a kid in the fifties....What really interested me was the leeches, the hotbox and Alec Guiness.  This time around I loved the personalities and the positions the characters took under pressure such as opposition to the war, worried about being shamed, leadership and moral values as well as getting the job done under lots of pressure. Bravo!
0440246318|1.0|I completely agree with \\"Reacher Creature\\" on this one. In addition to the faults he mentions, I would add that the plot is a complete mess; it's difficult to even understand what's happening, but even if you did, it would give you no pleasure whatsoever.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is a great read. Its content might be disparaging to some, but the book caries a great message and is an excellent piece of literature (and soon to be a movie)!
B004ADH1RI|1.0|Heard it was good. Wasn't. I can't even imagine this being remotely good back in the day. Indiana Jones ripoff is probably the nicest thing I can say about it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love minions and temple run/subway surfers you`ll love this game!!!!!!! Also you should watch both movies if you haven`t already, the game has different places to run based off of the movies.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I really enjoyed this and the other cut the rope games!  I am extremely impressed with the creativity of the creators!
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|I am biased. I really love the way Rick Riordan writes! It is FUN to read. Helps that I like classical history and myths too, I guess. A fun read, and all together, yeah!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It works like all calculators but on my Kindle Fire it's huge.  Numbers and symbols are big and clear. If you know anyone who would benefit from a big display this is the calculator for them.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The plot twists are great, storyline very engaging, but why, oh why did it have to end this way? Sigh; now what?
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game offers almost an endless variety of Mahjong games, backgrounds, etc. Really enjoy it! Would highly recommend for Mahjong lovers.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice game could be better but still a good way to kill time works fine on HTC one no issues
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I was so impressed with the graphics! I loved the game playing and the progression through the different levels. I was disappointed when I completed them all.  I do plan to play again, because I think it will be just as challenging next time. Highly recommend.
B004C03L4G|5.0|Everyday I can find an answer with their advises, What I read everyday on this pages move my heart and my soul deeply. I want to be better and better.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Cute action movie with a great cast & lots of twists to keep you interested. I love the cast combination
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I have never played the game, and I will say I had to watch this a few times to get even an idea of what it was about. That being said. One of my favorite movies ever, and I watch a TON! Master Chief, one of the best characters ever. To make this at $10m or less (from what I've read), is just amazing! I've easily watched it about 20 plus times, and just bought the Blu-Ray...can't wait to see it on that.<br /><br />That being said....Star Trek (new and old, though like the new best), Star Wars, Goonies, Avengers. Fan of those....so compare my comments to them.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Too many characters, too much going on, all of it interesting but leaves the reader wondering whose story is this book really about?  No sooner have you begun to care about a character then they are relegated to minor mentions; the characters that turn out to be most important are the ones you have not had a chance to really care about.  Dare I say the plot was predictable, too?  Not a BAD book, but not a GOOD one.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Blackberry Smoke is just an awesome band!  Love it! My favorite is &#34;Whippoorwill'...she sang my song and called me by name...
B000FVE3AC|1.0|Update (as of 12/8/13) I purchased two Invicta watches in July 2013 & within six months both of them have broken (both had a secondhand or small arm brake off). It's been over three months since I sent the first one in to be repaired & I still don't have it back yet. DON'T PURCHASE AN INVICTA IF YOU EXPECT ANY DURAIBILITY AT ALL!!!<br /><br />This is a beautiful watch, but it is some of the cheapest quality material and workmanship I've ever seen. I was barely outside the 30 day return window when I clipped the corner of a wall with this watch as I was trying to squeeze through a doorway. The level of contact that the watch made with the wall was minimal and certainly not something that would warrant causing any sort of damage to a normal watch. However, when I looked at the watch a couple hours later the secondhand had simply fallen off and was rolling around the watch face.<br /><br />Then, only a couple days later I woke up in the middle of the night with my watch laying in my bed. One of the little pegs holding the band to the watch had simply fallen off as I was sleeping - please tell me how it is possible that I exerted anywhere near the pressure needed to break a metal band while I was sleeping! I tried to snap the piece back on and it seemed to be secure, but this happened again several nights later.<br /><br />In summary, this cheap watch has showed just how poorly it was constructed two different times within 60 days of my purchase. And now I have to pay $28 to Invicta to have this cheap-ass watch put back together after having it for less than two months. Don't buy this watch if you expect it to last at all!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a fun read. Don't listen to the bad reviews about her writing style. I read this book for pleasure not to critique her writing style, grammar, and technique.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game because you can do what you want. i thing you should get it it has so much things to do like multiplayer and get this app for the game its block launcher
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have this one and Oregon Trail Settlers. In this game you never run out of energy like on the OTS. You van quickly build up your energy and your village. Keeps you busy for hours.
B004WR125O|5.0|I didn't want to take the hard wired connection from my XBoX 360 so I thought I would give this a try...Works great and price right too!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great cast, great story, great special effects! I'm 43 and when I watch this it makes me feel like a kid again!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find myself playing it all of the time. I don't get anything done anymore. It is so much fun!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I've enjoyed Avenged Sevenfold's albums for at least the past five years and I can confidently say that I am a huge fan. I love their metalcore era, it contained perhaps some of the rawest metal that was on the market at the time with some tight riffs and epic melodies. Then City of Evil came around and introduced a more heavy metal oriented band without screamed vocals and more reliant on musical excellence. This continued through their self-titled record and Nightmare, both which are amazing records in their own rights. I choose to review an album based on it's own merit which is what I will do, I will most likely have to compare it to classic metal legends like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Old-Metallica, and Guns N' Roses because that is what this album envelopes. I will just throw that out there right now, I know I'm contradicting myself but it's inevitable. Hail to the King if one of the finest straight-forward metal records I've heard in a long time. From the bands I listed above, Hail to the King is a combination of The Black Album, Use Your Illusion II, Screaming For Vengeance, and Somewhere in Time. This record is tremendous and is perhaps my favorite record by AX7 but only time well tell for that statement is fickle in its' own right. Here's a song by song review, some track picks, etc.<br /><br />1. \\"Shepherd of Fire\\" 10/10 - Has a tingle of For Whom the Bell Tolls and Enter Sandman but the rawness of Avenged Sevenfold. This opening is tremendous with the inclusion of brass instruments and large to create this epic atmosphere. The song itself introduces a very simplistic drum beat but when done correctly, simplicity is perhaps the most original idea that a band can have. This song displays the potential of this record and basically lays down the foundation for the rest of the record.<br /><br />2. \\"Hail to the King\\" 9.5/10 - The intro riff is so reminiscent of an Iron Maiden song, it's incredible how this record just soars back through time with the intention of introducing an old style with a new sound. This song is the first single, I was fairly impressed with the direction when I first heard it and since then, I've been constantly listening to it. The chorus, my god, replace it with Bruce Dickinson's vocals and you got Iron Maiden. The guitar solo is quite impressive as well.<br /><br />3. \\"Doing Time\\" 9/10 - Is that Guns N' Roses, sounds like it. What a great song, one of the more upbeat songs on the record, it also has this great scream by M. Shadows. It's a very simple song, very straight-forward, the shortest track on the record. It carries so much weight and energy in three minutes, love this song.<br /><br />4. \\"This Means War\\" 10/10 - Sounds like The Black Album, it's 'sad but true'. The riffs are very groovy, so much to love about this song. I absolutely love the composition, it's so simple but so brilliant. It follows a normal song pattern but the addition and subtractions of instruments help to create this epic feeling when the chorus finally arrives. M. Shadows vocals are very powerful on this track and I particularly love the guitar solo on this track. One of my favorites off the record.<br /><br />5. \\"Requiem\\" 10/10 - Some Latin choir chants, some darker guitar tones, and a very groovy beat. This track is absolutely filthy, awesome song. M. Shadows' vocals are so powerful in the 'chorus', the lyrics are very interesting, it's just a great track. The guitar solo sounds like something Kirk Hammett would play except better. Awesome song!<br /><br />6. \\"Crimson Day\\" 10.5/10 - Time for a ballad, reminds me of Metallica power ballads except with much better vocals. This is a beautiful track, the vocals are really the highlight with some beautiful harmonies. The addition of some violins really pulls on the heart strings and not to mention the epic-beautiful guitar solo. One of my favorites!<br /><br />7. \\"Heretic\\" 8.8/10 - This song is very interesting, I wasn't incredibly impressed with it at first because the riff was almost too simple but when I listened to it again, I respected that riff and what it stood for. I hear so many classic bands in this song, it's such a great song. Surprisingly, it might be the weakest track on the entire record but that means absolutely nothing because it's an awesome song. The guitar absolutely raises this song though, it's quite impressive.<br /><br />8. \\"Coming Home\\" 11/10 - This song is literally enveloping Iron Maiden, it's such an amazing mix of music, vocals, and production. The double guitar riffing is very intense, it has a thrashy like verse, it can even be something that Megadeth wrote in their hey-day. The chorus is absolutely the catchiest on the record, amazing song. One of the best, if not the best!<br /><br />9. \\"Planets\\" 10/10 - Another impressive track, this track and Coming Home are perhaps the heaviest tracks on the record but they still carry such a great classic vibe. M. Shadows' vocals are so strong on this track, it's nice to hear some double bass as well. Love the riffs in this song, I can't say anymore cause I'm running out of adjectives.<br /><br />10. \\"Acid Rain\\" 10.5/10 - A ballad as the last song, a piano the reigns throughout the song, it's quite beautiful. I love some orchestra with my Avenged Sevenfold. The guitar solos are very bluesy, very lovely additions to the song. The chorus displays some great vocal strength from M. Shadows, it's one epic song. A great closing song to an incredible album.<br /><br />I highly recommend this record to anybody who respects music, loves Avenged Sevenfold, and loves classic metal. This record is perhaps the most nostalgic piece of art I've heard since I heard The Darkness' new record. This is going to be on repeat for months. What a tremendous accomplishment! Buy it!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|What it does it does well,it's just that it does not do enough; just Netflix and YouTube apps and mirroring what's on my Mac

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fabulous book truly touching it definitely deserves five stars for the quality of writing and details. The gruesome details of Pi's survival really bonded with me I could not put this book down

B005WBBYXO|4.0|Great read overall. First two books were very well written, action packed page turners. Third book was good, but not the quality of the first two.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I recommend that you begin with just one suite and gradually increase to more.  I . began at four and never won, so I went back to one, when I began winning consistently, I moved up to two- I  win often enough to keep me coming  back
0743497465|3.0|This is a summer book in the sense it's easy to read, pleasantly distracting and leaves nothing on the palate or in the mind once done.<br /><br />Dan Brown, successful as he is, just isn't a great writer.  He like to tell instead of show.  He likes to spoon feed his audience, unable to resist the urge to explain the concept behind what a character just said or did.  He likes to create what I call false drama, ending a chapter with a line like, \\"Little did he know it would be the last vision of his short life,\\" and then apply the brakes with a drier, sometimes unnecessary chapter.  He loves \\"quotations.\\"  Brown does do his research, but it rarely feels truly synthesized into a story. It can feel like reading someone who piled up his Google research and dumped it into a couple pages to elicit the feel of secret knowledge.<br /><br />Deception Point is fun.  Hardly mysterious in its road map, but fun.  The only problem I had - other than Brown's style - was the dogged insistence that NASA is the wedge that divides the country.  It's not really even a point of contention with so many other urgent national matters.  But the drama that unfolds around that premise is interesting, albeit ridiculous at times.<br /><br />One minor point.  Dan Brown uses sharks as one of his villains in this story.  That's fine, except he got their science and behavior almost completely wrong.  That made me wonder about the other \\"science\\" he presented in the story.  If you have a well exercised suspension of disbelief, this won't bother you.<br /><br />There's nothing really wrong about Deception Point.  There's just nothing really right with it, either.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Riding on the coat tales of the Twilight movies Stephanie Meyer got lucky and had The Host made into a movie.<br />What a waste. The book was so interesting it could have been a very good movie.<br />Saoirse and Diane were talents were wasted in this movie. It could not be saved.<br />It was as bad as the Twilight Saga, its a shame. Don't waste the money, although if you enjoy syfy, read the book, I'm sure its<br />cheap on Amazon.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this is bs. need the real candy crush. come on amazon...you're better than this..who agrees with me? tired of playing from my phone
1616550414|4.0|If you have any doubts about Hyrule, Zelda or Link, this is your guide.<br /><br />Beautifull toons.<br /><br />I recommend to all Zelda fans.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Tue game is cute, fun and even enjoyable  for my pre-schooler. The premise is so simple and fun to figure out the different way to achieve the win.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I was happy with the game. Some things were easy but fun. Until on one level a piece that i needed was traped behind the tab on my kindle fire HD that has the home and back buttons in it. So saddfully i was unable to continue.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy playing this app together and it is much cheaper than buying her a real horse.  We love the competitions!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|with so many parallels to my own life...& wonderful, whimsical lifelong insights...i have taken this story to heart & will follow in the path to live life honestly & to the fullest...
B00957T6X6|5.0|that anything as hyped as GoT could actually be good writing. But, being bored one evening, I downloaded the Kindle sample.<br /><br />First, the sample is H_U_G_E!! I've read entire novels that weren't as long! So kudos to whoever had the guts to share as much on spec.<br /><br />Second, they didn't really need much in the way of guts to share, just realistic confidence in the strength of the material - which is quite good. Martin is such a good write that some of his short, simple, descriptive sentences will 'literally' transport to the place. You will just simply find yourself there. This happened to me on several occasions & so ...<br /><br />... I was sold. Here - take my money!!<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I'm finding this story completely engrossing & I highly recommend it.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I am beyond amazed at this CD!! Everything, and every little bit about it, is beautiful!! There are a few sad songs that will break your heart, and then there's plenty of hardcore songs to go around that everyone loves so much about FFDP :) So glad I preordered it its so much better than I expected it to be. A must buy.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Wanted to get flash onto my Kindle Fire HD and downloaded this along with dolphin browser and flash.  It works just as advertised and quite happy with it.  Would recommend it friends.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|The problem is not so much with the movie making but with the underlying story itself, which is of course unrealistic (being of fantasy genre), but also pointless and boring. I had heard so many claim that the movie is about God. Well, well, well... God must be the ultimate fallback position. When a  story makes no sense at any other level, just say it is about God and there are enough mushy minds in the world that you will find some agreeing with you.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It works as advertised.  I downloaded it in order to print from my Kindle Fire HD, which after a bit of work is works just fine.  Have installed it on another person's tablet at their request, it works just fine for them as well.  Good product.  Would recommend it to friends.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I very much enjoyed Downton Abbey, and I began to feel the characters were people I knew, just like when I read a good book.  In addition, Toronto, Canada, has a comedy, mystery, dinner, theater where Uptown Abbey is the featured event.  The play was outstanding, and was hysterical.  The characters very much mirrored the characters of Downton Abbey.
0688014291|2.0|As this book is so famous I was really expecting a breakthrough lecture but I find it extremely superficial and do not really believe that the mentioend principles can be like they are explained nowadays implemented .
0385345054|5.0|I love paper arts and either dabble or dive into them depending on my schedule, need to indulge, budget, etc, and I've been committing a greater-than-average amount of time into paper arts booka for the last year. I've got a bookcase of some really cute books, some informative, and some works or art that I will never master.  This book has it all, and then some. Photos, text, templates, bound in a really thick book. Not the usual craft book.<br /><br />There is a section devoted to the \\"examples\\" they have made for clients, all 75 flowers are magical.  The next section describes the materials used to make paper flowers. The fact that they don't force any brand is a plus, if you aren't new to paper arts, you already have most of the materials, except, perhaps, for the stems and centers. The skills section is vital unless you are an expert in creating paper flowers. It is really useful that they have picture and text intermixed and that they break down flowers to their smallest parts. (center, stamen, stem, petal, etc) Each technique is introduced \\"contextually\\". So many helpful images of action and steps. Different means of shaping for different paper and a focus on creating rounded, organic forms. Because that is what nature is, correct? Organic, rounded flowers, no matter what colors you use are going to look amazingly real, just like all of the examples in the book, over something straight, flat, and fake. There is none of that in this guide. Not in the images or the writing, or even their style, it is really natural, beautiful and likeable.<br /><br />The how-to section gives you just that for each one of those 75 flowers, broken down to their visual individual parts, and marks the skill level of each one. They are using a scale, of 1,2 or 3,; 1(basic techniques) to 3 (advanced techniques). The authors are so kind as to give us some advice as how someone with a solid 2 level skill could modify a 3 flower project to their strengths, which I find especially helpful, and give you a rubric for mastery at each level. This is something more \\"high-level\\" crafters need to include in their guides; not just beginner techniques, not just advanced techniques or looks, but what does the spectrum look like, what does it include? How can I take a project that is too advanced and target it towards my level (What to remove in the flower? What to add to make the project look good, help me improve skills, but not look like my 3rd grader did it?)<br /><br />After the how-tos, as the other reviewers have stated, there are pages of templates to the shapes used for the flower - well over 200. They include a good source guide. One warning to the paper newbie, some of this paper and related materials can be extremely expensive. You can go through and find the materials that work for you and your project(s) at any price point with the variety of resources the authors include.<br /><br />This will be THE paper (handmade) flower book for the year, if not years. What an excellent job this couple has done on their first book (she was an style director at Martha Stewart Weddings and they run a design business), I look forward to seeing more from them!, and give you a rubric for mastery at each level.

B00DLKXF3A|3.0|Ive been a metal fan for more than 21 years. I couldnt wait for this album and now that ive heard it I just want to know if it was made purposely to pay homage to Metallica and other bands or is just a rip off of them?  This is not to say the album is bad, its not...its just that ive been listening to this in one form or another since 1991.  There are hints of enter sandman and various GNR songs but the most blatent example is This Means War which is nearly bar for bar with Sad But True.  Again, i like the album but it would help if I knew i was listening to a tribute rather than a copy of music others have already made.<br />For those that get angry about this review... Read all the others, its an issue when almost everyone mentions the fact that it sounds like the same band rather than the band that made the album.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|Worst non ending to a book I ever have read. Thought some chapters must not have been downloaded until I went back and read other reviews. First book I have read that I feel like I want my money and time back.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Great animations and great 3d effects.  Even parents will enjoy watching this one.  Good movie to have on hand when you need<br />to keep the kids entertained when family and friends stop over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show!! The costumes, the settings and the acting really pulled me into the show.  Nothing is predictable in this show, which really holds my interest.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Purchased for my husband who is a HUGE JT fan. Sadly, he was not impressed with this CD. Wish we could have listened to the whole cd before making the purchase. Few ok songs but not worth buying.
6304884419|5.0|A Bronx Tale is well written, well acted, it is funny, touching, thought provoking, happy, sad...it has everything.  It's one of my all-time favorite movies.  Love it!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Purchased for my husband. Great CD. Very pleased with the purchase. It's always in the disk changer in the car.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|While lying in a hospital bed in Royal Oak, MI I spoke to the daughter of Glenn Jackson, also known in the book as \\"Rocket Man.\\" His family were friends and Church members in Holland (NL) 30 years ago. Never knowing about this adventure then, or since leading up to my hospital stay, I was re-connected with Glenn's oldest daughter Cheryl Jackson Dorsey on face book just weeks before my admittance. Cheryl had assumed that I knew of the story that I hope you will read. What made it more thrilling to me was that I actually knew Glenn just after all of this happened. The strange thing is that I knew nothing of what had happened. I have become very close friends with Cheryl, who filled me in on many sidebar incidents, which were not put in the book. After reading the whole story and catching it on an old NBC TV Mini Series on YOUTUBE, I was astonish that I had been friends with a man and his family who meant so much to me as a 22 year old Airman stationed in the Netherlands back in 1980 through 1982, not knowing what a dangerous adventure they had all been through just prior to me meeting them. Thirty years was a long time to catch up with this story, but it's been worth it. I thoroughly recommend this book for those who appreciate how the author captured the true thoughts of the people involved and the dangers they faced. Mr. Ross Perot and Col. Arthur \\"Bull\\" Simons deserve the lion's share of recognition for saving the lives of many of the Americans talked about in this book. Although no less can be said for those on both the \\"Dirty Team\\" to make a jail break for two innocent men, and those who risked their lives on the \\"Clean Team.\\" When most in the State Department, President Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger and other U.S. officials clucked their tongues and did virtually nothing to help in this against all odds story, it was gratifying and up lifting to read about ordinary businessmen coming together to perform a task that was anything but ordinary. A great read all around.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I went in with no expectations for this show.  Yeah there's pretty boys and pretty girls and apparently Beacon Hill has something in the water where there are only pretty people allowed in the town.  But the plot it okay.  The acting needs help but it's a good just set your brain aside for an hour and just enjoy the fun of it all.  No one is winning Oscars.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I saw this movie as a child and remembered how hilarious it was; you have to pay attention to catch everything that is going on...just a great and funny movie!
0316228583|3.0|This one was just okay, nothing fantastic. I enjoyed how the story flowed smoothly from one character to the next, rather than jumping around like a lot of books do to follow each character's story line. The transitions were natural and made reading comfortable. That being said, I felt the book had a very slow start. I was disappointed when I reached the halfway point and we were still talking about the same man's death. Then we jump forward to the end and everything happens all at once. The events naturally needed to happen to end the story, I just wish they were spread out a little, I felt like I was being rushed out of the story by the end of it. It also seemed as though JK has lined the ending up to make a sequel, which bugged me a little with the open ended-ness of the different characters' happenings. All in all I'm disappointed I bought it full price and won't read it again HOWEVER, I probably would pick up a second if it turns into a series.
0345803485|1.0|It is amazing that a person can \\"earn\\" 95 million dollars by writing pornography. However, perhaps not so unbelievable given the reading and viewing preferences of many of today's consumers in a world glutted with perverse sexuality and behaviors.<br /><br />Consider these words before indulging in this type of debauchery: \\"Set your mind and hearts upon the things above, not on earthly things of your nature: such as sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed which is all idolatry...Rather, put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. Therefore, as God's beloved people, holy and dearly loved for whom His Son suffered and died, clothe yourself in Him -  Christ Jesus! St. Paul<br /><br />As Jesus stated if you conceive of adultery, fornication and sensual perversity in your mind and heart so have you committed these actions in your person and have therefore convicted yourself.<br /><br />If you want true gratification and beauty in your life choose the true way to life in Christ who loves you without condition - Perversity and sexual desire outside of the God-given gift of marriage will never fill your heart or your desires because this is not love - only more emptiness that is never satiated.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing a little bloody but still amazing. I just love all of the detail. I recommend this book to everyone I know. Confident stop reading heading on to the third one now
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun!! for some reason I can only play when I'm connected to the Internet so no fun at the park.. :(
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|For starters was not only this movie amazing but had 3 of the best actors and 2 that are hot!!! This has a lot of action, comedy ,drama and surprises to it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I loved le miserable when I saw it at a local high school production I went to on a date with my ex boyfriend. So of coarse I had to buy it for him as a present to remember that night and watch it over and over. We both loved the voices of the singers in this movie and the passion they showed. It is such a great show this is a must buy DVD.
B00D8H3Q2G|5.0|Wow, this SACD is sonically stunning.  It's a hybrid SACD/CD, but I haven't played the CD layer yet.  This version has some nice touches, including floating bits of dialogue from the movie.  What surprised me after so many years is just how aesthetically beautiful and moving Vangelis' music can also be.  In this case, it has a hauntingly human, emotional feel to it that certainly must've added to the movie's theme of blurring the lines between human and android.<br /><br />Sonically, standout parts of this version of the soundtrack are the wide soundstage and subterranean bass.  If you play this through speakers that have good bass response down to the mid-20's HZ, you will feel the bass as well as hear it.<br /><br />Overall, I am very glad I picked up this SACD and have listened to it several times within the first few days of receiving it.  It is worth the extra money to get it on SACD if you have an SACD player.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Buy it and thank me later. This movie was so funny I just had to buy it to be able to watch it over and over. I love musicals and this movie is perfect.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just as easy - if not easier - as &#34;pinning&#34; on the computer.  Much nicer to have the Kindle on my lap at night before bed than the laptop.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Got this cd to add to my collection. I love josh and his amazing voice. Cd came fast, no damage. Listened to it right away. This is a must buy.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I decided to rent this simply because I love Morgan Freeman, and think Tom Cruise, despite...well, I don't have that much space...is a fantastic actor.  I didn't really remember much from the television promo's so I viewed the trailer.  It still did not look familiar (trying to remember if I had seen it before) so I rented it.  That was the best $4.99 I have ever spent on a movie rental I do believe.  It's hard to refrain from recapitulating the fine points made in most of the preceding reviews for they all share my amazement of this film.  It is almost completely original; yes we've seen the post-apocalyptic rebirth of earth and its meek survivors before, but this differs from those, I believe, because that is not the story-line.  It acts as supporting role to the main plot/theme - that being the power of human spirit, sacrifice, strategic defiance, and determination.  The action was fantastic.  When the drones go flying through the underground headquarters spinning, flying, and firing in all directions at high speeds, well, I have to admit I was on the edge of my seat brimmed with fervent anticipation, wonder, and bedazzlement!<br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a pulse; or rather, NOT to those with weak pulses!  Spectacularly visionaired (apologies for the flagrant use of poetic-license)with vibrant setting, a staccatic yet perfectly blended score, and an apparent limitless budget...in the words of John Hammond, they \\"spared no expense.\\"  I rarely purchase movies as I normally don't watch them over and over again.  In order for me to do so, its got to be somewhat of a classic like, ironically, Shawshank Redemption (the irony being that Morgan Freeman obviously is in both...hmmm, can irony be obvious? Squirrel! Sorry for the Attention Deficit Disorder!), the GREAT Resident Evil, Back To the Future, or the before-allusioned-to Jurassic Park series, etc.  But I can promise you I will be purchasing a Blu-Ray copy of this one.<br />In summary:  GET IT!
B00B19GKI0|4.0|First it has a lot of good actors, Kurt Russel, Ernest Borgnine, Lee VanCleef etc.. Then there is a lot of &#34;old time&#34; action. Many &#34;Special Effects&#34;, but the actors carried the movie, not the special effects, not like the action movies of today where the &#34;FX&#34; carry the movie. Call me &#34;old fashion&#34;, but then I am old!!! Loved it for the fifth time. Good actors, good screen play, well done. What more could I say!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam puts difficult content into easily understood principles and even gives step by step ways of testing her hypotheses. If you found The Secret difficult to put into practice, this is the book for you.
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|After reading the other reviews, I double checked and sure enough, I found that the packaging had been tampered with before my action figure arrived. The bottom portion of the clamshell had been opened & partially crushed, then taped back together.<br /><br />However the merchandise arrived intact and complete with all the accessories.  I won't resell so no harm done I guess...<br /><br />NOTE: Did not purchase this from Amazon!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|you can see why mes janet is in the top 10<br />money earning writters . six more words are required to have this officially
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Surprisingly better than I thought it would be.  Oblivion is well crafted and gives us an interesting look into a not so perfect world.  Unlike many of the films in this category Oblivion held my interest throughout.  Well not a major Cruise follower I thought he did well in playing an all too familiar roll in science fiction films.  I liked the storyline and the relationships both within his 'home' base and the outside world where is works.  The special effects were really well done and the environments where we discovered each step along the main characters journey with him were wonderful and kept my interest.<br />Morgan Freeman is of course Morgan which is fine but his character's story was short and too predictable for me.  There were a few unforeseen left turns in the story which worked but the ending was pretty much a Hollywood ending.  I liked it and recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction whether your a Tom Cruise fan or not.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|just what is needed. Another sitcom of misguided teens. Maybe it is better in later episoded but I did not make it past 10 minutes of first episode. I needed to change water in the fish tank or wash the car or something important.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The film over all is incredible from the cast to the special effects and story.  Denzel's performance of an addicts life was beyond anything I've seen in the past.  The opening scene grabs you and carries you until the end.  6 stars for Denzel.  I also loved John Goodman who nailed his role as the &#34;pharmaceutical friend&#34;.  He must have laughed at how much meat there was in this role which is relatively short in the film.  Well done John.<br />The strength in casting also was something that held the film together seamlessly.  There is not a weak character in the cast and you feel for them and sometimes feel nothing for them.  I'd see this one again which is very rare for me.<br />Thanks for a great Flight...
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Game was cool should have more harder stages and new things om nom should have some sort og a partner or somthing like that
0920236162|5.0|Our family has had this book for years.  As a grandma, I've read it to the grandsons to show them that they need to have manners and be greatful for things that are done for them...especially if a young lady is involved.  I've read it to the granddaughters to show them that girls can be strong and accomplish whatever they want and desire to do, but most importantly, they should require the respect they deserve from boys.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Keeps you busy and has very enjoyable graphics.  Absorbing.  Lots of fun. Has a lot of options so you won't get bored.
1550379151|5.0|This anniversary book was written and illustrated to hold the interest of everyone, even small children.  It proves that when a person has a talent, they can make themselves happy and enrich the lives of many others by sharing it.  Wonderful for children and adults.

B000VK99Z6|5.0|The Wright, Pegg, Frost team are so great at film-making that parodies a genre, while still paying tribute to it. This might be the funniest of the Cornetto Trilogy.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very complicated in a good way. Just wish it had a &quot;hint&quot; or &quot;clue&quot; option. Just when you think you're getting good at it you get stumped.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great app. Hard enough for me and fun enough for my cousin. Super addicting.  Never gets boring. I could play it for hours. Works a lot better then Dragon story.I
1927628091|5.0|I am listening to this book on my daily commute, this is the first time I ever wished my commute was longer!!! I will not go into the plot details as others have covered them in detail, I will just say you owe it to yourself to read (or listen) to this book!  The Audible book has a great narrator who is perfect for the book. If you like Asimov or Heinlein you will love this boook!!!!  Plus, I do not recall when I have laughed so hard listening to a book. You cannot go wrong with this one!!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Okay, but very confusing and hard to get past certain points. I f you can it's great. If not it gets soooooo boring. Try it. You maybe one of the people who get it.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I'm only doing this so I can have 15 coins,but while I'm here...<br />It is a good guessing game,but it could be easier to get coins by having a watch a video then get 10coins or something like that.Thank you!
B0023RSZZU|5.0|I love the book! I read it as a school assignment and I then had to have the book for myself! They are also coming out with a movie so I am elated! This book pulls at the strings of your heart and I plan on reading many more times.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|It is very rare I actually give my opinions on films, I never summarize the plots or give opinions on acting, and almost never buy a Blu Ray without having seen the movie first in one form or another.  I usually only review the quality of the Blu Ray itself as transferred from Standard Def.  Today, I make an exception.  Yes, I heard all the negative remarks, but I am very capable of forming my own opinions without the influence of others.  So, IMHO, this is not a Die Hard film as we have come to know them, but an action film more in the vein of those horrid Transformers films.  Previous Die Hard movies had a great degree of personality in John McClain's character, and strong and visible antagonists who challenged him every step of the way.  This film has neither and has only the slightest hint of a storyline in that Bruce comes to Russia to save his son, who is now a secret CIA operative in battle with a Russian big wig.  That's it.  The entirety of the film is one huge cacophony of stunt work and CGI.  I was very disappointed and think they should have stolen Sly Stallone's movie title and called it 'Die Hard, Over the Top'.  Never the less, my take on the Video and Audio Quality.<br /><br />VIDEO...<br />  Surprised that such a new film on Blu Ray would have this much grain in its image.  Especially against gray backgrounds, the grain crawls to annoyance.  There is a slight bleach bypass to the color grading and a definite crushing of the blacks to maximize the dreariness of the American view of Russia.  With the blacks being crushed as they are, there is also a loss of fine detail.  A smoothing out of skin features also removes the details there, and in some scenes, the characters almost appeared cartoonish.  With a Mbps rate that is relatively high in the low thirties, I was surprised at the comparatively poor video reproduction.  Yes, you can get used to it, and I did.  But why should you have to in the first place?  2.5-3 stars.<br /><br />AUDIO...<br />  We should be thrilled that not only is the audio codec a lossless DTS HD but that you can have it in a 7.1 configuration as well as a 5.1.  I wish more films offered a 7.1 mix but understand that most viewers have a 5.1 surround system at best.<br /> The problem with the audio however is that the mix makes for a cacophony of noise.  Yes, there is a great deal of discreet panning and directionality from all the home theater surrounds, but the overload of noise takes away from the directionality by so immersing the listener that the audio is hard to follow.  As one who would take pristine audio over video any day and loves a great directional mix, I am amazed that I am even saying this.  On a positive note, the LFE channel will earn all the money you spent on it and, I can say, that some scenes actually offer DEMO worthy audio to show off your system with. 4 stars.<br /><br />EXTRAS...You do get the disc on Standard Def as well as a digital copy and you also have the choice between the theatrical release and extended cut.  I based this review upon the extended cut.  Other extras are deleted scenes, trailers, commentaries and other short docs I have not yet viewed.<br /><br />I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in determining your possible future purchase.  All my Blu Ray reviews focus solely upon the quality of the video and audio.  All except this one that is.<br />Thanks for reading.hould be thrilled that not only is the audio codec a lossless DTS HD but that you can have it in a 7.1 configuration as well as a 5.1.

B009WUBERW|5.0|Great movie. Definitely worth the purchase!!! I heard that a part 3 may be coming out sometime in the near future.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Good game I like the fact the u can now make your own with the new sealed campaign. It just makes the games that much better
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a really good series if you're in to work place dramas, lawyers, and some really funny humor.  Lewis is truly my comic relief.

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I have Definitely enjoyed playing this game.  Most are pretty easy to figure out. I hate rating games but need the points.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It's a very good book  if your looking for fun  for all ages I have read all the books have them all and going to buy hard luck the next book<br />I give it five stars
B008OOYALE|3.0|The games is great.  But it takes to long to do anything because to build next thing costs huge amount of money but you only make small bits.  Clearing tree cost 10000 but you only get 600 an hour from your Dragon. To get more dragons you need more area but to get area you either wait forever or pay real money to buy in-game money!!!
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|it simply does ok iv had better aps doesn't even get every item wen refreshes but the basics work could be a lot better but if u want basic bs it works
B004N868DS|5.0|I bought it for my son - he loves it. Very sturdy and nice looking as well easy to use when gaming. Thanks!
6304698798|5.0|The misses is a huge Eastwood fan. She was totally surprised when I got this for her. It made a great addition to her collection, which I was surprised to find missing this classic. She was so utterly grateful that I thought about her, that I knew what to get her, and that I paid enough attention to know that Eastwood gets her going that, well, you read the title.<br /><br />Haven't seen the movie yet, but highly recommend!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|UPDATE: I bought a second one and development is really good on this device. Updated to 5 stars.  So the jury is still out on this device. It is perfect for watching YouTube on the big screen, but I prefer my TV's built in Netflix app. Originally, it looked like streaming media from a local device was going to be working like a charm, but Google broke that functionality. They did issue a non-committal response saying that local content could be brought back and that the current SDK is a work-in-progress so other things might break or come back.  Overall though, for $35 plus three free months of Netflix, I can't really argue with buying one.
B005PK57NU|4.0|I would definitely recommend this show,it is rich in the level of story complexity and in the development of the characters and how they intertwine.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A beautifully told story of life, love, loss and second chances.  Set amid today's England, pre-WWII England, and WWII and the London Blitz.  It's a fascinating glimpse into that time and place.  Kate Morton does it again, and weaves a subtle mystery into a story that you'll find difficult to put down.  A must read!
1423124960|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's niece to go with a princess tutu for her 3rd birthday. She loved it and will be able to use this book for years to come, first with her mother reading to her and then with her reading to her mother! Great for the price!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|He tries to make the premise that only the seals are brave in battle, only the seals look out for their buddies and so forth.  There is more but why bother, just say that I don't care that much for it.
0783225792|4.0|Although this isn't my normal type of movie this one is a very good movie with a lot of stars.  It has a lot of action.  It's a great realistic movie about Vegas and gangsters.  Seeing Joe Pesci as a tough bad guy is worth getting this itself.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I had to watch the YouTube video to figure out how to play. Once I got going I really enjoyed playing.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love books like 'The Secret&#34; and anything to do with the law of attraction so when this book popped up as recommended I had to give it a whirl. This book really breaks everything down for you so you can easily understand all of this law of attraction stuff. I love the way the author talks to you as if you are her friend sitting in front of her. Out of all the books I read, this one really opened up my eyes. As for the experiments she gives you, you really have to do them without an ounce of doubt or else they won't work!
B007AL48UK|4.0|Good practice for hand-eye coordination and of course a great time killer when traveling on long haul plane flights. It would be a 5 star game if you could shuffle instead of receiving a &#34;NO MORE MOVES&#34; message........

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo Saga looks at the post apocalyptic story from a different perspective. The writing is good and the story is excellent. I've had a hard time putting it down. It's 1:30 in the morning and I just finished reading it.  Instead of going to sleep, I'm writing a review. That should tell you something.
1592402690|3.0|Emerick loses me when he elevates his role in The Beatles story. First, he was there for less than half of their studio output, and has a habit of disparaging the albums he missed out on. I personally don't hear much difference in the sound from Rubber Soul to Revolver. I will admit the tape loops, effects, etc. do add to Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, but I'm not sure if he can claim credit for all of that. The band's influences were changing and expanding which had as much to do with the sounds you hear as the not-so-humble engineer. Would the songs suffer if Norman Smith were engineering Revolver and Pepper? Who knows? His treatment of Martin could be seen as self serving, but some of Martin's recollections also seem self serving. Everyone seems to want to claim credit for the success of The Beatles.<br /><br />In regards to his treatment (mis-treatment?) of the three less-Fab, I must disagree with many of the critics here. I think he was completely fair to all four, and I don't think anything he has written hasn't been said before! The treatment of George was completely in keeping with the history as i've understood it. He talks about how much George grew from the Revolver sessions to Abbey Road. He credits his guitar work (solos) on Abbey Road mentioning how he re-dubbed his solo on 'Something' in one take (because it had to be) while accompanied by classical musicians. This was something that a less confidant George would not have attempted a few years earlier. I'm a George fan and I always believed that was part of his charm, the less talented (more grounded in many ways) little brother who finally came into his own. Somewhere along the way people have raised The Beatles to a mythical proportion, believing that all four were 'geniuses.' They were not. Maybe Lennon and McCartney have some claim. Harrison benefited from being the understudy to two of the greatest song-writers of all time, and he eventually became a decent one himself. He became a damn good guitar player along the way too. Emerick gives him plenty of credit for his growth. Sorry Ringo fans, but Ringo also was not a genius. Hate to break it to you! This rewriting of the Ringo story is contrarianism at it's worst. Ringo hit the lottery with The Beatles. Can anyone honestly with a straight face say The Beatles would have been less successful without Ringo? C'mon! Did 'Back in the USSR' suffer because Ringo was home pouting? Did the White Album sessions come to a halt when he threw his fit? For a not-fantastic drummer to try to quit The Beatles is artistic suicide. Luckily, beneath all their bitchiness, I think the other three were good guys, and liked Ringo. Otherwise he'd be off with Pete Best wondering what might have been. Much lesser bands wouldn't have allowed Ringo within 30 feet of a microphone. He's made a nice career living off his Beatle fame and has become something of a clown prince of Rock, but save me the Ringo is underrated nonsense. I did like 'Octopuses' Garden' though. Anyone who doesn't know that Lennon went through a passive psychedelic stage and emerged angry and aggressive isn't a Beatles fan. It's also no knock to say he wasn't a great guitar player. This is nothing new from Emerick. He gives him plenty of credit for his singing and songwriting. These were his strengths. It has been stated elsewhere that Paul was responsible for many of the innovations The Beatles were responsible for. Somewhere along the way the Lennonites have tried to turn John into some sort of avant-garde genius. His genius again was his songwriting. To say Paul helped Lennon's songs out more than Lennon helped Paul's, to me is stating the obvious. Paul was much more interested, patient, etc. when it came to making a track. This has also been used as an example of an annoying quality of his (Obla-Di-Obla-Da). Emerick stating this is hardly a revelation. The fact that he liked Paul better seems incidental to me. I think he gives plenty of examples of Paul being overbearing and childish. But he was also the most committed to keeping the group going and therefore put in the most work, why people are still defensive about this stuff is beyond me.<br /><br />In conclusion, nice book by someone who was there for (part) of their historic run. Self-serving at times, interesting at other times, and telling us what we already know most of the time.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This has been by far one of the best games I enjoyed playing. It is very user friendly. I love search and find but also like some type of monologue with it. This covers it all, and its not just a search and find, you have to actually put things together. Also if you do not want to do the search and click part, you can choose to do mahjong tiles, which was great because sometimes you just want something different. The map with this game was great, it showed you where you were at and where to go to next if you can remember yourself. one of the best one so far from G5. The only thing is that I wished it would have longer. But hey that may have been because I was having such a fun time playing with it.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I downloaded and played for an hour,  addictive. What are you waiting for. Loved it.  You will likely not be disappointed.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Got to sere this flick.great characters for all ages.i would watch again and again excellent ,must watch anytime my son loved it
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Considering that I have listened to this CD for over a year straight is saying something,Some of the best stone sour ever,the album has a rollercoaster of songs,but it just seems to be so cohesive,one of the best records in the last ten years,this album is my oxygen. \m/
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Doesnt work on my s4 waste of money<br />Wish they would get it fixed to work on my phone seriously
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding drama - no hardcore sex or violence.  Many sub plots within the main plot.  Can not wait for season 4.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|ITs really awesome. I love the graphics as well as i can play it all day and never get bored
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is highly reccomended by me, and I'm certain a thousand other people. Its simple, but still immensely fun. I would PAY for this app, so it being free is an amazing deal!
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|A good cast, but a bit hard to follow.  Still can't figure out why Natalie was even in the movie, other than some gratuitous sex.  Just when you thought she may have a purpose, she's gone in a rather twist of demeanor.  There were too many pieces that either didn't seem to fit or lacked some clarity.  It ended like a Perry Mason TV show, with little fanfare and the bad guy just gives up.  I always can tell when a movie is having trouble when the background music and sounds muffle the dialog.  Watch some Tarantino or Coen Brothers movies to see how dialog s/b handled.  Over all, it was an OK movie.  I probably wouldn't watch it again.  I like Mark Walhberg,  but he overacts in his own movies, as do many actors.  KZJ was stunning as usual!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I researched many activity trackers and ended up having to decide between the Fitbit One and the Pulse. I composed a list of pro's and cons for both trackers. For the Pulse:<br />Pro's:<br />- much higher accuracy for actual steps taken. (Fitbit One records steps while riding in the car, or even standing still.)<br />- very nice design; easy to get into and out of the various clip and wrist items, but also fits nicely in your pocket by itself.<br />- Easy to use interface. The web page is very well laid out and configurable with a great deal of data.<br />- Sleep tracking is great and better data when compared to Fitbit.<br />- Easy to sync. The auto sync works well, however it's easy to just press and hold the button to sync when desired, which I found easy.<br />- Heart rate \\"pulse\\" tracker, which also uploads to the app and online. Very nice feature.<br />- I like being able to quickly check the previous day history - does up to 10 days stored.<br />- Battery life is very good. I charge it once a week just to keep it full, however the I found the Fitbit One only lasted 5 or so days.<br />- Integrates nicely into the same Withings app that includes the Withings Scale that I have (also, very nice quality device). The user experience and interface is very good.<br /><br />Con's:<br />- step length and targets are not adjustable, although Withing's said they are working on adding this. I have a longer step length than the unit obviously uses. I find that I'm short about .08 miles for each mile walked, so not bad and it is consistent distance compared to my GPS. The number of steps is accurate and consistent compared with my old-fashioned ankle pedometer (which is very accurate - but not what I'd call an all day wear item...) For comparison, the Fitbit One consistently had between 600-1500 extra steps a day more over the seven day period I tested this, and therefore additional distance as well.<br />- No interface to My Fitness Pal (yet, although MFP has said for a few months now that it's coming).<br />- Display is a hard to read in direct sunlight. Easy work around is just to shade with your hand.<br /><br />Not really a con, because Withing's never advertised having it, I wish this had a silent alarm, much like the Fitbit One has. I consider this the nicest feature of the Fitbit...<br /><br />Overall, a very nice device and I give it my highest rating. If it had ability to adjust stride length and a silent alarm - it would be perfect. I would call this a 5 star when compared to the other trackers I've tried - and I've tested the Jawbone Up, BodyMedia Fit, Fitbit One and Nike Fuel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really like the twists and turns the book took. I see real life in the story lines with todays society.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|Very cool games, if you can call it that, its more of an experience. Beautiful graphics and unique play mechanics. The music is beautiful also. The content is worth it for sure. Shows producer commentary on their games, plus downloadable music, pictures and extra games. Worth every penny in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app. It is a challenge and lots of fun. I hope to continue on to more levels.
1401307450|4.0|Before reading Scar Tissue, I thought I could easily predict what Anthony's life would have probably have been and how he may have risen. I thought he would have a hundred idols in rock and roll, he would probably have been a born leader, a complete athiest, probably the youngest of three children with two older brothers, a vocalist from the age of 6 or something.... BUT<br /><br />Man I was wrong.<br /><br />Anthony Kiedis 's life is like a roller coaster with no breaks or safety, I am quite shocked he is still alive, he has a most keen sense of adventure, whether its his amusing song writing ability, whether its trying to control people, flirting with the law, getting naked in front of thousand people or whether its going to a neighborhood and buying out all available cocaine and heroine from all the dealers. When he didn't have cash, he actually paid the pizza delivery guy a massive tip on his credit card just so he can get cash from him to buy drugs (like an ATM)<br /><br />He wasnt destined to be a singer. Anthony become an adult at the age of 12. The book will make you walk behind him through the many sets variations friends enemies girlfriends musicians he worked and lived with.<br /><br />If you don't mind a spoiler or few,<br /><br />- he wrote I could have lied for the Irish sensation, Sinead o Connor who had dumped him.<br /><br />- he wrote tearjerker after Cobain's death<br /><br />- under the bridge was written when he had gone sober and thought he 'd lost his best mates cause they didn't like him anymore, he never felt worse. He was embarrassed of it and didn't want to put it on the record until his producer said it would be great.<br /><br />- Anthony lost his virginity to one of his fathers girlfriend at 12<br /><br />- Dalai Laama wouldn't let go of his hand when he met him<br /><br />- his hair were down to his waist and he only cut it shortly before releasing californication<br /><br />- he couldn't believe how attention seeking Courtney Love was<br /><br />- pearl jam was a Rhcp cover band and they started opening for Rhcp!!<br /><br />And so on and so on..<br /><br />So many intresting facts. Strangely enough I liked his drug escapades the most, him running around for drugs and then writing music, his inability to stick with one girl, infidelity..<br /><br />So much more.<br /><br />What you waiting for? I suggest you start reading soon.<br /><br />And hey, in the comments column, recommend me a similar bio.

B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of those rare films that melds social critique with pure entertainment successfully. The action sequences are excellent, the acting is impressive, and when it comes to a satisfying ending.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I just got my Chromecast yesterday, it is very easy to set up and works very well.<br /><br />Comparing to my Samsung SmartTV interface it is much, much, much easier to use. My TV has HMDI 1.4 port, so I just need to select the content and stream to the TV that it turns on the content automatically.<br /><br />Comparing to my Apple TV, it is very limited compared to Apple TV because it doesn't have an interface with multiple content and it also dependent on using your smartphone, tablet, or computer to command the content.<br /><br />I hope Google can enable more content faster, current just Google Play, Netflix and Youtube, but you can stream your PC screen so it is a good alternative if you want to watch Hulu streaming from your computer.

0385345054|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful! It's full of very detailed pictures and descriptions. The layout is beautiful and the flowers are inspiring. There's even a whole back section full of patterns! The look, the feel, and the content of this book made me feel like I had been sent a 50 dollar book! I'm so surprised at the value! I'd recommend this book to any paper enthusiast or anyone who just loves beautiful things!
B00B23O96A|2.0|There were only a few songs on here I really enjoyed.  Old Sock is an appropriate title for this one. Eric's guitar usually speaks for him, but I've always thought his voice was adequate. That is no longer the case, and he should have skipped the vocals all together on some of this. Beating old standards to death does not make me want to waste my money on this.
B005AKFXZW|2.0|I know this book gets a great write up - and it was kind of interesting, but it is really, really long and it takes an age before anything significant happens. In this age of instant gratification, I just found I had other things to do.

B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Come on, we knew it was going to happen - the end of the series, that is - not Sookie becoming a vampire. Charlaine Harris did warn us a long, long time ago that that was never going to happen. And Charlaine kept her word. I like that! I for one am pleased she ended the series in a realistic way. Thanks for all the many good reads, Ms Harris.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|This is a beautifully done game. Plays well on kindle fire. Unfortunately this game is a money hook. To really enjoy the game fully you really need to have a credit card. Everything in the game constantly advertises items that require in game purchasing with real money. It is a little bit of a kill joy. I don't mind shelling out some cash for a game, or even paying a subscription. But a person could really ring up a bill on this. It takes a lot of the fun from the game to constantly be reminded of all the money sucking Venus fly traps built in to it. The potions are ridiculous. This game is worth a brief dalliance, but not a real gaming love affair. I would maybe come back to it if not for the in-ap purchasing, but as it is,  I won't spend a dime. I wish there were more games like this for kindle that a person could just buy the game.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I think this book has special implications for anyone who works with children. Recognising and understanding the differences between introversion and extroversion has particular application in our classrooms. Some children may be under stimulated, while others are desperate to switch off. Similarly, parenting and teaching children who seek high levels of risk is a challenge. This book is sure to start lots of conversations in the staff room.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|Good read, a good introduction to home brewing, simple and easy to follow. I am looking forward to the lessons learned
B0033H7VI6|5.0|While the handle does look like cheaper knives, as noted by previous reviewers, this knife feels sturdy in the hand and holds a very sharp edge. The significant blade thickness, 0.25&#34; along the spine, would lead one to believe that you could pry a car door open with it if needed, though I wouldn't recommend that. Overall, I am very happy with this knife and feel it is worth every penny.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Their music is always a treat.  No screaming, yelling, or foul exhortations.  This is simply good, fun music that is done beautifully.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I downloaded this but it will not install!! Keeps saying there is an error!!??? It was a waste of my coins!!  I would like a refund please.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|It is a fun and diverting movie.  I put it on while folding laundry.  I can enjoy it without having to keep my eyes glued on the set.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I like games that offer mindless play.  Sort of like &#34;take me away calgon&#34; type of games LOL.  Seriously though, it's like a lot of other games in type, but has an added bonus of some graphics that appeal to me.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love their music, the energy and the beauty of it.  I love the mash-ups, and their original work, and their interpretation of other artists work.  It fills a place in my soul for quality music.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I would actually give the game 4.5 stars because of all the back and forth with the scenes, but other than that it was really good.  This game is long enough to not be able to play it in one sitting - which is good.  Problem is us old folks tend to forget things so when I went to continue my game, it was challenging to figure out where I left off and what I had already done :). The map and hint system was great! I needed that to remember what I had yet to do.  The games were fine, glad there is a skip button for the hand-eye-time coordination game, (didn't even attempt that one.) For $1.99 it is WELL worth it! Thank you and I look forward to more games from you.
0783230079|5.0|I don't know why, but I can't seem to keep my copies of this movie.  I enjoy it enough that I keep replacing it!
B009AY04A8|2.0|I just can't can't can't take it anymore! Is it possible to put any more freaking dialogue in a game!?! I'd have rated it 4 or 5 stars, but the chatting and back and forth... it takes FOREVER to get to a game.  Now I will stop talking so you can look at all the other reviews.
B005CAATXG|5.0|This is a very good album. I love the band.  The only bad part of this is the decal which is adhered to the shrink wrap.  The decal says, &#34;Recommended if you like Skillet, Paramore, Flyleaf&#34;. Ariel's Blog states that they are not a christian band. Skillet, Paramore, and Flyleaf are christian bands. I have listened to skillet and flyleaf before and they dont sound anything like Icon for Hire. Icon for Hire is way better. If Icon for Hire was a christian band I would not have purchased the cd since no matter how good something sounds I refuse to put garbage into my head.  Just because they say the word &#34;savior&#34; in a song doesn't mean they are christian any more than if I say oh my god.<br />I would recommend this CD to anyone who is not deaf.  They have a new CD coming out soon too!
B005G4TJUC|2.0|This movie was not what I expected. In a good and bad way. I didn't like the voice for Optimus. I didn't like the new love interest Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's character, Carly. I don't think they should have changed Megan Fox's character. I hope she comes back in the fourth movie. The action in the movie was great. I was on the edge of my seat. I'm a lover for graphics in movies, the graphics and effects were amazing but I hope everything is better in the fourth. I LOVED the first and second.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I dont get it? I watched this movie all the way threw? My mouth open most of the time as I could not really figure out what the hell was going on.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Not bad hidden object game, not too easy, not too hard to find, would have liked a few more puzzles, lots of dialogue, but liked that you can skip, got all the way to end, keeps saying loading, not sure if I finished
B00BJS7104|5.0|Quentin Tarantino, has breathed new life into the dyeing movie industry. I enjoy his movies because they break away from the cookie cutter Hollywood conveyor belt of drivel they are tossing out nowadays. taking notes from Sergio Leone's old school westerns. That I also enjoy, this is a great show I have enjoyed watching again and again. 2 thumbs up.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It took me from a restless mind to relaxed with a smile on my face.  I am trying to use it every night.  I have used a lot of these type programs - this one works!
B00EOO55GW|3.0|Short answer: For me, NO. But for the mainstream media, YES.<br /><br />Still a very solid album, and is their most radio-friendly album to date.<br /><br />Being an A7X fan, I am accustomed to that distinct sound. Listen to their first 5 albums and you will hear things like church bells, piano, organs, dueling guitars, violins and complex melodies. In this album, those are missing.  By simplifying the song composition in HTTK, they lost that A7X sound that I have grown to love.<br /><br />Here's my track by track rating:<br />1) Shepherd of Fire [3/5]: Very upbeat intro track.  You can totally see this being played as a first song in a concert.<br />2) Hail to the King [3/5]: Obvious this is their first single.  A catchy song and will get a ton of radio play.<br />3) Doing Time [2/5]: Not a fan of this one. It sounded monotonous, as most \\"riff driven\\" songs tend to do.<br />4) This Means War [2/5]: Now this one is very monotonous, downright boring (listen to the verses!). My least favorite track.  Guitar solo's were good though so it got a bump to 2 stars.<br />5) Requiem [3/5]: Also got a bit monotonous at times.  Very old school sounding. Nothing wrong with old metal, but also nothing special on this one.  Only saving grace is during the bridge, where they flashed a bit of old A7X goth.<br />6) Crimson Day [3/5]: Decent ballad.  I know they've put out good slow tunes before, so this isn't a total surprise.  While it isn't \\"I Wont See You Tonight Part 1\\", its still very catchy.<br />7) Heretic [5/5]: My favorite track! This is one of two tracks that slightly resembled previous A7x albums, which is probably why I like it! Also as a bassist, it's always good to hear the bass track prominent in a track.  Great Job, Johnny Christ.<br />8) Coming Home [4/5]: Total headbang song.  They stuck to that old school metal sound.  Difference with this one, though, is that I can totally see myself pumping my fist, headbanging, when they play this live.<br />9) Planets [3/5]: The other \\"A7X sounding\\" track.  Still missing complexity but is the most drum-complex track of the album.<br />10) Acid Rain [3/5]: This feels like November Rain by GnR. It is quite catchy but didn't quite seem to fit this album.  May have fit Nightmare, since it sounds very much a tribute to The Rev.<br /><br />I have no doubt this will be a successful album, but it wasn't my favorite album either. I do recognize that in order to tread water in this (what seems like a deteriorating) music industry, a band must keep on evolving or it will drown... and that's what A7X is doing. While HTTK isn't what I was expecting, I'm at least comforted to know that A7X will stick around for a while. This album will definitely capture a bigger more mainstream audience, with its simplistic riff-driven sound. I now look forward to their tour this Fall/Winter and future albums to come. R.I.P. The Rev.
0345803485|5.0|I could not stop reading it. I was very curious of what Mr. Grey was going to do next. Anastasia, kind of innocent and silly, ended being the hero of the novel.<br />Anyway, I enjoyed James' first book. She is a clever writer that can keep the reader interested. It is a book to laugh and relax, and to want to have more creative ideas when you share with your partner.<br />I became more aware of my body, that was a plus to my relationship.<br />Thanks Ms. James.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|This is my favorite work that includes Sinatra. I find this to be really amazing and relaxing in a somber kind of way. A lot of the songs stand out to me and I found that every song in this album is enjoyable which I find rare nowadays. Jobim and Sinatra compliment each other really well in some of the tracks and it feels natural.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Frank Sinatra and would like to experiment with something a little different.
0143124544|5.0|I became the author's fan after reading the \\"Last letter from your lover\\" novel. But \\"Me before you\\" will surprise you with all the human complexity. Life and death hand by hand in a romantic story. I simply love this book. I like the way that Jojo plays with the narrative. You have to keep thinking.<br />Yes, I cried too.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book sucks you in and makes you want to see what happens next. Gillian Flynn has the amazing ability to make you turn the page. And her twists are amazing. Definitely worth the read, but be warned it is a dark and bumpy ride.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Use it on my phone and although typing on the phone is slow, this app actually can match edit with Office on computer so I can keep up with my work if there is an emergency.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|this movie was made for 3D, you will get more out of it watching it in 3D vs 2D. i watched it about 5 times in 2D and then saw it in 3D and it was almost like watching a new movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I thought this was a great season. It answers a couple of questions which is nice. Can't wait for season 9 in September.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I was impressed how well this app worked for being free. Used it daily as a backup alarm. But lately it just freezes up my kindle or crashes. Tried reinstalling it numerous times. Sad I can't use it anymore.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It was overall a very good movie. I had to watch it in bits and pieces but the twists and turns were good and kept you interested.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was superb, all the way around. Great action, good acting, great drama, and awesome message. Get it! The lessons about parenting and being a solid Christian man are highly impactful. Get this movie for young men or men.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Works great. One minor issue is that it doesnt have any legs, i put rubber things on the bottom so it doesnt scratch and slide on the desk.<br /><br />I started up a podcast with my buddies, and it wasn't too long til more than 4 people needed to jack in with headphones. So, I just bought another one.
B00EHAIHWM|5.0|I'm a big fan of Franz Ferdinand. I agree this album is more like the first two, it's not exactly as loud or aggressive as Tonight (and I loved Tonight), buts it's still essentially Franz Ferdinand. If you listen close, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Actions is really quite fun, catchy and creative. It really deserves more stars. Come on people give it a chance!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This is a fun movie to watch...it's completely over the top and ridiculous but you know that when you rent it right? Good special effects.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Why it won't let you just go to Facebook's web site I don't know. It won't close out of a picture, it won't go back from looking at an article, I have to close my Kindle several times-Kindle has changed their layout also. Do not & will not recommend this app
B00DW39B2K|3.0|This was pretty good if a bit predictable. Both actors give good performances but the story is not terribly believable..
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and simple set up. No extras or annoying adds. Just the weather  you need. Well worth the free instalment.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|REALLY GREAT  BOOK JACK RYAN JNR ISA GREAT READ<br />WISH I COULD GET MORE OF HIS BOOKS HERE IN NZ
B003ODIZL6|5.0|How are you? Hi bye happy mad  mom dad Mel Matt all a<br /><br />Melissa all my  say bed bye cat
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I am totally addicted to this show! It is so good. Thank you Amazon Prime for having both season on here , and allowing me to catch up
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Not very good. Doesn't move from day to night automatically and premise and action passe. But to be fair I was not a big fan of Missile Attack either
B00CPWTRAA|4.0|There have been few, if any, careers in opera to equal that of Placido Domingo. I first heard him in 1969, as Manrico in the new Met production of \\"il Trovatore\\", singing beside Leontyne Price, Grace Bumbry and Sherrill Milnes. He made his entrance at the end of Act 2 swinging in on a rope, the very image of youthful virility and impetuosity. He managed the high note at the end of \\"di quella pira\\", although he did not linger on it, and that was always his way, like most spintos, with high notes. He spent the next four decades and more at the very top of the opera world with a repertoire truly breathtaking in its range, including well-respected Wagner interpretations alongside the great Italian and French roles.  Here we are almost 45 years later, with a generous (70 minute) recital of extremely heavy, demanding Verdi roles, as a baritone. Among important tenors I can think of only a few who have sung successfully as baritones late in their career; Ramon Vinay comes to mind. Many tenors have begun as baritones, and Domingo might be thought to have done so since he began singing baritone in zarzuela as a very young man. There is much to appreciate here, especially his great energy and engagement with the dramatic requirements of the music. He is not afraid to make an ugly sound: the beginning of the Council Chamber scene from \\"Simon Boccangraa\\" is a shout of rage, and later his denunciation of Paolo is quite chilling. His lower voice has been developed very successfully; it sounds more baritonal, in fact, than many \\"real\\" Verdi baritones, who are often somewhat weak at the bottom of their range. He sings with enormous passion and truthfulness, a proud, still-strong old man who has nothing to lose and who will not go gently. There is often a pronounced beat, an inevitable loosening of vibrato, but never a wobble. He sounds better than any of the male singers in the supporting parts--in fact Machado is far less steady than Domingo in Don Carlos' prison cell. He is daring in his choice of repertoire, including the extremely exposed music from \\"Ernani\\" and the high-lying, treacherous tessitura of \\"il balen\\", with not entirely perfect success. The angry, vigorous characters are somewhat more comfortable than the contemplative ones. It would be foolish to expect real vocal freshness or consistent tonal beauty from him, from any singer, at 70, and those are not on offer. What you'll find here is complete fearlessness, a lifetime's hard-won craft and an indomitable passion. Verdi never wrote the King Lear he tried throughout much of his life to create, but the spirit of King Lear is Domingo's here. Whatever quibbles might be made, I think old Verdi would be proud.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show!  The characters seem simple at first and then glimpses of their depth show by the end of the season.
B001R60ESE|5.0|This was a very nice concert. Very well put together. great to watch on a rainy day, or just to kick back to some jazz.
B000PY6BBI|1.0|This movie was really too bad to even comment on.  The soundtrack, classic eighties computer generated adventure garbage was enough to ruin even the finest acting and cinematography.  It was nice to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in her super hot days, but not nice enough to bear it.  I turned this one off after 15 minutes.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is definitely quirky, but in the best way possible! Despite the occasional super awkward scene this show is hilariously funny.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This is probably one of the most under rated movies of last year. I came in with pretty low expectations of the movie and was blown away. This is now one of my favorite action movies of all time!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was so excited to see Gaiman's had a new book out, and I wasn't disappointed!  As always, fantastic story telling, and a unique tale told from an interesting perspective. A great read! Couldn't put it down.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. I do. It's cute & fierce, nothing wilts or decays if you don't get back quickly, it moves at a relatively decent speed (of course, allowing you to speed things up spending $).<br />One of the best qualities of this game is the ability to gift gold, allowing you to get the premium items without spending anything.<br />It's fun, easy & allows for strategy or simple play. 5 stars!
B003UESJHY|5.0|Enjoyed the movie a lot with great performances, so decided to purchase it as a gift, for someone who felt the same way.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this little farm game. It's cute, easy & best of all - the crops don't wilt. So I can come & go as I please...making this a lot of fun to play. :)
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Excellent book for historical facts about WWII, and a great Spy thriller.  Rich with information regarding the European front and the invasion.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good way kill down time. Updated version of the version I played on Atari. If you bored at work download it and play away. You will not regret it. But I hot it free...
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's a really fun game but it only gives you one coin every time you solve one so be careful about using the hints !
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|First off, I have never read a Judge Dredd comic, so I'm no fanboy.  I have known about him since his creation, just never thought to pick one up.  The first mistake most people will be comparing this to the Sly Stallone film that was not very good.  This movie is all balls and no comic relief.  Fortunately, Dredd didn't make any misplaced puns at any time.  He was full on hard-ass from beginning to end.  The \\"rookie\\" Anderson also came off as a competent judge-to-be instead of a hapless tag along.<br />The film was a bit claustrophobic as it takes place entirely inside a building, but the action moves along fast enough to maintain interest.<br />Now not all was great.  The plot was pretty predicable with no unexpected twists or turns and even though they tried very hard to incorporate the 3-D effects into a specific plot point (the use of the drug Slo-Mo), it still seemed contrived (ala \\"Put the mask on now!\\").<br />However, if you want to watch a great action movie and not think too hard about what is going on, you could do a lot worse.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The National's best work to date, the whole album is good, my favorite song off of it changes almost every time I listen to it and it has been in and out of my stereo many times already.
1598561634|5.0|This is as close to the original copies that are available today. It is just indescribable having the purist form of the Word of God in my hands. Awesome.
0399159347|5.0|This is a terrific beach book - entertaining with unexpected twists.  Great characters, an engrossing tale, easy reading.  If you enjoy escapist reading, do yourself a favor and read this enjoyable book by a very talented author.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a great game.<br /><br />but it's disappointing to complete all the levels after only a few hours play.<br /><br />I hope more levels are added soon, and the game automatically updates.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews on this book. I will agree that about two thirds of the way through I did start to skim over pages looking to cheat my way past some of the chapters, but the ending certainly made up for that! I continue to be amazed at the strength of the female characters in this series...looking forward to the next book!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I love stories with cats but I really love true life stories with cats.  I am also very partial to red tabbies.  So I could not wait to read A Street Cat Named Bob.  James's story, I am sure, is not unique.  But I absolutely love how he puts himself second, and Bob's welfare first, in deciding to come off Methadone.  Those of us animal lovers who see our pets as our family understand this.  I can't wait to read the next book!
B008JFUNYG|4.0|I was a little surprised that this was a pretty good remake of the original Bruce Campbell film. The original had a lot of dark humor which this completely lacks but it is actually a good horror movie played straight. I enjoyed it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This enhances observation and paying attention to what you are seeing. As you grow older, observation becomes less.  I think this helps.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Reminds me of the old Nintendo excite bike and off road all wrapped into one game. I have seen the top of the mountain Beavis and it is good
0142403873|5.0|My 2 year old son just loves this book! Read this and then also enjoy the BBC animation on DVD. Such creative characters and storyline!
B008N9AASC|5.0|There is something very captaining and Zen-like about this film. Watching it is truly a meditative experience. The soundtrack--excellent and the images are stunning. The supplementary DVD with interviews and the process of how the film was brought into reality is equally good. If you're seeking a film with content, excellent visual imagery and a wonderful ambient soundtrack, check it out. Hope to see more from this crew in the future.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I liked it for a while, but got bored after some time. But it is quite impressive the way it works. Cute game! No regrets downloading it!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I discovered Joe Bonamassa on public TV and immediate purchased this DVD. The performance, the directing, the filming is excellent! Bonamassa is captivating on the guitar and keeps it entertaining through the entire performance. I have watched this DVD many times and look forward to watching it many more.
B00004R7X5|4.0|Having enjoyed the original in vinyl shortly after being issued, I was disappointed with the CD transcription in comparison to other performances (love the piece, sampled 6).  What attracted me back to the reissue is similar to other reviewers' comments ... the strings are unparalleled (I can ignore other less attractive aspects).  Although this reissue is better, it still lacks clarity and purity of tone in many places (strings are wonderful).  I had a similar view of the hybrid SACD reissue of Reiner although the performance is superb.  Put it down to personal taste; sound quality is important to me, not just performance.  I've had the good fortune to hear most of the current top violinists live and this recording sounds muddled at times.  Also, I recommend not buying if you wish more than the title piece.<br /><br />If you do decide to buy, I suggest listening to the reissue and comparing to other more modern recordings, e.g. Gergiev.  Or, buy it for the string section performance.  4* for overall performance (bias + for string section) , 3* for sound quality (same as vinyl, but not as warm).
B00DT55OGS|3.0|1.  the flow just isn't there.  Whoever ordered the songs should've put more thought into it.  One example of this is starting off the whole cd with the remix of I'm a Cuckoo.  It simply isn't a strong starting song for it lacks energy.<br />2.  Stevie Jackson's contributions are just bland.  \\"I took a long hard look,\\" \\"Long Black Scarf,\\" \\"I believe in Traveling Light,\\" and \\"Mr. Richard\\" are either too slow, not very interesting musically or, in the case of Mr. Richard, just plain silly in the conga line sense.  Traveling Light is the best of the lot for Stevie, though in my opinion his absolute best song is Jonathan David (not on this collection).<br />3.  I Didn't See it Coming is not a very inspired remix.  The album version is far superior as its feel is more consistent.<br />4.  The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House seems to be looking for its way towards a final version- it has the feel of a demo song that might have sounded more believable had it been a crappy recording in a hotel room.  It simply sounds incomplete musically.<br />5.  Passion Fruit is an instrumental and, though it is sort of a fun surf rock type tune, I feel that rock and roll bands should stay clear of instrumentals.  Either they end up being masturbatory 11 minute excursions a la Rush or Yes or they end up being repetitive and unnecessary a la The Cure or this song by B and S.<br /><br />So, what is good about this album?  The songs that really stand out as energetic and/or melodic in a recent B and S sense are Suicide Girl (a tip of the hat to bands like Aha or Berlin) , Love on the March (a bossa nova feel with a catchy melody), Your Secrets (a poppy, bouncy \\"don't get me wrong\\" by the Pretenders or \\"close to me\\" by The Cure type song), Your Cover's Blown (a dance, euro pop, disco tune)and Desperation Made a Fool of Me (which Stuart says is the second oldest song he's recorded- it feels like a nice bridge between older B and S and newer- the reason for that is, while it is an old song, it was recorded recently). The good songs on this album are really good and deserve to have been ordered better and surrounded with similarly strong songs.  The liner notes are fun as they hold not just the lyrics for each song but notes from Stuart and Stevie about the songs.<br />Overall, I'd say get the album (especially if you're a big fan) but don't expect the cohesiveness and strong quality that made Write About Love, The Life Pursuit and Dear Catastrophe Waitress.  With this, you're looking at more of a mixed bag like Fold Your Hands Child.  If I were to compare this album of oddities/ rarities to its predecessor Push Barman, I would say that, due to the fact that there are fewer songs and fewer strong songs, this one is inferior.  If Push Barman was a well planned three course meal, Third Eye Centre is more of a hit or miss buffet.  Where Push Barman had songs that made me wonder how they never made it to an official album, Third Eye Centre has songs that made me say, \\"Yeah, I can see how that never made it to an album.\\"
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I don't know how probable this show is in real life, but I love watching the show and the the characters
B004W25KKW|5.0|Much better than a book that just makes thoughtless claims and unwarranted extrapolations. Makes sense. I like the balance between the hope for the techniques and the reality of the success vs the limitations. The last few pages are particularly instructive.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great movie. Fun watching when I wanted it. My first experience with amazon video. I will use it again sometime.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|this movie is so freakin great. every role was played with earnest and it is a movie worth buying because you will definitely be watching it more than once
B009OYSFDM|5.0|A viable and strong interpretation for the Green Arrow character for a series. Excellent writing, acting, directing, and production values.
0205313426|5.0|This &#34;little red book&#34; contains basically every guideline needed by any good writer. Its format is such that it introduces a grammatical rule, and shows you why and how it's correct. Would definitely recommend it to any good writer or those aspiring to be.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I found the casting to be fantastic and the story to be perfect!  Even my wife loved this movie and she hates scifi.
1592402038|4.0|British author Lynne Truss goes on a rampage in order to bring proper punctuation to the attention of the common reader. She presents the absence of proper punctuation as an increasingly contagious and rampant problem in our world today. I had to buy this book since my AP Language and Composition class required it for summer reading; however, after reading the book, I realize now that not only did it boost my grade in said class, but it made me less ignorant as a person. All in all, Lynne Truss's language use makes the book a fun read, with the occasional chuckle and the occasional &#34;Ahh...I see.&#34; I would definitely recommend it.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Amazing movie must see!!!!!!!! Kid friendly and just plain amazing!!!! I laughed i cried its just amazing!!!!<br /><br />Buy now!!!! Best movie ever!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Super fun but the free version needs more time. The full one gives you unlimited time it's worth the money. Ever since the new update with horses I wanted more time.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch Perfect is a funny, romantic, and entertainingly sexy movie. Beca (Anna Kendrick)is sexy in her dark eye liner and punkish look. And to top that off, she has vocal skills that are natural and sultry. Her connection/back and forth with Jesse(Skylar Astin),who is even sexier and as equally talented as she is, is the highlight of the movie to me, along with their on stage performances. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is hilarious through out. I love her character and the way she commits to a role. She is an awesome actress. Pitch Perfect has romance for the ladies and comedy for the men. What more can you ask for?!<br /><br />  T. Youngblood,<br />  Nebraska
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The calibrate feature really helped my first edition kindle battery charge issue. Was only charging to 15 percent now goes all the way. Thanks!
B005LJK3AC|3.0|Same old plot with different twist. Not many laughs but Jennifer Aniston does look hot. A waste of two dollars.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini's  writing allows me to picture places and feelings in whole new ways using analogies and images that seem to make his ideas come alive.  Reading one of his books is like opening a gift slowly because you want to enjoy not only the gift itself but the process of discovery. This book is so much more than just a book about  Afghanistan.  It is a book about love, loss and connection - of family, of home, of a sense of who one is.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Love the new album - Avenged keeps putting out great music! Been waiting for this and it rocked more than I could expect!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot even though it has a few bugs.<br />It requires you to think to solve the puzzles to get past each board.<br />Some of these are impossible to do because of the bugs like crates that should blow up and leave just blow up and stay on the screen blocking your way.  But all in all its a fun game. I do recommend it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun , a good time killer. Some things to add as part of city take a while to purchase because you don't get enough credits in to keep up with the goals.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I really loved this serie, too bad they cancelled it without a proper end, and with no hope of a movie to wrap thing up...<br />Anyway, I really liked it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This young man has the most beautiful voice. I really like this CD and so do all three of my granddaughters!
B000AARKO4|5.0|It's not just that Orlando Bloom is so good looking, I love the fact that this story seems to be an objective telling of a war for Jerusalem where both sides do good, both sides do bad, and in the end, each side retains their humanity and honor.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|This CD is good, sometimes the Boss' songs take a while to grow on me. I really love his music. I'm sure I'll learn to love this one!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again.  There's something about this movie that keeps me coming back repeat viewing.
B000000OU0|5.0|Really enjoy all of the Eagles CD's my husband takes mine so I buy more then my kids take them.  Obviously we all love the Eagles.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wonderful Movie, I have sent this movie to my children and they love it.  I would recommend this movie highly
B000069HKH|5.0|I really love this CD. Bought it when it first came out and loved it, lost it and reordered it. My 10 year old granddaughter loves it!
B001PB3NWK|5.0|Very Good Movie.  Actually an excellent Movie.  It is a story about Our Pope, JPII  I would recommend this movie highly to anyone
034580404X|5.0|Really love this trilogy. Surprised some friends by reading this but I really loved it. Held my attention, made me cry and I loved the ending.
B000T1GKH2|5.0|Jethro Tull's 'Thick As A Brick' - all time classic album from the British rock band.  The download includes 4 titles: 1) Thick As A Brick (Part 1) (1997 Remastered). 2) Thick As A Brick (Part 2) (1997 Remastered). 3) Thick As A Brick (Live at Madison Square Garden. 4) Interview with the Jethro Tull band.  If you're a Tull fan you probably own the CD/album already, and if not you should download this from Amazon.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I ordered this for my husband, he listens to it to and from work and really enjoys listening to it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works great.  I wish Amazon would increase the amount of upload songs (250 songs isn't very much) to the cloud; anything greater incurs a fee.  That said, no problems - all is well!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It rocks!  I'm 53 years old and I can't wait for Season 4.  I absolutely love this show.  If you had told me 3 months ago, I would be watching this show, I would've said NO WAY.  I got hooked after the first two shows on Netflix, in Season 1.  Crazy good.  I love it!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love the Doctor and at first I found Rose annoying (she keeps getting locked in/out of places), but quickly learned to love her. I began Watching Doctor Who whe Tennant was the Doctor (10th), but 9 is hilarious.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great,  easy to read book.  I enjoy the style of this author's writing.  I would recommend this book to any bookclub.
B00CK6MUSW|5.0|Another great book by a very talented author. there were plenty of twists and turns throughout the story. great reading could not put it down
B008K8X0IS|5.0|The included-extras are well worth the expense of the deluxe package. I will purchase the ensuing Seasons of this series.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|If you are a follower of Star Trek and if you enjoy Si Fi, you should read this series of books.Since you have seen all of the movies and the TV series, you already know most of the characters by sight and reputation and the ones you don't know you can easily imagine as you read the book, It's truly almost like being there or watching the movie, I purchased all of the ones that were priced at $0.99 with tongue in cheek, figuring they must be all of the looser's, but they are not, they are all very well written and fun to read if you enjoy Star Trek. I heartily recommend them to anyone. The only problem is, when you get hooked on paying $.99 each for a series of books, it is hard to go back to spending $7 to $10 for the rest of them and trust me, when you start reading these stories, you'll want to read them all. As a caveat, I am 73 years old and have more time for reading now. Regards to all: Mike
B005ES0XQY|5.0|My son loves his crocs. These are made really well and very comfortable for him. We were very much pleased.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I actually bought the wrong thing.  I thought this was a DS game, so I was surprised when I really<br />looked at the box.  My grandson really likes it but he has a 2 year old sister who puts everything<br />in her nose so he has to be careful when he plays it.<br /><br />Otherwise, it came on time, perfect condition and he will really enjoy it.
B001HN6922|5.0|its one of the most wonderful movies for kids. Its done very nicely, entertaining and exciting. My son of 5 y.o. loves it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. Solved all 10 levels. Send more soon! Would definitely recommend this game if you like to solve problems and find hidden items and clues to help you out of the rooms.
1619693364|5.0|Nelson DeMille is probably my 3rd or 4th favorite author. I've read 5 of his books and have enjoyed them all.<br />I picked up 'The Panther' with high expectations. My expectations were not only met but far surpassed.<br /><br />What can I say? He is the master. He tells great compelling stories. The Panther has numerous plot twists and turns. You have the primary storyline (the capture or assassination of The Panther) as well as underlying themes (who to trust? Are John and Kate being set-up?)<br /><br />I totally connected and \\"felt\\" for all the characters. Some have said that DeMille took John Corey's sarcasm too far. I totally disagree. This is DeMille's style and this is the character John Corey is.<br /><br />If I was forced to find fault with one area it is this (and not really a fault.) I will say that in all of his books I've read, they do start a bit slow> I've read MayDay, Plum Island, Spencerville, Night Fall and Wild Fire. The Panther, like those, does not really GRAB you from page one. However, by the time you get to page 50 or 60, you're hooked.<br /><br />This was a great book by a talented storyteller. It was 619 pages---and I wished it was longer.<br /><br />Mr. DeMille---keep it up
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a good game on a tablet.  Reminds me of days gone by but with better graphics!  Good work!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun! I don't like that you have to get on Facebook to get further in the game seeing as I'm not a huge fan of Facebook. Otherwise a fan of bingo blitz!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a very fun game......but it does require a lot of thinking..........and yes I would recommend this to my family and friends.......and I would recommend it to you!!!!!! :)
B005LAII1C|5.0|Huge Seth MacFarlane fan anything he does is brilliant!! I recommend this movie to any adult that needs a good laugh.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|A very enjoyable group of songs except a couple of them stick in my head and after awhile it makes me crazy.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I found this easy to insert slides and save to transfer to computer.  The screen is small but I could see it enough to edit most slides.  There is ability to lighten or darken photos and flip over for ease of viewing.  I was able to scan about 500 photos in about 4 hours.  This is much easier than the flat scanner that I tried to use first.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|This graphics card is a amazing budget graphics card. I can run all my games on max except for battlefield 3 , but it can run battlefield 3 fine.
B00E1L9N8E|1.0|Rap music. In a movie set in the 1920s. During the JAZZ AGE.<br /><br />Whatever potential this film might have had was utterly destroyed by the decision to lay a \\"contemporary\\" sound track over this classic story of love and decadence following WWI, when jazz and other new developments were changing American society. I am reminded of a version the Scarlet Letter which was produced a few years ago which tried to make adultery a virtue, which was NOT the way the original book was written.<br /><br />How can you NOT use jazz music in a movie about the 1920s entertainment scene? That's like playing heavy metal music in a movie about Bach. It's like playing bluegrass music during the filming of Cleopatra. It's like playing Gilbert and Sullivan during the Hitler Files. It's bad enough that we're subjected to rap  music in 2013 without subjecting people in the 1920s to it.<br /><br />If these people want to use their actors and entertainers in a vehicle, here's a concept: come up with an ORIGINAL STORY, one more suited to what you want to do.
B000001FQQ|5.0|I'm a Kiss fan but I feel free to say when an album is good or not...and this is one of the best of them in my opinion! It's the last \\"hard rock glam\\" album, just before the darker \\"Revenge\\".<br />I didn't know this album well until some time ago, apart from Rise to it and Forever, and it's was an incredible surprise!! I prefer Stanley's songs, they remind me the best of Bon Jovi hits, surely it was a huge influence by the time, but they still are original songs. Simmons songs don't compromise but some are just average.<br />My killer songs are: Rise to it, Hide your heart, Forever, Silver spoon, King of hearts and Cadillac dreams.<br />One good thing about this album is that it has 15 tracks, which is awesome since most Kiss albums don't have that much songs.<br />After listening well and getting acquainted to this album I just can say: buy it! You won't regret.<br />EDIT: In my opinion the production/mixing of this album is perfect! Considering the style, it's kind of raw, but everything is in place, nice guitar fills and solos by Bruce Kulick, Eric Carr always perfect (but unfortunately close to death), Paul and Gene singing in their primes, especially Paul that has always been the most achieved singer in my opinion.
1416550534|5.0|Kate Morton really surprised me in the end. I had it wrong! It was such a well researched historical novel in the &#34;Upstairs/Downstairs&#34;  and &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; genre. I really enjoyed her writing and characters.
1878424319|5.0|A friend of mine gave this book to me about 8 years ago - read it...changed my life.  Just decided to buy it again to remind myself of what I learned.
B000L43QJ2|4.0|This Swan Lake is not for everybody. It is .... different, but that how it was conceived. Nureyev was a mature artist in 1984 and had his own concept he wanted to realize. His ballet is full of melancholy and sadness. Evil remains undefeated, and everything ends badly for the prince. Generally, I consider Swan Lake to be extremely boring, and cannot swallow more than half an hour of it at a time. This Swan Lake, though, grabbed by attention and kept me focused throughout entire performance. I did not regret purchasing this DVD. I liked the choreography. Costumes were tasteful and beautiful. I would've given it 5 stars if it wasn't for bleak minimalistic sets. Stenography gets so bad during the lake scenes that stairs in the back and columns on both sides of the stages make it look as if the action happens indoors. You will have to use all your imagination to see a lake there. Nonetheless, this production deserves your consideration even due to the fact that it's from a number one ballet company in the world.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|...until the update. This is a paid version and I still have to deal with intrusive advertisements? This sucks. This update has made the game slower and is killing my desire to play.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I wish the plot would have been more complex. But overall not bad.  I will probably read the sequel to see where the story goes.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very surprising turns and twists. Kept me reading and in suspense...I highly recommend this book. Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really like it but still like the first one more. Will keep playing to beat all the various challenges. I would recommend
1476704163|5.0|Lovely peek into Ke$ha's crazy life. Her writing and songs are just as beautiful as she is. Hope she shares more with us in the future.
B006RXPSLK|3.0|This was good to watch, but is not as good as all of the newer movies that the director did.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A very moving book. As always Hosseini does a remarkable job of painting a vivid picture of life and all its complexities. ElinaMS
B008MAI0WK|1.0|Its not worth the money since I found the same info on the raspberry pi web site in which I refer to more so than the book. Should come free with every European pi purchase. Would suggest buying a python programming book before this one. Sorry guys.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am looking forward to the next one. This one is a lot of fun. I just wish there were more!
B006FE83UE|5.0|this has been my favorite gregory peck movie, and should be in every peck fans collection. the price was so good i bought a second to give away.
0385341008|3.0|I appreciate the cost and the quick delivery but the book was described as 'new' and when I received the book it was visibly a 'use' copy. If I had wanted a used book there were several other options that would have been cheaper and just as quick, the lack of honesty is extremely disappointing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved the main character ender Wiggins. You can't help but to feel for him and be on his side
B005544TRQ|5.0|love how they keep you guessing .  Also thank you for keeping it cleaner than most shows.  Nudity and language are not important for a good plot
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I was one of the original group that wanted no part of the &#34;New&#34; Star Trek movies. I am proud to say I feel that way no more. These movies have given me emotions I have never felt in the &#34;Original&#34; movies. That mixed with the &#34;Special Effects&#34; , superb acting and writing have made me an even bigger fan of the Star Trek Universe. The movie was over 2 hours long but it felt like half that and left me wanting more. There is not a character that I do not love just as much as in the original. The newer movies seem &#34;dark&#34; but seem to add just enough humor and emotion not to overwhelm you. I would recommend this movie to any that are &#34;on the fence&#34; about seeing it. If it can attract and put tears in the eyes of my daughter who up until a few years ago refused to watch any of the old Star Trek Series OR Movies, it can make you a fan also.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is the Super-Hero movie I've been waiting for since I was ten years old, and never thought I'd see.  It was superlative.  Don't go to this movie expecting 'Citizen Kane', but if you have any sense of fun, I don't know how you couldn't enjoy it.  Keep in mind this is really a sequel, following Hulk (which I have not watched), Captain America (3 & 1/4 stars) and Thor (3 & 3/4 stars), so it helps to at least be familiar with what happens in those movies before you watch Avengers.  I really wasn't expecting that much when I walked into the Theater the first time I saw it, but was delighted to be mistaken.  Yes, you could complain that Captain America is a bit wooden (decent actor, limited part, gaps in development in his solo movie, so this character suffers slightly as a result), and the plot is a bit thin from the start (but very consistent with comic plots, so be aware this is to some degree, art imitating art - which might be disconcerting if you aren't  familiar with the characters ahead of time) but there are a lot of inside jokes and details for Marvel fans on top of the snappy patter, and some slick deceptions that I think most viewers missed, so there is some modest intellectual appeal.  I'm not much for special features, so you'll have to look elsewhere for comments on those.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I was surprised this movie did not do better at the Box Office. Honestly I watched this movie only out of lack of anything else to do. Boy was that wrong. I found it kept me wondering what was going to happen next with a lot of &#34;I didn't see that coming&#34; Movie of the year it is not, but definitely a movie worth seeing and I am glad I added it to my Sci-Fi Collection
B00D5XYY4M|5.0|I recently purchased this for my kindle and just managed to complete first chapter.  I compliment the author for having done a phenomenal job explaining the basics very well. I can't really wait to finish remaining chapters and hope to update this review of mine for a complete feedback.  For now, I am thoroughly satisified.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I love the series that netflix made based on this book so I decided to read the book.  The tv series definitely fleshes out characters and made the story more dramatic (as tv does), but the book is interesting and informative.  I came out with information and many opinions about the federal courts and prison system that I never had.  Definitely recommend.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|The application  has ran with no problems, and performs as advertised.  Runs much better than a popular weather application on my phone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is wonderful.  The story is important.  The writing is more than compelling.  It is unique and I wanted to read it again the second I finished the last word.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I had Asphalt 7 and I wasn't too impressed with it. However this game is awesome! I love the races and the cars, everything is great!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love Gillian Flynn's books.  They are beautifully written and full of suspense and turns I actually don't expect.  Perfect.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great game and smooth gameplay I recommend to get this game<br />And play it it is also fun when you connect the game to Facebook.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I an so happy I bought this album the day it came out and I have listened to it so much.  I have loved Paramore since day one with all we know is falling but I was a little sad they aren't all rock now. but what eves I'm cool with it.  Paramore Forever!!!  I hope they get nominated for a award again.
0385751532|5.0|Harrowing story of a young boy who teaches his Nazi father the ultimate lesson. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the disturbing factors of war and its effect on all involved.
6305744793|5.0|Have to say this movie was hilarious. Between Joan Cusack's con artist character and the feisty daughter played by Christina Ricci, I was in stitches.  Didn't think I would enjoy it given that I've never watched the tv series and always thought that the concept was too dark and spooky.<br /><br />***SPOILER***<br /><br />The way Wednesday Addams alters the camp play is absolutely priceless and for me the best part of the movie.  Funny but political at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great way to play about doing something wrong without getting into trouble with the curse of not being able to play with spray paint and I think it is a great good very well game!
B004EPYZT4|4.0|I'll keep this short: if you enjoy Robert E. Howard's stories, you'll enjoy this film. It's fast-paced, bloody, brutal, visually striking and often predictable--in short, a true example of sword-against-sorcery drama. Momoa is actually outstanding as Conan (visceral, cunning, menacing) and the heroine and villains do a fine job, despite being limited by the conventions of pace and plot.<br /><br />It lacks the majesty and scope of The Lord of the Rings, and the hypnotic characters and rhythm of the original Conan film, but it's an entertaining tale from a convincing Hyborean age. Four drops of molten steel.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This show is so beautifully filmed, and the acting is stellar.  Each of the characters seems fully formed and realistic.  It is a great glimpse into a bygone time.
0439023521|5.0|Great book!  Entertaining and fast paced.  It's a social commentary examining rights, freedom, democracy, reality TV, and the excesses of the rich.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Powerful story of honor, patroitism and endurance -- both mental and physical. Marcus Luttrell displayed amazing heroism and dedication to duty. His story made all my problems insignificant in comparison.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app illuminates a large area.  Actually, I downloaded it as a widget so it is readily available when I need a light source.  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to find their way in a darkened arena, e.g., the Hollywood Bowl, or find a dropped item in a movie theater, etc.
B008R14YBK|3.0|None of the songs really stick in your head, like you expect from really good pop music.  Her voice has nice energy.  Good background music while you do other things (eg housework).
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Dark fairy tails are becoming my favorites lately. It is nice to finally have a resolution to the entire story.<br />I wanted mor though. It didn't feel finished.
B00122RFOO|5.0|I basically buy anything that &#34;Van The Man&#34; puts out and recently discovered that this was not in my collection, although I did own it in vinyl and CD over the years. It's as good as anything else he has recorded. Basically I have never heard an album of his I didn't like..
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I thought the game was awesome and I cant wait to share it with family and friends across the world.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my title says it all. lots of fun. very challenging. can not wait to see what will be coming next.
B0016Q6CQI|4.0|This episode really proved that musical TV shows can work, and it did it extremely well. I love these songs and like most Buffy fans it's one of my favorite episodes.<br /><br />However I have to be honest, when just listening to the songs in isolation and not having the images to go with it the singing loses some of its luster. Not all of the cast members have especially strong voices, and that stands out a bit more when just listening to the songs. Also the bonus items of Joss and his wife singing rough versions of the some of the songs is more of an oddity than something you'll ever listen to repeatedly.<br /><br />These issues don't take away the cleverness and strength of the song and music writing. If you love the episode then there's no reason to not have this!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books in the trilogy are amazing. I could not put the books down! I am looking forward to Christians point of view books. I hope she follows through with them. Best books! Would recommend to anyone. Older age groups 18 and up of course.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Doesn't seem to be made that well, but it is very convenient to sharpen things you do not expect to get shave-sharp. From a machete or three to a small hand axe I've used it on everything I didn't really NEED a razor edge on and it's made sharpening them a breeze.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three books kept me interested the entire time. I am so happy with the ending, I truly hope she continues with Christian's point of view. I was a little crushed when his ended. I love these books! Great price and great purchase. Would recommend to anyone 18 or older.
B0063GORYU|3.0|not as automatic as I would like it to be.  I would not pay money for this game but free is ok.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I seriously LOVE this series. So happy with my purchase. I know I am a little late on reading the books, but I am obsessed! Love love LOVE this book. Would recommend to anyone.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I found it difficult to manuver around with this game.  I guess I am not much of a game player.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|It's been a long time, in my opinion, since Disney made a movie that was on par with some of the &#34;Disney classics.&#34;  This was a great movie with good music and animation to accompany an interesting plot.  Sincerely enjoyed it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is great!<br />I enjoyed playing it a lot! Easy and great for all ages. Worth it to download.
B005FPT51K|2.0|Product was returned as it was not as expected.  However, this does not mean that I will not pursue the next product by iBaby monitors when released.  Please note, the product performed as advertised; however, it did not meet my needs at this time.  I will purchase IBaby products in the future.
0393317552|4.0|There, in 3 words a Cliff-notes on this book. The homo sapiens who migrated to the Fertile Crescent got a jumpstart on the rest of the humans who did not locate there. They had the right elements to create civilization. The author makes the point that the subsequent history of stronger vanquishing weaker cultures is all a by-product of these particular humans being the first to develop farming, tools, technology, etc. Being first is good.<br /><br />One large element missed is \\"why\\". Why did hunter-gatherers evolve into farmers and eventually develop the culture that is pre-dominantly in power on this planet.<br />My answer is women and family. Women who have one or more children flourish better in a settled location instead of following the animals and seasons.<br />When it comes time to decide who is responsible for civilization as we know it (for better or worse) blame or praise women. They didn't single-handedly invent guns, germs or steel but they were the ones who said \\"Let's settle here. We can grow some food and you can hunt on the weekend.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, it made me think, and that is the best thing a book can do.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Sittin in movie theaters drives me nutz! Much rather watch a DVD with pause & reverse, then I don't miss a thing & Day-Lewis is a GREAT actor....  watch this movie just for the history of slavery factor..
B00DU74U74|5.0|I read the book and loved it.  Was a little concerned that the movie would not live up to the book, but it did.  I recommend this movie highly.  Very good!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This movie attempts to lift the veil. Remembrance happens in stages, consciousness is expansion. Consciousness is unity. There are no words, remembrance happens through the process of dreaming a life.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I'm so glad to finally find this game.  it has been a favoriate of mine for a very long time. I'm enjoying this game so much. it's Lot's of fun thank you so much for making it available to me.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Short and sweet review.......read this book you won't be disappointed!  Hilarious book, loved the characters, excellent writing, witty dialogue.  Can't wait to read more from Emma Chase.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Keeps up with the Death Punch sound! Hard fast rhythmic rock! Can't wait for volume two! Hope they keep it up
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this games gets you really thinking. and you have to be s terrific snoop to do well ... lol i love it. passes yhe time
B002BVQU5A|5.0|The beginning was abit slow, but it picks up momentum and I'm so glad I watch right to the end! Very heartwarming n touching!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Unlike Lee Child's other \\"Reacher\\" novels I had a hard time getting into \\"THE HARD WAY\\" because it started off somewhat slower & laid back. It seemed as if the author was feeding you some info but holding things back deliberately. Turns out that is all part of the story development and it actually keeps you coming back for more. So I stuck it out and soon the story changes gears and begins to pick up speed. Reacher as a character seems to be growing and adapting in new ways in this story. Yet it still is an amazing read.
B00280LYHS|5.0|That last part always makes me cry<br />They were meant for each other<br /><br />Best book ever since the lightning thief :)
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Reminded me of the Forest Gump book.  Interesting mix of characters.  Enjoyed the way they all fit into the story.
B00BB5OLCG|5.0|The whole album good but Copperhead Road is awesome.  Get this album if you are questioning yourself.  You will not regret it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A great look into the war in Iraq, from someone who lived to tell the tales. If you think you know what the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are like, read this book. It will give you a perspective that no media outlet could begin to provide all of us at home.  Chris and those he served with have removed a lot of evil from the world.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wife and I rented this quirky film about a year ago and loved it. Decided to add it to our small collection of DVDs
B000P0J024|5.0|This set is awesome!  Not only the fine songs of this group of talented musicians joining to create incredible music, but also a DVD of them performing some of the songs.  I am a huge fan of Tom Petty, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne individually.  This collection puts them all together on an impromptu collection of incredible songs and the music will make you sing and dance with it!  Best music ever performed!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game out there! It is a lot of fun. You have got to try it. Love it!!!!
0307887448|5.0|Wow.  Now this was a fantastic book.  From the beginning, I could not wait to get back to the book, from whatever it was that was tearing me away from it--friends, family, vacation... Must... Read... Book....<br /><br />I keep picking up books hoping that they'll actually transport me elsewhere -- take me to the land of the book and not left on my couch reading a book.  Where others have failed, Cline succeeded.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS<br />This book takes place in the the not-too-distant future, after the \\"Great Recession\\" has left the world a bleeding dump of what it was in the (now) past.  Trailer Parks have been built up into stacks, with RVs and mobile homes being stacked 15-20 homes high, most people have abandoned their vehicles because of the prohibitive cost of gasoline, food is a scarce resource, and fossil fuels have been burned up, leaving energy itself endangered.<br /><br />Yet, there is OASIS.  Originally designed as an \\"MMA\\" (multiple player video game), the OASIS quickly became a virtual reality for almost everyone in the world, with people \\"plugging in\\" as often and for as long as they could.  The creator of the OASIS - Jim Halliday - dies, leaving behind his fortune to whoever wins \\"the game\\" -- whoever collects the 3 keys and passes the 3 gates first.  For the next five years, no one finds even the first key... but then, it's on....<br /><br />BUT WHY'S IT GOOD?<br />Yeah it's hard to describe.  I'm not a gamer and didn't play most of the games mentioned in the book (of course I played pac man).  Halliday was born almost a decade before I was, so all of his nostalgia kind of just missed me.  I have seen several of the movies mentioned... but then again, there were a slew that I had not.  This book is not just nostalgia-crack and it's definitely not just for gamers.<br /><br />The brilliance of this book is that it's set in the not-too-distant future, realistic in many ways, with a quality of virtual reality that is probably just around the corner from today... so it's almost not even sci-fi or fantasy.  Yet through OASIS, the participant can do just about anything--visit planets described in books, be a wizard or a fairy, actually play a character in a movie, even go to school--anything someone can think of aside from the necessary bodily functions... of course, all for a cost (actual money).  So, at the beginning of the book, the main character, Wade Watts, doesn't have access to anything.  Essentially, just some kiddie video games, the public library, and school.  But he's smart, resourceful, and willing to devote serious amounts of time to the game.<br /><br />But the brilliance of this book is the relatability -- Wade Watts is some shy, dorky kid, who is insecure and only able to come out of his shell behind the safety of the virtual reality lens.  But somehow this shy, dorky, insecure kid is the hero of the book, and somehow you believe it and root for it.  And somehow maybe it feels a little bit like you.<br /><br />But the brilliance of this book is that it abounds with descriptions of games and movies that at least some of its readers (e.g., me) have never played, seen, or even heard of, and yet it's so. freaking. fascinating.  I just ate it all up.<br /><br />But the brilliance of this book is that, when I wasn't reading... I started to almost believe that some of what was happening in the book (the \\"future\\" stuff) was possible, happening, present.<br /><br />So yeah, I absolutely loved this book.  I always hope to read a book that takes me there and makes me believe that it's real, and makes me feel connected to the characters, and makes me actually care about the outcome.  And here it was.<br /><br />I *really* hope there's a movie someday!<br />FIVE out of five stars.<br /><br />**This and other other reviews can be found at AllBookReviewer.blogspot.comm today... so it's almost not even sci-fi or fantasy.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Another must have app that I use on all my android devices. There are other file browsers out there but this is the one I always go back to. A very powerful tool for accessing pretty much anything on your phone or tablet, a shared network drive, an sd card, cloud drive etc... just be careful not to delete anything if you don't know what you're doing.
0385523394|4.0|Review based on ARC.<br /><br />This is one of those books that was entertaining, informative, and infuriating.  Piper Kerman wrote a memoir that reads almost like a diary.  This is both a compliment and a criticism.  The problem with the non-diary-diary format is that it was scattered, unfocused, and anecdotal.  The good thing about the non-diary-diary format, however, is that it was interesting, personal, and present.<br /><br />So, the story.  Kerman makes massively stupid and selfish decisions in her young life, as young ladies are wont to do, and years later, she begins to pay for it.  a little.  Her involvement in large-scale drug trafficking ultimately lands her in inside a minimum security federal prison, which she proceeds to detail in a manner that is, at turns, entertaining and lecturing.  There's not really much more to the plot:  she learns about being in prison, she learns about the people there, she learns about the impact of her actions.  Thus, a memoir.<br /><br />What works is Kerman's tone, most of the time.  She takes an equally amusing and reverent tone in describing her prison-mates and describes heartbreaking, enraging, and amusing stories alike.  Kerman's own appearance and naivety land her, fortunately, friends with some of the more powerful women in the prison and, to hear Kerman tell it, she herself ends up being one of the most popular prisoners to ever grace Danbury's walls (this is a literal exaggeration of the tone that many of the anecdotes presented -- she never, of course, ever states anything quite so ludicrous).<br /><br />Kerman flits between anecdotes, grand philosophical rants, political lectures, and summaries, which unorganized presentation was, at many points, annoying and disrupted the flow of the tale.  However, Kerman's voice was consistent throughout these variances, making the sudden switches more tolerable to read.<br /><br />Kerman mentions in passing that her year had its rough moments... but aside from dealing with her Grandmother's illness, stays far on the surface of these times.  Which leads the reader to believe that her time in Danbury wasn't so bad--that maybe she was just a \\"whiney privileged white girl.\\"  In reality, there were probably times when it was terrible for *her* (and not just one of the other girls there), and maybe she didn't want to relive those in her memoir.  Or maybe she didn't want to be too depressing for her readers.  Or maybe just being incapable of leaving the walls for such an extended period of time was rough.  She managed to remain a picky eater, looked years younger after LEAVING prison, worked out, got a lot of daytime, watched movies, had friends.... yeah, I know a lot of girls who'd kill for her crappy year.  But, as I say, maybe there was some stuff under the surface that she didn't divulge.<br /><br />All in all, the book gets THREE AND A HALF stars (bumped to 4 on non-half-star sites for its importance) because Kerman tells a good story and creates a few vivid characters (though a few others are glaringly 2-dimensional), and because the story she is telling and the impact it has had and can have is important.  Important!  For any person who knows no-one who has been to jail or prison (even a \\"swanky\\" minimum security prison like Danbury), or anyone who thinks that prisoners cannot be rehabilitated and/or do not have any good in them, this book is a MUST.<br /><br />For the rest of us who've had harder lives, I say go ahead and read it if it sounds interesting.  It certainly is not a bad book and, even though it's a bit disorganized, it tells an interesting story.<br /><br />**side note: I am both interested in watching the tv show to see some of the characters come to life, and adamantly opposed in case my fears that it has created caricatures of very real people's lives, pain, and struggles are justified.<br /><br />This and other reviews can be found at AllBookReviewer.blogspot.comher Grandmother's illness, stays far on the surface of these times.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Love the wisdom. I've read parts of it again and again. Insight into sports betting and entrepenureal spirit. Highly recommend
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Finding books that I like read are easy to find, cost for the book are reasonable. I really didn't read a whole lot until I got my Kindle. I didn't read this much in School.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|it was awesome it was the best movie i loved it i wish it never  ends it was soo awesome loved it
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love all the Star Trek movies and this was no exception. I think its great how they mix traditional Star Trek and new together. Wonderful!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus features the first 5 books/novellas in Hugh Howey's Silo Series. It's just something to remember when reading the Omnibus version.<br /><br />The story starts out fast and leaves you with a number of questions right out of the chute. But once the first chapter is finished, it does take on a slower, more descriptive pace and most of your questions are answered by the conclusion.<br /><br />While I agree that some of the early plot isn't necessary to the story (likely why some reviewers couldn't get past the first quarter of the book), it turns out to be a great, suspenseful read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game! I wish it were longer though. Lol didn't last me very long. So mentally stimulating!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a unique story idea!  I couldn't put it down!  Haunting....it really stays with you after you've finished reading it.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I was concerned that this would be a really cheap looking edition with no special features and I could not have been more wrong! Accompanying this terrific DVD are a slew of amazing special features including commentaries, making of documentaries and another Edgar Wright feature, Dead Right! I would recommend this edition to any fans of Hot Fuzz or of Edgar Wright himself.<br /><br />Happy Shopping!
B00EB85AP2|3.0|Twenty years ago it was hard to find a recording of The Bells with top-notch Russian forces, although a very good one under Evgeny Svetlanov was available on Melodiya, and still is, in somewhat rough Soviet sound. Since then, the field has burgeoned, and Svetlanov even added a live performance on ICA that is superb in every way - it does full justice to Rachmaninov's choral masterpiece. There are a handful of other contenders in modern sound, including Noseda (a bit cautious), Bychkov (live, very idiomatic, with a particularly sensitive tenor), and Pletnev (fine all around, more refined than dramatic). As the lead reviewer notes, what's missing is an account from the most prominent Russian conductors based in the uK, Gergiev, Petrenko, and Jurowski. But we aren't suffering from lack of choice.<br /><br />Rattle's main advantage is twofold. The minor advantage is that he's paired The Bells with Rachmaninov's last orchestral work, the vibrant Symphonic Dances, in case a buyer wants both pieces together. On the other hand, collectors who love the Symphonic Dances are likely to possess two or three copies already (my favorite comes from Petrenko and the Royal LIverpool Phil. on Avie). Rattle's major advantage is the glorious Berlin Phil., which rarely records any substantial Russian music; you have to go back to the Karajan era to find a Tchaikovsky symphony.<br /><br />The Berliners come through as expected, so if that whets your appetite, Rattle's interpretations are refined and detailed. EMI's sound highlights the orchestra's beautiful soloists, and the Berlin Radio Chorus is resounding, although their Russian is unintelligible - no great drawback since that's the case on most of the other leading recordings. All three vocal soloists are excellent, the palm going to Mikhail Petrenko, a star from the Mariinsky Opera. Although she's in her early fifties, the Slovak soprano L'uba Organosova has retained much of her lovely lyric tone, and several of her rivals exhibit considerably more Slavic wobble.<br /><br />But it's not quite a case of \\"what's not to like?\\" Rattle misses a great deal in the Symphonic Dances. He underinflects every movement, preferring to proceed correctly and almost blandly. There isn't a hint of seduction or wooziness in the saxophone solo in the first dance; the sharp, etched-glass chords that open the second dance aren't accented. Rhythms are square instead of springy and dance-like. A momentary comparison with Petrenko shows up Rattle's silken refinement for what it is. If you already own a better recording, this one adds very little to the program, making the CD's total timing short shrift. (The most interesting pairing for The Bells come on the Noseda and live Svetlanov disc.)<br /><br />Overall, Rattle's tendency to be too civilized comes into play, either a little (The Bells) or a lot (Symphonic Dances). How you feel about this will probably determine how you feel about the recording as a whole. I found it hard to stay engaged all the way through.nsiderably more Slavic wobble.<br /><br />But it's not quite a case of \\"what's not to like?\\" Rattle misses a great deal in the Symphonic Dances.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love it.  Play it all the time.  Has a lot of her hits and new songs are great too.  Would recommend it.
B00979CS50|5.0|Ever the musical chameleon, Neil Young never rests on his laurels, and always does exactly what he wants.  What he wants today apparently, is to get back to the feedback laden grungy sound he forged with his band Crazy Horse back in the 90's with albums like \\"Ragged Glory\\" and even earlier with gems like \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\".  This is a sprawling 2 disc extravaganza with Young at his heaviest no holds barred, mostly heavy stomping music that should appeal to anyone who likes the more rock oriented side of his catalouge. There are several tracks here that clock in at well over the 15 minute mark.  These are full of Young And Company's patented sloppy jams.  For many bands this would be a distorted mess, but Young has always had a way of making simple jams sound cool, and as always, Crazy Horse is the perfect foil to Young's meandering guitar exploits.  Most of the lyrics on this one seem to be a reflection of Neil's past and the generation that spawned him.  Yes, there is some repetitiveness to some of these tunes, and they probably could have been pared down a bit, but overall I think the lyrics and messages are poignant vintage Young.  Your enjoyment of this album will most likely depend on which side of Mr. Young you like.  There are no ballads or acoustic songs to be found here.  This is rock n roll as only Neil Young and Crazy Horse can pull off and I think it may be one of the best albums of his career.
1401216676|5.0|I love everything about this graphic novel. The pictures and colors, the storyline, and the fact that it's a hardcover.... amazing! Good price too! It's a love/hate thing; I love this stuff but hate that I love it so much, that I've become addicted to collecting more graphic novels! But I guess I don't mind. I read reviews on this particular story on the Joker and I am very pleased to have bought it.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|It's pretty obvious that the Author didn't tell everything about his strategies in this book. After all, by purchasing the book I didn't expect to find all of them, common sense. So no regret, and at the end the book worth reading.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first story was... decent... although the author got stuck on one word... &#34;hot&#34;.  Everything was... &#34;hot&#34;.  He was hot, she was hot, sex was hot, they looked hot, the roommate was hot... OMG save me from &#34;hot&#34; unless it's a weather prediction!  :/<br /><br />The second book I found that no one talks to anyone... they all &#34;murmur&#34;.  The entire book is filled with murmuring characters.  The redundancy of certain words starts to take over the reading.  It's as though I am listening to a speaker who constantly says &#34;um&#34;.  You can't concentrate on the story, only count how many times a word appears.  &#34;... I murmured at him... he murmured to me... his dad murmured to me and we ALL murmured to one another!&#34;  I finished the &#34;hot&#34; book but I'm not sure I will be able to finish the murmur book to see what the third book word is.  :/  So distracting.  UGH!
B005544TRQ|4.0|I like the program to some extent.  The characters don't seem to interact as well as they do in White Collar.  The lead character seems to act like his intern should already know things and helps from the background, but not in obvious ways.  Worth watching.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Is an awesome game, very entertaining, although it is also very revenue oriented. If you want to make real progress you have to spend too much money buying stuff online. Other than that, is great.
0446573027|2.0|When I received the book it looked good. So I am just getting to reading the book and opened it up and the first 44 pages are gone and it is too late to return.  Not very happy about it.  I will now look inside and out of the used books I receive from now on.
B00177Y9ZM|5.0|New condition, disc and box. Love how I can rip it on my computer and my iPhone. Bought it new from Amazon all under $8 with delivery. Get your's now iPhone users. Also plays in Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center and iTunes. Yep Yep!
0385349947|3.0|Sheryl Sandberg seems way too concerned about pleasing everyone. Case in point: her temporary ban on PowerPoint during Facebook meetings where she is present. That's visionary - eradicating this insufferable program that serves as the training wheels of public speaking for disorganized middle managers. Has anyone ever enjoyed or \\"leaned in\\" to listen to a Powerpoint presentation? But once she realized employees had interpreted the PowerPoint ban as a company-wide policy - not a bad idea, especially considering it's the epitome of a tired product sold by a stodgy company (Microsoft) that Sandberg's two most recent employers (Google and Facebook) bend over backwards trying not to be - Sandberg canceled the ban. The book provides little insight into Sandberg's managerial style. Elsewhere she's portrayed as a corporate badass, deftly bridging the gap between Gen Xers like herself and the legions of millennials Silicon Valley companies like Facebook employs. But aside from her discussions about how she mentors female employees considering pregnancy, there's not much here about her management style. That's a shame since she's the (still) rare female COO of one of America's most high-profile companies. If she had provided more insight into how she manages, that would be something worth leaning in to hear.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think this is one of the best apps I downloaded. Want to keep an eye on your battery level, or want to see how much longer it's going to take to get a full charge, this is your app and its free. Well worth the download.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use this in a daily basis... I'm even considering to purchase the PRO version so I can have the 'Scientific' calculator for my kid's homework...<br /><br />I'll recommended it...
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|But I don't care for all the offers to spend coins. Also using the tilt steering method was hard for me and my child.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't stop playing with it. Is definitely better than the first one (don't get me wrong, version 1 was very good too).
B00AECGQF2|2.0|Liked the toca kitchen and this one is along the same lines but the actions and the characters were kind of odd. Not fun.
B0063IH60K|4.0|One of the few good solitaire games I've found for the Kindle. I like it a lot... I will definitely recommend it...
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is an excellent series.  I absolutely enjoy the drama and comedy in each show. I am hooked!! I now have to watch the following seasons.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I've use it on my Kindle HD and it works very good. Never had problems with it. Easy to use...
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I didn't have a lot of expectations when it came to graphics for this game on my kindle fire. Then it completely blew my mind the scenery was breathtaking! I noticed all those little details in the background like the planes and skies and on and on.the game as many other have pointed out is realistic when it comes to driving tough it still has that asphalt 7 feel to it with all the passageways you could take and the super long jumps which are awesome. Asphalt 8 and blitz brigade are prime examples when things are done right with not only the game itself but the environment around it. Btw facelift whatever game engine you where using for this game how come you didn't  use it gangstar Vegas. A game I hope will be getting many updates for kindle fire hint hint
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You want a game to have a very good time? This is it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />And not to mention the availability of travel the world every month in a different country...<br /><br />My kids and I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Definitely recommend it..... :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great and sad at times. It was a well written book. Suzaanne did a phenomenal job and is a overall an great  author.<br /> The book was sad. Especially when rue dies. Katniss and Peeta compete against other tributes and love. Katniss is a strong independent teenage girl who hopes to survive and win.<br />  She won with Peeta and they became happily ever after together. I cant wait to read number two!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It makes a super good mental excercise to do in a daily basis. Keeps my mind sharp. Love to make competitions with my kids by timing them, therefore, helping them to keep their minds sharp..<br /><br />I'll definitely recommended it.....
B007REV4T8|5.0|Casino Royale was a great reboot. Quantum of Silence was a bit of mis-step. Skyfall hits the mark of what a Bond movie should be, Perhaps a little more humour next time around to take some of what was best in the earlier Bond movies. Farewell, Dame Judi Dench, a great Bond M. Thanks to all who bought this excellent movie to our screens.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game itself is very good for the kids.<br /><br />If you have a plan of Unlimited internet access...this game is for you.. since it needs to be connected to the Internet in order to run.
0553801473|5.0|I don't remember who to thank for introducing me to the Ice and Fire series. Once I open the book, I hate to put it down. Unfortunately, I am a slow reader. Great characters, great story line. I was very surprised to love it. I usually hate mediveal settings but this one works for me. I usually hate books with too many characters because they are confusing and most authors have problems properly developing a single character much less multiple characters. How Mr. Martin keeps all these plates in the air is fascinating.
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|Didn't like it too much. Is just another link to the GMail page.... I will still use my bookmark as usual...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Help anyone understand what taking care of any living animal is about. Learning tasks and getting them done right. I love this game MY friend showed me it and I'm in love with horses.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I can't wait for the next book in this series, the first 2 have been very good, I'll be adding Patrick Rothfuss to my list of authors, that I follow.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game to have. The only thing I'd change about it are the quests or the expenses for the rare dragons. Other than that, it's a must have
B000ZJTPLG|3.0|I have AC30 and Lead versions and both cover my music territory. I purchased this just to try out different Amplug model. Soundwise, the simple way to describe it is It sits between AC30 and Lead with a little bit of scooped mid (not much), not so clean but not too Leady (if that's a word) typical to Classic Rock sound as advertised.<br /><br />However, the bottom end feels mushy not as clear as the other two models or the real amp (I know its not meant to replace the real amp). My real amps are Bugera V22 and Ibanez Valbee plus some pedals. I use Schecter C1, MIM Strat and Ibanez RG270DX loaded with dimarzio pickups with this. All have same bottom end sound quality. Neverthelsess, The mid and high are good for Classic Rock sound.<br /><br />In saying that, I plan on selling this because I feel that AC30 and Lead are just enough to cover my late night practice sessions.<br /><br />Been playing for 15 years and experimenting with different sounds (guitars, pedals, amps) since around 10 years ago when I can afford it (buy, resell and trade mostly, and settled to the one I like)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a fun game that can be played without paying!  Woo hoo!<br /><br />Of course, you CAN pay, if you wish, and speed up building times, buy special units, get cool powerups, etc., but you'll do just fine without.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I would probably give this game at least a three star rating but I can never get the last free item to complete a room. It's very hard to even get a bingo anymore. But I don't want to connect to facebook and it just seems like unless I do, I will never complete the rooms so it is a bit of a futile effort. Oh well, it is free and I only play it in moments of extreme boredom...which isn't often!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|If you are a fan of hip hop, then this album is a must for your collection. He constantly reminds me of a young Jay-z the way every track has hidden meanings, yet he makes every song different. Showing his flexibility to adjust to different beats as well as speaking on real issues. This is real hip hop.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a good game to escape into.  Excited for the next one.  Makes you think, but not so challenging that you want to give up.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Combining MaJong and a rubix cube...simply genius!!  I find myself playing this half the night!!  Love that you can rotate the cube in all directions for when you get hung up on one side.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game... a little challenging and best part is that it is free! Would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to kill 30 minutes
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Something for everyone<br />Teyla for the Guys<br />Shepherd for the Girls<br />Action and Suspense for everyone<br />Good all around Historical Science Fiction
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game I can't put it down ecept when they want money then it goes down.so play this game you will like.
159420411X|4.0|This is an interesting book that dives into the problems surrounding statistics and forecasting. It makes a good explanation about the different nature of problems and how hard (or how easy) it's to analyze the data, the dynamics of the system and how the problem is best tackled. An interesting subject addressed in the book is the the human factor, that is, how our individual bias distorts our analyzes and creates blinds spots. It provides a very good read.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is a good calculator &amp; you can't beat free. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it can be a little slow. It isn't that slow. Maybe a split second, but it is noticeable. Other then that I have no complaints. I would have given it 4 &amp; a half stars if possible. Since it was free and works good.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This movie is just as good as the day I saw it at the cinema back in the 90's.  One of my personal favourites and I'm more than happy to have my own 'Groundhog Day' watching it again and again.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|This book is written in a way than anyone can be convinced of the methodology of the &#34;diet&#34;. Because it is not a diet! Just a really sensible, logical way to eat.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I also got 3 months' free Netflix which makes the chromecast $11 for me, what can beat this price? It's cool and handy to cast youtube, netflix, etc. to the TV, the only concern about this product is, the wifi signal can be better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it!! This game is ver addicting; watch out for the pull knto despicable me and its crazy fun! Only downside is having to purchase things to move forward once youve mastered it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love playing this game the only problem I have is that your information doesn't carryover to the other systems you have to start over.
B00DY951RQ|2.0|All great artists have relatively barren (or, if you prefer, fallow) periods--it's nothing to get strung out about, just something to acknowledge.  What this collection does is really confirm our sense that, yes, around 1970 Dylan was on sabbatical from most of his musical energy and talent.  The issue is a little confused because around 1967-68 there was sort of a fake dry-spell which turned out to be tremendously rich (The Basement Tapes & associated material--wish they'd released some of this).  But \\"Self Portrait\\" really was a pretty bad album.  There are a few great tracks (covers + \\"The Mighty Quinn\\"), and many weak ones.  At two disks, bulked out with ho-hum concert recordings, it seemed to be scraping for material.<br /><br />But there was more--and worse.  Which is where Columbia's revenge album, \\"Dylan,\\" came from.  In the years since, other bits and bobs have been dug up from the period--a few wonderful.  But now, a whole 35 more tracks?  What could these be?<br /><br />Mostly junk.  Not really awful junk--just stuff worse than what was actually released.  The terrific thing about Dylan bootlegs is that he occasionally left \\"Blind Willie McTell,\\" \\"She's Your Lover Now,\\" or \\"Positively Van Gogh\\" on the cutting room floor.  But this collection gives you the sense that this time round Dylan-as-editor was on top of the situation, even if Dylan-as-songwriter was not.  Sometimes the rejected version we find here is nice in its own right (\\"Went to See the Gypsy\\"), sometimes it is not (\\"Time Passes Slowly\\").  Often, it just seems redundant.  \\"I Threw It All Away,\\" is a sound-alike of the released version; \\"Alberta\\" is a good song that we already have in two different versions on \\"Self Portrait.\\"  All the songs marked \\"Without Overdubs\\" sound anti-climactic: the drums are the main things gone, and it makes you realize how much the drums did for a song like \\"Days of 49.\\"  And if you doubt that Dylan was in artistic decline in this period, just compare the ploddingversion of \\"House Carpenter\\" on this album with the harrowing take he did of the song in 1961.  In the middle are some OK surprises--\\"Annie's Going to...,\\" \\"Thirsty Boots.\\"<br /><br />All that said, it is an interesting collection to listen to if you're already interested in Dylan.  It fills out our picture of his career at a somewhat mysterious period of artistic retrofit and rebuilding--there's kind of a \\"back to the drawing board\\" feeling to this work.  ...And there is one really beautiful hidden gem: \\"Pretty Saro.\\"

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have not used this game but all my grandchildren have used it--they like it very much--especially the 5 year old
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Oh yeah ! Stephen Stills is back at his roots ! Rockin`cool like in his early days . Such a powerful expression like never before ? Swinging Blues-Rock from the best ! Seems like a fantastic relationship with Manassas, which ever was my favourite Stephen Stills( not to talk about CS&N) ? I guess Stephen always is superb, when he`s in co-operation with other musicians, (like Manassas and The Rides or even CSN & Y )and not muscians that \\"only\\" play for him as session musicians .I followed his musical works without any exception from `68 on till today and must say, that he is my absolute favourite Rock`n`Roll player and singer for all these years and now he`s crowning this with that fabulous new CD !! Thanks !So keep on twanging your Gretsch for ever, dear Mr.Stills !
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Looking, you'll probably find it,  or some kind of link to make you think.  For sure does what I expect
B00BP4X3W2|1.0|had to turn it off without watching couldn't hear it. I would  like to have closed caption option. thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is not like the other stupid apps where you can't do zilch. This game<br />is more. Except I do not like the Nether Reactor. I think you have the perfect performance played all on this game (Hint buy Pocket Editor; It's free and you can<br />get the stuff you need without crafting it) If you like to live in a life with trees, zombies,skeletons, and spiders, then this is a good app to embark on an amazing adventure beyond the bricks. So don't be the kind of person who thinks Blockcraft 2 is a good waste of your dollars or coins get this app today. No matter if it is $6.99. So what if it is dumb, Notch is making it look like the bomb of all the previous versions of Minecraft. Like the portable PC Edition of Minecraft. I myself was determined to slay the mobs who attempted to pursue my flesh (after watching some guys who did Minecraft on YouTube) Don't let anyone fool you this app is Boss!!!!
B002APU580|3.0|Decent film but reinterprets Austen as though she'd actually approve of young people running in the rain, clothes clinging, hearts ruling heads. In all of her novels, reason and \\"sense\\" beat emotionality. Jane Austen would never have directed this film. If you like Knightley in period pieces, watch The Duchess. If you like Austen, watch the BBC Pride & Prejudice, Emma Thompson's Sense & Sensibility, or Roger Mitchell's Persuasion.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game was my CHILDHOOD on the sega CD. Im so glad they remade this for kindle fire and i dont care how old you are. This game is fit for all classic sonic fans. Kinda dissapointed you cant to the &quot;secret message&quot; . If you dont know what i mean by that look up on Youtube: Sonic CD secret message. But it is quite disturbing... anyways this game is mostly like i remember with all the secrets and such, just for a touch screen. It is WORTH THE MONEY.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I wanted something to use for remote recordings and this fit the bill quite well.  I already own two great sets of speakers so I know the company and I have been very happy with this mixer.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app to sleep every night, sometimes I get such good sleep I don't want to get up. I absolutely love it. I bought this back when it was the FAotD, so far my only &quot;complaint&quot; is that you can't save custom times for the hot off time. I have it run for three and a half hours, it gets very tedious to type it every night. Overall two thumbs up and 5 *'s, great app, I absolutely love it.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Great album. Comes with two coasters which is just awesome. Favorite song by far is St. James. Feels classic. yolo
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I was hoping for a more realistic, PC type version of email, but this was only a small step above above the free \\"Email\\" app which lets me check all my accounts in one spot.  Not worth it, and I don't use it.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|It's an enjoyable read. I devoured each of the five books, one after the other. I loved the 1870's London setting and the alternate universe where werewolves and vampires had not only come out but were valued members of society. The mythology of this world and its mechanics were very well thought out. Highly recommended.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a great book. Megan and Conner meet & get married in Vegas. They really don't believe in love & think a marriage of convenience will work for them, but without realizing it along the way someone starts falling in love
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I'm kind of out of order on these novels but this one was a great read. On past friends coming together for fallen comrades; and how in sync you stay with them even after years have past. Don't miss this one.

B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|... but what JJ Abrams has done to Star Trek really makes that a moot question.  He's<br />turned it into a kids movie and removed the wonder and morality of Star Trek and<br />replaced it with soppy one-liners and computer graphics - some of which are pretty<br />cool but in a year or two will look boring, just like the original Star Trek's effects<br />look boring now.  The problem is with the old Star Trek there was something more<br />to the show that people still watch, but with the New Star Trek it will not be worth<br />watching because the whole venture is of cheap quality.<br /><br />Really terrible ... only a testiment to what Gene Roddenberry created and how people<br />are still willing to go see these movies just based on hope.
B000A6T262|5.0|All the DVDs played very nice I would highly recommend it ! I like this DVD set very much !
1455526959|2.0|I have now read this and \\"The Drop\\" from this author. I was hopeful after hearing a positive review on NPR. I ended up hoping for something great and literally groaning out loud from the painfully ridiculous garbage this author uses to make his character \\"cool\\". It is fodder for cop groupies. I had enough interest in the plot to stick with it till the end but it only got worse. The whole rogue cop, breaking the rules to solve the case (at the expense of other's rights) deal makes me gag. No thanks. Done with Connelly.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|The shield was hard to remove from the paper. It kept sticking. Tore in a couple of places. I know by having zagg shields in the past, they are not supposed to do that. It looks awful on my iphone and never smoothed out. I even waited the full 24 hours to let it set. That was the easiest part of the whole process.. I went to remove the back shield, because it looked so bad, and it left sticky tape EVERYWHERE!!!  Will never buy a ZAGG from amazon or this seller again.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I received this to try to make my old Kindle charge. I still had problems with my Kindle, so I upgraded to the HD I have used it on my Kindle HD for about a month and a half & the connecter has already started to bend. I have been very careful with it and it is still working. I use it with a Powerfast for Accelerated Charging and it charges in about 4 hours.  I got this the day  after  Customer Service ordered it. I believe if I have trouble with this Amazon will stand behind it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|As a working artist (painter) I found your book very uplifting.  I have made a very satisfying career by following my imagination along with putting in far more than my 10,000 hours.  I enjoyed your book very much and will. Recommend it widely.
B00EHAIHWM|2.0|Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party have kind of mirrored each other in a really odd way. Both bands put out great debuts and followed them up with very fine second albums which build on the ideas of the first. Then they put out a third which just kind of faltered. Which led both to a fourth album, which while attempting to recapture the vibrancy and style of the earlier work, just sounds like a hollow attempt rather than anything really driven by artistic motivation.<br /><br />Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe this album is covertly brilliant and it'll take me a while to figure that out. But I'm pretty sure that's not the case.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is a very entertaining show.  We love the character development.  You really care for these people and their stories.  Keeps you wanting more!
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|This is a great album. Wish I could give it four and a half stars, but I can't.<br /><br />I've always had a problem with Vampire Weekend. A lot of their work seems too programatic, too by the numbers and calculated. This isn't. There's a lot of interesting stuff going on here. Is it still a bunch of privileged white boys writing songs about their time in the Ivy League? Mostly, yes. But they weave so many novel pop ideas (lots of very Baroque ideas at that) into simple pop songs that I'm willing to overlook it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good, clean fun. Good rerpresentation of the original classic. Great graphics, gameplay and sound. Worth the small price tag.  Get it now, you wont regret it.
B009DALSSG|5.0|this controller is great for call of duty or black ops 2. short throw triggers.sticks are acurate and tight.holds very comfortable...ONLY issue is the cable is only 6 feet long.. will need a usb extension if need of a longer cable..

B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you're into watching tv shows about mythical creatures and phenomenons, Supernatural does it better.  Based on the heart and soul of the myths and folk lore come brilliantly crafted episodes filled with the paranormal in graphic detail.  Plus the two main characters, brothers named Sam and Dean, are pretty hunky too!

B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series has terrific acting with twists and turns! Each actor has a distinct personality. I do wish Alicia would give another chance to Will. He is more sensitive than she realizes and really loves her.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|i love this movie,i had never seen it before,i was visting my sisters and they was telling me about,i knew i would be able to find it on Amazon,the services was good and the dvd plays very well.

B00B78AIV0|5.0|I purchased this book based on a recommendation from a friend and I was not disappointed. From the beginning, this book kept my attention and I did want to put it down. I laughed, cried, and got angry with the characters. You will not be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Ever since it updated I keep getting string not found when I try to load the game. I have tried looking online and sending error reports to fix it but still nothing.
B005LAII9O|2.0|This movie had UNREALISTIC written all over it.  The pot-heads LOVED this movie thinking it was the coolest thing ever....lol<br /><br />The opening diatribe highlighting marijuana was dumb...we get it....Oliver Stone embraces marijuana.  What compelled him to come up with this entire story is beyond me<br /><br />The love-fest between the girl and two drug-dealers was nonsensical and unrealistic.  We witnessed no drama between those 2 guys?  How convenient to push through the movie.<br /><br />The Buddha versus evil duality represented by both characters was another cheap way of pushing the story through and through....<br /><br />Salma Hayak is constantly playing these sexy, pretentious, \\"classy\\", powerful entitled women - it's so predictable and stupid.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro was the only bright-spot of this film portraying the apathetic hit-man.<br /><br />The end was stupid and unaccomplished, for a lack of a better word.......They live happily ever after on an island loving one another.  This movie was a crime-thriller right....?  So end it in crime-thriller fashion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun! It really makes you think. Some of the levels are pretty challenging and I couldn't help thinking to myself that I feel like Sherlock while solving each of the puzzles =) The app is awesome and it is free!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very entertaining the characters keep you engaged and the combination of Mike Ross and Harvey Specter is absolutely genius. Can't wait for the next season to be available on Prime.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|very entertaining... graphics great and the story line is very intriguing.  I need more of this game! Spent many hours trying to solve the mystery!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have never read anything from this author so it was a risk.  But it turned out it was  risk worth taking.  The characters were fully developed, and what I thought would be a giveaway at the beginning turned out to be quite a surprise at the end.  It was a change of pace in reading for me and I expect will read more from Ms. Moriarty.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|I thought it'd be a lot funnier. I had high hopes. It was similar to Shaun of the Dead in that it was supposed to be a subtle comedy with gore in it - but the part missing was mostly the comedy. I think I laughed one time. At the end I was just ready for it to be over with. It wasn't the worst I've watched, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game, seemed a little short. Want more. Great graphics,hard but not to hard. I would like to know if updates will be available.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wonderful book. Couldn't put it down once I started. Growing up in the 80's brought a lot of images back for me! Especially walking into Aladdins Castle with the greatest hint of all... A $5 bill :)
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|A wonderful escape into a time much simpler than ours.<br />An Engaging journey into the lives of these lovable characters.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|It was an interesting story but very depressing.  The amount of people hired to hunt him down didn't make sense or the relationship he had with the gal.
B0063GORYU|3.0|So far I have not won a game. But it is fun to play I will keep trying to figure out how to win. This is why I only rated it 3 stars
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars because it just wasn't as good as the LOTR series. While still an awesome experience it left me with the feeling like it left something out. It was missing something, and felt a bit rushed at times.<br /><br />I would recommend this though, just go into knowing that this isn't an exact remake of the book!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version of this app is horrible. I am deleting it. I had the old version for more than a year,  it was great. Now it sucks.  Don 't bother to download.
B00BDXM9JI|4.0|A friend of mine gave me this book. I was sceptical at first. I'm a mystery addict and this was clearly  not a mystery. But after reading the praise on the cover and discovering that the author had also penned a TV series called \\"Cold Feet\\", which I was a huge fan of,  I decided to give it a go.<br />A good move. I romped my way through this book and enjoyed every page. The concept is nothing new - on the surface it's a will-they-won't they rom-com, each chapter dealing with the same day every year from 1988, when they first meet, up to 2006.<br />But what makes it stand out is the interplay between Emma and Dex, the two main characters. By the end of the book you can't help feeling you know them and like them and would feel quite happy to sit and chat with either of them.It's both funny and  painful to follow them as they grow from naive young graduates into fully-fledged human beings, with all the hiccups and hurdles that most of us can relate to.<br />No, I haven't seen the movie and have no desire to either. A movie of this book seemed like a bad idea from the start.  The reviews seem to back-up my trepidation.<br />So, all in all a nice book.<br />Now, it's back to mysteries.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Great movie and follow up to the fellowship of the ring.  Movie looks incredible on blu-ray and the sound has vastly improved over the DVD version as well.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This version of missile defense is a great way to clear a little time between classes or appointments. The ability to upgrade and repair gives this some replayability. Good game but simple.
B008602KQI|5.0|We enjoyed the book better, but the effects were good and the actors did a great job. I had not watched. It was my first time this past Saturday, sad I know :)
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Really enjoy the game. Have to use my brain and pay attention to what I am doing<br /><br />Everyone should try this gamee

148951418X|5.0|Very useful and necessary, easily to undrestand, pleasand reading. Opens up the streets of creativity. I recommend it to everyone.
B000J103PC|5.0|When I first saw it I thought, Princess Diaries, and then a different take throughout the movie. It was definitely awakening and well put together, especially when the secretary got down personal with her boss in the limo :o
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|The reason I gave this book a 5 star rating was that when I first started reading it I couldn't put it down. It is a great children series and I would recommend it to everyone all ages!
B005V5WBFG|2.0|Deleted this product after a few days.Was not what I expected and drained my battery in the phone.Good luck with it.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|No scratches on the case or the CD, music doesn't skip. Definitely a great album!! I highly recommend it! :D
B000HL2J0G|5.0|its a little tongue-in-cheek -- but it holds up well and isnt a show that should only be replayed in your brain versus actually watching it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I absolutely love my chromecast.  It has been great for streaming Netflix and youtube videos.  It is simple in its design and I am confident that Google will be updating it to be even better and work with more services.  I will be buying these as gifts for many of my friends and family this holiday season!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My wife, daughter and I all love playing this game.  Very easy to navigate and tons of levels to keep you busy.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Pleasant game.  Nice graphics and music.  Parents should be aware that the game is always urging you to do things that cost money.  Some of these are presented as &quot;homework&quot; and may not be possible in the time given without buying something.  You can use this as an exercise in building sales resistance.  Also, the payoffs are so lame when you take a chance on something (treasure chests or &quot;mystery seeds&quot;) that it might serve as an anti-gambling lesson.  I enjoy building my reef but I wish I could just shut off all the tasks sometimes.  I did turn off the jukebox sound effects.
B002XHN776|4.0|I've slowly turned into a fan.  I'm always hesitant when you have a singer/actor trying to make rock music, but Jared Leto is no joke.  Some of the other albums are a little better, but this is still a much better than most of the garbage being produced today.
1401942601|5.0|Very user friendly. I enjoy mixing several oracle decks for readings and this one works very well with others. The first of its kind.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Comes in a very nice box set.  How could you not like it?  I think that this one of the best television series ever produced.
0316228583|5.0|A Casual Vacancy is structured like a Victorian novel: many characters written in the omniscient point of view so that the author can slip in and out of the minds of each character. The book is complex and multilayerd. JKR begins with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a councilman in the small down of Pagford. His death causes ripples to move through the cauldron of pettiness that is Pagford revealing the truth behind the facades of many of the most prominent members of the community. This book comes the closest of any I've read in years of replicating the experience of being a psychotherapist, of learning what most lives are really about behind their appearances. JKR's psychological acumen is outstanding, especially when portraying the dynamics between prominent hypocritical parents and their mostly dramatically disturbed offspring. In the character of Simon Price, she presents the best depiction of a malignant narcissist I've ever read. The first 60-80 pages are difficult because the author presents many characters (reminiscent of Richard Russo) and the reader must work to keep them straight, but the labor involved is more than richly rewarded. I'm afraid that the books mixed reviews are coming from reviewers (even from some of our most prominent newspapers) who simply don't want to spend the time on complex novels that can't be speed read. God knows what these reviewers would have done with Dostoevsky or Tolstoy. They certainly lose patience with other brilliant authors - Murakami, for instance. Anyway, A Casual Vacancy is a brilliant novel, worthy of the woman who created the Potter series.
B0086HGW42|5.0|One of the best albums I've purchased in the last 6 months.  He writes his own music, plays guitar and can sing surprisingly well.  Gotta respect that combination.  Everyone in my household enjoys this album.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this for my nephew who was 5 and a half at the time and totally obsessed with angry birds. I never played the actual game with him with the rules that come with it, so I can't say whether or not that's fun.  He did however have a blast setting up his own &#34;levels&#34; and launching the different birds at those &#34;piggies.&#34;  It's very fun to play for a while, but loses its charm more quickly than some toys.<br /><br />FYI it is nearly impossible to fit back into the box properly, so when you first open it take very good mental notes or actual pictures of where all the pieces go!
B005LAII4E|5.0|I wonder about the movie, considering the other reviews but I really liked it. HOWEVER, why kill off so many main characters!!!! but overall worth the watching and would be a great rent!
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I bought this CD back in 2009. For three years I'd heard a song of his here and there on the radio until finally I made one of the better decisions of my life and bought his second CD, &#34;Carolina&#34; (Thanks in large part to &#34;Love Your Love the Most&#34;). Can you say hook, line, and sinker? It spun non stop in my car for a week, and I had to have more so I bought this CD.  I've never found another musician that I can happily listen to every song on every one of his CDs on repeat.  His third album &#34;Chief&#34; is definitely the strongest, but you need every one of them. Trust me.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We have played this game as a family game just about every night after dinner... well worth the money considering the amout of good quality time my family has enjoyed... even my 5y/o learned it quickly and now is a real threat to beating us.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|even though this was a gift for someone  i had it shipped to my house and had the pleasure of watching it. the shipping was super fast i recommend you buy from this seller
B009V3KKXY|3.0|I had hoped this book would have been easier to follow... DO NOT GET ME Wrong... I am sure it is a great book but not the easiest to follow for me
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragons and now I get to raise them in a little village. How can you not love this game? It's great and a blast!!!
