B004V4H55Y|4.0|`The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' feature the London-based consulting detective who uses astute logic and a knowledge of forensics to solve baffling cases of mystery, intrigue, and even murder.  Dr. John Watson shared an apartment with Holmes at 221B Baker Street until he was married.  Watson still visited his friend and they still worked on cases after his marriage.  Watson chronicled the best cases of Sherlock Holmes while serving as an able, loyal, and trusted assistant.  These twelve cases, written between 1891 and 1892, are the first of the 56 different Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B005X7H9YK 1954 Sherlock Holmes television series]], starring Ron Howard (the son of actor Leslie Howard) and H. Marion Crawford, borrowed from several cases in `The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.'  The screen writers did not even change the title of the Red Headed League, and only modified the plot to fit the parameters of a television show.  The Shoeless Engineer of the television series is based on The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb that you can also read here.  Two of the characters, Victor Hatherley and Colonel Lysander Stark, have the same name in Doyle's story and the television episode.  Here is one about one of the characters:  Holmes used the name `Lysander Starr' when he tried to make up the name of a mayor of Topeka in `The Three Garridebs,' one of the last cases of the Holmes canon.  There are other modifications to the story made for television.  For example, the beautiful servant Ruth Connors develops a romantic interest with Hatherley in the television version.<br /><br />Several other episodes on the television series were inspired, but not really based, on the cases by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The television episode Blind Man's Bluff drew some small inspiration from The Five Orange Pips, another case from these Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  In the television episode, the crew of the Gloria North receives chicken claws, a symbol of death in Trinidad, to presage their death.  Doyle's case involved a symbol of the Ku Klux Klan, the orange seeds.<br /><br />Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, played by Archie Duncan, was a regular on the television show.  Lestrade makes appearances in two of these Adventures, the Boscombe Valley Mystery and The Noble Bachelor.  Holmes and Lestrade have a somewhat adversarial working relationship that plays out comically on the television episodes.<br /><br />Lestrade considers Holmes an amateur, who can nevertheless help with his useful deductions.  Holmes believes that his methods of detection should be second nature to Lestrade, since Lestrade is supposed to be a professional.  Holmes describes these methods to Watson in several adventures.  In `A Scandal in Bohemia,' Holmes points out that Watson sees, but he does not observe.  In `The Blue Carbuncle,' Homes elaborates, `You can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.'<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law starred in a modern remake of [[ASIN:B0038P59A0 Sherlock Holmes]], released in 2009.  Rachel McAdams played the role of Irene Adler, who is introduced in `A Scandal in Bohemia.'  Because Adler is one of a handful of people to outwit Holmes, she is sometimes paired as a love interest with Holmes.  Watson thought the governess of The Copper Beeches, Violet Hunter, might have been a match for Holmes, but nothing further came of her after Holmes solved her case.<br /><br />The Blue Carbuncle refers to three cases in this book as free of legal crime.  Those cases are the attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers (A Scandal in Bohemia), to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland (A Case of Identity), and to The Man with the Twisted Lip.  Holmes solved another case, the Noble Bachelor, which did not lead to a legal crime.  Ironically, the two cases that discuss other Holmes cases that were free of legal crimewere cases themselves that did involve crimes.<br /><br />The Blue Carbuncle was one of those aforementioned cases, while The Copper Beeches was the other.  The Cooper Beeches also has a common theme with another story in the collection, The Engineer's Thumb.  If someone offers you too much money for work, then don't take the job.  In both cases, the person who took the job later regretted the decision.<br /><br />The Five Orange Pips is an outdated mystery because of the reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.  The first movement actually collapsed in 1870, when Congress passed a law outlawing the society.  The organization resurfaced after the turn of the century to enforce segregation.  D.W. Griffith produced `Birth of a Nation,' a movie that glorified the Lost Cause, painted the Klan positively, and spurred enrollment. The Second KKK was discredited in 1924, when a leader of the Indiana Klan was convicted of a brutal rape, but it still existed in various forms through the second Reconstruction of the 1960s.  Countless movies and television dramas in the 20th century created a larger public awareness of the Klan since Doyle's time.  I suspect that most of today's readers linked the envelope marked with K.K.K. to the organization synonymous with White Supremacy when Openshaw first proffered the letter to Holmes.<br /><br />The cases are interesting, and addictive in their own right - although not quite as addictive as the Bohemian habit of Holmes that is mentioned in The Man With the Twisted Lip.  Sherlock Holmes became a popular character because of these cases, even though a pair of novellas preceded these adventures.<br /><br />These short stories were originally published as single stories in the Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The book was published in England on October 14, 1892 by George Newnes Ltd and in the US on October 15, 1892 by Harper.  As such, it is part of the public domain.  Some readers described a problem with the version from Amazon, but it is readily available from other sources.  The e-book version of `The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' from Project Gutenberg has no problems, and is available for free.
B009A87Z6U|1.0|Creating &#34;action&#34; by moving a camera around doesn't work for me.  Plot way to hard to follow, actors talk too fast with heavy accents.  It may be that all this is done to try to get you to buy the DVD to figure out the movie.  On the other hand Skyfall had none of this and is easily one of the best Bond movies ever.
B007PKDW44|5.0|Saw Volbeat live in concert at Lazerfest in 2012 in Des Moines, Iowa. They put on one hell of a show and they music rocks! Must have for sure!!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is really awesome the creator needs to keep coming up with more awesome games I'm going to tell all my friends and I'm pretty sure they will loveeee it! @ the creators y'all are awesome
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What a series! I am looking for more. If you and your special someone want to learn or spice up your life. Read these books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my kids fight over this game, my 3 year is a master at it. so I have to have it on my kindle and my phone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this to readers of all ages. The 14 year old girl that I babysit and I read it at the same time and loved it. We both finished in 3 days.
B000001EL7|4.0|I bought this record in July 1977 & then I bought this album in CD format in March 2013.  I would like to offer my opinion & review of each song:<br /><br />1. \\"I Stole Your Love\\"...This song is pretty decent & I've always loved this, very much.<br /><br />2. \\"Christine Sixteen\\"...When I FIRST heard this song, back in 1977, I thought that this song was lousy & I just didn't care for it.  I was really SHOCKED when this song became a Top 40 hit single, reaching #25 that July.  It charted for 7 weeks & it was the ONLY hit from THIS album.  I guess, it really goes to show that the song you like the least, OR the song that you least EXPECT...always DOES make a hit or @ least a DENT. I never saw it to fail.  I forgot to mention that this song DID grow on me & now I can say that I like it, after all.<br /><br />3. \\"Got Love For Sale\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />4. \\"Shock Me\\"...This is my ALL TIME favorite song on this entire album.  Everything is EXCELLENT about this & I really LOVE this song.<br /><br />5. \\"Tomorrow & Tonight\\"...This is another great song & I love it, very much.<br /><br />6. \\"Love Gun\\"...This song always got on my very last nerve in 1977 & it STILL gets on my very last nerve in 2013.  This is the TITLE TRACK & it's my least favorite song, because the vocal drives me nuts @ the END of this song.<br /><br />7. \\"Hooligan\\"...Since I'm part IRISH, I always thought & wondered if the title \\"Hooligan\\" may be an Irish term for HOODLUM, thug, ruffian or even a gangster. It sure SOUNDS like an Irish word to me. I like this tune & the words are sometimes funny, but unfortunately, Peter Criss' vocal is rather shrill & downright irritating, just like his vocal was on 1976's \\"Baby Driver\\", from the \\"Rock & Roll Over\\" album.  It's a funny thing though, Peter's vocal sounded GOOD on \\"Beth\\" & \\"Hard Luck Woman\\", which were the TWO previous hit singles, BEFORE the \\"Love Gun\\" album came out.<br /><br />8. \\"Almost Human\\"...Musically, this reminds me of a song, butI can't remember the title, from Kiss' 1974 album \\"Hotter Than Hell\\", BECAUSE the music is a little similar to \\"Watchin You\\" (Oh, NOW I remember the song's title).  This song is pretty good & I like it.<br /><br />9. \\"Plaster Caster\\"...I like this song quite well.<br /><br />10.  \\"Then She Kissed Me\\"...A pretty good REMAKE of The Crystals hit single titled \\"Then HE Kissed Me\\", from the Summer of 1963. It's a pretty good song.<br /><br />This Kiss album is definitely recommended, because there are MANY good songs, on this album.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not among best of Grisham, but pretty good. A lot better that some of the most recent ones<br /><br />Ingenious story. Liked it. Though as the plot unraveled, I kind of felt that were some holes in the plot; at least there were some holes that were not explained.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Good, not great.  Fantastic video game nostalgia, and an original idea no matter how many people try to liken it to Toy Story.  Not as humorous as other movies of like kind, but Silverman does come through on a few occasions.  Other than that it's more situational humor.  Interesting that morals can be found for both girls and boys.  Entertaining from start to finish.
030746363X|5.0|Great book about exercise, dieting, and other stuff.  Really gets you to thinking about different types of approaches to health
0061537934|5.0|This is an easy read that has more to do with our relationship with people and animals than the technical expects or driving on wet asphalt. This is a very good book!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great games for teens but for little kids I think that it would be I little intense . Great game too
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  The interviews and making of segments showcase how much research and work go into making this premium show.  AND Season 3 ends with a bang!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|this movie is not what I expected.  wish i had rented it instead. Denzel was fine but after the first 40 min. the movie plot went FLAT!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Books are meant to whisk you into the world of the hectares, and 50 Shades does exactly that. I was so absorbed in the story, I dreaded for the book to come to an need. It's relatable, entertaining, sexy, and an escape from every day life. I loved it; you will, too.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|BORING.  BORING.<br /><br />All the games are the same.  Doesn't test your brain at all and is a big waste of time.
0143122916|4.0|Honestly I would love to hand this book to someone who has just finished Hunger Games with a simple challenge - compare and contrast.  While there is no violent teenage battle or garish costumes there are enough similarities described here that the possibility of such a horrifying fiction being even partially true shocks the reader!  I am glad that we were able to read such a detailed account of life in North Korea for a politica prisoner and, as much as I wish there was more, I am happy that the awful time in the subjects life was limited to the events described - a bittersweet moment.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|consider for all children this is a very good movie and very interesting and keeps the attention of all children
B00006J3T4|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It is chock full of great music.  I especially like \\"Quality Shoes\\" and \\"Coyote\\".  The beat and sounds of each song are unique on each track.  This is a top quality album and I do not tire of listening.
B004SBB0LU|2.0|I was so excited to get this CD box set, but then when I found out, there were hardly any songs I knew.  All the good ones like \\"radio ga ga\\", \\"fat bottom girls\\", \\"don't stop me now\\", \\"we will rock you\\", \\"we are the champions\\", \\"another one bites the dust\\", \\"somebody to love\\", bicycle race..... ARE NOT ON THESE 10 CDS.  Very Disappointed.  If you want to hear B side queen, this is your CD set.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Who doesn't like google, google is the best search engine app available, when in doubt I always search google for help.

1401937268|5.0|Archangels with Tarot gives a beautiful message and provides a more accurate interpretation than Tarot alone. I enjoy working with these when giving readings.
B009L7MD44|5.0|The unit is great and works fine when you figure out how to...<br />The included Manual is terrible with incomplete and therefore confusing information. However, their Customer Service is the best, they respond to a question within 30 minutes and the rep was very helpful and polite.<br />I recommend this Unit as very good.
B00846WWVM|4.0|This puzzle is a challenge, my grand daughter always asking me to help her with the challenge. help her to put out the fire before the homes burn down
B0019EXZY4|5.0|I am a Jason fan and love every one of his movies and all of them full of action.  he is an awesome actor and one of my favorites
1878424319|5.0|life changing simple read that if taken to heart immediately changes your reactions to the world and its impact upon you.  I found myself talking to strangers in line about this wonderful book and recently met a woman who stocks it and regularly gives it as gifts to people she meets.
B00AYL7OAY|4.0|Never listen to this band before. I will deff buy more of their music after hearing this album though. Very solid chill album.
B00B3HJMLM|4.0|Saw this and had to get it for her. It's not as good as &#34;Tailgates and Tanlines&#34; but Luke is a good performer. I'm suree he'll be around for awhile.
B00BU2TEGS|2.0|I have been a Depeche Mode fan for a long time now and I can say is this is another album with no songs on it that I would listen to ever. There have been alot of old Depeche Mode songs I don't like either to be fair but honestly Ultra was really the last album they made that had several good songs on it. But listen to it yourself you be the judge.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Being a fan of Tolkien, I am happy to note that Mr. Jackson has again undertaken another quality film creation of Tolkien's work. Though The Hobbit has a different feel than The Lord of The Rings, it seems to fit well with the other films. It has more of an innocent sense of adventure to it. The character of Bilbo helps greatly in this respect. He is a believable unwilling--yet tempted--adventurer.<br /><br />Gollum is another character who must deliver a realistic performance in order for us to accept that this story is reasonable and faithful to Tolkien's intent. His portrayal, a mix of animation and live action voice and movement, is easily believable. As in The Lord of The rings, his character is a solid blend of malice and pitiable existence. I felt both revolted by him and sad for him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was not impressed with what appears to be a significant amount of animation, especially with the character Azog. Perhaps I am wrong, but I feel that there was a fair amount of this film work in this movie. Perhaps there was more animation in The Lord of The Rings trilogy than I caught on to; this movie is not so subtle in that regard.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a fun movie! I will happily watch the other two installments and, as I did with The Lord of The Rings, I will look to purchase the extended versions if they are available.<br /><br />Watch this movie and enjoy the talents of the writer and the movie makers!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely beautifully written!  I laughed...and cried...couldn't put it down!  Many age levels would love this book.  Thoughtful and sweet.  A must read!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game is fun and pretty easy to play but not super easy. Got addicted pretty fast and beat the game pretty fast. Cool feature is the hints button really helps when you're stuck.
B0049GYXDG|2.0|Well I bought this thing because I thought it was a great classic, I was wrong. This is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen they are constantly singing and the characters are very annoying to the point where they make you feel uncomfortable. Rent it first judge for yourself or don't buy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great read! Good story line,  along with a little excitement!  I've read the series, waiting on the 3rd book to be released.
B0076DELIG|2.0|The first half of the book was classic Connelly: a tight, suspenseful, engaging novel. The second half felt like he was phoning it in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS. IS. AWESOME.<br />Minecraft is the best game ever! One thing that I would change is that they would have buckets ( possibly coming in the late April update :) ), unlimited world ( they are are working on that), an the ability to mine obsidion and Redstone.<br /><br />  THANK YOU MOJANG!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was  a great novel. It was confusing at first but then it flowed smoothly. Can't wait to see the movie now
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It is awesome. The kindle store should have more of these. Taking Gina is good too also talking Ben. Dont you agree with that
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Great game but it kinda feels like the DNA creating rips you off for gold sometimes. But I play all the time so it obviously isn't that big of a deal.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|My hubby and I loved this movie.  Classic Appatow with a little more maturity than some of his other flics.  Great delivery, even if the emotional baggage of the couple and the kids seems to drag the story at times.  Great sound track and feel good adult movie.  We're not 40, but we hope when we are, it's something like this!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Loved this series so much I ended up ordering Showtime from my cable provider in order to watch the second season before it came out on dvd.  Great acting, moves quickly, and keeps you guessing as to who the bad guys really are.
B009NPK1IO|4.0|Good show. It seemed to lose its way at times but in the end I had to watch all the way through  to know how it ended.  I really got attached to the characters and was surprised by a lot of the twists the plots took.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Make sure you watch the entire season first as this is the finale. Do not watch this without watching the season first.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco was one the most influential Jazz musicians of all time. As a teenager in the 70's I had the chance to experience his explosion onto the Jazz scene. After listening to Weather Report's &#34;Heavy Weather&#34; I had to hear more. I found this album and &#34;The rest is history!&#34; His influence spans all genres of music, not just Jazz. I just wish he was still here today.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|What if, when you were 75, they transferred your consciousness into a superhuman body and sent you off to the stars to fight for humanity?<br /><br />Kind of a cool idea. I used to work in a nursing home and I was struck more than once by the amazing things that the residents had done during their long lives. Of course it didn't do them any good because their bodies were wearing out, and while they might have been able to remember a particular day during the Korean War in great detail, they often couldn't remember what they had had for breakfast.<br /><br />Just as: \\"Youth is wasted on the Young\\", so \\"Experience is wasted on the Old\\"...<br /><br />In this book that experience isn't wasted - old people get recycled as soldiers in brand new bodies. A pretty good deal - considering the alternative...<br /><br />The actual fighting that occurs towards the end of the book is well scripted but kind of formulaic. This book is very reminiscent of Haldeman's \\"The Forever War\\" in a lot of ways - although it doesn't have the spooky \\"alien\\" quality of that book - it's more like: \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I purchased the deluxe on iTunes. The bonus tracks are nice, but the part I love is the core album. Perfection. So for my CD I am buying the standard album since I already have the bonus tracks. If you don't, I would definitely purchase the deluxe album. Bonus Tracks, Long Time Lie is excellent and dark, and All That's Mine is a really good song. In the past decade I loved Playing the Angel in 2005, more aggressive electronica and great songs, Gore's guitar. A nice balance of high energy songs and slower music, and a lot of soul to the album. Sounds of the Universe a letdown. This album, Delta Machine, is back to form for Depeche Mode. It is a unique album which stands on its own with a nod to older albums, just more scaled back synths. It is filled with energetic tracks and slower tracks in the middle, and comes back strong with a core group of songs that are all slammin', Soft Touch, Soothe the Soul, Goodbye, and also in that group Alone and Should Be Higher which grab you. Two of their best in a long time. Goodbye really grew on me. Nice to see a DM album end so strongly with Soothe My Soul and Goodbye.<br /><br />This album really has a synth/electronica dance music vibe on many tracks, which is great to hear back from the guys, and there is a real sexiness to this album with Should Be Higher, Slow, Secret to the End, Soft Touch/Raw Nerve, Soothe My Soul. I don't hear that mentoned too much in the professional reviews, but the sexiness of this album is one of its great points. Dave's vocals are really fantastic.<br /><br />The beginning, Welcome to My World just builds and builds and is epic and is a tremendous opener and then moving into the amazing, dark, aggressive Angel and then moving into the moody Heaven sets a great introduction to the album.<br /><br />There's also experimental and odd little tracks on here also in the middle that really work after repeated listenings. Songs I didn't think I liked just flipped on me and I now enjoy every song on here. It all works. The album just flies by.<br /><br />I love it because it fills a great place in a fan's collection of their music. Ultra was a very stripped-back album after the band's implosion after the Devotional tour with personal problems, Wilder leaving, Dave's problems, etc. Ultra is gorgeous and lush, more intimate, and shows their fragility and some amazing songs, and a real departure from Songs of Faith and Devotion with Wilder, but still beautiful. Exciter terribly uneven. Playing the Angel, amazing, one of my favorites. As I said, Sounds of the Universe, a disappointment. And now they are back in a big way. It's rare for a 30-year band to put out something this fresh sounding, but DM isn't just any band. The blues sprinkled throughout lightly on certain songs really is great and not overkill. It's no Violator, but there will never be another Violator, even if Wilder came back (which I hope will happen one day for another album together), but Delta Machine is a great album all on its own, deserving to be in the top echelon of their catalogue of music. Congrats, DM. I can't wait to hear many of these songs live on tour.<br /><br />This album is best as a headphones album for me
B0093SK2MQ|5.0|Nice to know you can go to Amazon for all your viewing needs. A quick and easy way to go!
B00005RIKI|5.0|I actually bought this record in 1975 after hearing &#34;Second Helping&#34; and wondering how I missed the &#34;First&#34;. Free Bird is one of my favorite songs of all time. &#34;Gimme Three Steps&#34; and &#34;Simple Man&#34; make this record a must for anyone who loves Southern Rock.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|4 and one half stars, while it was a wonderful film with a great sound track, i thought there was something a little off and could not quite figure what it was..perhaps it was over to soon..still a great film, and glad they made it.( looking forward to part 2.)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to use, lots of choices, and my students are familiar with it to use in class.  Google is always there to use.
B00A83075M|5.0|I finally set aside time to watch this flick.  At last Pixar has gotten their imagination back!  Excellent little tale.  Fabulous journey that will take you away if you're not careful.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Joe Bonamassa has the talent to play anything he wants. To apply his talents to the blues makes me a lifelong fan. I own four of his albums now and it won't be long until I have them all! I just hope to be able to see the show live, one day. The Blues have a very bright future with Joe leading the way.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|It was great, and long over due to have most of the last action hero's together in a good old fashioned action adventure film..a little cheesy but fun.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy to set, loud enough to wake me up, and it is always with me on my phone and my pad.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Feels good after a hard days work. This is pleasant and relaxing audial experience with friends and a drink in your hand.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This documentary is a must watch for everybody because the issues tackled here affect us all! It will change your entire perspective on the food industry and what we eat.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner and excruciating ride until some point when sadly the story become somehow weak.  It is however, an accurate exposure of human values and faults, the end is real.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|very calming, relaxing music for the holidays. I will save it for next Christmas and play it at work again.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Love this album as I always love Bobs musical evolution. Winning combination of the singer enjoying himself and giving us the same delight.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the moment I started this book I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was in the shoes of the main character, felt her sadness and excitement and most of all Hope. Such a beautiful story with enough twists to keep you guessing. Thank you Colleen Hoover, off to DL another one of your books!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I went through the experience hoping to rescue something from this book/author and sadly I have to say it was a great waste of my time.
0007447868|1.0|I had been enjoying the series until I came to this book, at which the writer must have felt compelled to add yet more families and characters for me to remember and work into the mix.  There now are so many families involved in the plot that some important families are not mentioned at all in this novel; I thumbed through the chapter titles to the end and nothing is mentioned about the original Stark family, some of whom I'm sure play some important part later.  So many chapters are devoted to Cersei the whole book should just be titled \\"The Laments of Cersei\\".<br /><br />I agree with a previous review who said this novel could just be skipped.  At least I guess it could.  I've lost interest and won't continue the series.  I haven't even finished this one.  I lost interest by page 517 and went on to better writers.  I love historical fiction, but I hate dragging on and on about nothing.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have spent many enjoyable evenings sitting with my 93 year old mother watching Downton Abbey.  I love the quiet drama that is constantly erupting both with both the family and staff.  Problems know no boundries according to wealth of monies.
B0055OG2BC|5.0|This is what American film making is all about. Take a Institunalized concept and turn it into something much more fun and very humorous.  No James Bond collection is complete without this film!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It's a good game did not expect much going in and got blown away. It is definitely one people should try. It's easy to learn and fun to play.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I ssssssoooo thought that this was going to be a easier and  a worse app but it wasn't and I like that! Well easy 5 stars no problems loading or starting up or anything like that
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Work great I don't have the strength to lug the vac like I used to so this light weight swepper do the job for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I couldn't put it down... Colleen is a wonderful writer; looking forward to her next book! Could there be a 2nd book to Hopeless?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great app because it teaches kids how to be responsible! But it is also fun!
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Ok lets get this over with, this cd is just awful every line lil wayne raps its about p**** or f'n women, its just complete overkill too the limit. I didn't expect too much him this point in his music career hes just one big corny punch line. Its actually sad that his music has came to this its just unlistenable. Every song its about the same thing, aleast the carter iv was actually good. This is just one big headache all the way through, the only track good is \\"gunwalk\\" and that's not saying much even if you buy the deluxe version its still just awful it adds nothing more but more terrible tracks to the cd. Bottom line just leave it on the shelf and walk away!
B003L77FYS|5.0|I can't believe I missed this show in real time. Got bored one night and my wife and I watched a show. We were hooked. Great repore between characters. Great writing and fun to try and guess what happens next. My wife and I are now fans!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much however the love scenes could have been more detailed in their descriptions and emotions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. it is the most amazing game I have ever played and trust me.... I have played a lot of others
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft sucks. Roblox is wayyyyyy better. Minecraft is too pixely for me but with roblox its graphics look more realistic. Just go on a computer and play roblox dont waste your time on stupid minecraft.
B00021R7CG|5.0|Great apocalyptic flick. It has aged well. I hadn't seen this movie since it was on HBO originally and it didn't disappoint.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I enjoy movies from this  british historical era. The author does not disappoint .  The cast is superb, they make you feel like you are there with them. Each episode keeps you wanting more!! I love it!!!
B003YUQ174|4.0|I had to re-order these shoes twice to find the correct size.  I'm now wearing them and enjoying them, but beware of the face that they are sized way small.  I ended up with a pair that is two sizes larger than what I normally wear.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I had to watch for an event and I was shocked to learn that it was really good. The characters where fun and it moved fast and the story line was well written and went somewhere. I know why the girls love this movie. It's great.
B008QCBFHG|5.0|I agree with one fellow reviewer that this opera is the product of an artistic feud between two of the leading divas in the days of G.F. Handel F. Cuzzoni and Bordoni. The level musical treatment in the score for these two characters (two princess) demanded Handel's compositional genius, and the great composer arose to the occasion with real aplomb. The listeners are staggered by the large volume of fabulous vocal music written for the soprano voice in this work.<br />Two truly superb sopranos are aptly chosen to sing the two soprano roles.  Karina Gauvin has the fuller timbre and greater dramatic thrust, while Julia Lezhneva has greater facility and tonal purity, with a trill that every soprano would envy.  The two singers contrasted each other strikingly, and served the characters' respective vocal demands exceptionally well.<br />In the male batch, countertenors Cencic and Sabata give highly polished performances, while bass Kim is fully competent, if not outright outstanding. Cencic pulls off the role of Alessandro with diverse facets of vocal drama, and is not one bit eclipsed by the two 'dueling' divas.<br />Petrou's conducting is, apart from the two lead sopranos, the other big reason for listening to this recording. The recitativos are well handled, with the appropriate tempi and stylish treatment.  The embellishments employed are tasteful and dramatically alert. The singers are not merely 'singing', but also 'conversing' and emoting in their recitativos and arias. The overall effect is lively and fully dramatic, and even if the work encompasses three full discs, listening has never been easier and time flies swiftly.<br />Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic story line and well liked by people I know who have watched it.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good story.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Love this album!!! Didn't think he could top Red River Blue but he did!!! Must have for any Blake fan.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I like it but my husband loves it! He got this to show his friend and they watched the whole season in one sitting! Downloaded quickly and came in really clear.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's awesome, gory and amazing! You can't get enough of this show... I watched all the seasons in less than a month.
093183841X|5.0|This is an amazing book! Great information, easy to use, and thorough!<br /><br />Money well spent!<br /><br />I totally recommend this book for any collectors, enthusiasts, people just trying to sell their fun finds.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez is an excellent song writer and singer. How such a talent could remain undiscovered for so long compared to the vast amount of worthless music being recorded and sold today remains a mystery to me. &#34;Coming From Reality&#34;, along with his first release &#34;Cold Fact&#34; should be added to your music library and enjoyed.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I paid $15 for this and it still won't let me read pdfs. Olive Office was only $2 and it worked just fine.
0440237688|3.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is an interesting book that is told from the perspective of an eleven-year-old named Jonas. Jonas lives in a futuristic community that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, hate, as well as any competition or differences between the members of the community. Everyone in the community basically looks and acts exactly alike, and they have no choice in how they live their lives. At the age of twelve each member of the community is assigned a career that they must follow, and then later in life they can apply for and be assigned a spouse that is perfectly suited to them. They also are only allowed two children each; one boy and one girl, these children are also born and raised in a controlled environment where the parents have no part in the babies first year of development. Any of the babies that don't fit into the community, like twins, and elderly people are \\"released\\". Everyone believes that when you are \\"released\\" you just go to Elsewhere, but in fact those people are given a lethal injection. The whole reason that the community is under such tight control and restriction is so that the citizens live the most convenient and pleasant life possible. This book reminded me a lot of Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. The element of absolute control of the citizens life is present in both books as well as the people that don't fit in are sent elsewhere. In Brave New World, they are sent to  a reserve type area where people are not controlled, and in The Giver they are simply \\"released\\", or killed.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I thought it was very good--I only read each night at bedtime so it takes awhile to get through a book so this one was a little hard to keep all the characters straight since in switched between present day and 1900's.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez is an excellent song writer and singer. How such a talent could remain undiscovered for so long compared to the vast amount of worthless music being recorded and sold today remains a mystery to me. &#34;Cold Fact&#34;, along with his second release &#34;Coming From Reality&#34; should be added to your music library and enjoyed.
B006ZZANFG|5.0|Also heard this artist on NPR with interview and music.  Chose this CD as it was the one I heard and enjoyed very much.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Good video, but don't start this unless you've been doing Bob's Power Walk first.  She's just like she is on TV and this one hurts.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I ENJOY THE MOVIE FLIGHT , IT MADE YOU THINK A LITTLE ABOUT FLYING WHEN YOU GET ON A AIRPLANE.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has it all- good acting, good directing, good filming, great story lines.  I love this show and all the characters.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A fast moving murder mystery with some interesting twists and turns.  Central to the  plot was the question of blind familial loyalty and the pitfalls that presents.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway Suffer is a great game to pass time.  Its a big step up from a game like Temple Run adding in more obstacles, coin opportunities, and updates to play in different cities all over the world.  Additionally, with Easter coming up, and if your Subway Surfer is updated to Rome, there is an added incentive to collect 100 Easter eggs which will ultimately allow you to collect a prize. Although, I have seen some issues with touch sensitivity because sometimes when I want it to do something(so I would swipe my finger) it will do the complete opposite.  All in all it is a great game, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book at first it started off slow but as I got into it, it became a page turner. You can really visualize what's happening in the story. Can't wait to read the second book.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This show is awesome ,I recommend it !! I can't wait to buy the second season . This is the kind of show we be waiting for without changing the channel to HBO .
B009P13RQY|5.0|The Sword is my favorite metal band these days. Fantastic albums and live they're even better. Go see them if you can. I should say I'm not in love with every song on this album, but I love most of them and I certainly like every track. The first track &#34;The Veil of Isis&#34; and the title track &#34;Apocryphon&#34; are my favorites. Some metal fans may not appreciate the keyboards on the song Apocryphon, but I love how they are expanding a bit here. Hell, Mastodon used some keys and it didn't hurt their heaviness any.<br /><br />As a native of Austin, Texas it's refreshing to have a band that's truly heavy from there. Normally it's folk, country and blues coming out of Austin, which is fine, but The Sword is a real metal band without the &#34;Austin sound&#34; whatever that may be.<br /><br />I'd recommend every album by The Sword. This one is clearly a more mature album by them. Keep it coming boys!
B0039208JE|5.0|I was reading Batman comics long before the movie was released.  Even as a kid I knew theTV show was \\"campy\\" and this movie saved the public perception of the Dark Kinght.
B003C34CZG|5.0|I had to pick up this album after the break up announcement. I had listened to a friend's copy, but now I need to have my own copy to remember the band by.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Writing style, stories and content are all A+++. I recently attended a talk by Malcolm Gladwell as well, and his talks are just as riveting as his books. He is genuinely fascinated by human beings and what makes us tick, and how we influence and are influenced by our world. An interest and fascination I share with him, that's why I really enjoy reading his books. I feel like we can always indentify with the examples/stories he tells, and most importantly when you're done reading his books you have either learned something about yourself, or perceive your universe with a new eyes. Very compelling and enjoyable reads!
B0092W2GSG|5.0|I should first say I'm a huge Calexico fan, this isn't a non-biased opinion. That said, if I didn't like this album I'd say so. I have every Calexico album and have seen them every time they've played in my town since I was aware of them. Algiers is a perfect album as far as I'm concerned. Calexico expands where they've been and explores new territory that completely works. The &#34;old&#34; Calexico is still in the mix, but mostly as a basis, not a focus. Joey's guitar work is a solid as ever and John's drumming is the best you'll hear anywhere. Okay, he's no Neal Peart, but that's not his thing. For what Calexico does, John Convertino is near perfect. The rest of the band adds precisely what's needed when it's needed.<br /><br />Have the feeling I like this album? Just get it. If you're a Calexico fan you be happy and if you aren't already, you will be after you listen to this album.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|I found this book so interesting I bought it for my sister and mother of a 7 year old girl. I genuinely believe if parents would put what they will learn in this book to practice at home, the children of our next generation will all be happy rock stars!!<br />Gladwell's writing style, stories and content are allways A+++. I recently attended a talk by Malcolm Gladwell as well, and his talks are just as riveting as his books.

B008I34ZQG|5.0|This is my favorite Frank Zappa album. The only reason I would pick this one over \\"Hot Rats\\" is because it's much longer.\\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" was originally released as a double album and I can not think of one thing about this record that I don't like.This cd's sound was redone by Bob Ludwig and for my money he always knows what he's doing so it sounds fantastic.A must for fans of Zappa's out there vision.
1594203334|5.0|I LOVED this book. I was so glad to see someone promoting behavior in children/toddlers. I hate that America seems to have gotten so accepting of poor behavior in our children. This book gives some examples of how to set (and achieve) higher expectations.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|loved this film.  Hadn't heard anything about it until some friends mentioned it.  Finally got to watch it streaming.  Laughed at a lot of the hidden easter eggs and subtle (and not so subtle) references.  Good, clean family film.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|If you've been following this series then this book is a no brainer. It leaves you wanting more and more after each page is turned. Brace yourself for one hell of a ride.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!!! It's so easy to use and I love that you can pin using the share option when you are using the browser. The only thing is that it's addictive and I have ended up using my fire to go on pinterest instead of reading. Lol.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Good performances from just about everyone.  Wasn't too thrilled with the recurring f-bombs.  Occasionally slow, but still worth watching, at least once.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|What a great series.  Can watch it over and over, and I'm normally not a repeat program viewer.  All characters are well cast and the acting is excellent.  Highly recommend, but you need to watch seasons 1 and 2 first to understand all the nuances.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|great it was so good and fun to read i really had a great great time reading it all day
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|The main character (Rebus) is always surprising and truly plausible.The plot  looks ordinary as it begins but thickens<br />as you turn page by page.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Yeah I am 60 years old but some of the these newer animated films amaze me.  This one didn't fail in that.  Very well made, some funny parts (and admit it, no matter how old you are sometimes you just need to laugh) and a good story line.
B006H5120E|5.0|3D made the movie all the more enjoyable.  3D effects were excellent.  Recommend for 3D viewing - sure enhances the experience.

B0083P1QUM|4.0|Like the characters.It's always impressing how small details thru forensic analysis can reveal the truth.After reading a few Scarpetta novels you think you can predict the end but eventually the plot will always surprise you.
B001OG3VOQ|3.0|There are some great songs on this album. It was a bit overplayed on the radio when she was popular.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app, my friend showed it to me. Magical floating islands to clame yours, dragons you can get, decorations and buildings that get you more visitors and its all on dragonvale. Get this app and tell your friends now.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game. Something to waste time with. Enjoyable when I have free time at home or wherever I am. U need more investment points, lol.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Well it started pretty lame but by half through the first stages it gets pretty in depth.<br />Here's a hint aim low with the explode birds and if u don't use your perks for ten days then u get 72 eagles!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Very good movie. Suspense and intrigue. Matthew McGonaughey is excellent. It has an excellent story line with a few twists. An enjoyable evening watch ..
B009S33I68|4.0|The book covers roughly a week in November 1965 as the US was ramping up and testing its operations in Vietnam. It is a heart wrenching journey - painful and graphic.<br /><br />I find it most saddening that when faced with intense losses and a determined enemy, the US chose to ramp up its invasion.<br /><br />This is war at its ugliest; their is no glory in senseless death.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Its always nice to find a fun game that keeps you playing for free.<br /><br />Its obvious that it would be better to pay, but it doesn't punish your for playing it all through for free.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper takes the reader from the countryside of England, to the ravaged WWII 1941 city of London, and to beautiful Australia. The protagonist, Dorothy, drove me crazy at times. I found myself judging her for her thoughts and actions and at times I wanted to put the book down because I'd had it with her. One doesn't take advantage of others--especially out of hateful revenge. It was difficult to feel compassion for the young woman. Her mysterious friend seemed nearly trapped in her head and in her life. Dorothy's daughter Laurel, the actress, fought to find her mother's secrets in ways I can't imagine playing out. The twists and turns in the novel kept me guessing and I certainly walked away with satisfaction. A lovely story with fulfilling subplots.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This movie is as great now as it was when I was a child.  My 3 year old loves it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is my husband's favorite movie of all time, so when it was the special value of the day for the blu-ray set I did not hesitate to purchase it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is filled with shocking events. Who ever reads this book will like it more than the 1st one.................but I must say it gets sad when u get to the end when you reach their u will automatically get the 3rd  book. This book is a thriller
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I bought this for may son, who loves it.  It arrived within the time frame given on the web site.

0307887960|4.0|The diet works, provided you adhere to it strictly. Do no deviate, and you be pleasantly surprised. If deviation occurs (as I am told) you will not get success and try to blame the diet. My friend from Paris has many friends and family who have success, some for thirty years and counting!
B001JU4S44|5.0|I like the MI series.  This one has attractive people, lots of fire and explosions and an awesome chase with motorcycles, which I understand is entirely &#34;Impossible&#34;, but what did you expect?  I'm still giving it 5 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great writing. A different view of cancer, loss, love and family. Really living and loving even with a terminal disease.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Now that I have a blu-ray player I wish I had bought the blu-ray collection of this wonderful show, but this one will certainly do, and it was cheaper.  I believe it has everything the blu-ray edition has.  All my discs worked fine and the packaging was handsome and is a nice keepsake.  I liked all the little extras that came along with the collection, though if I hadn't read a spoiler about how to fine that extra hidden disc I might never have figured it out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Cool, enjoy the nice big numbers. Easy to use. Much simpler than a regular calculator machine. Don't need my bifocals at all!!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I was not able to see the movie when it was at our local<br />theater, so I pre-ordered.  I remembered the story when it<br />originally happened and was curious how it would be when<br />it came to screen.  It definitely deserved BEST PICTURE!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app ever! I have used this everywhere and it is so nice to have the Word at your fingertips.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Beach Buggy Blitz is a racing game where you have to go as far as possible. There are checkpoints along the way, other racers, and obstacles that slow you down. The grpahics are amazing, even on a 1st gen Kindle Fire. The controls work pretty well too. The main thing that slows this game down is the fact that you are riding the same track over and over again, but every time they switch parts of the track. It feels boring going through the same parts lots of times. Another thing I'm not a fan of and is present in many app games are overpriced items. App games should be casual games, not games that you play for 5 hours straight. Even though the prices aren't too high at first, but seeing as you gain about 30-50 coins per run at the beginning (depending on how good you are) and cars cost around 400-900 and power-ups are 200 each, it's not fun going over the same track to get coins to get to new places. Even the upgrades for cars and power-ups get a bit ridiculously high, but I've seen far worse (Temple Run, Subway Surfers, etc.) Overall, fun game, everything works well, and I would recommend this game to you.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Kuznick and Stone, who lends his name to this work, present a reasonable well researched history of the USA . Many who were raised on sanitized histories written for grade and high schools will be shocked to discover (or deny) the truth. In some areas the authors held back, most likely as to not cause more shock in getting at the truth. Corporations have expanded their control over every facet of society. Corporate predatory behavior has now become rampant and has in many ways turned against American citizens through the outsourcing of jobs in seeking profit and even lying to get visas for foreign workers who are often trained by their American counter parts before taking their jobs and working for half the salary. The FED has reduced the buying power of the dollar by 95% since 1913. It is a system built on debt and more importantly the continuous expansion of debt. I would also suggest those readers who are skeptical read: LIES MY TEACHER TOLD ME.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book involved theft, murder, love, betrayal, survival and, of course secrets, spanning 2 generations and 2 continents. It was riveting. The characters were richly drawn and the settings clearly described. Though the backdrop was England during WWII, it was really a book about a daughter trying to understand her dying mother. The ending surprised me a bit.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the book. It was very romantic! Can't wait to read another one in the KISS. Would recommend to a friend.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This part of Lincoln's life and attempt to add the 13th Amendment to the constitution is writen in eriodite style which perhaps makes it a step above the average viewing preferences of the public, but on listening intently to what was said I felt the language was ofter above the characters.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|THE 2-D BLURAY DISC<br />I'd award two extra stars if I could for the Bluray disc (which probably applies to the DVD too) because the movie LOADS QUICKLY and PLAYS QUICKLY.  A animated loading symbol is shown for the 10 or 20 seconds it takes to load.  Then quick flash of the Warner Brother's screen and you are at the main menu.  Press &#34;play&#34;, two anti-piracy screens appear for a few seconds each, and the movie begins. That's all.  THREE CHEERS FOR WARNER BROTHERS!!!!<br /><br />In contrast, Sony's &#34;Men in Black 3&#34; (by no means the most annoying Bluray I've purchased lately) takes forever to load, leaving you with a blank black screen while loading, then several &#34;previews&#34; of other movies you have to fast-forward through (because the &#34;disc menu&#34; button is disabled), then 4 (FOUR!!!!) long antipiracy screens, then a long general disclaimer screen, then a disclaimer screen regarding internet features.  All Sony disc are like this.  Many other Blurays and movie companies/distributors are worse, I've had to fast forward through seemingly a dozen &#34;previews&#34; on other discs each; others have opening screen after screen of distributors, producers, and contributors (such as THX for the sound processing).  Many anti-piracy screens seem to hold for 30 seconds or so.  On one disc, I had to choose &#34;Language&#34; before I could get to the menu.  Why do we tolerate this crap??  Because we have no choice.<br /><br />THE HOBBIT MOVIE<br />THE BAD<br />&#62; The good news is that surely there will be no &#34;extended edition&#34; to buy in a few years.  In fact, I'm kinda hoping for a &#34;condensed&#34; edition.  The movie is just too long with too many exaggerated chase scenes.  There is just so much adrenaline the body can absorb---I've already crashed by the time the movie is at the 2/3rds point.<br />&#62; I was particularly annoyed by the grossly overlong, cartoonish chase scenes in the orc cave, which must have been 10,000s of hours of CGI at a cost of $10s millions of dollars.  About 1/4 the length would have been fine.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />&#62; The Bluray is absolutely stunning--razor sharp.  The cinemaphotography is superb.  The CGI seemless.<br />&#62; The introduction, with the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; Bilbo and Frodo is a stroke of genius.<br />&#62; The trolls sequence reminded me of ny High School years, long long ago.  Actually, the dwarves and orcs were a bit unpleasantly &#34;familiar&#34;.<br />&#62; The actor playing (young) Bilbo is terrific.<br />&#62; Although I'd have prefered a version truer to the book, most of the additions are from the unreadable &#34;Silmarillion&#34; and other Tolkien material, and make the story more consistent as a prequel to &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;.  I suspect that if Tolkien himself had had a chance to re-write the Hobbit, he would have done something similar.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />Like many reviewers, if I were in control, the movie would have followed the book more closely, would have been better paced, and would have been more adult.  BUT it is what it is, and what it is is MAGNIFICIENT.<br /><br />3D?<br />Why not?  If it's only a few bucks more and comes with the 2D Bluray.  No doubt the 3D version is spectacular.  But I didn't consider the 3D.  As it happens I have a $5000 state-of-the-art 3D capable system, but every 3D movie I've seen (including Avitar) gives me a migraine headache within 20 minutes.  The fact is, regardless of the claims of producers who've dumped $10s of millions into developing 3D cameras and technology, 3D movies simply are not filmed the way the human eye sees and interprets 3D.  If you see 3D, your mind assumes that you can selectively focus on any part of the scene you want, say on the background, even if the action is in the foreground---but you actually can't---because the background is intentionally out-of-focus, so you brain is in constant conflict with your eyes, telling your eyes to focus on things that it can't.  If you veiw an image that is only 2D (as in a photograph or an ordinary 2D movie) your mind takes 3D cues from sharpness of focus, proportions, etc. and &#34;reads&#34; 3D into 2D images, without any eyestrain.  A real 3D experience would require the entire image (foreground, subject, and background) to be in perfect sharp focus.  But if a movie was shot that way (with no selective focus), it would look completely flat in 2D. Note that the few successful 3D movies out there are either &#34;landscape shots&#34; where everything is in focus, or fast action, where you are so busy following the subject (which is in focus), that your mind doesn't have a chance to be confused by out-of-focus elements.  The Hobbit is a mixture of landscapes and fast action, so it probably works better in 3D than most movies.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.mind takes 3D cues from sharpness of focus, proportions, etc. and &#34;reads&#34; 3D into 2D images, without any eyestrain.

B003WUYRGI|4.0|This is the Oxford Dictionary of English, and not the Oxford English Dictionary (12 volumes). That said...<br /><br />  This dictionary (ODE) is great. I discovered it is possible to look up words by typing them into a search feature on my Kindle Fire. You tap the bottom of the screen, tap the magnifying glass, and type in the word you are hunting. Bang!<br /><br />  You also have the bar at the bottom of the device. You must put your stylus or finger on the bar and slide forward or back - but there are so many words in this huge dictionary that it takes up to ten tries to get close enough to locate the target word by tapping the right side of the page to advance one page at a time. Better to use the magnifying glass and type in the word.<br /><br />  The pronunciation feature gives, as its main pronunciation, the pronunciation used in the south of England. It still gives some U.S. pronunciation, and it gives extensive pronunciations of foreign words. It's a super deal for the price any way you look at it.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|Super 8 (J. J. Abrams, 2011)<br /><br />I'm having some problems figuring out what to say about Super 8, which I watched yesterday and enjoyed a great deal. I think much of the reason for this is that I'm not exactly sure what type of movie it is. On the other hand, it knows exactly what type of movie it is, which leads me to an inversion of my usual problem reviewing certain films. It's part monster movie, following closely on Abrams' success with Cloverfield. It's part homage to 1979, an historical piece that aims to capture an era (and does so almost perfectly as far as the atmosphere goes, and I say this as someone who was just a year or so younger than the principals in the film in 1979). It's part coming-of-age rom-com, and this is probably the movie's strongest facet, as it takes a well-worn plotline, social outcast 1 ropes hot girl into working with his crew in order to seduce her, opening the way for social outcast 2 and hot girl into falling in love, destroying his plan--and gives it new feet. And somehow, despite any number of anachronisms that don't make sense in a movie that supposedly takes place in 1979, Abrams makes it all work.<br /><br />Plot: in a small town in Ohio, a bunch of teenaged kids are trying to make a zombie movie. Director Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths in his screen debut) has a major crush on school hottie Alice Dainard (Because of Winn-Dixie's Elle Fanning), and so reworks the script to give his lead actor, Martin (Alabama Moon's Gabriel Basso), a wife, and asks Alice to be in the film; she agrees. Of course, the entire cast and crew of the movie are equally hot for Alice, including make-up artist and model-builder Joe Lamb (The Between's Joel Courtney), the son of a local deputy. Unfortunately, Joe's father has an unpleasant history with Alice's father Louis (ER's Ron Eldard), which complicates things when the two find themselves getting entangled. While the crew are shooting a pivotal scene at the local train station, they witness--and unintentionally film--a truck, driven by local biology teacher Dr. Woodward (John Dies at the End's Glynn Turman), driving onto the tracks and into the path of an oncoming train, causing the worst derailment in Ohio history. When the authorities arrive to clean it up, they turn out to be military types, led by sadistic tinpot dictator Nelec (Warrior's Noah Emmerich), who immediately crosses paths, and hackles, with Deputy Lamb, who is elevated to acting Sheriff when his boss, Sheriff Pruitt (Edward Scissorhands' Brett Rice), disappears under mysterious circumstances.<br /><br />Honestly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much has been made of the fact that this is not only a love letter to 1979, but is also a love letter to a number of eighties films (notably E.T. and The Goonies), as well as closely mirroring Abrams' own Cloverfield. This is true. And if that bothers you, so be it. I didn't have a problem with it at all; better an homage than yet another Hollywood remake, as far as I'm concerned. Especially when that homage is as well-shot and well-acted as this one is.<br /><br />Much has also been made of the movie's many anachronisms--the two most obvious being mentions of Rubik's Cubes and Walkmen, neither of which was available in America until 1980. Yes, these things jar, and yes, I did shave off a bit of star for them, but the way I see it, this is Abrams' love letter to the time period, rather than something he exhaustively researched, and he wrote it how he remembered it. Should he have gone back and checked that all his cultural references actually made sense given the setting, or maybe changed the year to 1981? Yeah, he probably should have. Am I going to say \\"this movie is crap and you shouldn't watch it\\" because he didn't, as some of the more vociferous critics on the IMDB boards have? Of course not. That would be like saying \\"you shouldn't see The Serpent and the Rainbow because Zakes Mokae is from South Africa, not Haiti.\\" Ridiculous.<br /><br />You may have to be of a certain age to get the most out of this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, just go with it and you'll have a very good time. *** ½<br />You may have to be of a certain age to get the most out of this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, just go with it and you'll have a very good time. *** ½
B0058YPGSY|4.0|Can't fault it really, but it loses a star for dragging on and on and on.... Obviously a must watch for those of us who are addicted to SOA. At least it sets the stage for an explosive next season. Might as well get it, if you've come this far!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 are outstanding, each episode was extremely interesting, time passed quickly.  However, I would judge season 3 as good but not as good as seasons 1 and 2.
B005LAII44|2.0|That, it has: lots of action. Stuff blows up, fight scenes with amazing choreography, heart-stopping stunts, exciting scenery all over the world, good guys win in the end - you know, the usual. And it has Bruce Willis's wise-cracking character, and that just makes an action flick more active.<br /><br />(G.I. Joe fans should stop at this point.)<br /><br />But, I now realize there's a hierarchy among movies. Although some are better and some worse, comic book movies often don't rise to the level of most other movies around. And movies based on video games rarely rise to the comic book movie level. And (fans of the [[ASIN:B00B020PO8 Barbie movies]] are free to chime in), I suspect that movies based on toys are hard pressed reach the video game level. With Hasbro featured boldly in the credits, this falls well into that last category. So, if you really insist that movies make sense, even within their fictions, this won't offer you very much. And although Willis fit in well, he seemed sorely under-used by the script.<br /><br />OK, of its sort, but not the most elevated sort.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B009POCG2C|4.0|I got the opportunity to view TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE on two separate flights.  My goodness, is film legend Clint Eastwood making a memorable ride into the sunset (arguing with an empty chair notwithstanding), not only as a gifted director/producer, but as a squinting, raspy-voiced actor.  You can't help but like him, which is why I so enjoyed TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.  Here Eastwood plays aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus--a seasoned veteran who avoids statistics and numbers to evaluate talent. Gus relies on the old eyeball test; trouble is, the old eyeballs are failing him.  And Gus has to deal with a Braves front office just itching to get rid of him, led by director of scouting operations Phillip (Matthew Lillard).  Yet also residing in the front office is Gus's good friend and ally Pete (John Goodman just keeps getting better and better).  With Gus en route to scout the most sought-after player in the country, a concerned Pete contacts Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), a busy lawyer on the fast track to make partner in her firm.  Yet Mickey takes a leave of absence to accompany her father; their reunion is bittersweet, to say the least.<br /><br />Over the course of Gus and Mickey's journey, they encounter Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former ballplayer and current Red Sox scout with broadcast aspirations.  Gus had once signed Johnny, so they're competitors on friendly terms, and Johnny is romantically attracted to an (initially) indifferent Mickey from the start.  So as the trio scouts the decided diva slugger named Bo (Joe Massingill makes this brat truly unlikable), who, as Gus insists to his superiors, has \\"trouble with the curve,\\" Gus and Mickey reconnect, Mickey and Johnny also connect, and, in the unlikeliest of places, Mickey discovers an amazing pitching talent who ultimately gives both Phillip and Bo their long overdue comeuppances.  Like Eastwood himself, the film occasionally feels a little long in the tooth, and meanders and flows a tad unevenly before recovering to deliver its predictable feel-good ending.  Yet these slight irritations take little away from TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE'S tender portrayal of a father and daughter finally getting acquainted after decades of estrangement.  It's a solid double, right up the middle.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.tad unevenly before recovering to deliver its predictable feel-good ending.

B00BOL126U|3.0|I cannot speak for the whole series because I gave up after episode 1.  I applaud The History Channel for trying something new (hence, 3 stars), but I want a good ol' documentary, not a movie.  Maybe it gets better down the line but the first episode was kind of boring and not intriguing enough for me to watch the next one or to continue to record it.  When they do a documentary-type show about the Vikings, I'll watch it. Until then, count me out.

B00BCR353E|5.0|It seems hard to find a review of any bands latest album that isn't compared to their 1st album, or their most critically acclaimed album, etc. This is the latest Strokes album and I aim to give my honest review of \\"Comedown Machine\\" as an album, on its own, regardless of past material. As probably anyone reading this knows, the Strokes are a very tight and solid band with the ability to make music for the sake of music, art and not necessarily much care about the charts.<br /><br />On this album they certainly look back to their 80's influences. Scoff or laugh if you must, but does anyone else hear, not one but a few Michael Jackson-like guitar riffs, tones and solos? Believe me, this is no complaint, I love Michael Jackson and the way the Strokes have intertwined some nice 80's disco beats with the MJ guitar sounds really works for me. It's not as much as a departure from former sound ala Tegan & Sara's \\"heartthrob\\" yet I think as Tegan & Sara looked back on Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, the Strokes were looking back at the King of Pop. You may have to hear this album a few times to find those 80's influences, but they're there. The opening track \\"Tap Out\\" for example has that MJ-Like bass line and beat right off the bat!<br /><br />We all know by now that Julian Casablancas sings several tracks in falsetto on this album, something I can't recall him doing before? As I'm sure it's not for everyone, I'm also sure it's right on time for others! Personally, the first time I heard \\"One Way Trigger\\" I was floored. I even questioned whether it was a genuine Strokes song, or had someone played a joke on me? The falsetto mixed in with classic laid back Julian vocal style might make that my favorite track on the album.<br /><br />The closing track, sounding like it's coming out of an old am tube radio is a perfect slow and jazzy closer, though I wish Julian's vocal track had been turned up a bit. Really, my biggest joy from this album(Julian's various vocals) might be my only complaint. It's not on every track, yet there are several where I wish they had turned his vocals up, since they seem to get drowned out by the guitars a bit. I've listened to this album about 12 times, both on headphones and regular speakers and the vocals benefit from the intimacy of the headphones, but I'm not always wearing headphones.<br /><br />*Specifically on the vinyl. Fantastic job, solid 180g and unlike many new releases on vinyl, this one sounds as vinyl should! The package leaves a bit to be desired as it only contains the lp, a download card and well, that's it. I purchased the CD as well and though it has no lyrics or liner notes the cd has a 8 panel fold out with silhouettes of the strokes against a red background. The vinyl could have come with something similar or a lyric insert.<br /><br />Looking back at another generations music for inspiration, these matured Strokes have put out a fantastic album in my opinion.complaint.

Consistent with the research process, analytic work on interventions, advocacy, and models of introversion/extroversion can follow, perhaps appropriately in academic journals.

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I'm just watching this now as I type this. The soundtrack is relaxing. Great acting and dialogue. A family drama. You might also like The Royal Tenanbaums. Matt King (Clooney) finds that his wife has been in an accident and looks after his two daughters; rebelious Alex (Shailene Woodley) and young Scotty. They go visiting family and friends. There is Sid, who often puts his foot in it. Various characters. Amazing scenery. Clooney is always on top form. See Up In The Air. I recommend this film to everyone. Buy or rent it now.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A great actor who played the part well, the movie was made well but the character was someone you want to dislike. Will make me think the next time I get on a plane.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this. Its simple and easy to use. More relyable than my cell phone! I like that it has a gradual increase in sound! Recommeznd!
630471193X|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and wanted my family to see it.  I have been looking for it on netflix and in stores but counldn't find it.  On amazon there it was.  It came quickly and I enjoyed it with my family who loved it as well.  Love the tree swaying scenes as relaxation.  I have trees all around my house and love to watch the wind in the trees and listen to the sound.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|A good western with plenty of action. You might also like Cowboys & Aliens, Wild Wild West, Back To The Future 3. Megan Fox is hot as always. I like the scenes where Hex (Josh Brolin) talks to the dead. His arch nemisis is played by John Malkovich. It's an entertaining film so you'd be doing nowt wrong by checking it out.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book sucked me in from page 1. I felt like I was there hiking the pct with Cheryl. It also deepened the need for me to go on a great trek like hers.
B0026KX6TY|5.0|Heart warming, funny and enjoyable life drama about pursuing passions, fatherhood and the competitive spirit. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone even if you are not a chess aficionado.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Got this as a birthday gift for my teenage son.  He loved it!! Great price as well.  Love getting a deal.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love Om Nom or whatever his name is. He is the cutest little guy ever. This game is so cute and I love the concept.Trying to get a piece of candy of a rope and into a cute green monsters mouth.  How cute???
B00498YZFK|3.0|Good film that not everyone will get.  Its a view into a very different type of lifestyle that most will not be able to relate.  Jennifer Lawrence is great, as usual.  However, I do believe that the film is plagued by slow moments that would bother most movie goers.
B004132I20|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Television ever written and season two is even better!! I can't wait for the third season.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Quirky, humorous, sad, heart- wrenching, heartwarming -- so many emotions in one book.  Loved, loved, loved it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It's pretty good except it's kinda hard. I dunno about you but I like to get mine right after the first like six tries. I like it because you can be very creative with it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show.  Very intelligent and interesting.  Characters are complex and believable.  Long live &#34;The Good Wife.&#34;  I just wish CBS would give it a better time slot so it isn't always delayed from football games.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted the latest information on the Atkins DIet.  I am so glad I did! The new Atkins diet is much easier to follow than the original one I tried severeal years ago. I highly recommend this book and this diet!!  I am a RN and this is my second time on the diet. I am starting over again because I failed to do the maintenence program and regained the weight.<br />Don't give up. I am one of the ones who loses weight very slowly, partly because of my medications, but I know with out a doubt that if I follow this diet, the weight will come off!
B008D36INE|2.0|If only Hester had been successful on her first attempt!  Then nobody would have been subjected to this interminably boring and excruciatingly depressing film.  I'm warning you now.  Avoid this disaster at all cost.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fin app. I enjoy playing very much. The swiping instead off controls males it much easier because you don't have to remember where the up or down button is.
0385738781|5.0|I bought this for my 12 yrd old son and he can't put the book down. Success!<br />I was nervous about the content but when he began to describe the events<br />taking place, he sold me on his satisfaction.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I'm writing this after the release of Season 3, so I hope my headline doesn't spoil the plot for anyone. In brief, I think the second season is the best of the three. It has it's ups and downs, but it concludes with a happy ending, which after season 1 and later season 3 is appreciated. Season 2 focuses on the Great War, primarily the home front. Downton Abbey has been converted to a convalescent center and the Crawley girls are nurses. It's a great history lesson and enjoyable drama. As I said at the outset, Season 2 is my favorite season so far.
B005IKZSYA|1.0|This was no more than a costume drama.The Swiss Guards uniforms were the best part of it. It had no usesful message. It treated the cardinals of the church like children. It was a goofy waste of time.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|So at first you think, &#34; oh no, another good girl meets bad boy=drama, drama, drama, blah blah blah&#34;. But you soon find out that Travis isn't the only one with a badass persona. Abby has quite a shady past of her own that shows through as their relationship grows. Yes there's mommy and daddy issues but lets face it, in real life, that's not really uncommon. Their friends, America and Shep, add extra awesomeness to the overall story. Travis has a side gig as an underground fighter and from what I can conjure up, he's a sexy, tatted up bad boy;-) Their story was not overly frustrating, it was sweet, maddening, hot and crazy. The end was a little abrupt for me but I felt satisfied that the story could either end there or continue into another book. From what I understand, the next book is the same story through Travis's point of view. I'm diggin that, definitely on preorder lockdown!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I love this story and have reread it many times, especially near Christmas. If Scrooge can become a nice guy, then, there's hope for all of us.
0345803493|5.0|Wonderful book left me anticipated for the next book. I loved it. I would recommend this trilogy to Any who has found it difficult to have sex with their husband.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't wait for season 4. I did hate to see Matteuw die though. Now we have two orphan children in the family.
1616550414|5.0|It is really big, it is no simple book, it is big and fat, has all the information about all the zelda games released, concept art, character information, everything. Really worth the $30 bucks
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I have enjoyed Downton Abbey from Season 1. I own the DVDs for all three seasons. There are some sad twists to the Crawley story in Season 3, which I won't detail so as to avoid spoilers. The way Season 3 differs from the prior two seasons is this: when I re-watch Season 3, I skip over certain parts of the story. Though they are well dramatized and the acting is superb, the story line is too painful. I hope that Season 4 will find more members of the cast still with the show at season's end.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Is there a help screen telling me how to play it. I can't seem to play it on my kindle fire. What about using it on my computer?
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game wish could play longer without having to purchase though otherwise i like the challenge and diversity as it unique to other games -use can actually use your brain.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Aside of teddie (which i personally hate) the game is awesome, it is so detailled, has a lot of extras that the ps2 version didnt have, a must buy if you have a vita and liked any other persona game.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|k
B00B99KJR0|4.0|So far I have found this game enjoyable. It looks and sounds great on Kindle Fire HD. Early levels are easier and then get progressively more difficult... as they should. Can you get three stars on each level? Give it a try! If you like match three games I recommend this one.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is not &#34;totally&#34; ad free...every so often up pops an ad for Campbells soup or some other ad. Not often, but not totally ad free. But<br />definitely a fun game. I particularly enjoy the music, at least for a few minutes before it gets monotonous.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|this movie shows how we humans take upon ourselves to be gate keepers of good and bad, without realizing that the universal diety only requires kindness towards each other.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|good movie
B00846REIS|5.0|I read Bared To You and Reflected In You before I read Fifty Shades!! I've read all 3 Fifty Shades books and now I'm reading Bared To You and Reflected In You again so I'll be ready for Sylvia's 3rd Crossfire Novel Entwined With You!!! Their even better the 2nd time around!! Eva and Gideon!! OMG!! These book are GREAT!!! I can't wait to read Entwined With You and I hope there's a fourth Crossfire novel!! I wanted Fifty Shades to keep going so maybe Sylvia won't stop with 3!! I recommend this to anyone who liked or even didn't like Fifty Shades! Bared To You has a completely different storyline so if you miss Fifty Shades then you need to get this book!!!
B003UYV08E|4.0|The product arrived a day before Amazon said it would, and the disc itself was in pristine condition. However, the case had a large hole on the back, likely from something being dropped on it or a finger being pushed through.
B008J344BQ|5.0|There are already 3 hits that came out of this album, and I really love the last single 'Just give me a Reason&#34; that screams in my head.. that this is indeed the reason to buy this Album.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|For all that is good and right in enlightenment theory, May Americans read this and other works of historical, philosophical and political critical theory.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful love story.............LOVE the twist at the end!!  A great Nicholas Sparks novel!!  Can't wait to see the movie.  Great sit down, by yourself book!
B004LP3AYI|2.0|As stated in other reviews, not a great follow up to the first. All the action takes place in the last few chapters. Magic seems to just happen and solves every problem. Richard is supposed to be training throughout the entire book, but in the end he just lets things happen and every problem is solved.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Amazon continually pops up game circle popups that interrupts the  game. Just say no and download from someone else and turn off auto updates otherwise they will update on the next version and cause the popups to appear.
B00BQUUH7E|4.0|the game is pritty cool but the should make it harder to win. It is still cool. mabe there could be more people on a team
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So happy that I purchased Downton Abbey.  I love watching the past episodes over again and caught up on one episode I missed. Worth every penny!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I would recommend these headphones to anybody who likes to listen to music without a lot of interference from background noise.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I really miss this series, it was cancelled before it had time to really get going.  Enjoy the humor between Sheppard and McKay, not to mention the overall cast was great.  I will always give the first two series of Stargate five stars, What they came up with and called Universe was trash.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've had these books on my Kindle app for a few months, focusing instead on hard covet books. Recently, I was in between things and waiting, and I don't idle well. I started the first in the series and became totally hooked, reading whenever I had a spare moment. I enjoy a very eclectic mix if books, including scifi, and this series is one of the best I have read in some time. In the time of seemingly endless wars this country has gotten stuck in, and all of the mass killings in the last year, this series makes me have to look at where we could end up if all this nonsense isn't stopped soon. These books are a plea to stop the violence, end these wars, focus on peace now.
B009DZDJU6|1.0|Don't watch it. Horrible movie. Predictable, no history at all. Would not watch again. Do not buy this product. Buy something else.
1400049628|4.0|Although I disagree with a few of his conclusions about weapons it is an interesting book and much information if your planning to survive and am a prepper like me or a great source of entertainment now remember people who think zombie preppers are crazy we don't always think zombies will come but we figure if we're prepared for zombies were prepared for every thing .overall a . great buy
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|I love action packeted movies and this movie is action packed... but with soulless boring sllloooooowwwwwww motion effects that just make you want to take a fall asleep.

0783230079|5.0|I haven't watched the movie yet, in fact plan to tomorrow with a friend.  I saw part of it on TV and enjoyed what I saw.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good book for fledgling. D/S relationships. Kind of mild for true enthusiasts of the game. More for the ladies then men.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love the character development. I love the story line. Can't wait for season 3. Game of Thrones decidedly RULES!!!!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love hidden object games and this one is no different. Love that I do not need to use zoom to find objects. More, please!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I absolutely love watching NCIS.  The character development over the years has been awesome, and Season 10 is no exception.  The interplay between characters is top notch.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|i love the quality the dvd is excellent and the movie great at a great price and i would recommend it
0061992860|5.0|This book is very small, like the size of 2 decks of cards, but thicker. It is great because it takes up very little room in an emergency bag. But of course the bad part is it is pretty small text and can be hard to read for those of us with less than perfect vision. I have horrible eyesight and have worn glasses since I was 4 years old, and I'm almost 40 now. I don't really have a problem reading the text in this book, but it is small, and without my glasses there would be no chance of me being able to read it (but that's true of most anything for me).
B00932A3SK|4.0|Subtitles are extra effort but it was worth it.  This surprising story takes betrayal and makes a happy ending.  Very relatable and exciting.
B005PK553C|4.0|I have no idea what I watched, but it made sense and at the same time it was very confusing.<br />Much more satisfying than LOST though! So much more!
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Definitely a must for Wagner fans, and also an excellent choice for students of the human voice. The orchestra is a bonafide opera orchestra, which enhances the recording in myriad ways.<br />Many of us will not live long enough to hear another singer as gifted as Jonas Kaufmann.<br />Prepare to be transported!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A realistic rendition of the life of a Seal...an exceptional Seal with a gift for understatement. He will be missed.
B00AJLHUAS|3.0|I love this type of music and admire the musician for converting his rock music to music of the 20's but the music didn't &#34;wow&#34; me.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|All of the books in this trilogy are chock full of usage errors. The writing is weak, and desperately in need of a skilled editorial hand. Rice has characters &#34;yell&#34; when they should instead express shock, dismay, or perhaps even cry out. One of the main characters' name even changes spellings between the first and the second book. The story itself fits into the archetypal boy-discovers-he's-unusual-and-goes-on-hero's-journey mold. That's fine, but some of the material is too grosslly similar to some other series that are enjoying success right now. Further, while I applaud an author who is willing to write a gay character into their book, Rice's two primary gay characters are villainous and weak, which I find a bit homophobic. Give us just one gay character to be proud of, and this would smart considerably less.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Great overview of an important artist's output. Real good work by Rhino with the compilation. Excellent for both those who already know the work and those newly curious. Filled with interesting remixes, live versions and solid CD sound. Well done all the way around.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I love to use this app on my Galaxy nexus, but it has a terrible problem of randomly stopping while playing music. I'm pretty sure it isn't some specific notification that stops the player, it's just random. Then you have to turn on your phone, unlock, and hit play manually to restart. Big problem, but otherwise great app.
B008X5CMCS|3.0|It was fun to watch Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson in early on screen career roles. Not a great movie but I thought it was worth watching. Patrick Stewart gave me a good laugh. If you're a Star Trek NG fan you'll see a big difference in his acting styles.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|While The Bone Bed makes a fine contribution to the Scarpetta canon, Cornwell seemed to get lost in the constant mechanic of using very specific acronyms (fine), and then having her characters explain them in stilted dialogue. I would much rather see her include them in an index, so that if I don't know them I can look them up. Her characters are obviously familiar with these terms, and might use them every day. As such, to have them constantly spelling out the whole acronym to each other (not even to someone who may not know the term) just seems hokey.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a well done app. The setup is straightforward. Nice set of controls. Clear and simple. Sounds are amazing for a phone. Selection of bells. Journal capability to help keep track of experience. Nice touch of the number of others around the world using the app when you are.
B00520R146|5.0|It is a great movie. My baby enjoyed very much. Even though it was an used dvd, it looked really good. I'm happy with my purchase.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I haven't watched the movie - I gave it as a gift. From what I heard, it worked just fine.
B009AMANBA|4.0|LINCOLN is typical Spielberg---broad in scope, beautifully filmed, and reverently manipulative.<br />It's also tedious and often superfluous, heavy on political drama.  Some of the more intimate scenes are filmed at a distance, lessening their impact.<br />Daniel Day-Lewis perfectly embodies the essence of Lincoln, his sensitivity, fatigue and fierce dedication to his cause.  His Oscar is deserved.  Tommy Lee Jones amd Sally Field also give performances validating their Oscar noms.  The large supporting cast is impressive, especially Joseph Gordon Levitt, James Spader, Jared Harris and David Strathairn.  John Williams score is complimentary and majestic.<br />LINCOLN does demonstrate the importance of the President's influence in America's history and Spielberg's dedication to bringing this to life is admirable indeed.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Wish Sam would stop mugging. Same exact expressions on everything that happens, he is pissed off, Even condemned men on death row have some humor or smile a couple of times be for they are dropped through the gallows trap door. Quality of streaming, very good.

0547848412|4.0|I couldn't bring myself to see the movie even though the trailers were beautiful.  As an animal lover some aspects of this story were difficult to read.  It was so well written as too draw me in and allow myself amazing imagery even though some of it became very unpleasantly graphic.
0307730697|5.0|I bought several of these books as I had read it on line before I purchased it. I gave them to my men relatives as Christmas presents and everyone of them have truly enjoyed the book. This seal was from Arkansas and I live in Arkansas so it came home fast  and helped us understand what the troops are going though during Military service.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Excellent app for meditation. Very natural sounds. My daughter really enjoys listening to this amazing melodies before going to sleep. It's great that you can create your own combination of sounds.
B00BDPW7XE|5.0|I own all available BBT CDs. I believe that all of them are really good albums. If BBT were to produce a live DVD, I would welcome the inclusion of EE1 and EE2 as the whole performance and be happy. I think that BBT is maturing very nicely and anyone that likes Genesis and progressive music will find this album and the companion album a delight. I really hope that these guys do a DVD concert someday!
B007XNAQPG|5.0|As a Duran fan for 28 years, I enjoy watching their live performances.  I'm also a musician, so I get a kick out of watching them play and checking out their gear.  I thought the Live from London DVD was better, though.  I would've liked to have seen more behind the scenes stuff, and they should have included the Girl Panic video.  But still a must-have for the Duran fan.
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|Whether you liked SOTU or not - I happen to love it and stand by my review - Depeche Mode's latest album has the makings of a modern classic. To anyone who thinks that Violator was their crowning achievement, this album will make you reach out and touch faith all over again. For starters, it's built on the same musical veneer as Violator but that's where the similarities end. The heavy hooks are traded for lighter, nimbler ones on a canvas that leaves a lot of white space for effect. Musically, the airiness of a less-is-more approach to the arrangements gives the album an almost ethereal, trance like quality that propels it to greatness, underscored by deft studio production from Ben Hillier and Flood and skillful flourishing touches from Christoffer Berg. The result is a fresh sounding modern piece that delivers catchy melodies and pleasing sounds, much like the bonus material on the SOTU box set, in particular Ghost and Light, two of the best songs they've recorded and sound absolutely terrific, but I digress...Other than for Flood's involvement I didn't detect much of an influence from SOFAD, with the possible exception of All That's Mine.<br /><br />Virtually every song is a standout and some like Slow, Soft Touch/Raw Nerve and My Little Universe deliver a refreshingly varied approach. A particular favorite of mine is Alone whose lyrics I found especially haunting: \\"I couldn't save your soul; I couldn't even take you home\\". Goodbye is another haunt but more in the way it is sung. Other gems include Angel, Welcome to My World, Secret to the End, Broken, Always, All That's Mine, Happens All the Time and Long Time Lie (the last four appear on the deluxe version).<br /><br />Through it all, one can't help but appreciate how great Dave sounds; his pristine vocals are delivered pitch perfect. There's really not a weak moment on the album though I found that a couple of songs (Soothe My Soul, Goodbye), excellent in their own right, could have benefited from a little less repetition in the chorus. Another song, The Child Inside had an all too familiar sound to it and could have easily been substituted on the main album with Always, arguably the best Martin-sung song since Ultra. Heaven is a bit of an anomaly. It's truly a great song but demands patience from the listener. Plucked from the album as the first single it may come across as a fish out of water in the singles charts but its unique production befits a Depeche Mode song and having listened to it many times, it has grown on me to the point where I no longer question its selection. I'm sure others may see it differently particularly when compared to some of the more upbeat songs like its successor, Soothe My Soul.<br /><br />With this album, I feel that Depeche Mode have elevated their music to a different realm that will expose them to a new generation of fans, while heightening their appeal to fans of such artists like Muse and Trent Reznor. All in all, it's a stellar album and one that's bound for glory and longevity.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|My concert Blu-Rays are my favorites of my collection and this one is a great addition.  One great song after another- including many solo songs from the various members.  The picture and sound is amazing- the band still sounds great!  Really makes you appreciate just how great they were (as if I didn't before?)  I also like that I can leave this on as background when I have friends over- who doesn't like the Eagles?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn is an unbelievably brave writer.  This book is incredible and full of twists and turns.  Very suspenseful and surprising!
1423140605|5.0|Ok, I'll do this review without any spoilers. Considering Riordan is going to be popping out a new Heroes of Olympus book every year around October (so I can't wait for House of Hades) I'll just have to wait for his next installment. I'm a fan of young-adult books, and even more of a fan of greek mythology. So this series goes well hand in hand for me.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Started watching Nashville this spring and catching up via Hulu.  The music is absolutely amazing- my whole family listens to the soundtrack regularly.  I want to take off a star because Fade Into You should have been included on the soundtrack, but it is too good for me to take off a star!

B005NPCUC8|5.0|I had been listening everybody raving about this record for years, so I decided to give it a try.  My headline summarizes my impression, great audio experience.  Definitively a classic.
B00122MWBK|4.0|Great collection for the casual fan looking for the hits.  I would have liked for them to have included some outtakes or live versions.
B00632HWOG|1.0|It would be hard to design a program worse than yahoo mail.  For many years this<br />was not the case but recently yahoo has gotten extremely greedy and puts money first<br />and customers way down the line.  The only reason I use it at all is that I have many emails<br />from many people and places and it's difficult to get them to switch.<br />Yahoo Sucks.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters are believable. It's been a long time since I read a book which made me laugh out loud and cry as well.

B004RUF022|5.0|I have had several of this artist's recordings in my collection, but when I learned of her recent demise, and the availability of this set, I rushed to get it. I have not been disappointed. The performances and recording qualities are nonpareil.
B008476HBM|4.0|It is very hard to write something original about a story that is `universally' this well known. I mean there can't be many people in the world who haven't read the book or seen one of the many movies and TV-shows that have been based on this story. I know that I can never think of Darcy with imagining Colin Firth with his wet shirt plastered to his chest. And that brings me to my first issue with this book, which isn't book related at all if I'm honest. I discovered that I really don't like reading a book (for the first time I should add) when I'm already completely aware of the story in it. What is more, I don't like having other people's ideas of what the characters look like in my head before I have had a chance to form my own. With this book, unfortunately, that was unavoidable and I know it influenced my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />On the other hand, I did enjoy reading Pride and Prejudice. I liked the insight it gave into life at the turn of the 19th century. I loved having a closer look at how the middle and upper classes lived and interacted. The descriptions of the interactions between those of different standing were as fascinating as it was unimaginable to this modern mind.<br /><br />The way the title is reflected in the two main characters - with Darcy's Pride running head first into Elizabeth's Prejudice - was a joy to read and maybe not as specific to the time the story is set in as I would like to think.<br /><br />And that brings me to my next observation. It is astonishing to think how little romance novels have changed over the past 200 years. In this book we find all the elements we would expect in modern novels: the misunderstandings, the dastardly villain, the broody and seemingly distant hero, the quirky and spirited heroine, the nice girl and the vixen they all make an appearance and play their role in the story. In fact, were this a modern romance I would call it predictable and uninspired so well does it cover every possible plot device. Remembering when this book was actually written I will call it clever.<br /><br />Another thing that fascinated me was the social commentary Jane Austen provides in this story. The snobbery of the middle classes, the contempt of those in the higher classes for those they perceive as being less than them, and the importance of money when it comes to being able to marry someone made this story historically significant as well as an enjoyable read.<br /><br />What I really appreciated in this book is the way in which Jane Austin allowed her heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, to find her own way and come to her own conclusions in a time when women were rarely alone long enough to think, never mind act, for themselves. As Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n says in his book `New Ways to Kill Your Mother' this is achieved by separating Lizzie from the family members who might influence her at crucial times in the story.<br /><br />\\"Power instead is handed directly to the heroine and this power arises from the quality of her own intelligence. It is her own ability to be alone, to move alone, to be seen alone, to come to conclusions alone, that sets her apart.\\"<br /><br />I also have to admit that after reading this book I've come to a new appreciation of P.D. James' `Death Comes to Pemberley'. I've read enough reviews by others to realize that many readers disagree with me on this, but I find that her story gives a rather satisfying sequel to Pride and Prejudice. I may have to read that book again at some point now that I'm more intimately acquainted with all the main characters and back-stories.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that this was a pleasant reading experience that I would probably have enjoyed more if I had not been as intimately aware of the story as I was.vice.

B00BUL0XYG|2.0|I may tick off some fans of the Strokes, but this album just doesn't do it for me. I thought First Impressions Of Earth was a masterpiece and Casablanca's Phrases For The Young was catchy and diverse as it headed into more of synth pop direction. But this album, while compared to the direction Angles was heading, just drones on and on... uninspired and lacking energy while trying to be experimental. 39 minutes and 55 seconds go by and nothing sticks. After a second listen, nothing stands out. I would almost consider this a very half-a$$ed PFTY II instead of even thinking that it's sounding like a real Strokes record. Even opening this CD and you'll see that it folds open to show that the inside cover is blank... which unfortunately is exactly how my head feels after a listen to this disc. I don't know if it's the rumored tensions in the band or it's an album just to fulfill their obligation to RCA but I'll give this one more listen and then it's back to Juicebox.

B0019N95IK|4.0|I am bringing this review over from the DVDs.  It still holds true!<br /><br />This is a long time coming, and I know there is already a ton of reviews for this series. I just have to give my take on this series just too kind of cleanse my soul after watching it for the second time.<br /><br />Broken Bow was the start of the series, and it had a lot of promise and it gave me so much hope for the show. Who wouldn't want to see the missions before the Original Trek Crew of Kirk and Spock? In this episode we see the Klingons for the first time in the Trek universe and to any fan of Star Trek you immediately notice something that most casual fans might not. So it starts to make you think about the possibilities of what could have happened. It was a great time to be a Trek fan.<br /><br />Season One started out strong and for the most part was a great first step in building the Trek universe, That said Season two was dragged down by time travel, too much was used to try and explain things. It was unnecessary and a cheap way to explain things. In my opinion it brought the show down and ruined what could have been an outstanding show. The second season turns Enterprise into an acceptable TV drama that was to busy trying to confuse everyone.<br /><br />Season two brought more time travel into the mix with trying to expand the \\"Temporal Cold War\\". Season one had the \\"Temporal Cold War\\" and if you didn't get it by the end of season one, season two and three throw it in your face every time they can. It really cheapens the Trek universe and it reveals too much to Captain Archer. Even with all the future information given to him you wonder why he makes some of the decisions he makes knowing full well what would happen if he just did it another way. With the information given to Captain Archer about the Federation being formed you feel as if it deprives you and him of the experience of creating it. There was no need for time travel in this show. Season two was were a lot of the fans left the show on to better things.<br /><br />If Season two was not enough to make you turn it off, Season three was another good reason to do so. As with season two and one the \\"Temporal Cold War\\" plays a big role with the Xindi learning of how Earth is going to destroy their home world from another faction of the Cold War feeding the Xindi lies. This in an attempt to destroy humans so the other species manipulating the Xindi could eventually take over the known universe. So you guessed it, more time travel and more nonsense. The Season starts off with the Xindi sending a massive weapon of mass destruction to Earth which ends up killing 7 million people. So humans and Enterprise has to go to \\"The Expanse\\" to find the Xindi and stop them from completing an even bigger weapon that would destroy Earth in one blow. This Season also tries to strengthen a romance that you feel was developing slightly in the First and Second seasons. The season ends with Enterprise being thrown back into time. Once again you're left wondering if they will just let the \\"Cold War\\" die and get back to being Star Trek!!<br /><br />If you managed to stick with the show you're finally made it to the best part of what unfortunately became the last season of this show. It started out weak with the whole time travel thing, but they finally stopped the nonsense with time travel and focused on what was important. It got the series back on track, and featured more of the aliens we have come to know. The first part started off with the Augments and even has a reference to the \\"Botany Bay\\" and \\"KHAN\\"! The show also started to explain the Klingon disease that changed their appearance to what we saw in the Original Show with Kirk. This Fourth season was what we craved the show to be from the start and it was delivering on so many levels only to destroy you in the finial episode.<br /><br />The last episode is what makes people cringe with fear when they watch this show. They know what's coming. I for one hated the last episode as it basically makes you feel the whole experience was a joke from the start. Was it real or all fake? The little joke they had going though the whole series about a chief which you never see until now makes you wonder was it all worth it. The last episode cheapens what the whole cast had worked for and basically turned it into a half baked Star Trek \\"The Next Generation\\" episode.<br /><br />A few things could have been changed and this episode would have been great! Change one would be get rid of the TNG cast and all references to TNG. Let it be about Enterprise and not William Riker! Don't kill off an awesome character that everyone agrees is one of the best in the show for no reason. This was done just to make fans talk, and it was senseless, there was no point in the killing and it seemed so forced like it was a joke to the writers. Lastly show the speech we all wanted to see. Why was this never shown? It was start of the federation, the speech that made it comes into being and nothing was shown. If you took out all the worthless TNG crap they would have had plenty of time to show the speech. Besides that it was an ok episode and I understood what they were trying to do, but it failed miserably. ( I really believe if you just take out the one death, everyone would be happy with this episode, it would not make it so hated like it is. Still a bad episode but that one death thows it over the top of being bad).<br /><br />Besides the last episode and the clunky 2nd and 3rd season, this is a great show. The fourth season really does hit a home run, and it's too bad they canceled it. I hope they could do something in the future with Star Trek. It's like something has been missing for so long from TV and it needs to come back in the \\"Original Time Line\\". Maybe the first episode should try and fix the damage done to Enterprise with another holodeck recreation of the 'Real Events\\". Having said how badly this show ends, I would still recommend this show to Trek Fans. It's a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy. I never really owned the real DVD set so(I bought my DVD's in Afghanistan, so what I really have is a Ripped version of the show. :-), I thought it was about time I buy the show in a proper format.<br /><br />First, I would like everyone to understand the reason why the first season of \\"Enterprise\\" is not up to picture quality like \\"The Original Star Trek\\" or \\"The Next Generation\\". This is not a remaster of \\"Enterprise\\". This is simply a transfer of the original film to blu-ray disk. I am not the only one to realize this, Blu-Ray.com does not really talk about this, but another review does. Read the Digitalbits review it's very spot on!!<br /><br />The picture is an upgrade over the DVD's, but its not a huge upgrade. If you are like me and have not bought the DVDs yet, than this is the set you want. You will not be disappointed in the quality. The first episode was the worse picture out the whole season, but it did get better along the way. I believe this is due to the fact that the show was filmed when HD was still very young. On the plus side it's the first Star Trek filmed in Widescreen.<br /><br />The sound is not great, but it is 5.1 and it's an upgrade over the DVD's. The best thing about \\"Enterprise\\" on blu-ray is the special features. Words can not express the amount of extra's you get on this Blu-Ray. The extras alone prove how much love CBS put into this Blu-Ray set. If you think CBS is taking your money for a substandard blu-ray than the Special Features prove you wrong. All of the DVD extras and even the Best Buy Extras are presented here, plus a few new ones that will blow you away on the amount of information given on why the show was not what it could have been.<br /><br />Overall the score for this release is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. The picture could have been remastered, but I understand the reason why it was not. The picture was state of the art back in 2001 but today it does not hold up. The sound is good but could have been great. Despite the little problems \\"Enterprise\\" on blu-ray comes warping out of space dock onto your TV in a great package and is a overall great value.d this show to Trek Fans. It's a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book had me hooked from page one!  The characters were well written and the storyline intriguing.  I would highly recommend this book!  If you liked &#34;The Help&#34;, you'll love &#34;The Kitchen House&#34;!
B0084670FU|2.0|I was excited to watch this, as I am a big fan of Cate Blanchett.  Also a fan of Brad Pitt.  Given those two big names, I figured it had to be good.  Sadly, those two play remarkably small roles, and Cate's character is incoherent for a lot of her scenes.  The plot was a twist on the &#34;small world, intertwining lives&#34;, theme, similar to the movie &#34;Crash&#34;, but on a global scale.  The individual stories are compelling, some are strange, and the links between different stories is sometimes a reach.  Glad it was a rental on Prime, so I didn't have to &#34;pay&#34; for it...

B00BF123WG|2.0|Way too long. The film did not live up to all the hype. It's a good film but not nearly as good as the advertising behind it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I did enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire,  Easy to see and you don't have to be a brain surgeon to know how to play it. Does get a little dull not  very challenging. Sometimes that's all you want anyway.

B001OL4TR4|5.0|I love the story line, and the actors make it wonderful. Matthew Broderick is so funny and lovable. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer are amazing together.  Even the villain is  the perfectly evil.  You must watch it many times, because you will see something new every time.  Can't get enough!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|it is fum and challenging without being too hard. it is great for kids and adults. i would recommend it to enyone.
B002RI98BA|5.0|I am a great fan of US History, and - living in Europe as I am - I find the Civil War period especially interesting. My country has no colonial past, so the slavery / race issue is very foreign to me.<br />The way Abraham Lincoln tried to solve the question with empathy for the southern way of life and respect for the Constitution is amazing. That he was considered a moderate candidate on the slavery issue is a great surprise to me.<br />On the other hand the increasingly desperate actions of Southern lawmakers in the 1850's - up to and including the Dred Scott decision - do not read like history merely some 160 years old.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|this is a simple app that is easy to play. It is Not extremely challenging and kind of repeatitive. i good time killer
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|Argo is a feel-good actioner and as such suffers(despite opening sequence story boards describing how the present situation,the Ayotallian Revolution came to be)playing fast and loose with historical truth,grossly down playing Canadian involvement,portraying Iranian officials as childish and easily duped,distorting the rescue mission to make it seem far more nail-bitingly precarious and in the nick of time than it was.In the historical department Zero Dark Thirty stood as the year's pre-eminent political lightning rod film saddled with the burden of responsibility.The pill it was asking us to take was the torture.One film suffered the other rose,because there was no ambiguity in the portrayal of its hero,while the other introduces very dark moral ambiguities.Affleck swallowed accuracy in favour of easy-to-swallow heroics.Bigelow swallowed accuracy in favour of hard-to-swallow anti-heroics.The wider context of brutal and ignomious manipulation belongs to both films.In global power stakes America's empire since Vietnam,Iraq and Afghanistan is in decline.Argo's infelicities are conventional,creating a serviceable,feel-good cinematic narrative,telling Americans something great about themselves.<br /><br />However Iranian radicals are seen as a seething rabble unjustified in its insurgence against American emissaries who helped architect the nation's slide into monarchical decadence(a scene in which the six American hostages, and Affleck,trek across Tehran in a minibus and are assailed by the Iranian protestors,rendered as an amorphous tide of generalized hostility, is head-shakingly ludicrous.)The film is brilliantly balanced between the Hollywood sections,John Goodman and Alan Arkin bringing wit and humour,concocting the faked production through Mendez of a sci-fi movie in order to rescue the 6 US diplomats from Tehran during the hostage crisis,with Affleck playing the straight man with bright ideas and daring and Hollywood contacts.On the other hand if the mission goes wrong it could lead to humiliation and death.There is great pacing and we get to know the hostages as individuals.<br /><br />The Canadians took a lot of the risk of housing the hostages,drawing up faked passports,suffering the brunt of the PR flak when the hostages' liberation became headline news.Americans didn't just arrive in the nick of time to bail out the distressed,ineffectual Canadians.This is a wet dream of buccaneering foreign-policy intervention based on the pluck and gallantry of a doughty individual.Affleck is an intelligent,shrewdly commercial film-maker and has proved(if not as an actor) that he has a second life as a director with his two previous works before this. There are afterwords postscript to the film by Ken Taylor and a feature Rescued from Tehran with interviews with Jimmy Carter,Tony Mendez and the houseguests recounting their harrowing experience.Inconspicuous pop-corn flick or insidious in it breezy pleasure? Best summed up by the Hollywood's buzzwords,\\"Aah,go f*** yourself!\\"

B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Justin Timberlake's third album \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" has gotten rave reviews from all my music fiends on Twitter. However, I didn't enjoy it as much as them.  Not to say that I didn't enjoy it; I actually enjoyed much of it.  But there were many things that I hated about it.<br /><br />First, the things I liked: Timberlake is a talented performer. His voice and falsetto is excellent. The whole album has a classy vibe which is pleasant to listen to.  And there is a diversity of R&B influences on the album, both modern and classic. Those include Frank Ocean, Drake, Robin Thicke, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Motown.<br /><br />Now, what I hated about it. The lyrics of most of the songs are sub-par.  The Guardian's review was correct when it described the album's lyrics as `porny' and awful.  Also, the album is bloated.  Many of the songs are 7 or 8 minutes long. For most of those songs, the long length is unnecessary. The same beat and lyrics are repeated frequently. It just makes these songs drag.<br /><br />I enjoyed half of the songs on the album, while the other half was so-so.  \\"Suit and Tie\\" makes a great first single. Like some of Timberlake's previous work, it echoes Michael Jackson well. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" effectively combines the downtempo R&B of The Weeknd or Drake with a 70s R&B sound.  \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" echoes Frank Ocean.  It is the most creative song on the album, complete with introspective lyrics, sound effects and hazy strings.  \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" is a horn-y, upbeat late 70s-influenced track. It's a nice track, although it just needs the first four minutes, not the whole eight.  \\"Mirrors\\" is the most modern-sounding track. It's an excellent track that sounds like it could have been Timberlake's previous album.<br /><br />\\"Spaceship Coupe\\" echoes Prince's mid-80's sound. Prince is my favorite artist (besides Michael Jackson). Personally, I found it just an okay homage to Prince. Tracks \\"Let The Groove In\\" and \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" have decent, ethnic influenced beats, but suffer from a poor chorus and lyrics.<br /><br />Every pop and R&B fan should check the album. Despite the various flaws, there is some excellent music here.

B0055OG2BC|4.0|This was a great James Bond spoof, I had a lot of funny twists in it. I would recommend this film
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The show kept us on the edge of our seats, episode after episode after episode, we couldn't stop watching. The interaction between the characters, the build of their relationships and the let downs just added to the mystique of the show. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sci-fi mixed with action, adventure and mystery.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|It is a good game for the price of $1.25 There are no hidden objects just lots of puzzles which aren't really too difficult. It ran smooth and graphics are good. But you do run around a lot! Everything is pretty self explanatory so long as you don't miss something. Definitely recommend. if you're bored.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|I saw the Beatles first performance on Ed Sullivan show.  I was pretty young.  that was all we could talk about
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch, as usual, rocks your face off.  Another great album by an extraordinary band.  Warning, playing this while driving can cause speeding tickets.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It helps me get to sleep many nights. It is easy to use and has a good variety of sounds to choose from.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|this game looked really good but there is an error every time I try to install it witch is stupid
B009YG2ND8|4.0|What a classic. It also has better graphics than the original. The only thing I wished it had was a manuel to describe some of the symbols and any of the instructions from the tutorial just in case I missed them.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book grabs you and pulls you along and entertains with ease. Was a great pleasure to read. Get it now!
B003VANOFY|4.0|First off, I got this headset for an incredibly cheap price, but I'd be willing to pay full price for it. The headset itself has a very comfortable fit - I only noticed problems on my left ear when I first started using it but that only lasted about two days and I have not felt discomfort since, not even for 6 hours+ of gaming. The mic itself has very nice quality from what my friends have told me. The only thing I ever notice is if I tend to scream (which I do fairly often) I can hear some static feedback from my mic, but that's not too big of an issue and I have to get incredibly loud to hear it. The bass response is incredible, the battery lasts for a good 4-5 hours without needing charge. The surround sound is iffy - I don't really prefer to use it because it morphs peoples voices over Teamspeak or Skype. Though the bass is 2x as strong when surround sound is turned on, not sure why.<br /><br />Overall a great headset with a few peculiar quirks. I would easily recommend it to a friend.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Speedy delievery and great product in mint condition! Downtown Abbey speaks for itself! You're missing out if you don't watch this wonderfully created masterpiece. The original U.K. Version is the DVD to strike for. More details and film that's uncut like on the American TV show. The scenes are surely more fulfilling and won't leave you unsatisfied! My wife and I both love the series and have the whole U.K. Version collection on DVD. A Must buy!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I bought this mouse to replace a still servicing Logitech G9x, hoping to make use of the 3 thumb buttons. When I first received the mouse and set it up, everything ran smoothly and there were no hardware problems to speak of. The thing that made me not like this mouse that much is the flimsy buttons on the side and the material the mouse is made of. If I held the mouse for too long the grip  would start to feel sweaty, even if my hands were not. The mouse itself is fairly long and I couldnt comfortably position it on my keyboard tray. For palm grip users with plenty of mouse pad space, this may be a fine mouse for you, but it was a bit too clumsy for me to handle comfortably.<br /><br />EDIT (4/2/13): Bumped up my review to 4 stars simply because of the desire for quality assurance displayed by Anker. I received a call after writing this review, in which an Anker representative and I chatted about what could be better for the mouse and its users and how Anker could help improve their product. I feel like this sort of thing goes a long way in the long term satisfaction of purchasing a product and trusting in a company.<br /><br />I also forgot to mention the software in the initial review, which I felt was very quality and displayed a lot of options for the user. The color changing symbol was a nice touch, but it would be better if it affected the whole mouse.
B003ZSI7R2|4.0|Saw these guys open for the Who In Atalantic City...They put on a great set. Although hard to capture their live set this cd is a great buy
079284131X|5.0|Great classic movie for a great deal. Hope to deal with again in the future. Better than the store prices. Thanks.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Good idea for a story, but this author is not a great writer. Overly descriptive details forced me to skip through most of this book--it should be half the length. Great literature it is not.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is great as Sherlock Holmes and Iron man & I've made it my business to purchase both movies!!.  I watch this one repeatedly as if it's the first time each time.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I am not even 50% knowledgeable about English Britain’s History therefore I trust they were accurate. That aside the sets, costumes & overall the acting transported me to 1500's. It was delightful albeit unsettling to realize the conditions overall for people with Kings & Advisors. However, viewing the corruption, agendas of the 1500’s allows me to connect to today & self serving harlots are not new!!! In fact they have refined stealing & self serving to an art form! I do wish the punishments for the corrupt officials today when found out would be what as severe as then! We’d have a lot of heads on the tower & London Bridge!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|One of my all time favorite Disney movies!! I had a copy and it was stolen so I had to replace it immediately and I'm glad I did!!!
0062082353|5.0|This book is a great read it will keep your intrest. It is also a great loss of Chris Kyle.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I saw this in the movies and I knew in the first 10 mins I need to have this at home.  Great movie and I think he is the 2nd best Bond!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is extremely engaging, thoughtful, and well-directed. The acting is credible, and the story fantastic.<br /><br />One becomes really connected with the main character(s), and the religious theme throughout is refreshing and thought-provoking.<br /><br />It is too easy to overrate a film, and so with that said, it remains that &#34;Life of Pi&#34; is certainly at least worth checking out.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I understand that Fun has been around for many years, but this is the first time I have played their music.  I really enjoy the Celtic feel to this CD.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love Rod Stewart so now I can add him to my Christmas listening. It is a very good CD..
B003L77GG0|5.0|Great, must have for anyone that loved the show.  Fun to go back and watch Clark grow up to the Superman is became.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|this was a movie I had seen on tv and finally bought it to watch again.... the loyalty and devotion of an animal is amazing...  loved this movie..
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|Just what I expected! The visual effects are better than the lord of the rings.  some stuff added in the movie but should be a great trilogy.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Push the button, and the shutter releases.  What else could you want?  Simple installation, simple operation, sit simply works as advertised.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.
6304401736|2.0|I was very disappointed in the condition of the case.  It was dirty, cracked with edges peeling, and not user friendly for my grandaughter. The vhs was ok.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Baldacci does it again.  Good story, moves fast, and keeps you intrigued.  I real a lot from this authror.
B0007N1BBC|5.0|If you love Darcy, you will forget him after watching this movie. Great movie. Watched the whole thing in one day and after that , had a hard time not thinking of any thing else for quite a while. It's a great period piece. I love the little camera shots that catch the slightest hint of chemistry between them... Great movie
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the Hunger Games Trilogy, I will not go as far as to say that it is &#34;better&#34; than the &#34;Twilight Saga&#34; but, it's defiantly a good read!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.

B003V5HWWA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Disney Movies and having the opportunity to share it with my kids & nieces and nephews just makes it that much better :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The animation of this game is fantastic!  It has sound that goes right along with the movement of the horse.it's a fun game and it makes you feel like you want to ride that horse.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I've been playing (off & on) for about a year now, and still haven't discovered all of the different combinations! It's great! I love the challenge of it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The entire book collection of the hunger games was exciting and captivating.  Each chapter lead to the next exciting chapter.  The book was a page Turner and I couldn't put the book down.  There are chapters that I thought I'd figure the plot before going to next chapter and it had that twist that threw my theory off track giving me another reason why I liked the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|GREAT game! Not too complicated for my children or nieces and nephews to play! We all love it! Good one for passing the time, and has never crashed on me! :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a wonderful story of loss, struggle and redemption.  I am so happy that Cheryl found herself in the end.  I hiked 9 miles up a mountain today, my longest hike ever at 67 yrs old, and I thought of Cheryl, her strength, her courage and her perseverance the whole way.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This app is okay on my kindle fire (first generation) but I prefer to use mine for  mostly reading etc.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I truly enjoyed this novel. Loved the end; makes one stop and think about life and our beliefs. I could not put this down. I am looking forward to watching the movie.
B0055SWM08|3.0|This one is a bit confusing to me, it started out really fun, but now I'm stuck and the app doesn't offer much in the way of support.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Been a while since i read a good space tale.  I enjoyed it immensely.  It would make a good movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you like to read, I don't see where you could go wrong with this book! I downloaded the preview and before I finished reading it had already ordered the book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A good freshman effort that is worth a free afternoon. the language is immature and the characterizations are slim to none but the plot line is excellent and the science and engineering are intriguing. I couldn't stop reading it despite the flaws.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! I think it gives us a lot to think about too! LOVE THIS BOOK! Before I finished the preview I had already purchased the trilogy of books!
0812982622|4.0|I really liked this book.  It was not something I would have thought I would have liked, but I really enjoyed it. It starts out with the misadventures of a young North Korean boy, Jun Do, whose name is a homonym for John Doe. Jun Do is raised in an orphanage. He is the son of the orphanage master, who treats him really bad, to prove he is not showing favoritism for his son.  He takes his shoes in winter and burns him with a shovel. Jun Do has a hard life.<br /><br />The writing style was a little difficult to get used to, jumping from first person, to third person, and back again, with each new chapter.  The book was divided into two parts. The first part was about Jun do, growing up and the strange jobs he had as an adult, (kidnapping, spying on a fishing boat) up until he ends up going to America, and returning to North Korea, only to be sent to a labor camp.<br /><br />The second half is about Jun Do, impersonating a general, and getting to live with the general wife, his lifetime crush, a north Korean Movie star. Some of this part, seemed a bit farfetched, but was interesting reading.<br /><br />The propaganda and situations in this book, prompted me to look up North Korea, and see how much of it was true.  Sadly, a lot of it was(is). I can't imagine living in a world that the characters of this book inhabit, and am grateful that I was born into this country.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This one is great for little kids (very simple concept they won't get too frustrated with it etc.) but, me being 30 years old I also love it! It's just a fun little game to distract you while sitting at the docs office etc.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The most important events adhered to the book just enough to satisfy me. But I must say I reeled at the bird doody in Radagast's hair, and I cheered for the rabbit sleigh.<br /><br />It was fun to see Gandalf back in action, and although Bilbo was crafted into a Tookish life-saving hero at the end, it supports the fact that a hobbit is made of tougher stuff than most folks think.
B008GFI418|1.0|It's alright.. Not the best, but still cool to see him talk about the good times with The Beatles.. I think it's an okay documentary.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Bought it because I loved  Rolling in the Deep.  Found a few more songs that I loved.  Good listening, recommend.
B0000028M7|5.0|This was always my favorite album of theirs. Had most of their CDs at onetime, but I had my CD case stolen years ago. Finally rebuying my essentials.
B004IFYN2E|4.0|This film was panned by audiences and critics. However, I think completely unfairly!<br /><br />If you like the old films starring Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn etc like I do... then you will very likely love this movie too. I relate it to Charade, To Catch a Thief, How to Steal a Million....and I think it pulls it off excellently! The chemestry between Jolie and Depp is electric and I would happily see them play opposite each other again and again, in the style of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The direction isn't perfect, but in the finale I get goosebumps every time. And that soundtrack is gorgeous!<br /><br />The blu-ray has great picture and sound; and the special features are enough to add to the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />So in conculsion, an underated movie for fans of the classics presented really well on blu-ray!
B005USZML4|4.0|This book was the second in the series and most characters were familar.  It was another book that was hard to put down and kept my intrest to the end.  Look forward to more Theodore Boone stories.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a great book...had a little bit of everything. Sometimes action, mystery, tech, murder...and so on.The whole vision of the story was fantastic. The only criticism is that some of the characters were not given a chance to develop, and I really wanted to get to know some of them. Either we changed narratives or they were dropped from the plot line. Tremendous writing voice...one of the better books I have read in a long time. Thanks.  Although I read the whole thing in three days.
B004UPANGM|2.0|Expecting a decent sequel to Evil Dead 1? Then don't waster your time with Evil Dead 2. Story line is weak and predictable. Bruce Campbell is just plain stupid with occassional flashes of humor. Not worth the time to watch it - even if you've got prime and you aren't paying a cent. NOTE: I enjoyed Evil Dead 1 and would give it 4 stars.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Didn't think much of it, too long, boring, very surprised it was up for any awards, glad I didn't pay theater price for it.
B0027DI05A|5.0|Reread this book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  a great read. It made me want to read more of Betty Smith's writings
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Read all the original books and could not WAIT till it was made into movies.  I was THRILLED when I discovered that it had been made into a SERIES!!!  They ought to do that a LOT more.  Seeing written words actually come to the screen is a real treat.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|A great read for those interested in dog training.  Great stories with lessons you can use in training your dog
B00140PK6O|5.0|If you love good British period pieces..then don't miss this one. It has likeable characters, great story lines so you can't help but get involved in their lives. It's funny, it's sad and it's true to life with it's ups and downs.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This sure makes me feel like I was never given a challenge!  The author gave a lot of insight into the history and politics of Korea.
B00BF124PC|2.0|I think that  Kathryn Bigelow missed the mark on this movie.  I was very excited by this movie because of what it was about and also because of the director.  I really enjoyed &#34;The Hurt Locker&#34;; however, this movie was very slow and didn't focus on what I expected it to focus on at all.  I think it could have been a great action movie; but instead it turned into a really bad documentary.  &#34;Seal Team Six the raid on Osama Bin Laden&#34; is a better movie IMHO.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game is cool dudes. get it. ok? or else you wont gave fun like me. review the game too.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is continuing the hero's of Olympus. And might I sat this book is full of action/adventure, you get to see Annabeth's, Leo's, Piper<br />And of course Percy's side of the story. Hope my review was helpful for people.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game. easy for all ages. its cool to see all the different charecters from the movies. I really like the scrat game.
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I love horror films and this one wasnt bad. the begining was very slow but once the action of the movie started itwas good all the way through tto the end!! i enjoyed it!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was an intriguing story line but lacked a little depth.  This may sound silly but the mouths did match up to the words.  It kind of made the characters look little creepy, but it was fun, nonetheless.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages, it is so sweet and funny. My kids have probably seen it 30 times now and they always pick it for movie night!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a great book about Chris Kyle's life. I think if you like military stuff you will really enjoy his story. The only sad thing is that as you read this great story, you know that Chris is no longer with the world.still, this is really worth reading
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is very entertaining and interesting to read. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The photos are beautiful too. I highly recommend.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|This is the strangest book! For some time you are not sure who is speaking. For instance, the word &#34; he&#34; is used twice in two sentences yet refers to two different people. How much of this depiction of the culture of North Korea is true remains a question. Allegory, dream, fantasy, truth? Impossible to tell. I could never really sympathize with any of the characters.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I've been waiting for what felt like forever for JT to Bless us with a new album and the wait was well worth it! He's on his grown n sexy with this new album. He's not trying go cookie cutter pop so some might not be used to this more mature sound. He's said in the past that he would make another album when he had something to sing about and now that he'S married and absolutely in love with JB he's got more than enough material. It's clear this album is for her. Thanks JB for being his muse n inspiration.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of the first mysteries I've read in ages. I usually read non-fiction, but I'm so glad I picked up fiction again with this one.    Though it had a bit of a slow start, suddenly, BOOM. I couldn't stop reading it. This twisted love story kept me on my toes and was a really fun read by an obviously solid writer. Simply put, I didn't want to put it down and I'm not sure I've ever finished a book as quickly as this one.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|a good variation on the coin slide game, very creative graphics, the grid is a little small for old eyes
B0033TJATW|5.0|My kids love this movie they watch it at least once a day. The quality is excellent. The timing of arrival was accurate.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is definitely eye-opening as to what we do to our bodies with food!  Love it!! Highly recommend it to anyone concerned about their health.
B00005JKG9|1.0|A bunch of business guys using selling strategies that are deceitful spend their days competing with each other, swearing at each other, and when it is all over, I ask myself--why did I watch such a mean-spirited mess of writhing egos? An hour and half wasted.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was a bit confusing at first. But when you realize<br /> what is happening it is hard to put down.
1932907009|3.0|This book has been the most widely recommended book by Hollywood agents and script readers and apparently if you're not familiar with it, its terms and strategies for building a pitchable script, you will have short conversations with the gate keepers. It is a very useful how-to with plenty of good advice for the novice script writer by a man (since deceased) who had great success in the arena of family comedies. His &#34;beat system&#34; is fundamentally sound but awfully formulaic and other screenwriting books cover much of the same territory without the self-aggrandizing. Yes, you need to read this book, but it is not a bible.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Having a failed marriage on my record and finding myself back looking for love, I stumbled upon this book. Each chapter, maybe even paragraph...turned on a light for me. I began to see more clearly 1 that there are many couples who explained my feeling exactly and 2. Exactly what I did wrong in trying to make my marriage work.  We were both so clearly speaking the wrong love language. And even though we kind of knew that, we didn't quite know how to speak the others language or may the commitment to learn to speak the others language. I will be reading the book for children next. I think this is invaluable information to learn and teach our children!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Christian Grey....hmmm who doesn't want a man like that. Him and Anastasia have a beautiful relationship that makes you long for one yourself. Sigh.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This book contains an argument and an explanation.  The argument is that violence has declined and we are living in an unprecedented era of peace.  Pinker then provides an explanation for the decline in violence that relies on factors as diverse as effective governance, market rationality, education, and conditions favorable to self-control.  Though a cognitive scientist by training, Pinker shows a remarkable facility with data from history, philosophy, mathematics, and economics as well as psychology.<br /><br />The book is meticulously argued, is a very entertaining read, and its conclusions are extremely important.  No trend is irreversible, so if we wish to continue living in a less violent world, then we ought to pay attention to solid accounts of what actually works to diminish violence.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I spend a lot of time travelling, sitting in airports and this game is great for passing the time and giving your brain a healthy workout!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great book, interesting twists and turns.  unexpected happenings throughout the book.  Well written by an author I have never heard of.  Look forward to next book
B003TTCURU|5.0|Loved being able to watch this Grey's Anatomy Season whenever I had some free time. I'll be ordering the next season shortly. Love it!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you like 1890s Britain you'll love this study of people in two nearby villages. The acting is good and the characters are enjoyable. Stories connect from episode to episode through the same village characters but it all stays fresh. We have watched two seasons and can't wait to start the third.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Very easy to navigate. Can keep in touch with my friends wherever I am. Very handy for someone who travels a lot.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Loved the way Blake put things into neat categories.  I also found his beat sheet to be an effective tool to organize my scenes.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This was one of the recommended amazon apps, it's very handy and easy to navigate. I've found it very useful.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is so funny, real and just fun to read.  I was sad this book came to an end.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Just hard to not want to keep watching once we started the season. Each story leaves you hanging! Just love it!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Superbe, satisfaction totale. C'est grandiose, émouvant, esthétique. On sent que la conception est la même que pour Riverdance. Je conseille cette lecture aux amoureux de la culture celtique et spécialement gaëlique, plus généralement aux amateurs de jolies voix de sopranos légères, de violoniste talentueuse (agilité et sonorité) et d'orchestrations absolument prodigieuses
B001R60ESE|5.0|It's an amazing concert captured on blu-ray.  Chris is quite the showman and the guests were great.  Don't miss it.

B004EBZX6W|4.0|It does what it promises. You get a nice picture of what your wifi surrounding looks like with this app. You can check levels, channels, adjust sampling cycles to name a few of the good things in this app.
B0013GUKDC|1.0|First of all, I thought this was supposed to be a normal book.  It was not. It looks as though the person selling it, just photocopied the real book and put it together like a notebook!  I was going to send it back, but it  would probably cost more than the book did to send it back.  My daughter was disappointed.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|I bought this because I'm a big Jim Carrey fan but after watching it I hesitate to call it a Jim Carrey movie. His flair is missing from this character and the animation masks a lot of his expression.<br /><br />Jim Carrey fans may want this for their collection but I'd advise against it. I'm looking to sell mine.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy and recommend a book about the extreme challenges facing a quadriplegic, but this book was so engrossing, despite the dire circumstances of this character - actually, there was quite a bit of suffering and angst going on with everyone, however, Jojo Moyes did a great job finding the humanity in each of her characters.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|has a different feeling to this album, than their original album, but its good in its own right. Sounds great on vinyl too
B00AHHODH2|4.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club book is a great fun read.  The story and characters are just waiting for a script writer to submit to a Made for TV movie. Lots of fun and intrigue, too.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I like this film a lot. It has all the magic, and wonder of the original peter jackson films, but with a unique feel.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|To me, this is the best of the three books. Spicy and sweet!! I like that he is open and doesn't play games with Anna. He is quite a man.
B007IK44CK|4.0|its ok not as good as the first one tho.  i like when he runs down the side of the building.  Man giving reviews on amazon sucks
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Really enjoyed this one. Nice challenge,keeps the mind working. Nice graphic effecs alsoThis is the best G5 game so far.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|There was only one other show that I couldn't stop watching, literally. That was Dexter. This show pulls you in and makes you part of the family. You're right there with them through the whole thing. Real shame it only made one season.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This show brought back so many memories of great tunes. Very talented cast. Some of the jokes were inappropriate. But all in all a great movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow...seventy-six glorious stars for this amazing read!<br /><br />Judging this book by its cover:<br />I love the cover of this book. It may be simple, but I think it's very alluring.<br /><br />Plot/Execution:<br />The plot of this book was amazing. From the beginning of the story, there is this air of mystery that is so subtle that it makes you wonder if it's really even there or if you are imagining it. The pacing is absolutely perfect; I felt like the timeline of events was spot on. There were so many things in this story that were so simple, yet intricate parts of the plot, and I felt like they were all resolved by the end of the book. I don't want to say too much, because I would absolutely hate to ruin this story for anyone, but this story was an emotional roller coaster. There were so many twists; to be honest, I thought I had this story pegged from the beginning, but nothing I thought was going to happen happened.<br /><br />Characters:<br />I loved both of the main characters in this story; they were so layered. There were so many things that made them the way they were, and the author really took the time to flesh those things out. The secondary characters were fun to read about, too. I thought Six and Breckin were scene stealers.<br /><br />There were so many facets to Holder's personality, and I loved reading about all of them and how they came to be. There really was an explanation for every action/reaction we got from him. I didn't think there was anything inconsistent about his character.<br /><br />I really liked Sky, too. She was a balanced character, which is a refreshing change from the passive characters that seem to litter books these days. I liked how though she may not have liked what was going on, she was always honest about her feelings and never tried to hide herself from Holder.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the nature of their relationship. <spoiler>Their past was so interesting and such an amazing twist. You knew they were connected from their pasts, you just weren't sure how. I love that he was still carrying what had happened to 'Hope' with him. I also thought the blame he placed on himself was realistic after what had happened with Hope and then with his sister. I loved the angst that was Holder.</spoiler><br /><br />I love the way everything came together at the end. I can't say enough good things about this book. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a beautiful love story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another action packed book from Collins. Second half of the book moves quickly keeping you glued to each page! Katniss's stubborn but devoted nature makes the reader yearn for more.
B00AY1NY30|5.0|As was the case with Pt. 1, all NON-Japanese fans get the shaft, yet again.<br /><br />Pt.1 (JP Edition) contained the exclusive bonus track, \\"Gallows Humor\\"... A \\"Demo\\"; but still pretty good.<br /><br />Pt.2 (JP Edition) contains the exclusive bonus track, \\"Shine\\"... Another \\"Demo\\"; but will likely be good also... as there were no doubt many tracks to choose from which didn't ultimately work for the 'concept'; &/or didn't make the 'quality' cut, so to speak... as we've all seen from past S.S. releases.<br /><br />WHY RoadRunner?  WHY Stone Sour?  WHY have you screwed us TWICE now?<br />No \\"Demo\\" or \\"Bonus Track\\" is worth $45 (after shipping & tax is included, minus $9.99 for the standard album), yet that is what we must pay in order to get this exclusive bonus track.<br /><br />I've loved each of Stone Sour's albums... Own the Deluxe/Special Editions... all which came with 3 to 5 bonus tracks (or more), and a DVD w/ videos, live stuff, &/or behind-the-scenes stuff... and THOSE cost less than $20!<br /><br />You're quite literally forcing loyal, law-abiding music fans who BUY your music, to break the law, and download these types of \\"exclusives\\" illegally.  How much money are you costing YOURSELVES with this idiocy!?? __ It's one thing to include those tracks as \\"pre-order\\" digital bonuses, and so on... It's not like you haven't done it before (\\"Saturday Morning\\" = iTunes pre-order bonus track from Audio Secrecy)...<br />So, again, WHY KEEP SCREWING US!?<br /><br />LOL, and your \\"industry\\" wonders why sales are so miserable!?  Uh, aside from the \\"greed\\" factor (people wanting it for free = greed)... it's crap like this, that make people say, \\"Hell, why pay and download it now... I'll just wait a week, and download the ENTIRE album, w/ bonus track(s), for free!\\"<br /><br />GET A CLUE!!<br /><br />As for the album itself -- It kicks butt, of course... So buy it... Or snipe it... I don't care enough to advocate one or the other at this point.
1476733953|5.0|Read the dang book already, its MORE than what you are hoping for.  Hugh will not waste your time or money and will leave you a fan of his for life, unless he pulls some danielewski bs..
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I liked most of the recent bond films (and the older bond films too), but Skyfall has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. Not just one of the worst bond movies, one of the worst movies EVER made. Yes, movies like this need to push the boundaries of what is \\"realistic\\" every few minutes to keep the attention of modern audiences, but Skyfall goes over the top, over and over again and my suspension of disbelief can only take so much abuse.
B000063DI9|5.0|This album really pointed out for me how tight this band really was(is)! Tight arrangements and complex melody/harmony played out in voices and guitars. I hadn't listened to these guys since 1984, and I find this... woww! I got their latest as well. Pure gold if you really care about heavy, tight unison riffs played out against powerful, driving,kick-ass single kick drum riffs from Nicko.<br />You like Iron Maiden? You shoulld REALLY like this, maybe even love it... I was here from the start, and I'm totally satisfied by this album.This is REAL IM, done well by the dudes who started it all. Excellent sound quality, welll produced and a real gem. Sure glad I got this one; you will be, too...
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Musician, classical music lover, lover of well-done non-fiction books and recordings and those who seek a true understanding of WW II's toll on humanity: for these people, this is a must.  A profound, true story of the survival of a Polish pianist in Warsaw, who experienced the extermination of his entire family, but survived and hid in the ruins of Warsaw to the end of the war.  Helped in the end by a compassionate German officer who discovered him and heard him play, the pianist survived and lived to play on the stage again.  There is an authenticating addendum of details surrounding the making of this movie, made while the pianist still lived.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Another great season and the Blu-ray edition provides great video and sound. I would highly recommend giving this a look.
0810970686|5.0|The Diary series was a Christmas gift to my twin great nephews (now age 10).  They were wild about them.  Their mother, a teacher, says they contributed significantly to their reading progress in school.  They became popular in their classroom and this volume was loaned to a classmate who didn't return it.  I was happy I could replace it without having to purchase the whole collection again.  This should always be on your childrens' bookshelves.
B008RTE08E|5.0|I've been waiting to see this movie remastered since 1985 when I first saw it on USA cable network.  I realize the Beatles never archived an original negative at the time, so it had to have been mastered from a 2nd generation negative, but watching this version you can't really tell the difference except in a couple spots.  The sound quality is excellent, the picture very good, and it has several bonus features that were interesting (although it helps to be a fan to appreciate them).  I'd love to see a featurette about how they restored it, to me stuff like that is fascinating.  Now if we can just get Let It Be released...!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun Little Game to pass the free time.  It reminds me of being a kid playing this kind of game with tokens at the arcade.  Only this time I am not bugging the heck out of my mom for more nickels.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game but its very addictive. I like the different options for playing...that its not just one type of game with levels that once u beat you're done with the game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think these games are fun and mindless for when you want to enjoy yourself without getting frustrated. Another plus...my four year old son also can play the games and be entertained.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|so realistic. i thuoght i was seeing real people. The storyline was very good. I want all my friends to see this movie.
B007HOOAH6|2.0|This book is cute and presents the concept of going potty in a very simple way. I just don't think was long enough to warrant spending 3.99. Maybe I'm just cheap though.
B0035S996U|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over. It has a lot of action even from the beginning. Scary Good.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is the first game to keep me engaged for several months. others just get boring because it's just the same old story again and again. but this game is more dynamic, with new quests to complete and places to explore every so often. this is a social game. your friends are your lifeline, so make many friends.<br /><br />the developers still have to work out some bugs. once, I wasn't able to visit certain friends else the game would force close. a few weeks ago, I got listed as &quot;asleep,&quot; even tho I was active daily, and was thus cut off from my friends, so I started over. the only good thing that came from that is I was able to keep my friends.<br /><br />buyer beware. awesome game, irritating bugs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS SO AWSOME BUT THEY SHOULD ADD ENDERMAN ENDERPEARLS SUN MOON REDSTONE AND SWITCHES REDSTONE LAMPS AND A BUTTON AND SWITCHES
030758836X|2.0|Maybe it was all of the hype or maybe to predictable for me...but I wasn't \\"wowed\\" by this book.  I read it through but still question why it remains a best seller...so many better stories out there!
B00AFYZDL2|4.0|Couldn't wait for this cd to hit the shelves and finally got my copy. I was hoping for something in the line of Killing Ground, or Lionheart, but this cd comes closer to they're cd Metalhead, which is not bad. Its not as melodic as I wanted it to be, but the music is good, hard and heavy and Saxon just don't led up, I think they're going to be around forever, and thats a good thing. The standout tracks to me are Guardians of the Tomb, Sacrifice, Walking the Steel, Wheels of Terror, Made in Belfast. Enough good music on this one. If you like Saxon you won't be disappointed with this purchase. Another good effort from a band that knows how to play heavy metal.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This was a cute little movie with quite a few memorable scenes. I was concerned about renting the movie because of other reviews but I'm glad we rented it for date night because it had us both laughing and talking. Give it a try.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|These guys keep going, and going and going. We like showing concert videos during get together s at the house. Added this to my collection! Another good choice!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie had a great message and was delivered in a fun way that would appeal to all ages. I would recommend it without hesitation.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It gets better every time I watch it and pick up new bits.<br /><br />At first, I had my doubts about the additions to the story, but it makes a more complete tale overall.<br />Without some of the filler, viewers would probably be left with a lot of questions.<br /><br />Just a movie of some dwarves, a hobbit and a wizard wandering around various forests and caverns would<br />have been pretty boring.<br /><br />I can't wait for parts 2 and 3.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Another album with more straightforward rock style, and a little resurgence of go go.  After 20+ years, still pro-rockin on.  weathermakermusic.com  [...]
0596007124|5.0|This book is well written and although it is very long it is also very easy to read.  This book is must for any developer wanting to know more than just the basic elements of object oriented design.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is addicting! Morbid and well done! I love it! Especially the looks I get when I say I've wiped out humanity! Money well spent!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|One of the reasons I purchased this book was because of a review stating it reminded the reviewer of the \\"best of Rowling, Martin, Riordan, Paolini, AND Tolkien\\" - extremely high praise indeed.  I had hoped for something at least on the order of Paolini (a young gifted writer) - and at the very least Teen Fiction.  Not Quite a comparison...<br /><br />I would place this book into a preteen category - like 8-10 year olds.  The main character Thor is introduced and fairly well thought out - believable. The different situations that occur are poorly engineered, on a time-table that is so totally unrealistic that I laughed at the ridiculousness of it. The whole book seems to cover only a week or so of time in the story.<br /><br />If Morgan Rice is a child with limited experience, this is a good book.  If the book is intended for 8-10 year olds - who watch TV and everything happens NOW - it's an ok book.<br /><br />If you are looking for something akin to teen fiction to satisfy your reading hunger - even near the same level as Paolini, Rowling, or Riordan PLEASE look elsewhere. Did I mention Tolkien or Martin?? No comparison at all.
1400049628|5.0|Bought this and read it during a combat deployment overseas. Was a great read, lots of useful information that actually made sense.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Amazon makes things so easy to find and they are so reasonably priced.  I listen to this CD a lot and I love it!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Maybe the writers had a deadline, but I don't generally think this is the same quality as the other Daniel Craig Bond films.  Just lots of logical gaps and 'why did they do that' moments
B00AA0U046|5.0|I have been a Hendrix fan for years, but this is by far the BEST thing since &#34;Band of Gypsy's&#34; or &#34;Blues&#34;! A must have if you are a fan of any music!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The movie itself has good production values, but the fact that it is a true story makes it just amazing
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Favorite game. I love this game I spend a lot of my time playing this. the graphics look great. the sounds are pretty cool to.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read the reviews before buying it and had low expectations (but needed something to read on the plane).  So I was pleasantly surprised.  It is definitely a 'still part of the journey' book, not a 'destination' book, so people looking for a series wrap-up will be disappointed.  I keeps to his style of multiple threads and details and the occasional main character beheading.  I do think Mr. Martin has set all the (remaining) players well on the stage at this point, so I would hope the next installment starts to wrap things up.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|One of the best albums I've heard in a really long time. Went to their concert, enjoyed all the songs and had to buy it.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Mr. Martin has a particular style (multiple threads, details and gratuitous sudden deaths of 'main' characters), but the series is rich and does what successful series have to do, that is create a unique but recognizable Universe to operate in.  Definitely an adult series (do not give this to your child/teen to read).
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Thanks! This was a real life proof! I had purchased a fake one on another site. Was very disappointed. Now, happy.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson has taken his abilities as a biographer and applied them to a very modern subject, Steve Jobs.  I've been reading this on the train, and have been amazed to find myself having to hustle to get up as the time flew so fast.  I was not surprised at Steve Jobs briliance, but a bit surprised by his unwashed feet.  Isaacson applies his research skill and gives us insights into Steve Jobs as well as his relationships with others in the computing world.  A fun read, not necessarily a must read.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I enjoyed watching this ever so much!!  Revisiting some of the older games of my memories while watching the characters interact was a great deal of fun.  It is a fantastic story line that is perfect for all ages!!
1608870081|4.0|The book was in fine condition with only two little glitches- two really small tears around the \\"Maps\\" slits inside the front cover and the other was only a melted hole in the plastic bag cover which won't affect it's value.  Lea Wagner
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|It's a fun, fun,fun soundtrack, get up and dance, sing your heart out kind of track to a fabulous movie!
0765325950|4.0|This book isn't how Robert Jordan would have written the end. But I don't care, I like it anyways, and it was still a strong ending.<br /><br />It was basically one giant battle, from beginning (actually the end of the last book) to the end. This isn't so much a bad thing, it just tires you out quickly. Plan to take breaks. If you read it non-stop, things tend to just run together, and you'll miss details. Most of the plot lines from previous books are already resolved, so it's a very straight-forward story, but there are still little things that show Brandon Sanderson was taking this last installment very seriously.<br /><br />For the final battle between Rand Al'Thor and the Dark One, there's a suspicious lack of Rand Al'Thor and the Dark One actually fighting. Forces of the Light and forces of the Shadow do plenty of fighting, just not so much those two particular characters.<br /><br />20 years later, the series has come to it's grand conclusion, and I can say it was worth the wait. Now if only Game of Thrones would hurry up and finish as well, before we have to rope Brandon Sanderson into finishing THAT.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves this game. One of our church members was playing the game and highly recommended it to us. He is 5. Great kids game.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|Let me get this part out of the way: I AM the biggest Terminator fan that I know. I've watched this film countless times since I was child. I know it like the back of my hand.<br /><br />The video quality is wonderful. The best presentation I've seen of the film, and I've owned it on literally every format. Crisp, clear, with just enough of the grain still present.<br /><br />Sound- This can either make or break it for some. I was disappointed at the first release of this film on Blu since it only included the &#34;remastered audio&#34;. For those unfamiliar, what they did was give the movie a surround mix (which is great), but inserted different sound effects for a couple of the gunshots and a few, other small things. Now, to most people, this may not be an issue. But to people like me who grew up with this film, it's just weird and threw me off. Unfortunately, this version only comes with that sound mix. No original soundtrack present :(<br /><br />Extras- Meh. Same as the special edition, which werent that great to begin with. This film deserves much more.<br /><br />Anyways, this is the best way (in my opinion) to watch this flick. Just dont throw away your special edition DVD version so that you can have the option to watch with the original mono soundtrack :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a wonderful game .My brother always looks at this game when I play it .It helps children focus on what the game asks what to do .Also the game helps to remember tasks in life.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This DVD arrived quickly and real good condition.  The movie is funny, fast moving and tells why the Tommy Lee Jones character is so stoic

B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book! I love it, because it is a pageturner that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has mystery  and adventure with some humor. I highly recommend it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I was not disappointed! I can't wait for Mark of Athena and the house of Hades. Rick riordan can't disappoint!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read many Nicholas Sparks books and I have loved them all. This one in particular gives readers both love and strategic feelings towards the characters and the ending has an interesting, unique twist. I decided to read the book before the movie and so now all I have to do is watch the movie. Overall, I recommend this, it was another amazing Nicholas Sparks book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|downloaded for my 6 yo. . . hes lucky if I give it up..lol. gotta download this game. no disappointments here. and doubt many from you either.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I loved the Holy Bible, but I had to returned this book due to the fact that I ordered the Book on my Kindle.  I am currently using the Holy Bible on my Kindle.  Thanks .
B007Y36K46|5.0|First I rented this movie then I bought it to watch it a second time (and probably more). This movie is what adventure sci-fi should be but all too often fails to be. Too many sci-fi movies have cranked up the gore and correspondingly lowered the storyline and intellect to minuscule amounts. Adventure sci-fi is about science and thinking and wonder as much as it is about adventure. This movie should be thought of as an excellent blend of Dune and Star Wars. Mix some sci-fi adventure with romance, and then carefully blend in an intriguing measure of mysticism to create a drink well worth sipping more than once.  Enjoy! My only regret is that since this movie was not a box office smash the sequels based on the books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs may not get made.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|as a child i always love playing this game anyone will enjoy playing it to when i now start to  play the game i couldn't remember how to play it but i am getting there .
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Like the mighty Mississippi that winds its way south, the torrent that is Depeche Mode has snaked a course through over three decades of twist and turns. And like the alluvial deposits that slowly remove a river's impetus, the last twelve years it seems the boys from Basildon have encountered their share of sediments, as at times they've seemed mired in a quagmire of aimlessness. The Mark Bell/Ben Hillier experiments have not been totally buoyant so perhaps nothing much was expected of the boys on this go round. But it seems the trio have been up to something in the swamps south of New Orleans, where it's all too easy to sink without proper propulsion. For that you need a smooth machine, and in this case Depeche Mode's  \\"Delta Machine\\" provides more than mere flotation. The blues-inspired electro-synth segue pushes their sound forward in a manner that finally seems to shake loose the deposits that have shackled them since the heady days of Ultra and Song's of Faith and Devotion. Less plodding than Playing the Angel and more emotional than Sounds of the Universe, Depeche Mode create an atmospheric amalgamation of past and present that return them once again to relevance.<br /><br />With a penchant for potentiometers that would make even James Holden proud, the band punctuates nearly every track with prodigious panoplies of reverb, echo and oscillation in an effort to remind the world why they've been the best at what they do for so long. An inspired vocal performance from Gahan gives the album a vitality that has been missing for nearly a decade. His work with the Soulsavers has certainly paid off as he effortlessly morphs through the falsetto-fueled \\"Should be Higher\\", pristinely rendered ballads like \\"Broken\\" and breathless, hysterical segues like \\"Angel\\". Even Gore has upped his game on this outing and together they both sound extremely invested in their material.<br /><br />Always experimental, \\"My Little Universe\\", though it seems slightly out of place, nevertheless shows the band continuing to push the barriers of their own sonic signature. While this might perturb a segment of their behemoth following, they retain enough of their roots to pull off the bluesy themes that are explored throughout the album. The murk and mysteriousness of \\"Slow\\" gives way to the majestically paced \\"Goodbye\\", with a rousing, industrialized chorus leading the way. Finally, Depeche Mode has always been partial to delivering beautiful darkness and they do so superbly with \\"Alone\\", calling to mind the heady days of Black Celebration.<br /><br />The deluxe edition holds some surprises as well with \\"All That's Mine\\", which harkens back to \\"Music for the Masses\\" and \\"Always\\", a proggy and expansive little number essayed by Gore. Both of these could easily have been included on the album.<br /><br />While this offering from the boys won't quite top my personal top three of Celebration, Violator and SOFAD, it does represent another high-water mark in their career and they built the right machine at the right time to ride the crest. If it really does turn out to be \\"goodbye\\" then I can think of no better way for them to enjoy the silence.

B00BF123WG|4.0|This movie was an excellent film that depicted actual events. I find it odd that Hollywood is squeamish with enhanced interrogation techniques unless they can depict them in a movie and make money as a result.<br /><br />Overall excellent movie.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot. It's easy to build up money, but diamonds are harder to come by, and these are the better purchasing tools in the game.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a must read with great story line.  I definitely would read this again. i fell in love with the characters.
1439127700|5.0|This is truly a great read.  The relationships between the former presidents is really fascinating, and really gives a perspective on the ex-presidents that are not usually reflected in their bios.  Very easy to read, it flows well, very well written.  My new favorite book!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story will take you through several emotions as you grow to live these characters. Loved it and would recommend it, great read!
B00004STPT|5.0|This is one of my favorite soundtrack albums, beautifully composed and rendered, and is perhaps the main reason why I enjoyed the movie so much (without quite realizing it during the first viewing). I especially enjoy the track, \\"The Might of Rome\\".
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just got done reading all three books, and I couldn't put them down. I love the writing style and the way that two worlds collide together was great. The love between Ana and Christian is fantastic.
B0006399FS|3.0|This album never really \\"grabbed\\" me like earlier U2 albums. Although the tunes are unmistakable, there's no single breakout song here that really stands out. The album as a whole is good listening for a while but not a classic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very entertaining. A great way to spend idle time. The lower levels are easy for even many little kids. Enjoyable.
B004VDL826|5.0|This movie was released shortly after the end of 2nd Gig (the 2nd season) of Stand Alone Complex. The music is beautiful, the artwork is beautiful, and Batou drives a 2005 Ford GT!! What can I say,  I'm a huge GITS fan and a huge Ford fan so these two together are the bomb! But anyway, from a non-fan point of view, this film will be hard to understand if you have not already seen the TV show, so recommend watching that first. There are basically spoilers in this film for the TV series so watch them in that order for best results. (in other words, this is not a very good stand alone movie).
B003MYYJD0|5.0|The online pictures of this watch DO NOT do this watch any justice.  I bought this watch to add to my Invicta collection and it is hard to choose with the many unique styles from the brand.  The watch is stunning, appearing to cost way more than the reasonable price.  The color combination and high polish of the gold is amazing.  The watch does have a heavy feel to it but not overbearing enough to be uncomfortable.  The weight actually adds to the perception of a solidly built timepiece.  Have not had it long enough to attest to performance, but none of my other Invictas (5) have given me any reason to question this one will not perform.  I would definitely recommend to all who are deciding on this Pro Diver (great casual or dress watch) or any from the Invicta lineup.
B00005QZWI|4.0|The music for Fellowship of the Ring is at times haunting, but overall just a beautifully rendered composition that I have enjoyed for nearly 10 years. A must-have for anyone who enjoys fantasy soundtracks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finding this episode was easy. We are fans and we loved the episode. We bought it because we could not find it on TV
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack album from the first season, very enjoyable! The only downside is that the music is not durable, in that I did not keep listening to it long term, i.e. over a year. It was novel but due to the edginess of the composition, it was not a long term favorite.
B001NI24OI|5.0|There was only one sex scene in the entire movie. Personally could have done without it. Great family movie altogether.

B008R5OKI8|5.0|This disc is the latest, well recorded in 2012, in the Vivaldi edition produced by Naive. The intention is to record all the Vivaldi scores held in the Turin Library. These constitute Vivaldi's private collection and include some 15 operas, several hundred concertos and a considerable amount of vocal music amounting to about 450 works. Many of these are currently unknown to the general public.<br /><br />The final collection is likely to number about 100 discs and is due to be completed in 2015. Another feature of the collection is the concentration on a very wide range of performers and ensembles with very little repetition of personnel. In this regard, the standard maintained has so far been astonishingly high and the sheer quantity of musicians involved at that level has also been astonishing.<br /><br />This disc is a good example, as the ensemble was established as recently as 2012 and the soloist, although fast rising in reputation as a baroque violinist of great skill, is still relatively young. The theme of the disc, the fifth in the series of violin concertos, is focussed on seven works associated with Pisendel, a violinist of international renown based in Dresden and friendly with Vivaldi.<br /><br />These are works designed to demonstrate Pisendel's virtuosity. Their extreme difficulty is overcome with apparent ease by Sinkovsky, a virtuoso violinist trained in Moscow. Sinkovsky's virtuosity fortunately allows him to explore the musical interests of these concertos in such a way that retains the listeners' interest. The seven concertos are all in the customary 3 movement form but with more opportunity than usual for cadenza display. This is consistent with the intention of the compositions but stops short of vacuous digital display. The accompaniment is both vibrant and lively in the modern manner with accenting and dynamics playing a key role. In this way the idea of meaningful dialogue is maintained.<br /><br />I would suggest that this disc is deserving of serious consideration by anyone collecting this engrossing series. Some of the earlier violin concerto discs may be more suitable as an 'only' purchase but the real value in this disc is to take its part in the overall scheme of things. Being able to afford the whole collection is another matter!yone collecting this engrossing series.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|like that you are able to compete with others and build levels. Having extra lives allows additional chances once higher levels are achieved unlike other games where the game is simply over once the ability to keep up is lost.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a great puzzle game with clear rules and a very clever and creative premise. I couldn't put it down. I recommend it highly.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it will keep me entertained when my mom is doing work. my favorite part is to eat the people!  what is your favorite part?
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing. The graphics are well put together and for all those iffy parents out there you can turn off the Gore. I thought this game was great when I got it and that was just when I was playing campaign. I decided to check out the multiplayer mode. It was phenomenal. The only two flaws that I have noticed are that the game trends to freeze up while in multiplayer mode and that the guns in multiplayer mode as are hard to buy and acquire. Overall very good game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|2nd time I've read it and I still love it! Better than \\"Harry Potter\\" is what say. Lol  ;) peace.

B00338QENI|5.0|As a scientist, it was a delight to read as I have worked on the line of cells. As a person, it is a novel read and you will not want to put it down. You will want to fight for Henrietta Lacks and her family while you flip through the pages.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|It does exactly what its supposed to do, but I play most of my games while lying in bed, so a game based on gyroscope movement always loses a star because I just won't play it. Other than that, its polished and well built. No complaints on that end.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Words cannot express how creative this CD is.  It takes you on a non-stop journey, from slow ballads to the best club beats.<br /><br />There is perhaps no better segue anywhere than when \\"Forbidden Love\\" slides into \\"Jump.\\"  I think I may have listened to that segue-way at least 1,000 times.  The mixer of this masterpiece is a genius.<br /><br />If you had to have just one Madonna album in your collection, this is it. People think of her as an 80s or even 90s artists. However, her best work has come in the 00's.  Like a fine wine, she has matured and improved with each album.<br /><br />It is 2013, 8 years after the release of this masterpiece and I still listen to it regularly.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun twist on my favorite, most addictive game. I'm never going to get anything done! Doesn't expand quite like the other versions, but it serves its purpose and is well executed.
0399215980|3.0|If you are buying this book as a read aloud..... It fits in the palm of your hand. I should have looked at the dimensions.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|Why? What do they have in common with Cold Play? We buy CD's because we like the song we heard on the radio, and sometimes when you get the album you realize the radio play song was the only good song on the entire disk. However, with Mumford and Sons, as with Cold Play, every song sounds exactly the same, so you can't be disappointed unless you were hoping that they were going to give you some grand brilliant departure from the norm. So no worries. If you like the clanging guitar and the droning vocals, you will get a whole CD of exactly that!

B009U9S6FI|5.0|This a very well written book on one life's most important subjects. Well worth the time to read and re-read this book.
0547884591|5.0|Quick version:  I highly recommend this book.  If you're looking for an instructional book on how to cook, look no further.<br /><br />Being a self-proclaimed terrible cook but good at following directions means I am good at the recipes I've learned, but not good at the techniques of cooking.  After reading the pages in the &#34;Look Inside&#34; section, I knew this book was what I needed.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef's cooking instructions start you from the beginning assuming no previous knowledge.  The recipes start out wordy, explaining what to do and why, and, as you progress, they become less so, relying on your previous knowledge in the book.  Also, Ferris has organized the recipes in such a way that gives you, the novice cook, the largest margin of error while still getting something tasty.  I feel like I'm getting better as I progress through the book.<br /><br />Of course, this book covers much more than how to cook, as conveyed by the entire title.  His meta-learning method is really interesting and inspiring, such that I'm applying to other subjects.<br /><br />If I had a complaint, and bear in mind this is petty, he's got so many nifty tidbits scattered all around that I'd love to reference but bookmarking nearly every other page just gets silly.<br /><br />I've recommended this book to friends and family already, so it seems only fair to recommend it to people shopping for it the way that I did.
0802473156|4.0|This a  very helpful book if you're trying to figure out exactly what makes your significant other really happy.  It also gave me a chance to figure out what I like.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|The acting is superb.  The story quite interesting.  Read anything about Hitch, and they're always talking about his interplay and fantasies with his leading ladies.  Most likely quite true, but how about the fact that he kept tasteful morality alive in making suspense movies, and never caved to gore and cheap tricks.  And most importantly, he remained married until death.<br />Every couple has things they navigate, and it seems like the professional team did it nicely and honored each other.<br />Kudos to his creative couple!!  and thanks for dozens of the most innovative, high quality, creative movies every made.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally a big-button calculator that is simple to use but also has the more complex functions if you need them. I also appreciate that it did not have a crazy list of permissions or intrusive ads. I didn't expect to use a calculator very much on my Kindle Fire...but this one is so neat that I use it all the time.
B0057MFA42|1.0|This disc is simply not right. I waited to purchase this because of all the bad reviews in regards to sync issues with the audio / video. The disc still does not sync properly. Other reviewers stating that the sync issues have been corrected either don't know what they are looking at or received a different version then I.<br /><br />This is either a terrible production or the audio and video are from different shows.  If the audio is from a different show then that needs to be disclosed. This product is unacceptable.<br /><br />For what its worth, it is not my player. I have a brand new top of the line Sony Blu Ray player and every disc I have watched has played perfectly.<br /><br />Had to sell this one for pennies on the dollar at the local second hand shop. Do yourself a favor and save the time and money.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I decided to give this vendor 1 star.  If I could give it none I would.  On 2/25/13 I submitted my request to purchase this movie.  My children and I had viewed it at the theatres and loved it.  At the time I subitted mt request the fees were automatically deducted from my bank account as expected.  However, afetr several attempts (days later) to track this DVD movie I was unable to do so.  I sent in a not to the seller informing them I was unable to track the movie at since I usually receive my movies within a week I was concerned on whether or not it was lost.  The seller responded within a couple of days that he would track it for me and get back with me.  On 3/19/13 (the deadline for when the movie should arrive) I still had not received the movie so I contacted the seller again this time I received no response as of today 3/29/13, nor did I receive a refund.  So I paid for a movie I never received.  This experience has truly been a bitter one.  I will never trust nor purchase anything from this seller again.  Since this I went on to purchase the movie at a store when I know I will get what I pay for.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Truly Dissatisfied Customer

0871164566|5.0|This book is very creative and has really beautiful pendants that are an alternative to the traditional wire wrapped pendants. The techniques taught in this book will be very helpful to the person who has a design in mind but can't seem to find it for sale anywhere.  This book inspires you to create your own design and gives the techniques that will help you to do so.  For me this takes wire wrapping jewelry to a whole different level and I can't wait to get the opportunity to try some of the techniques and combinations.

It beats the hell out of all post apocalyptic stories/movies I came across. The writing was wonderful and never a dull moment or boredom. Please don't miss this book, this one is destined to become the classic modern day sci-fi epic...can't wait for the movie to be out.<br /><br />I will read this book again after finishing Shift and Dust.

The public is starting to wonder if the Avengers are a good idea. In the midst of this downward spiral, the Avengers have learned that the dreaded Phoenix Force is returning to Earth. The Avengers determine that the cosmic entity is returning to Earth to claim a new avatar in Hope Summers and possibly destroy the Earth in the process. Captain America decides that they must stop the Phoenix and protect Hope from becoming the avatar.<br />  After the decimation of the mutant population, at the hands of the Scarlet Witch, the X-men have taken refuge on the derelict Asteroid M. Cyclops, leader of the X-men and the remaining mutant populace, has resurrected the base off the coast of San Fransisco, and renamed it Utopia. Without any new mutant births since the decimation, the population has dwindled down to less than 200 - too small to perpetuate a species. The mutants know that all hope is lost as they battle an endless supply of enemies, hell-bent on killing the remaining survivors. Then, dramatically, a mutant child is born, her powers manifesting at birth, destroying the hospital she was born in. To protect her, Cyclops has the child sent into the time stream with his son: Cable. Now &#34;Hope&#34; has returned as a young woman with untapped raw power. She can feel the desires of the Phoenix force. Cyclops sees this and the return of the Phoenix as their salvation.<br />  Cyclops lays everything on the line for his belief that the Phoenix Force, controlled by Hope, can resurrect the mutant population. As they await the arrival of the Phoenix, Cyclops is confronted by Captain America, who comes to Utopia for Hope. The two greatest leaders of the two greatest superhero teams face off, with the fate of Hope and the Earth, in the balance. Who is right, who is wrong, and who fires the first shot?

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book has a very compelling story. The author puts you right inside the heads of the characters, allowing you to feel their joy and sorrow. Though fiction, she brought in the aura of that time in American life. I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the US.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Kind of cute the way they meet. Really cannot imagine anyone getting that blitzed though. I really enjoyed the the story. And I do recommend it.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This movie doesn't stray too far from the formula that made the Lord of the Rings franchise so popular. It IS a bit more fanciful and tongue-in-cheek than LOTR, having stripped away some of the grime, grit, and dark-corners, but that doesn't ruin the rich feel or lively characters most fans would expect.<br /><br />There were quite a few liberties taken with the storyline when compared with the original book. I assume this was to flesh out the story, removing some large gaps of [yawn] boring character development, but I can't help feeling that this was also a financial decision, driven by the need to make a not-so-long book into a three part cash cow.<br /><br />All in all, this was a lovely romp allowing us to once again glimpse into J. R. R. Tolkien's long forgotten realm of Middle Earth.<br /><br />P.S. Keep an eye our for the release of the followup film &#34;The Desolation of Smaug&#34; in December of 2013.
1250012570|4.0|I adored this book. I'm a sucker for anything with vast musical references too. However, Eleanor and Park just touched me. It was what I really needed at the moment. It sweet, clever and emotional. Nothing like young love, however bittersweet it may be.
B00AE2J93I|2.0|It wasn't bad, but I found that they lost track of the target audience. There is too much graphic/scary content for young children, but the story is over simplified, making it unpalatable for adults.<br /><br />I love stop motion animation (e.g. Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Chicken Run, Corpse Bride, Coraline, Frankenweenie, etc...), so was really excited to see ParaNorman, but unfortunately this movie just didn't jell for me.
0060523808|4.0|I would recommend it highly for anyone thinking of joining the industry.  The 13 year anti-trust suit surely played a role in forming attitudes at the company.  Win. Execute. Team.  Unfortunately some of us didn't play football in college.

B003TSEEDY|2.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is listed for pre-teen/teens.  I would not recommend this book for anyone under at least 17 years of age based on the language and content.  The story is about a ninth grade male wallflower and how he stumbles through his schooling trying to fit in.  Unfortunately, he hangs with an older crowd and is exposed to drugs, sex, homosexuality, teen pregnancy, suicide, death, and alcohol at a very young age.  The story is told by the wallflower himself, Charlie.  The way he writes makes you wonder if there isn't something wrong with him since he is so gullible and naive throughout the novel compared to most 15-year olds.  Of course they do mention he was receiving counseling after the suicide of his one and only friend.  He tends to come across as having a severe anti-social disorder.  It reminded me somewhat  of The Catcher in the Rye, but not written as well.  Again, I would never allow a child to read this book under the age of 17.  Our society exposes our children to too much of this too early in life as it is.

B00742GBDM|2.0|If you looking for a sweet and beautiful love story, do not look to this adaptation of Mansfield Park.  It actually was quite disturbing.  Questions of how the Bertrom Family acquires its income come I question.  It is clear that Sir Thomas is despicable if one is to believe his son Tom's drawings.  Was Tom subjected to watching Rape and Torture of countless slaves?  This story is nothing like the original Jane Austine story nor do I think she wound ever approve of the abomination that was made to her beloved novel \\"Mansfiled Park\\".

B008VBYN80|4.0|I bought this app thinking,wow this game is awesome. It's okay,but diamonds shouldn't be so hard to get or buy.<br />People, let's fix this and many other games
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Received quickly and appears to be a better design than the original so it shouldn't wear out at the connection point.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|I grew up with the Eagles. In fact the only time I ever saw them in concert was in 1972 when they opened for Yes(!) Back then it was the original quartet - Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon, and those other two guys. They played a solid mix of country/rock, and their vocal harmonies were awesome. Not to mention the great songs they wrote! But I lost a lot of love when Bernie was obliged to leave so they could get after a harder rock ( read \\"lucrative\\") sound with Don Felder, and then it was all over for me when Randy was forced out and replaced by the guy from Poco (WTF?) Ever since then the Eagles were turned into a corporation run by Henley and Frey and I don't want anything to do with them. I really don't want to give them any money, but I plan to buy this DVD set because it has interviews with all three former Eagles PLUS an extra DVD of an Eagles concert when Randy was still in the band. I loved that original band; tolerated the addition of Felder and, later, Joe Walsh. I'm sorry money turned the whole thing so big and ugly, but thanks for the memories guys. You were great!<br />UPDATE: Just got this in the mail today and watched the first disc. It's every bit as good as I had hoped. Fantastic band, fantastic story. I actually learned a lot and gained newfound respect for Glen and Don as artists and, yes, businessmen. They clearly were the nucleus of this band. I guess it was more of a fantasy that The Eagles ( or any band ) were a band of equals ( or \\"no sidemen\\" as Glen was reported to have said ). It was a wonder that Bernie Leadon lasted as long as he did with those two guys.<br />Only one complaint: after all the hoopla that the dvd featured interviews with all band members, Randy Meisner was on-screen for only two minutes - total! Bernie was on a bit more than that. But the dvd was meant to highlight Glen and Don, clearly. I was hoping the story would be told by all founding members instead of just the two big shots. I have since learned that nothing on the film went by without the approval of Glen Frey of Irving. So that explains the muted comments by Randy and Bernie!<br />I was led to believe this \\"history\\" would be like the one the Beatles did in 1995 - all four of them telling their stories! But in this dvd half of the founding members are portrayed as \\"the help\\". Bernie was there on the first four out of five hit albums, and Randy was there for ALL five of them! ( I don't count The Long Run as a hit Eagles album. The band peaked and died after Hotel California.)<br />Finally: the concert  footage on the bonus dvd is EXCELLENT! OMG! It makes me fall in love with the Eagles all over again and forget about the hating and firing and money, etc. It is indeed a great bit of footage which looks and sounds fantastic. And the best song was Randy Meisner singing Take It To The Limit. What a fantastic singer he was! And he hits the high note at the end! Even Glen Frey was all smiles at the piano while Randy belted out his masterpiece.<br />Enjoyed the hell out of the entire dvd, though I must warn people to take it with a truckload of salt. It is NOT THE history of The Eagles, but only Glen Frey's and Don Henley's approved history. Like most things those two guys touch it is very well done. But it is not the whole story; not by a long shot.lm went by without the approval of Glen Frey of Irving.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed Defending Jacob, and thought it was an exellent story. My only problem with the book was, that I found that intermittent testimony between Jacob's father and the DA to be confusing, even after having finished the book,
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This was my \\"go to\\" music player on my phone.  I liked it more than any other, and I purchased music from Amazon on occasion.  But then it started to say that it couldn't play music on my device.  So I investigated, and Amazon changed the game.  Now you have to pay $24.99 a year for their service.  Don't get me wrong, if you want a cloud service, that's a decent deal.  I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone.  That's all.  For giving me a nice player, they got my business when I needed to purchase a song.  But that is gone, and I switched to Google Play Music.  It will do.  I don't like it as much yet, but I haven't used it long.  And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song.  I completely deleted the Amazon app from my phone.
B000056ULS|5.0|Dido. What a great name for such a great singer/songwriter. Take the libretto and make sure you get every nuance of what she is saying. So much talent.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Chris's book is an eye opening tour of how technology has transformed manufacturing for the little guys around the world while making a few billionaires in the process.  A must read for anyone that loves to make.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|Brad could sing the phone book and I would probably buy the CD. Love his song writing more than anything. He is the very best of what I love about country music.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Juliana Margulies stars as the wronged wife of a disgraced politician. She must go back to work to support her 2 teenage kids. Chris Noth is the naughty husband with a genuine sense of regret for his sins. Archie Punjabi is a scene<br />stealer as the in house investigator as the law firm where she works. The family drama is nicely balanced with the legal case of the week: murder, theft, in house legal machinations, etc. Excellent use of guest stars (Kate Burton, Joe Morton, etc.).
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I love No Angel and Life For Rent, but I think Dido should have fired the producer of this album. She is lovely and her voice is great, but there are no big moments and the music is sleepy.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The descriptions are amazing.  Again really difficult to tell fact from fiction, so you just have to let it go.  Loved the magical world.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|makes me laugh keeps me guessing it's always different! And it lets you take out your &#34;day&#34; in a productive fun way. And my cat likes it also....
B000FA675C|5.0|I can't wait to read his books. I've read them all and love his intricate plots.<br />Would love to go to the places he goes, but I feel like I did in his writing.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|My daughter gave me a Kindle Fire for Christmas, thinking I would try reading books, BUT, even though I didn't think I was a game type, I am totally shocked how addicting games are!! Bubbles is one of them!
B000JIN3J8|2.0|This rendition of Pride and Prejudice is laughable.  I just read the book and it loosly follows the original but in no way can I recommend it
B00992CF6W|5.0|amagine it the best grafics in a video game like this. you get to build houses kill a assortment of things. you get to kill zombies, skeliton bow men, spiders, and lastly creepers that blow up. the only problem is my kindel fire heats up if I play for long perids of time. lastly wont get the demo mode you only play for a Max of 15 minutes.  you can have multipul words with out it slowing down. so get this game it is woulrth the price.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A friend in the USA had not seen this series on their TV and was interested in the story. She is now hooked and is looking out for it on the numerous American channels. The series is set in Georgia in the Southern states but she found it hard to believe that leading actor Andrew Lincoln was a Brit as his accent was so good and she is from Alabama.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It's a great way to pass the time and it works great on the kindle unlike a lot of other games.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I find this hard to manuver.  I like it but I can never get to the area I want right away.
B002BY77CW|5.0|When i saw the reviews for the book I was iffy but I got it anyways and I am so happy! I love Lauren Conrad and this book looks over her life from the hills. This book was great and kept me on my seat the whole book!
0307990850|5.0|A really good Reacher action novel.  Kept moving.  It also kept the reader guessing.  Not much more to say.  Just filling out required words.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book… I think many people can relate, many people have gone through worst things but it just reminds us that we will eventually get through it and be okay. We can choose who we want to be.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I watched this show more than 10 years ago and although it was good it did not seem great at the time. Watching it in 2013 it just seems much better than it did back at the the start of the 21st century. It has aged well!  Good plots and good acting! The film quality could be a tad sharper though! Too bad Amazon does not have the newly released 1080, p version of the first season.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are quite simple but are good for killing time. could have been a bit more challenging but you can not go wrong with free.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|time never worked, only thing it retained was my location but no weather time or alarm. I hope to find one that works.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|The girls (7 and 8) have spent hours with this.  It keeps  them occupied, nothing negative to say.  We do not purchase anything additional and they still enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun!!!!!!! When I need something to keep me busy this game is the answer!!!!!!! Buy the free game!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|One of the best game ever!!! One thing is that with the new update for the kindle joining games with your friends it does not work properly I can't die!( which isn't that bad) but I can't kill my friends:( or open chests! Please make this fixes by the new update in April. Other than that great game:)
B005USZYDU|4.0|SO far so good anything by John Grisham is great I find.I plan to read more of his books in the future
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game kept me playing and kept me wanting more! The graphics were vivid<br />, the storyline was good, and the characters were even diverse. Even knowing how it ends, I will probably play again.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|I read the book because my friend found it in hebrew and told me to find it in english and read it I found it to be very good. and it gave me something to talk to my friend about.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a fun read.  It was an easy entertaining book to read.  The complete series was very good and entertaining.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Movie arrived within a few days of ordering. Came in perfect shape, not a scratch on the disc. I love all the extras the dvd offers + love the movie, one of my all-time favs =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This complete series was both entertaining and easy books to read.  I look forward to book #3.  Once I started I could not put it down.  Usually the second book in a series is a let down to me, but not this one.
0307341577|3.0|I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars. As with Gone Girl, the writing was terrific, and the author knows how to keep you turning the pages. Her descriptions make you feel like you're right there with the characters. Unfortunately, I didn't always want to be there, not because the story was dark--I enjoy a dark thriller--but because I really didn't like any of the characters. More than that, I found it difficult to root for them. I understand characters should be flawed, but in 'Dark Places,' they are too flawed. Certainly the characters were far from perfect in 'Gone Girl' too, a book by Flynn that I loved, but I felt more empathy for the protagonist in that one than I did in 'Dark Places.' But that being said, I'm always impressed by Flynn's writing, and I will eagerly read more of her work.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|I was worried I wouldn't like the movie because it seemed to be getting worse reviews than the Lord of the Rings movies but I liked it just as much as that trilogy. Peter Jackson's Tolkien movies are so amazing I'm so glad he is making these. Yes the movie is long but I was never bored. I thought I was watching an extended version but at the end of the movie there are a bunch of small behind the scenes movies as bonus features. I think the actor that played Bilbo in this was great.
B000UZPIAW|3.0|THis one was a hard read... it was a good book full of facts and excitement but wasn't not thrilled with the price its the most exp. book ive bought and it took forever to read... was in fact a little boring... I love Nikki Sixx but this book wasn't as exciting as i fig. it would be as a book about the struggles of a drug addiction...
B000Y7U98C|5.0|This movie is not a &#34;feel good&#34; flick, even though the title might make you think so.<br />Its disturbing from the get-go and only becomes more interesting as it plays out.<br />Intense Suspense!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is so much cu I love mystory games like this. I wish I had found this game sooner. cant stop playing it.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|Never think that a complete transformation of your life cannot occur, no matter who you think you are!<br />Science and Spirituality are two sides of the same coin. You'll see how they merge in this beautifully inspiring film.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Of all the books I have read on Lincoln and the Civial War, this one brings the reader closest to understanding the man Lincoln, and the extraordinary human qualities he possessed.
B007T99ENE|3.0|McEwan is a great writer. This novel is certainly an entertaining read but not up there with other McEwan novels. The twist at the end (which I am not going to give away) is reminiscent of how he ended Atonement - a far superior novel.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I'm total music snob.  I'm a jazz and classical fan and I'm ultra critical of all music.  I'm especially critial of mainstream music...if it's rock, it better be instrumentally good and somehow unique.  I just heard of Clutch on Facebook, and decided to give them a try.  What a treat!  These guys are truly authentic rock-n-roll.  Instrumental is great, and vocals are unique!  Earth Rocker is heavy enough to kick total ass, and not too heavy to lose musicality.  \\"I don't always listen to rock-n-roll, but when I do, there's a good chance it will be Clutch from now on :)\\"
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|I loved Baraka and this follow up does not seem to be at the same par. I do like it but would probably save the money and watch it via a streaming site if it was available. I watch Baraka from time to time and do not see myself watching this again any time soon.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My son loves this bey! It literally cannot be beat. It spins longer than he can wait to let it finish. It also spins on the carpet without faltering. He wants another bey that can compete with this as nothing else compares.
0802130208|3.0|This book, whose publication was initially rejected by Simon & Schuster, on the ground it was &#34;pointless,&#34; but given strong critical approval when published some years later, at the urging of Toole's mother after his suicide. It is perhaps best thought of as a picture of lower middle class society in New Orleans in the mid-twentieth century. Toole was especially adept in recreating the dialect of both white and black New Orleans speakers. The central character, a youngish, very fat, learned, arrogant, impatient, self-centered son of a indulgent, but increasingly impatient mother, becomes rather tiresome. His girl friend, who is in New York for much of the time, is not very likeable and is obsessively preaching a socialist revolution, but she becomes a kind of &#34;deus ex machina&#34; when every thing else fails. He needs to find a job and he gets hired in positions for which he is poorly fitted: as a office clerk in a factory that manufactures men's pants, and as a strolling pushcart vendor of hot dogs. The situations are often amusing but rather too extended.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I just wanted something to kill some time while waiting in line or on hold.  Angry Birds Seasons Free fits the bill.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Before I begin to rave about the book, I want to say that I listened to the first half of the book. It was hard to stay focused because it is written in diary format. But I am so glad I stuck with it and read parts during lunchtime...... Boy did I really get into it after that!!<br /><br />Holy crap! This book had so many twists and turns that my mind is still spinning. AWESOME work Ms Flynn! WOW!!! When I thought I knew how it was going to end, you took me on a whole new twist!!! It is no wonder this was one of Goodreads best mystery books of 2012! I RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO EVERYONE!!! It is guaranteed to leave you totally awed!<br /><br />& can I just say that Amy is one twisted, dimented psycho bitch! What she did with that wine bottle was just beyond belief!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Ended up not loving this story. I was expecting a little more supernatural and less wartime. There were too many technical descriptions of weapons md ear strategy. I expected more of a story.
1401937519|5.0|Moorjani does everyone a favor by telling her story of survival following an NDE. Her story and experience gives hope to millions.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|For those Nicholas Sparks fans...this one is fantastic!  My only complaint was that it was so good...I read it in about a day and a half.  Wish it would have lasted longer!
B00992CF6W|5.0|wow new updates 1.6.1 i love it, but I hope there will be the cool update NOTCH AND JEB . AND THIS IS NOT SUCK GAME NEVER! LOL
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is book is intense!  I will start with this, if this were happening in real life, to friends of mine... I would feel differently about how things turned out.  That being said... this is a story, a book... an AMAZING story, an AMAZING book.  At times I felt Travis's and Pidge's pain, happiness, hurt, excitement... It takes a wonderful writer to pull a person so deep into their words, their book.  LOVED IT, EVERY PAGE!
B001UGB1X8|3.0|&#34;In the Electric Mist&#34; did not cause me to either turn it off, or to stay glued to the screen.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Was hesitant to purchase, due to price, but gave in and was glad. Only hope season 6, which debuts next week, will live up to expectations.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is awesome. I don't know hoe any of ya'll would have to look at reviews to see if you wish to get this. this game is too awesome for that. bye
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Great book. I totally would recommend it. Especially if you love a good apocalyptic book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I am on the edge off my seat w every epidode. It's like xfiles meets american horror story. Luuuuuuuuv it!!,
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I missed watching the 2nd season so buying it on Amazon was perfect for me.  I can watch the episodes in my spare time and watch again if I like.
B005WMQ5R8|4.0|Redline is most easily defined as a Sci-fi racing movie, but there are many more elements to it than just that.<br /><br />The Redline is a race where the best drivers go to show their skills and win fame and fortune.  The story follows one of these racers, J.P., through his quest to become the champion.  The plot is simplistic, yet engaging.  J.P. is a likeable main character but is nowhere near the only character a viewer may want to root for.  From the lead up to the race, through until the end, the movie gives insight into each team in the race and their motivations for winning.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are varied and unique:  Aliens, criminals, robots, and beautiful women are examples of the people gunning to win the Redline.  Each team's vehicle has its own strengths and weaknesses and the race has somewhat of a Hanna-Barbera's Wacky Races feel to it, although without the accompanying comedy.  This movie is not for children.<br /><br />The movie's greatest strength is its animation.  The cels are all hand drawn (over 100,000 of them) and are stunning.  This movie is as much a vehicle to showcase the slick animation as it is to forward the plot.  If you are a fan of hand drawn animation, you will be excited to see this movie.  Some of the character designs are far from normal, but they are compelling and rather unique.  This movie took seven years to make and you can see why in the detail of the animations.<br /><br />The soundtrack is, for the most part, a collection of upbeat dance music tracks that complement the fast, adrenaline fueled racing that pervades this movie.  I've watched this movie both with the original Japanese voice acting track with subtitles and the English language dub.  While I think that the voice acting in the Japanese language track is better (specifically the main character's voice which was much less subdued than the English counterpart), fans who enjoy watching movies with the English dub won't be disappointed in the voice acting.<br /><br />If you are a fan of beautiful animation, high octane race movies, or science fiction in general, I don't think you will be disappointed by Redline.  It gives the viewer all of these things and more.  If you're the kind of movie watcher that needs a complex plot to enjoy, this might not be to your liking.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|No review necessary.  Greatest Jazz Album Ever. Greatest Jazz Album Ever. Greatest Jazz Album Ever. Greatest Jazz Album Ever. Greatest Jazz Album Ever.
1455523550|5.0|This is nice, light disposable fluff, but it's great if you're after some relaxing escapism. I've never read a Nicholas Sparks novel before & whilst some elements were predictable there were enough surprises to keep me interested. Very enjoyable.
B001DPC4RS|5.0|As the story goes, all the lyrics were sung as &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; and much of the arrangement was improvised on the spot.  The fascinating thing is, there is absolutely no hesitation, it just flows.  Although the whole album is excellent, the standout cuts for me are: &#34;Sweet Thing&#34;, &#34;Madame George&#34; and the title track.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Love this trilogy and hated it when I finished the last page!  Mr. Smith's depiction of Stalin's Russia and beyond is beyond descriptive.  I began to feel the paranoia, the fear, the oppressiveness of that time.  If you love history and you love a good murder mystery, this trilogy is a must read.  I want more!!
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|was too hard for my sonto transform so i did all the transforming and showing how to do it was irritating should have gotten him somethins a little easier.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun little game about connecting the color coded dots. I made it to the 8x8 squares, it's been a pretty easy game. Probably more appropriate for younger players.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A necessity for me as math is not my forte.  It is a worthwhile app and I'm glad I aquirred it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am addicted to to this show cannot wait for the 4th season I love it<br />it is so well made
B005K17RU0|1.0|The new format is horrible. It is not User friendly at all and is extremely hard to just &quot;check the weather&quot;  I would much rather have the old style back.  I will be down loading another easier to use app.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app really gives you everything about weather.  Maps, real time video, news on storms, etc.<br /><br />this puts the weather channel to shame!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Awesome book. I could not put it down!!! You will love the suspense of learning Christine's past with her...just when you think you've figured it out....
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I was extraordinarily pleased with the depth and breadth of this movie. to  be taken from a view of a disappointingly degenerate view of ( my hero) Denzel, and then to see him accept responsibility ( anthus remain my hero) was SOOO uplifting. Several times in this movie I felt disappointment at his inability to demonstrate ANY self control and that was hard to watch. This story is totally redemptive and should be seen by anyone tinkering with or thinking about drugs or alcohol for recreational use. The slide to the bottom as depicted by Denzel was so very  illustrative of the brutality and hopelessness of addiction, this story was really pivotal and I loved it.
B005LAIHCM|1.0|I have seen lots of these kinds of movies and I thought it was a horrible movie. I do not recommend this
B007REV4T8|5.0|this is probably the best james bond-we liked daniel craig, but still prefer sean connery-was sorry to see judy dench killed off, but she has vision problems-excellent movie-would recommend to everyone-fast ship-thank you
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining series.  Hard to stop watching!  Every episode is gripping with twist and turns to the plot.  Good for all ages.
B00BS4PF0C|4.0|Great addition to my music list....love the mellow to the wound up!!  Great work blake!!! Must have!  Great country music!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I am reading this and enjoying the Harry Bosch adventures again.  I think I have read all of them and typically, they are all good reading and if you enjoy reading about how they solve those mysteries from years before, I recommend this one....
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It wasn't bad but did have higher expectations of it.  It did bother me how they cursed so bad in front of their children, but Hey guess that's Hollywood stuff for you. Would just like to feel & think that's not something allowed with parents.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Too many shadow in shadow items &amp; the game simply ends after you crack a safe.  Great save for these.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Graphics are very nice, and the upgrades are fun to save for. About the only thing I would change is more missions and more variety in the missions. Love this game!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I bought this app the day it came out and i have the entire series. Great online multiplayer. But, online there are alot of noobs and alot of pros. Not much of a middle area that made it hard to rank up. Voting for levels needs improvement. Since havok helped make it, gameplay is very fluid and fun. All around this is a great app and series. I reccomend this as &quot;portable epic&quot;.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Great, CD!  There is nothing better than a great sounding Texas blues legend.  I will definately buy more, so great
B00465I17E|5.0|The Great Debaters (Blu-ray) was and awesome movie it open my eyes about how life was for Blacks. It strongly shows how fortunate we are today thanks to those he stood and fought for us Blacks. Would also like to thank every white man and woman of God for without there help we would not be here today or have the things we have. They played a Hughe row in our freedom . God Bless you all. Donnie
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Would pay a one time of 2.99 but won't ever make an in game purchase off &quot;turns&quot;. These mini transaction games make me less likely to purchase a game from a developer.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|I hadn't seen this version before and actually liked it better then the movie version, more action and of course Arnie at his best!
B005I6EU48|4.0|This fits a Fire (not a Fire HD) nicely. This cover feels solid and has a nice (fake) leather feel. I like how I can bend the cover around back when using the Fire. The elastic bands, with a somewhat \\"sticky\\" underside, are stronger than I'd expected, which is a good thing.<br /><br />I'd give this five stars if the materials were a bit more upscale and if there were side guards when the cover is closed, but given what it is and the price, I think it's a solid four-star item, which is more than respectable.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|The Strokes were one of my favorite bands when I was in high school and \\"Is This It\\" was released. I wore that CD out playing it in my car and in my house CD players. I loved it and then I was pleased with the progression the band made with \\"Room on Fire.\\" But since then, it feels like the floor has fallen out on the band, and their last two releases missed the mark. While Comedown Machine isn't perfect and doesn't reach the heights of either of those first albums, it's a welcome return from a band that's been missing its muse for the better part of the last decade. Comedown Machine is heavily influenced by 80s new wave music. It's got some catchy tunes, like \\"50/50\\" and \\"Welcome to Japan.\\"<br /><br />This album doesn't feel like a finished product. The vocals from Casablancas don't sound as if they've been mixed properly on some of the tracks, including the final track. It's impossible to hear what he's saying and his vocals aren't the strongest. His falsetto vocals sound as if they are rivaling the noise made when a cat is strangled.<br /><br />When looking back at the last two Strokes albums, this one is much, much better. I hope they continue making good music and can get back to the heights of 12 years ago with \\"Is This It.\\"
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This store holds one in suspense until the very end.  Really great story skillfully written.  The characters are typical of a small rural town.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Although the story is a sad one, the music is great as well as all of the actors did a wonderful job.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|I bought this because I liked their debut album, I figured this was a little early for a new band to put out a covers album, they usually wait until they are an established band, but i also thought that most bands play cover songs until they can write thier own, so this naturally make sense.  Plus all bands want to show their fans what music and bands inspire them.  I begin with Band/Song choices: High Wire - Badlands; far and away one of my favorite bands and it is nice to see a new band use them as inspiration.  If you haven't listened to Jake E. Lee's Badlands, then do so now!!  Theor first self titled album and second one (Voodoo Highway) are absolutely amazing.  Their last album (Dusk) is great but really hard to find. Stand Up and Shout/Kill the King/Mob Rules (Songs 2, 6 & 8 respectively) the Dio trio as I call it - One from each of Ronnie's famous bands (Solo, Rainbow, & Black Sabbath)  All are great interpretations and Russell does a great job with the vocals, no one can hit Ronnies high notes or sound like him, but they put a good Adrenaline Mob spin on them.  I especially like Kill the King.  Next is Break On Through - The Doors; of all the songs this is my favorite, I am a huge Doors fan and this is a super cool version of the song.  Almost sounds like a completely different song, a lot faster and harder than the original.  Romeo Delight - Van Halen; one of my least favorite Van Halen songs, and the Mob cannot really make it any better, they make it sound different it is OK probably the weakest song on the disc.  Barracuda - Heart; another shocker for a hard band to cover, but they absolutely nail it.  Like Anthrax did with Boston's Smokin' on their covers album Anthems.  This is my next favorite song, pretty close to the original but again done in the Mob way.  The last song is the Lemon Song - Led Zeppelin; all bands who do covers albums should automatically do a Zep song, since all bands since the 70's owe their sound to Zep and Sabbath.  This is a great version aas well.  I like that Adrealine Mob has chosen tracks to do that are off the beaten path.<br />To summarize:<br />High Wire - 9/10<br />Stand up and Shout - 7/10<br />Break on Through - 10/10<br />Romeo Delight - 5/10<br />Barracuda - 9/10<br />Kill the King - 8/10<br />The Lemon Song - 8/10<br />The Mob Rules - 8/10<br /><br />Buy this as well as the Anthrax Anthems if you want some cool songs from the past redone to a modern hard rock sound.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this game.  only downfall is that it freezes often on my kindle.  would highly recommend this game though. very addicting
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I downloaded this free ebook to help guide me through the process of formatting my book for Kindle and uploading it. It's plain-English instructions made the operation easy and painless.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My dear kindle community I am Not a Zombie fan but this was the scariest book I have ever read. The upcoming movie  would be flesh out creepy.
B0025YKDJC|4.0|This is a very fun movie to watch. Carey is brilliant. And carries a great message of taking chances and living life! I fast forward through one part with my 15-year old daughter. :-)
B003M6EAXM|5.0|To see someone think of such a daring subject, yet delivering it with so much sensitivity is app-laudable. Just wish this was not the last season... Loved watching this series
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Easy, straightforward reading for someone who just wants to get on with the diet.  Fasting on two non-consecutive days is a manageable approach for me.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It works great. you can get the weather map down to the street level, This is useful in some weather condition in the mid-east.  The forcasting seems to be better that the ones on TV.
B0012239EE|5.0|You should hear everything this young fella has playing now. An answer to all those young women, Mr. Groban has a voice that should be heard by everyone with a decent music collection.
B00005JKG7|4.0|The dvd we had broke, it is the favorite movie of one of my children for Halloween, glad we were able to find a copy.<br />Thank you...!
B004BRP7R4|5.0|This young man has a voice as wonderful as any opera performer. I can see why he trained for and wanted a Broadway music career: his voice I can imagine singing any musical designed to spotlight a baritone voice.
1476715904|5.0|I bought it as a gift for a friend, she loved it........and have ordered the next one for her.. thank you
B0011Z33ES|5.0|Again, I am a HUGE Josh Groban fan. If you haven't heard him try his newest CD or buy one of his first CD's and see what you think<br />.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I think everyone needs to give the popular UK television series some serious consideration.  I've been very happy with the show and will continue to follow it as long as it's on the air.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I didn't love this one in the theater but I think that I actually appreciated it more at home.  The ending didn't suck as much as I remembered it although it's probably the weakest bit of JD's performance through out the series at the end (no spoiler).
B009KEN87O|5.0|time killer. just a great game. simple but addicting. pretty easy so far. I haven't tried the hard mode just yet
B0018RC7QE|3.0|Meryl Streep looks cool in her frumpy clothes.  It's a pleasant romantic movie of its time that probably once had some shock value in dealing with the issue of divorce and cheating... And love... Ah love.  Although, not sure I believed that the characters were in love. Little flat, in that dept.
B005LAIHRC|3.0|I got this item for one of my relatives last christmas and it was ok, the package was ok and the dick didn't have any scratches .
B0098TL4YU|5.0|Jimi Jamison, the vocalist of Survivor from 1984 masterpiece album, VITAL SIGNS to 1988 album TOO HOT TO SLEEP, put out his fourth solo album in 2012. After listening to his last solo work CROSSROAD MOMENTS and KIMBALL JAMISON, duo work with BOBBY KIMBALL of TOTO, I didn't have so much expectation. But this album turned out to be far better than what I had imagined.<br /><br />First three tracks recap glorious days of Survivor. THE GREAT UNKNOWN intentionally borrows opening riff of CAN'T GIVE IT UP in TOO HOT TO SLEEP. NEVER TOO LATE reminds me of DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS LOVE from Too Hot To Sleep. You will love this song if you like songs like JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME by Lou Gramm. At fifth track STREET SURVIVOR, Jimi rocks really hard. If you love Rocky theme songs, EYE OF THE TIGER, BURNING HEART and DANGER ZONE by Kenny Loggins you will love this song for sure. After going through great songs one after another, the last three songs are incredibly super. All these songs can compete current hit songs out there in 2012 and 2013. Particularly the last song WALK ON(WILDEST DREAM) can convince modern rock fans who like NICKLEBACK, HOOBASTANK or SHINEDOWN.<br /><br />It is surely never too late to promote the album so that this work can be reached to millions of music fans.<br /><br />Verdict: One of the best rock album of 2012<br />Rating: 98 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Every 80s pop rock fan.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I watched this movie just by chance on my TV.  As I had watched it only after it had been going on for an hour, I wanted to see the beginning of the movie.  What I was able to watch, offers valuable lessons for life.  Can't wait to see the complete movie, now that I have the DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read.  I absolutely loved it!  I think this was even better than Slammed and Point of Retreat (loved those too).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it my sister does too but one thing I went to play but all my stuff was gone people coins even bords I was sad.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this wakes me up in the morning normal alarm clocks don't do this itd the alarm clock ever you whole use this get it now while you can its amazing.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I'm angry that I turned down a trip to the beach to finish a book that reminded me so much of the NAtalie Holloway story. The ending has left me angry at the main character for covering up murder for his son.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a good story ,followed the others ,liked the whole series ,but last book was enough off them . It was interesting but by the end  I had had enough of this story .
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is an excellent book that I think everyone should read.<br />I have read the whole series except for this book .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Update needed for kindle and android for scoring issues as you get deep into game. Awesome follow up to original. Must try. I think it is better than the orginal
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are a must read....could not put them down!!! I am not a book reader but these definately kept me wanting to read more!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Well the listed addiction has No porn ads so don't listen to the people who have been saying that it has porn ads!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read it, just do it.  It's unlike nothing I've ever read before yet seems so close to happening in real life.
1616550414|5.0|This is a must for a Zelda fan.  It is a big book and well worth purchasing.  There is a ton of artwork and tells how all the Zelda games fit together.  I've always been a huge fan of the franchise and something like this is icing on the cake.  It focuses on some games more than others but is still really cool to read about it and catch some connections you might have missed.  Well worth adding to your bookshelf.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Same problem I have with podcasts app - sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't - so inferior to apple apps WHY? I loved my old kindle but I should have spent the extra bucks and bought an iPad mini You get what you pay for.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Florida Georgia Line is getting more well known but I really like their music.  When I share it with a lot of people they ask my why it's not on the radio more often.  I can listen to all the songs on this CD over and over.  I love the rap part in Dayum Baby.  I know it's a country CD and unexpected but it sounds really good.<br /><br />WORTH NOTING: Target sells this CD for the same price with TWO BONUS SONGS: What Are You Drinking About and Country In My Soul.  I think it's worth purchases from Target just for those extra songs, you can always rip them and upload them to whatever cloud music service you use.  Country In My Soul is one of my favorite songs on the CD.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Its an adventure and classic fun movie that you will want to watch again and again with your kids.  Its great!
B00BUI5GW8|5.0|I love this album. The digital download is great and the Amazon Cloud Player is the perfect way to stream music from any device.  All the songs live up to the expectation that I had for this album.  I only wish the MP3 version would have included the extra 3 songs that were on the delux version on CD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|just play it and you will be hooked on it.  Its fun and challenging.  You will not want to share with your friends.
B009GED3HS|5.0|HIMYM is hysterical, addicting, entertaining and one the best shows on tv. Barney's catch phrases, marshal and lillies awesome marrige, teds journey and robins antics make for some good old fashion fun! I am Sad to see it go! It will be hard to replace a show like this.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Its just fun to try to help your little person escape to freedom while gathering all the gold coins a person can magically carry.
B006O6F932|5.0|The Monster High School is unlike any school I ever attended but if you're a fan, you can't beat it! My seven year old granddaughter thinks I' m \\"the best grandmother ever\\" for purchasing it. My daughter, on the other hand, said it took her a while to put it together and there were alot of pieces. The kids love playing with it so what's an hour putting it together! We spent half the night putting things together Christmas Eve when my kids were growing up. They even plan to use it as a center piece at my granddaughter's Monster High sleepover.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Good book. A bit of a slow start, but then it grabbed my attention and didn't let go. Good lead character. This is almost as good as the forgotten.
1594135851|5.0|I love this series it is so good. I saw the movie first and then read all the books. Great
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoyed this game for about 2 years and got board and spent a great deal of money. About a week ago i got interested again about the game and discovered i had to start all over.  That really sucks what happen to my last game, the world may never know. Good game but i will not spend the money i use to spend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Kept you iin suspense until very end really loved this book one of his best.  I could really feel for the characters as they is many abused woman in this world
1931559317|5.0|...Which is mostly what I do -- I don't drag out the telescope that often.  It's probably great for scopes too, but I can't comment on that.  I can say this is a beautiful book -- the layout and colors are visually pleasing as well as extremely practical.  The colors show up clearly in red light; the page numbers and indices are large and easy to find; the maps are detailed and intuitive.  I've been using this to help find parts of constellations I can't normally see from my urban location.  I use binoculars to cut through the light pollution and bring out a few more stars.  Really faint constellations like Cancer can be a challenge, but the binoculars pick up so many MORE stars that it's easy to lose the ones you are looking for!  This atlas helps immensely.  It shows the main stars as well as a host of &#34;background&#34; stars allowing me to star hop along and find what I need.  I have a couple of other star atlases, and this is becoming my &#34;go to&#34; guide.  It's thorough, without being a heavy tome.<br /><br />Cons:  Not many.  It's not really a &#34;pocket&#34; atlas unless you have cargo pockets! But I wouldn't want it any smaller. Just don't be surprised  that it won't fit in your pants pocket.  Maybe a very large coat pocket.  The notes say to keep it in your glove box, but it will take up a lot of room in there!<br /><br />I highly recommend this atlas for binocular astronomy -- it's stunning just to look at, and equally stunning in actual use.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I like the game, It's a great game, but stopped as I really got into playing, asking for payment. It was advertised as Free...not so. I don't mind paying for what I like and want, but not be tricked into it. Uninstalled it.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Just a wonderful book and I would recommend this to anybody who likes to find what's behind the truth. The best book I ever read
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a surprisingly addictive game our whole family enjoy s playing this game for hour upon hour .  We. Love this great game
B00571F26Y|4.0|I purchased this book because I'm tired of the weight I've been gaining for no known reason. We all know we need to eat less carbs, but we have to have fiber. As a nurse, I've been embarrassed by my weight gain. But now I also have to admit to my high cholesterol. Kind of hard to make a patient respect your opinion when you don't have your own act together. So I got this book to see if I could maybe adopt a couple of principles. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading the book. There were parts that actually made me laugh out loud. Dr. Davis has an impressive sense of humor. But then there were parts that practically made me cry. Look at what we are doing to ourselves! And to our kids! I've been off the \\"stuff\\" for a week now. I've been fortunate enough not to have many withdrawal symptoms other than lethargy. My middle son who suffers from allergies, headaches, and frequent bouts of nausea, though negative for celiac, started putting the plan into effect last night. I'm excited to see where this leads!  OH...by the way... I'm down three pounds in just a week. I've been trying to lose 15 pounds for months now and haven't been able to budge at all! Could it really be this easy?
044024630X|4.0|When we first started reading Child's Reacher series, we thought we were clever to read them in publication order.  But so far, we've been through 16 of 17, and this one takes your favorite sociopath back to his late days in the military and includes Second Son, the short story from his childhood.  Consider reading it first.  (Don't know about Wanted Man, as it is the only one we haven't read as of the date of this review.)
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading this book. It was fun and easy to read. I would recommend this to any child.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really really fun but gems are kind of hard to get the gems but other than that its great
B002HFP0R4|5.0|It's a beautiful compilation of their extensive musical works, and includes family bios and photographs. For anyone nostalgic about the Bee Gees and Andy Gibb (like myself), this is a terrific way to really enjoy their music and stories again...
0143122916|5.0|The author does a good job of mixing the compelling story of Shin Dong Hyuk's amazing escape from a full control concentration camp with the background on North Korea, China and South Korea that is necessary to put Shin's experiences into context.  Some comments have criticized the \\"side bars\\" that provide this background on the fly, but I think they came at just the right places.  We have long known of North Korea's gigantic prison camps, cult-like culture, repression of any form of free expression, and economic disasters -- mostly from reports that look at this man-made hell from the outside.  Harden's careful rendition of Shin's account provides an insider's view and goes on to capture Shin's arduous journey to join humanity after being born to a feral existence in a slave labor camp.  The biggest eye-opener for me was Shin's first experiences in the impoverished, semi-starved North Korean countryside immediately following his escape.  The life that he saw outside the camp -- in the most cruelly repressed nation on earth -- seemed unbelievably free and opulent to him.  Incredible.  Shin opines at one point that it's just a matter of time before the NK regime collapses.  But I fear it will be a long time -- longer for me now that I know even more of what goes on there every day.<br /><br />The book gets five stars, but I wish I had read it instead of listening to it as an audio book.  Having spent 17 years of my life living and working in South Korea, I cringed at his pronunciation of Korean words, including place names and people's names.  It would not have bothered me so much if not for the fact that Blaine Harden did the reading himself.  If in all these hours of interviews he heard names and places spoken by Koreans, WHY did he pronounce them differently in the book?  Even the press gets Pyung Yang right about half the time these days (Yang rhymes with wrong).  It almost challenged his credibility for me as most people who spend time in a foreign country get SOME general feel for how the language sounds.  Because this book appeals to people who already have an interest in Korea, a little more care with the language in the audio version would have been nice. In print, of course, this is not an issue.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Lincoln was a man well beyond his time.  His decisions on choosing his Cabinet members is extraordinary.  I bought this book since it was recommended by my Son.<br /><br />Wonderfully written by Author.  It gave me an insight on how Lincoln's mind worked.<br /><br />Loved the book
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I was very surprised at the price. Even wally world cannot come close to this value. come close come close
1451695195|4.0|The Author described his experience in detail of what happened to him from feeling well to suddenly being admitted to a Hospital & into a Coma.  It's amazing that he can recall what happened to him in this state of &#34;COMA&#34;, when there was no brain activity.<br /><br />As time goes by I am hoping that he can write a sequel with more detail on his memory of Heaven.  It's a well written book.
B008O037RG|5.0|This is a GREAT album, like their predecessor - Sigh No More - both of these albums deserve many listens.
B005QMOZOO|4.0|A good read if you like Austen and James.<br />Steer clear Jane puritans. You will not be impressed. Oh- and Wickham had it coming!
B00000JNO1|3.0|Being a long time Lynyrd Skynyrd fan I can honestly say that this album doesn't stand up very well to the two previous albums as stated by other fans in their reviews... It is much weaker musically & lacks the overall rocking sound that Skynyrd is known for, I'm not going to totally downplay this album because I think there is still some good music to be heard on here, just don't expect it to sound any where near as good as the previous two... This album was also the first to introduce Artimus Pyle on drums... I would recommend this album only for hardcore Lynyrd Skynyrd fans... I give it 3 stars...
B009E3EY38|4.0|I have bought the 2CD only version and found it to be a great overview of the band. I only had album no.4 so I am not a massive fan, but this was a great listen.
B005PK1G76|5.0|The stroller we love to shop around town in had nowhere to put small stuff.  This solved the problem.  It can hold 2 bottles or sippy cups, my wallet and car keys.  I like it a lot!
B009ICQ6KO|4.0|I was really looking forward to this album featuring Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite. As other reviewers have noted it is just missing something. I really like the song I don't believe a word you say but there are no other songs that sound like that. You found another lover is also a great song and is quiet and slow as opposed to word you say. It is good but not as great as I was expecting.
B008602KQI|5.0|My Grand Daughter just loves this movie. Really like CatNis and her bow. Bought it for her as a gift.
0345803507|3.0|I can finally breath a sigh of relief...it's over.  I was aiming at 2 1/2 stars, but since that is not a choice, I opted for 3.  The book had it's good moments, but the constant sex and redundancy made it barely bearable!  There were a few things I did not like about Freed....her constant crying, Christian becoming too sappy and the bank scene had me LMAO, especially when she commented \\"I didn't think it would be this hard\\", referring to withdrawing $5 mil...in cash - COME ON - although she did succeeded, it was just too unrealistic!  Overall the book wasn't half bad, better than 1, but not as good as 2 - in my opinion!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Stream through Amazon is very good.  I'm loving Downton Abbey, its a very good show and the history is interesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is fun but would be runner if it didn't require real money to play better features. please update it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|The DVD gives much better surround sound performance and somewhat better picture vs the original HBO screening.  Only problem was having to update the software on my Blu-ray player in order to use these DVD's.  This was fairly easy to do but still a bit of a hassle.
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|The Amazon Instant Video was SO convenient, and we got to watch it, CHEAPER than we would in the theater, in the comfort of our home, without any strings attached to keeping the movie. And I'm GLAD we didn't buy it! I'm a HUGE fan of LOTR, have all 3 extended Blue Ray versions at home. So this movie was a disappointment... I stopped watching it halfway though. (To finish it the next night)<br />It's like they decided to make it a weirdly humorous movie. Which is NOT what the other LOTR are like. Humor? Come on. And it's like kid humor too. Like stupid, silly stuff. Trolls sneezing boogars into the soup? A slightly mental wizard with bird poop on his head? At one point he pulls a walking stick out of his mouth? Seriously. It was a big let down. I had heard both good and bad things about the movie, so my expectations were low.... But I still was let down!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't stop. The girl on fire refuses to be let out by anything, even the Capitol and President Snow. You will want to know what happens next.
B000UIVRXG|5.0|if you like silly british and sophisticated fast moving plots you will most likely really dig this. its very tongue in cheek, and in my opinion even better than Shaun of the Dead
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun but its very hard to unlock new people its fun though please have a China world tour thing because the Rio is getting really boring!!!!!!#
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I wanted to like this game. I love the original story by Jules Verne. I enjoy match 3 Bejeweled rip-offs (yes, this is another blatant Bejeweled clone).<br /><br />Here are my problems with the game:<br /><br />1. The story butchers the real tale, while this doesn't ruin the game, it certainly left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />2. There are many stages where due to poor design, I got poor scores. I would have to replay them multiple times until by luck, I got a starting layout that would allow me to finish quick enough for a 3 star rating. If you want to make a good puzzle game, the player's score should be based on how well they can solve the puzzle, not randomly luck out with better gem placement.<br />3. This is my absolute biggest complaint. This game has an obscene amount of ad's trying to get you to play other games by this company. This is completely unacceptable. Granted, I got this game when it was the FAOTD, so I didn't pay for it. But if I had, I would be furious to see that literally every single time I open the app, I have to deal with at least one &#34;suggestion&#34; to play another game by the company. I think there is nothing worse than a paid app that has this in it. A line must be drawn in the sand. If the game is truly a free game (not just FAOTD), go ahead...pester me with pop-ups or banner ads. The programmer has earned the right to do that, he's not charging for the app and needs to make something for the time it takes to program a game (even if it's yet another shameless Bejeweled counterfeit). If you sell the game though, DO NOT try slipping in advertisements too. Especially every single time I open the app.<br /><br />Anyways, the graphics are good. The music is passable. But there are simply too many better Bejeweled clones out there to pay for one that has to bug you every time you open it .
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so much fun. Especially nice when trying to waste time. My kids also enjoy playing this game and it keeps them occupied when mommy needs a little break!
B00B7G23KQ|3.0|I was expecting more of a scare. It's watchable, but I wanted more. I just felt that it was very predictable.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Rise of the Guardians is a great family movie.  It was a great first Amazon Instant Video movie experience at home.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Strong acting, a steady pace and international intrigue/espionage all make this a compelling flic. Well done, Zero Dark Thirty. Peace.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a very riviting and well done show.We need more shows that are as well done as this one.
B004P5RMZ2|2.0|I wished I had read the other reviews before buying.  I cannot believe they took an awesome, classic film and ruined it with the \\"extras\\"!  What IDIOT splices in train footage and overlays the sound on top of Echoes?!  Unbelievable!  I was so excited to find this on DVD since my VHS copy has been worn out, but very disappointed...
B005LAIHR2|5.0|The selection of rock and roll hits and the way these well-known songs were meshed into the plot was masterful.
0142004235|5.0|I love Steinbeck, and this was the first book of his I read. It's a great story and my favorite of his.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Our girls love these giant sticker books.  The reusable stickers are a great idea as they get much more playtime and creativity from being able to reuse and move the stickers from picture to picture.  As with any sticker, over time they do lose thier stickiness a bit.

B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I am a loyal Amazon customer and thus bought Season 3 of Downton Abbey from them.  The video quality is so bad, we could not stand to watch more than a minute or so of it.  A waste of money.  I tried to return it, but too late...  Beware!
B009CPEOC4|3.0|My wife liked the movie and it was fun to watch as a mindless movie for a summer night with nothing to do.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. It is a real survival story.<br />I would like her to write a sequel on her journey of recovery.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|An amazing book.  After reading the summary book I just HAD to read the full book, and I'm so glad I did.  To finally understand what makes me tick, and to feel good about it, is priceless.  I learned more about myself (and those around me) by reading this book than I had been able to figure out in 50+ years.  The insights here are proving invaluable in both my personal and professional life, and I'm giving a copy of this book to friends and colleagues (both introverts and extroverts).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Never thought I'd read another book that I wanted to continue forever.  For God's sake and my sanity continue this saga.  Ranks right up there with Dune.
B004G6009U|5.0|As someone who grew up watching the &#34;Disney Classics&#34; like Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Fox and the Hound, The Little Mermaid, and Snow White (obviously among many others), I am reluctant to watch recent released Disney movies for fear they will not live up to my expectations. This movie FAR exceeded my expectations! So glad I purchased this movie.<br /><br />The disc came in perfect condition:  no issues with playback.
B004SGWYVA|4.0|I love this animation a lot.  But the company who produces this Blu-Ray could do a better job.  First, there is no background music when the top menu shows up.  I don't know if they are just lazy or there are other issues.  There are plenty of good music in the show, which they can take advantage of .  Second, the English voice actors are not paying attention to pronunciation of the Japanese names.  For example, the actor playing Takashi kept calling Saeko &#34;Saiko&#34;.  The teacher Marikawa was called &#34;Markawa&#34;.  They are just not paying attention to details like those.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|this was the first season I watched and I loved it so much I had to go and see the first second and third seasons
B0038M2AZA|5.0|An excellent glimpse into the mind with autism. Claire Danes does an impeccable job portraying Temple and showing the struggles of having Autism and coping with society's expectations.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and I grew to really feel passionate about the characters.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I enjoyed this book as the story line twists and turns with your emotions as the characters develop. Trying to work out what had happened, I enjoyed it to the last page.
B0067TQQI8|2.0|been trying for three days to get it charged,  directions are lousy at best. also thought i was getting the newest and bigest, not the case but that is probably my fault , although when your selling the smaller older model for the same price as the newer model you can get confused.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is an amazing book.  Victoria Jones has had a really rough life.  She has gone from one foster parent to another, followed by one foster home to another.  She has had behavioral/social issues wherever she's been.  Her one saving grace is that she spent a year and a half with one foster parent and, while there, learned the intricate details about flowers - what they represent and how best to care for them.  This will benefit her greatly after she turns 18 and finds herself on her own.<br /><br />I don't want to tell you any more than that.  But I will mention a couple of things.  First, a first for me.  There were 2 spots late in the book where I actually yelled.  At one point I said \\"Noooooooo.\\" and the other time I said \\"s__t.\\"  I have never spoken out loud while reading a book.  Fortunately, nobody was in proximity to me when I lost control of my emotions.<br /><br />Secondly, I have never in my entire literary life wanted a reconnection as much as I wanted it here.  I know I'm getting soft(er) in my old age/dotage, but this darn book is just perfect.  I don't know how else to describe it.  Already I've spoken/emailed/texted with a number of people who have all, without exception, loved this book.  If you haven't read it, do it.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|There is very little that DM releases that I do not like.  From the great musicianship to the vocal harmonies, the formula that IS DM continues to create music that overshadows many other bands....
081297381X|4.0|I give this book 4 stars, but I mean to give it 3. I give it 4 because it's a book people should read, and I consider a book rated 3 stars as something not worth giving the time to read. Why do I have this mixed opinion of the book? NNT has some valid, real ideas, that are very important for people in general to know, however, he presents these ideas in a hypocritical, degrading, obnoxious way. He is a trader that writes a book about the fake profession that is being a stock \\"forecaster\\". He advises on never making predictions, although he makes several predictions in the book, one of which luckily (for him) came true, in that the stock market did crash and the banks did fail, as he predicted. His open dislike of all things philistine is taken to an extreme level, in which we are taken on anecdotes about his Ubermench (even though he expresses contempt for the concept and Neitzche as a philosopher), a James Bond-like flaneur who is the antithesis of all things engineer. His bias towards people who agree with him and against those who don't is brought to a caricature-like level as he hails Mandelbrot as one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived (he actually says that the Mandelbrot set is the most important mathematical object ever invented, enough to make many mathematicians exhale steam out their nostrils, I'm sure) but then he compares people who don't see the light in his glorious, brilliant ideas such as certain mathematicians, statisticians, and especially economists to people with autism. He is certainly a character, but his intellectual snobbishness in the face of his own writing being against intellectual arrogance made me want to vomit in my mouth from time to time.<br /><br />As for his ideas, they are sound, at least in my opinion, and he uses their validity as leverage and an excuse to sling crap at the entire academic establishment. His writing is very smug, especially in his new essay (included in the new edition) \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\".He does misrepresent statistics, however, setting up straw men all over the place, saying that what is considered \\"bad\\" applications of statistics is all of statistics. The people I've talked to however, seem to tell me that he is much more cautious when talking to actual statisticians, and his ideas are much less inflammatory, though I'm sure on the inside his is probably readying another polemic.<br /><br />Interesting book. As a physicist, it made me glad I didn't go into the social sciences. I was slightly offended when he accused those who are in my profession as all having Asperger's, but I guess I had gotten used to his character by then. I hope that it promotes a reconsidering of the field of finance, and prevents embarrassments such as the collapse of the LTCM group and further busts by finance professors.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Delivery was earlier than predicted and price is ten dollars less than Walmart!  I used Super Saver shipping & you can't beat this winning combination!  I love the authenticity of the acting and portraiture of that time period; truly a masterpiece in full Movie Quality. Can hardly wait to own Season Three.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's fun, entertaining and free!  So what if you have to wait a while for your lives to replenish.<br />Super fun to pass the time!
B000KIPT30|1.0|The first thing I noticed about this product is when I plugged my headphones in there was a painfully loud pop in my left headphone. This happened every time I plugged my headphones in to any port. Second, the sound quality is just awful. I bought this to add extra power to my Sennheiser HD555s. All of the frequency ranges are severely muffled, and it doesn't get very loud. It sounds (much) better plugged into my Galaxy S3 cell phone phone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|great game but it gets boring after awile but its so much beter than temple run 1 &amp; 2 hi

0385349947|3.0|I have not read book yet, but suppose it will be a good read. The book itself is made with cheap paper and the edges are unevenly cut, but that does not interfere with the type, just shows a cheap quality of production.

B0033H7VI6|3.0|Well, like many occasions I was not planning on getting this knife soon but I was interested in it ever since seeing several youtube reviews and blogs regarding the knife's toughness and great price point, however a few days ago I started to look for it on Amazon and it was not in stock, days passed and I saw it in stock for the first time in awhile and at a lower price than for what it was going a few weeks earlier, also it said that there were only 3 left in stock so I said to myself that it must be a really popular knife if people are swooping them faster than the manufacturer can produce them so I pulled the trigger and got one. I think it was the last one since after the purchase and as I write there are none available. Well enough of the story, got the knife very fast, haven't had a chance to put it through its passes but here are my initial thoughts and impressions:<br /><br />PROS: Big sturdy knife, not as heavy as I thought, think its lighter that the Becker BK2 or at least it feels that way.<br />Good looking, cool re-curve on the blade, came reasonably sharp, not really razor but a good utility edge.<br />1095 steel, for the price this is a plus since this steel is pretty good for outdoors/survival tasks, will need to be taken care of to avoid rust though.<br />Looks and feels tough, very thick spine, don't think it will suffer any damage when chopping or battoning.<br />Price!, for the size and steel material this is a great price point.<br /><br />Ok now for the CONS: The balance feels a little off, I can't quite describe it but it just something you have to feel for yourself. Also the handle starts to thin out as you get to the pommel, it just feels weird, it doesn't feel that natural in the hand, so something to get used to I guess.<br />The scales/handle is not flush with the tang, so you can clearly see and feel the extra handle material popping out when you grab the knife, not a big deal but it is very prevalent, part of why the price is so affordable, in general don't expect a high quality fit and finish on this knife, definitely not a collection or bragging type of knife for sure.<br /><br />The sheath is nothing special, its not great but it serves its purpose, it will not hold the knife in place without the nylon latch so be sure to button that latch to secure the knife in place, also it has ha small pouch so you can add a few survial items inside like a flint, multitool, etc if you like that sort of system.<br />As stated in other reviews the  point was not grounded evenly so it slightly curves to one side or the other, again not a big deal but its clear that this is another quality control issue that suffers and why the price is so low, they have to make cuts somehow to make the knife so affordable.<br />Having said the above in order for you to enjoy this knife you have to see it for what it is, an affordable made in Taiwan tank/beater knife for medium to heavy chores with good steel and a not so good aesthetic finish. This is a great option for a BOB or remote/primitive backpacking trip where wood processing will be high on the list of priorities and you decide not to brig a hatchet or axe.<br />Hope this review is helpful in making your decision.ble, in general don't expect a high quality fit and finish on this knife, definitely not a collection or bragging type of knife for sure.<br /><br />The sheath is nothing special, its not great but it serves its purpose, it will not hold the knife in place without the nylon latch so be sure to button that latch to secure the knife in place, also it has ha small pouch so you can add a few survial items inside like a flint, multitool, etc if you like that sort of system.<br />As stated in other reviews the  point was not grounded evenly so it slightly curves to one side or the other, again not a big deal but its clear that this is another quality control issue that suffers and why the price is so low, they have to make cuts somehow to make the knife so affordable.<br />Having said the above in order for you to enjoy this knife you have to see it for what it is, an affordable made in Taiwan tank/beater knife for medium to heavy chores with good steel and a not so good aesthetic finish.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Running slightly quieter than its close brother, the 212 EVO, this is a great CPU cooler to replace the stock cooler in any home or business system.  I have it on my 95W AMD FX-6100 and it is dead silent.  I haven't overclocked it and have no intention to, but size of the heatsink alone tells you that it should be no problem.  It works great in my media server/NAS and is so quiet that the wife has never even noticed that it is on.  She saw the case and thought it was just an old case that hadn't been thrown out, yet.<br /><br />Beware, this will have a hard time fitting in small cases.  Please do your measuring if you are thinking of putting it on a microATX case.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love using this. I use it at work when trying to figure out sales and used tax amounts.  It also helps me when also figuring out tax rates.

B0045DO8NI|5.0|PINK is fantastic. I have seen her in concert and have already have tickets for her next concert in November.  She is a fantastic singer, acrobat, etc..  Everything that you could want in a performer.  I would recommend this music to anyone over 18, as some of the words she uses are not appropriate for those under that age.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addicting and very fun way to pass the time.. . so many options in a free game. I was surprised at the amount of fun I had while playing.
B005OKTPKC|3.0|It was ok.  Hardly gripping!  Just got back to reading John Grisham books and really that was not nearly as good as his first few.
030758660X|4.0|Lots of great patterns in this book, and you don't have to be into the Vampire craze to appreciate them (I'm not). I am considering making the blood-type mug warmers though, with our real blood types. They'd be a conversation starter for sure!
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I had my doubts about the quality image it would capture and blurring, considering the relatively low price. Lay that to rest cause this is an awesome product. Like a lot of reviews say on here, it took me a couple dozen shots to dial in and get used to the magnification. I highly recommend buying a tripod. Any little movement is magnified that much more when shooting macro and steadiness is key in getting the highest amount of detail. Blurring is no problem either. The focused part of the image is totally in your face and sharp. My only complaint is that I wish the focal sweet spot was a little wider, if that makes sense to anybody. Excellent alternative to expensive lenses.<br /><br />TIP: zoom your camera in all the way, then move the actual camera back and/or forth to find the focal sweet spot. Shoot.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Although it is well researched, it is somewhat below the Clancy standard for character development and excitement. I have found it a much less engaging read than previous Clancy novels.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|The movie pace is a bit slow, but the great acting makes up for it. It only covers 1 day in the life of this firm during the crisis. A more comprehensive account of the crisis can be seen in the movie &#34;Too Big to Fail.&#34;
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I tired this thing out and kept having trouble with it. It would work for a while and then just stop working. Very frustrating, then I found that it would happen when I shook the cord. Turned out that a pin in the USB plug was out of place and was bent to the side. I tried to straighten it but the damage could not be fixed. It finally broke off. I am sending it back.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|this is one of the shows from the 80s-90s era. watching these show bring back good memories. when i was a kid everyday around 6:00 pm turn to the channel to watch this show. now i can watch them anytime i want now.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is one of my 3-yr-old son's fav movies because he loves airplanes and ducks. True, these are gliders and geese but that makes absolutely no difference in his mind. Honestly, after about a dozen times watching the movie, I'm rather tired of it but my son still loves it as does my husband. There is one spot toward the end when a hunter cusses \\"s***!\\" My son repeated it once in his excitement during the scene but after a short lecture he hasn't said it again. Good movie. I think kids would have to like gliders and geese in order to enjoy it though.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This is one of my favorite series.  I have all seasons available.  Looking forward to season 8.  Gotta love Shemar Moore.
1609611543|4.0|Bought to see what the Dr might have to say.  Book was an interesting read-  had a lot of facts to back up his claims.  I have purchased the cook book, and have found most of the recipes to be to my liking.  Been on the diet for two months, and have lost 22 lbs.  The Jury is still out on the overall concept, but I'm in for a few more months to see how it progresses.

B00A2AU0KI|5.0|After &#34;Gran Torino&#34; I didn't think Clint Eastwood was going to star in another film.  I had heard he was going to just direct films from now on.  I had seen trailers for this film and thought it would be just so-so.  NOT SO! This is a most enjoyable movie!  Amy Adams was just wonderful in the role of Clint's estranged daughter and Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good as the washed-out baseball player turned scout who becomes the love interest for a disinterested Amy Adams (at first).  Clint Eastwood is also wonderful as the aging baseball scout who is losing his eyesight and is reluctant to admit he's not able to do his job anymore.  I enjoyed watching Clint and Amy's characters gravitate around each other and eventually find a way to reconcile through the game of baseball.  This movie is a joy to see and I particularly liked how the pompous young ball player who is so highly touted for his ability to hit a baseball in one arena and then has &#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34; in another.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I enjoy playing Solitaire. This is great on the Kindle especially while traveling on the plane. Easy to download and play.

B000000OAC|5.0|this is a great album by a great band and i have the vinyl but I wanted it on cd and finally got around to getting it.
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan since the beginning and one of the things that I love about this band is how they keep on evolving. This is the most minimal sound we've heard from them in years and it might not satisfy some of their fans but give it a chance and you are not going to be able to get some of these sounds and lyrics out of your head. Good stuff.

B000PY6BBI|5.0|Though I wish the video quality was higher, I cannot wish for a finer story of love. Set in medieval Europe, the story follows young Phillipe, the \\"Mouse\\", an intrepid thief who speaks to God every time he needs His help (which is a lot). Escaping from the dungeons of Aquila, The Mouse flees from the Bishop's guards into the country side. There, he is saved from the Bishop's men by a mysterious knight named Navarre, a man clad in black armor and a deep melancholy. Navarre is the former Captain of Aquila's Guard, where he fell in love with a young maiden named Isabeau, who came to love him in return, secret from all but the monk they shared. Coveted by the bishop, Isabeau is the unlucky focus of his lust and envy. Unfortunately, their priest had a weakness for wine, and in a drunken confession to the Bishop, unwittingly informed him of the lovers' secret vows to each other. Navarre and Isabeau were then cursed fleeing from the Bishop's jealous rage. Two years before Phillipe is saved by Navarre, the Bishop, with the Devil's aid, cast a curse upon the lovers to keep them separated forever. She, a hawk by day and a maiden by moonlight; he, a knight bent on revenge by day and a protective wolf by night. Only catching a glimpse of each other in the seconds between day and night, the two are condemned to live this way for as long as they both shall live.<br /><br />Navarre seeks Phillipe's aid in returning to Aquila to exact revenge upon  the Bishop, and along the way Phillipe befriends both Isabeau and Navarre. Struggling with his faith and sanity, Phillipe manages to both aid the lovers in getting revenge and destroying the curse. While the story is kept simple and filmed in beautiful landscapes, the movie suffers only when the video quality and the musical score detract from the plot. I have loved this film since I was a child, and with adult eyes I am able to notice small plot details I missed way back then. It makes me cry every time I watch it, and nothing is more enjoyable then watching love triumph in situations of hopeless despair. Watch it with an open mind and heart, and you'll be swept up in the story as I was.njoyable then watching love triumph in situations of hopeless despair. Watch it with an open mind and heart, and you'll be swept up in the story as I was.
B007AG04M6|4.0|This completes my camera kit! Original case and original handgrip. All fits well and I also have another grip installed in the camera, but this was no trouble and everything was assembled without any issue. It is easy to carry, easy to open and close, protecting the equipment all the time. It is easier to carry than a complete case with all the stuff. You can use this all the time and during longer trips you can use a bigger case without disassembling this case. Really good.
0061655554|5.0|One of the best nonfiction books I've ever read, and definitely the best 'business' nonfiction book. Although it's long, the pace is brisk.
B000002H97|5.0|I love this CD.  I had a copy and it had a bunch of scratches and skips in it from years of play.  I purchased this new CD as a replacement and it plays very well.  I would purchase from this vendor again.
030758836X|3.0|I more or less couldn't put the book down and though it's not my usual type of novel, kept reading but was sorely disappointed with the flat ending. There were surprises along the way that made me think what a clever writer, but for the book to be done so well and there not to be a better ending really disappointed. I didn't like the character that Amy morphed into. I kept thinking that she would be caught in the ending and get her just dessert, but when someone ended up still trapped, it was not a satisfying ending. To put so much planning and thought into a book, which obviously was well done up until then, it just seemed to just stop and let things remain unresolved. I never would have read it except it was chosen for an \\"adult\\" book club read at my school. It's not the romantic suspense type of novel I usually enjoy. I like happy endings.
B008220DGE|4.0|After watching PT Anderson's \\"The Master\\", the closest comparison I came up with for it in modern film is the Coen Brothers' \\"A Serious Man\\". Although the conclusion of \\"The Master\\" is certainly less ominous than that which is affixed to \\"A Serious Man\\", the results will certainly be no less polarizing. For those looking for something similar to \\"There Will Be Blood\\", I would say that \\"The Master\\" is slightly less accessible to audiences but full of the same bravado performances (particularly from Phoenix and Hoffman, who amaze) and photographed every bit as spectacularly by cinematographer Robert Elswit (who was robbed of an Oscar nomination this year). \\"The Master\\" tells of a drifter with post-WWII PTSD symptoms who wanders onto a ship occupied by a religious \\"cult\\" led by The Master aka Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The rest of the film serves to focus on the relationship between Hoffman and his protege Phoenix, who struggles to fit that billing and who teeters between past regrets, love for the Master and his religion, and ultimately the defiance. The master is a masterpiece but it will take an open mind to declare it such.
B003Y8YXEO|4.0|John Lennon created many memorable moments in his solo career so this album can only be a sampling of his wide talent range. A song such as Cold Turkey conveys agony while a classic Imagine promotes his powerful idealism. Modern songwriters should listen to this album in order to reconnect with true emotions and relay them in their music. Of course, those who just want to enjoy the music will be quite satisfied with the song selection.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Very well done comic. I think the kindle's app for the iPad, iphone and the amazon cloud is not so great. It doesn't utilize the size of the screens, just expands the small blocks slightly and not others. It needs more work to be a good reading tool. Because it doesnt allow the reader to control the zoom in feature, The font can be too small to read at times and the reader can't explore some of the art work.  I did talk to Amazon but really didn't feel they understood my concern. I may not buy for the kindle if I decide to read more graphic novels.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app it is a great app to use I like checking it out daily I always find the best stuff
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2BZSP4W75I9WQ]]My only real complaint about this Blu-ray release of this fantastic movie, is that I think they could have done a bit better of a job in cleaning up the film for high definition, you can still see more film grain than I would really expect to see in a Blu-ray film, but considering this is the 25th anniversary release of this film, I only dinged them a half a star for that. (Of course, Amazon doesn't allow me to rate items using half points, so I had to give it a 4).<br /><br />This is an excellent movie, and a good action-adventure tale in its own right. It is also Warwick Davis' most memorable leading role I've seen him in. I know he has played a ton of roles in his day, but I remember him from this role the best :)<br /><br />The video shows a comparison of the Blu-ray release packaging versus the old DVD packaging I have from the older release. And the video shows a scene comparison between the DVD & Blu-ray versions. Overall, a very good effort on their part for this release.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great way to kill time, and I like how it changes locations, it is one of the best apps I have
0374275637|5.0|One of the most - if not the most - important books on thinking and decision-making you will ever read.  A must own for anyone who makes decisions - all of us..
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Could use a in game settings page.  I wish that I could mute the music without turning down the master volume on my device.  Game play itself is great!
B004EPYZXK|2.0|I'm no technical consultant, but even I was annoyed by the lack of attention to basic details like idiom and operational procedure aboard a spacecraft.  The script is punk. The lines are weak. The aliens are rocks. The camera jiggles a lot. It's Blair Witch on the moon, with more lens flares. Enough said?
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I really love this game - its very addicting. The dragons start out super cute and grow into awesome flying beasts! The amount of different dragons to breed and hatch seems endless. It took a while to get things rolling - and like other games to advance faster and get special items real $ is required. Other wise it would have gotten 5 stars from me. All in all - its a great game, even got some friends to start playing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This novel was just as thrilling as the first in this series. It kept my attention and made me feel for the characters as if it was me living the story. I can't wait to start the next book and see what Gideon and Eva face next!
B0090SI460|4.0|Disney did it again; How did they -AGAIN- persue me to buy a well-known film AGAIN that I already owned on Blu-ray ? Simple; just add another dimension ! THe 3D is way better than in &#34;Finding Nemo&#34;, so much more depth. If Disney keeps releasing their classics in 3D I will continue buying them.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|It is one of my favorites. Powerful performances by the cast. I recommend it to all to see it. I will watch it again.
1582701709|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister she absolutely loved it! She told me to give it 5 stars so I am...
B007A4SDCG|1.0|According to this book: An amateur is not a pro (desirable and effective perspective for success) because she takes the work and its meaning too seriously.  Got to think of the work or art or thing you do more less seriously, for example as something that will make you money, as a job, and don't worry about failure.  Be glad you're in the ring and not in the stands.  Do not let it define you, we are warned.<br />But then in the last 25% of the book this view disappears: the artists is an instrument of the infinite!  The artist has contempt for failure. The artist is a warrior against failure.  Your territory of work defines you.<br />Another flip: listening to criticism is a kind of resistance to working (good idea, very helpful).  Thirty pages later: avoid having a \\"hierarchical understanding of the field in which you work, placing it between better and worse,because you energy will undermine you.  Don't respond to the market.  Don't write for the market or you'll be nothing but a hack.<br />THAT'S CRITICISM.  So if you follow advice in first half of book you should ignore this advice given at the end.  And it seems very amateur to ignore market competition and compare one's work with others.'<br />This advice was GREAT however: don't distract yourself with workshops, a healing process, any effort that delays or interrupts you work flow even if it sounds practical.  DO THE WORK FIRST AND FOREMOST.  This advice is very refreshing, because these consumer products (writers workshops, self-help books, learning novel writing software) all use precious time.<br />One star because seller (Amazon) misrepresented the content length.  Many, many pages have only four lines of writing on them.<br />I could condense the manuscript to about twenty pages with a little content editing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Engrossing;  great characters both above and below stairs. Maggie Smith has the best lines, and her delivery and facial expressions are hilarious.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I downloaded this onto my Android Tablet but still use Chrome and the full site more often than this app.  Full site is more familiar and easier to use.
B004G606K8|5.0|Long ago I read books form Weis and Hickman.. but never started with these.<br />Loved the story and the characters.<br />Cant wait to read al the other books
B004NS710C|3.0|A solid story and cast, but I expect more from these guys. The story can't carry itself, and the performances aren't strong enough to make this a &#34;must see&#34; even for action fans.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Written with an easy affable style that carried the west coast themes of this book, I enjoyed the depth and reveal of Jobs life and accomplishments.  I will be reading this one again, and suggest it is a must read for business and those with interest in tech or historical figures.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|As a video-gaming Dad, I enjoyed the nod to the history of the genre. That said, this is a really entertaining and enjoyable movie. Great characters and voice acting, love the animation and the relationships. My entire family enjoyed it, including my wife, 15, 13, and 8 year old kids. Solid.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and challenging! I have enjoyed playing quell as well as quell: reflect. I'm really looking forward to some additional levels soon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters get more fully developed, we learn to understand better the villains, we learn the nicest characters also have flaws and secrets, and nothing can compare with the setting of beautiful Highclere Castle for this second season of a series quickly becoming THE favorite PBS offering of all time.

B001L5YW9I|4.0|Great movie in widescreen but not in HD.  Lots of action and a super music score highlight a well scripted and acted movie.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This movie is one of the best i've ever watched, the cast is awesome and they make you feel like it was a real story.<br /><br />The extras are great, the deleted scenes actually add some details to the movie that you don't see in the whole movie, great sound and really nice behind the scenes special.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this Blu-ray.
0062014536|4.0|I really appreciate lauren Oliver's work and really like the delirium series!! But the only reason I gave 4/5 is because there wasn't that much of Alex in the book!!! Whyyyy?!?!?! D':<br />In pandemonium I really disliked Julian! I couldn't stand him!! I was(still am) team Alex n seeing Lena like Julian was irritating lol but then in requiem Julian like kinda grew on me haha I actually really liked him n his kindness n everything about him lol I congratulate ms oliver for making Julian so likable &lt;3 but yeah I loved the book it's just that I wish there were more Alex n Lena moments &lt;/3<br />And I can't wait until the delirium tv series!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I was a little hesitant at first to download this thinking it's like all the others. But to my pleasant surprise, this is a very good Bible app. The greatest surprise are any many versions of the Bible. I'm tickled and blessed to have it.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Absolutely loved it. The ending left me hanging by a thread and I immediately purchased Fifty Shades Freed.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I'm a fan of Kung Fu flicks. I'm not always a fan of Tarrantino, but Kill Bill (both volumes) was a n excellent homage to the genre. This movie on the other hand is really bad.I mean really, really bad. I knew I had made a mistake within the first few minutes. Yes, it's one of those movies. I'm not sure who gave it 5 stars, but it definitely is not worth 5 stars. Keep track of those who gave it 5 stars and stay away from their reviews. They will cost you money. If this is 5 stars, then what would Kill Bill or Enter the Dragon be rated? It's definitely nowhere near as good as either of those two movies. So, how does it merit 5 stars? The plot is just a collection of different characters killing people. I'm at minute 24 right now and have finally reached my limit. Hats off to anyone who can watch this all the way through. I'm going to rent Zero dark Thirty instead.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|A fun game..the kids love it. We had to restart the app from the beginning after some updates were added so we lost our first game start up but it is still a lot of fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i play this game so much. i think you should also have android apps to access the minecraft forums, creates  skins, create texture packs, and something like worldedit
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild was written with such vivid detailing!  I felt her emotions as my own; crying, laughing as though I were beside her on her journey. She makes me want to hike the PCT myself. Simply amazing.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I love watching shows like Friends, The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family.<br /><br />To be honest I first thought I wouldn't enjoy this show that much, but I was very wrong.<br />The more I watched it all the characters grew on me and now I can't think of my life without this show.<br /><br />I love watching Troy and Abed. Senor Chang and the dean are also a key part of the show and I hope they will come out more in season 2.<br /><br />If you love a good laugh this show is definitely for you, you will not regret it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not been this sucked into a book in a while and this on  had me from the first few  pages.  Loved the way it was  written and kept me intrigued until the very last page
0321344758|4.0|Made me think about web design from a different perspective. And I have been able to put many of his suggestions to use immediately and have received positive comments from users about the changes.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Seen this probably 5 times and had to have it.  One of DeNiro's most demanding roles.  Jeremy Irons a standout as well.  Filming had to be an incredible chore as evidenced by the &#34;special edition&#34; feature that described how they did it.  Impacting story....historical fiction.  A tragic tale of how nations of the period, in this case, Spain and Portugal, used the missionary church as the vanguard to advance a political, financial and colonial agenda in the &#34;New World&#34;, subjugating or destroying indigenous civilizations.  Not a pretty picture, and a dismal look at man's inhumanity to man  (and not dissimilar to our own &#34;Westward Expansion&#34; in the United States).
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I received the first season as a gift and got hooked immediately. I had to order the second season to follow the storyline.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I volunteer at a local elementary school. I am a retired senior. The first year on President's I had to cover up a 5 dollar bill so I could show the children a photocopy of President Lincoln.<br /><br />None of the Classrooms have photos or pictures of Washington or Lincoln. In our day we always had both and we were taught about both George Washington and President Lincoln. Now the kids are taught about the current administration and not much more.<br /><br />This should be required viewing for every American student before receiving their High School Diploma.<br /><br />We went to see this the first week it was in the theater and I knew immediately we needed our own copy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|A mind blowing adventure on high mountains or in deep caves. It's a great quest at night in survival mode when you go head to head against Creepers, Zombies, and other frightful creatures. The best part about minecraft is the creative mode.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is the first book by Colleen Hoover I've read and I immediately liked her style of writing.  There's nothing more aggravating than reading a good story with horrible grammatical errors.  The story itself is captivating and unique.  I was drawn in right away and never lost interest even though I kind of expected the ending.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time, in my opinion, because it is NOT about the rich, famous and powerful, the beautiful or (to a large extent) even about the disfunctional, because in this movie disfunctonality is essentially the norm.  It's about people coping with what they have given to them, whether by family or environment, and overcoming obstacles placed in their path by those circumstances.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is fabulous as Ree, the heroine in this movie and totally believable in her role.  It's no wonder she won a Best Actress Oscar this year for &#34;Silver Lining Playbook&#34;--she shows in this movie how much she can get into a role to make it totally real and believable.  I lived in the Ozarks for several years and knew many young women like Ree who do what has to be done with dignity and poise and without asking for reward--in fact, I married one.<br /><br />John Hawkes' performance as &#34;Teardrop&#34; is fabulous as well.  He proves he is one of the best character actors to come along in ages, not only because he plays the strung-out meth-head uncle so well here in this movie but then take into account that this is the same man who played the paraplegic polio victim in &#34;The Sessions&#34; and you can see what a terrific actor he is.<br /><br />This little sleeper of a movie is highly recommended.  It is a &#34;Must See&#34; in my opinion.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I first borrowed this book from the library for my kindle. Halfway through, with plenty of time left on my loan, I decided I wanted this in my permanent kindle collection, so I bought it. The story started out slowly, and then I found I didn't want to put it down. The book is beautifully written, with phrases that are so perfect that I read them repeatedly because they created such wonderful images. Harold and Maureen are good characters with more going on than you'd suspect initially.  The conclusion of the story is very satisfying. One reviewer found the book depressing - but I can't imagine why. It deals with some difficult issues, but they unfold is a remarkable way. I would definitely recommend it. In fact, before I even finished it I recommended it to all my friends.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love these books! They are great books! I can't wait for the next one ( house of hades) to come out! 5 stars is the best of all the options I would have given 10!
B0027BVMSY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Great action, great James Bond.<br />And when Amazon accidently charged me twice (my instant play timed out), they fixed it in record time.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Always wanted to read Tom Sawyer and finally got around to it.  I was not disappointed, plenty of mischievous adventures to keep you reading.  I just wish this free kindle version would of had some pictures or illustrations.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Couldn't put it down! I was skeptical at first and then I found I couldn't stop reading it. Wish it had a better ending.
B003VANOFY|4.0|had these a few month and I like them a lot.  Surround sound is great but I haven't used the mic too much.<br />not sure i like the tiny on/off button on the side which is hard to use and they tend to slide off my head if I get too crazy but those are minor things.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Nice to see a movie that don't rely on special effects to make their movie whole.<br />Should have received a nomination for best director, even if not to win it.
0811870413|5.0|I bought Tartine Bread on the strength of the reviews already posted here, expecting to buy a decent to good cookbook.  What I got instead is the BEST bread book I've seen.  I believe that someone who's never baked would be able to follow these directions and get a much better loaf of bread than can be had in the grocery store or most bakeries.  The clarity of the text and the excellence of the photos assure that.  Yes, we can do it.<br /><br />But the really interesting part of the book to me was the second half, ignored in many of the reviews.  Here are about 150 pages of beautifully illustrated and well-written recipes for interesting things to eat with the bread or that contain the bread in one form or another.  I was hungry the whole while I read my first pass through this book -- and I wouldn't be surprised if I gained ten pounds just from the reading.  This is not a book for my cookbook shelf, but rather a treasure that's sure to be on the kitchen counter for at least the foreseeable future.  I couldn't recommend it more highly.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It's nice to know that the series doesn't come to an end with this novel. Preston and Child's mysteries, with a bit of the occult thrown into the mix, are always entertaining. Pendergast is a man one wants to invite to a dinner party. He's not bad to have around if one has a killer on the loose either.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Make sure you have plenty of free time to read because you won't want to put it down until the last page! And leave time to muse while you are reading.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie is great. I didn't think I would like it, but it is really good. Makes you re think how we look at people with autism. Anyone with a friend/child/neighbor/classmate/aquaintance with any form of autism should watch this.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent reading. Baldacci at his best. You won't put it down until the unbelievable end. I enjoyed every page and the artistic way Baldacci weaves the plot.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book! It is absolutely one of my favorite books ever! Abby meets Travis at a fight, exactly the type of place Abby tells herself she shouldn't be, because she is trying to completely change everything about her past. And Travis is to close to home for Abby's comfort, so she does everything she can to keep herself from being his next \\"one night stand.\\" But the heart wants what it wants. And Travis isn't about to let go the one girl whose never thrown herself at him.<br />I don't know what it is exactly about this book that I love so much but there is something so appealing about Travis and Abby's relationship that I was just sucked into the story from the start. Abby and Travis both equally frustrated me with the decisions they made, I really wanted to knock some sense into both of them at several different points in the story.<br /><br />Abby seriously makes me hate her and love her at times. One second she's upset with Travis for doing the things he's always done, and then the next she's okay with it. She seriously needed to get her head straight first before showing her emotions to Travis, and then causing a huge fight between them. She made me hate her for this on several occasions. But then I love how she doesn't bow down to Travis, she goes toe to toe with him on anything that really bothers her. And I love how she wants to move on from her past, but I hate the why she tries to do it. I mean really Parker Hayes?! Enough said.. I won't say more about him because I don't want to give to much away, but you will see once you read the story. But Parker was one of \\"Abby's flaws\\" in my opinion!<br /><br />Travis was a man whore! I couldn't believe all of the women who actually went out with him, he was known for his one night stands but women still continued to go out with him. But with Abby, he knew there was something special about her. You really don't get a lot of Travis's thoughts in this book because it is in Abby's point of view, but I'm excited for the second book to see what Travis was thinking in certain situations, because I couldn't believe how much of a jerk he could be!<br /><br />These two's relationship really defines the meaning of \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\"<br />Abby and Travis are Beautiful together, when they actually just let go and be together with out all of the drama.<br />But put in the drama the two of them create, and other's around them create, then it really is a Disaster!<br />The other character's like Shep, and America were very well written, and I enjoyed how dramatic America was even though she sometimes got on my nerves. It was still nice to see another relationship besides just Abby and Travis's.<br />The ending is also my favorite part of the book, I was so proud of Abby, I was smiling the whole time I read the end!<br />I love love love this book, it is one of my favorite books! I give it a 5 out of 5 Stars! And I can not wait to read the next one. I really kinda hope there are more than just two of them, because I can not get enough of Abby and Travis!! And if there aren't going to be more, then I will just continue to reread them when I need a Travis and Abby fix!the second book to see what Travis was thinking in certain situations, because I couldn't believe how much of a jerk he could be!<br /><br />These two's relationship really defines the meaning of \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\"<br />Abby and Travis are Beautiful together, when they actually just let go and be together with out all of the drama.<br />But put in the drama the two of them create, and other's around them create, then it really is a Disaster!<br />The other character's like Shep, and America were very well written, and I enjoyed how dramatic America was even though she sometimes got on my nerves.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely enthralled from the first page. Yes, their love can be described as crazy and many different things but, aren't the best things sometimes broken. I love how they are friends first and foremost, and everything else after. Love how they know each other's faults and mistakes and pasts and love how they are able to love each other wholeheartedly. This book is a must read!!!!!! Jamie McGuire has outdone herself. Can't wait for Travis' story

B00AFROVQC|1.0|I have thus far given the books I have purchased on Amazon a 4-5 star rating.  When I read that this was the next JK Rowling series review I thought it would be good.  I assumed that, based on a review that compared it to other Children's Literature books that I would find this a casual read without all the \\"adult\\" content that I so often get bored of.  I prefer children's and young adult lit most of the time because life has too much drama and politics as it is.  As I read through this book it began describing \\"bastard\\" kids who's mothers were long forgotten and the kings son who prefers his many \\"male\\" lovers.  So needless to say, I realized that I had not purchased a children's literature book and decided that since it wasn't keeping my interest anyway to return it for a refund.  I realize now that it must be classified as young adult?  But to each his own.  Seems like a lot of people liked while some didn't.
